    "content": "America's current account (CA) has been in deficit almost every year since 1982, reaching a record high of 6.1% of GDP in 2005 and 2006. The deficit fell to 3% of GDP in 2009, still higher than most years before the 2000s. The CA deficit reflects the imbalance between domestic saving and investment, with the decline since 2007 attributed to higher domestic saving and lower domestic private investment. This trend may soon reach a sustainable level, although cyclical causes could impact it. The current account deficit has been in decline since 2007 due to higher domestic saving and lower domestic private investment. However, as the economy returns to normal, domestic saving may fall and domestic investment is expected to rebound, increasing reliance on foreign borrowing. The large increase in the federal budget deficit since 2007 requires financing from foreign or domestic sources, and without fundamental changes, the decline in the CA deficit will only be temporary. Some question the sustainability of the CA deficit, but it has not prevented the economy from attaining full employment. The current account deficit is sustainable as long as foreigners continue to buy American assets, which keeps interest rates lower and boosts spending on capital investment and consumer durables. Concerns about sustainability arise if foreigners stop buying U.S. assets, leading to a rise in yields until the market clears. Loss of confidence in the U.S. economy could trigger a rapid change in the desirability of U.S. assets. Foreign demand for U.S. assets could decline rapidly if there is a loss of confidence in the U.S. economy, leading to a decrease in foreign capital inflows and the value of the dollar. To sustain the current account deficit, higher interest rates may be needed to attract foreign investors. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke believes that as long as a \"global savings glut\" persists, foreigners will continue to invest in U.S. assets. The deficit can be mutually beneficial if both lender and borrower are rational. The CA deficit can be mutually beneficial\u2014it allows the lender to enjoy a higher rate of return than at home and the borrower to operate with a larger capital stock. Some economists doubt this and argue that a country cannot rely on foreign borrowing to finance its investment needs. They suggest the United States must raise its low saving rate to avoid wider economic imbalance. Some economists argue that foreign borrowing to finance investment needs is not sustainable and will lead to a need for Americans to increase saving and reduce consumption. They recommend policy measures to raise saving and reduce overall spending to address a large current account deficit, which could involve microeconomic and macroeconomic policies. This could result in a larger share of the U.S. capital stock being owned by foreigners and a higher fraction of U.S. income needing to be saved. The rising fraction of U.S. income will need to be diverted overseas in the form of interest and dividends to foreigners, as a large share of the U.S. capital stock is owned by foreigners. Economists predict that the current account deficit will decline in the long run, but short-term trends are difficult to predict. Foreigners may want to increase their holdings of American assets in the near term, potentially prolonging the deficit. The \"home bias\" in saving refers to the tendency for countries to hold more of their own assets than optimal diversification suggests. Americans hold 53% of their wealth in euros and 19% in dollars, while the Japanese hold 63% in yen and 4% in dollars. It is uncertain why home bias would decline for foreigners but not Americans, even with continuing current account deficits. If the U.S. economy grows faster than the rest of the world, foreigners would need to maintain U.S. asset holdings equal to the U.S. share of world GDP, potentially leading to small deficits. The U.S. current account deficits have consequences for future trade balances as net debt owed to foreigners will need to be serviced in the future. Economist Edwin Truman estimates that if deficits continue at 6% of GDP, net income payments could reach 4.5% of GDP, leading to a trade deficit of 1.5% of GDP. This would result in a growing current account deficit due to increasing net investment income payments. In 2008, the U.S. had a net foreign debt of $3.5 trillion. The United States had a net foreign debt of $3.5 trillion in 2008, but received net investment income of $126 billion from the rest of the world. Despite the large net debt, the U.S. consistently has positive net investment income, earning a higher rate of return on foreign assets than on foreign liabilities. This rate of return differential has prevented foreign borrowing from becoming burdensome, suggesting that the U.S. net foreign debt could grow significantly before debt payments become burdensome. If rate-of-return differentials continue, the US can sustain a current account deficit of 0.9-1.3% of GDP without increasing its net foreign debt. However, if foreigners anticipate a dollar depreciation, they may demand higher returns on US borrowing. A gradual decline in the deficit and dollar would not harm the economy and could even stimulate it by boosting net exports. In practice, a falling trade deficit may coincide with slower economic growth, but it does not necessarily cause the slowdown. Historical data shows that a gradual decline in the trade deficit can be beneficial for the economy, as seen in the late 1980s. However, a sudden reduction in foreign saving going to the US could pose a short-term problem. Foreigners reducing capital inflow to the US could lead to a sharp dollar depreciation and higher interest rates. This may not cause a recession as it could result in a trade surplus, boosting aggregate demand. In the short run, a sharp dollar depreciation and higher interest rates could lead to a trade surplus, boosting aggregate demand. However, large interest rate increases could harm the U.S. economy by reducing the market value of debt securities and causing stock prices to fall. The Federal Reserve could mitigate the interest rate spike by reducing short-term rates, but this may indirectly impact long-term rates and potentially increase inflation. The economic theory assumes rational behavior in financial markets, but in practice, this is not always the case. The timing and likelihood of a sudden decline in the market are hard to predict due to irrational behavior. The United States is seen as a safe haven for investments, making sudden capital outflows unlikely. In a liquidity crisis, investment might be attracted to U.S. assets due to the more liquid financial markets available. During the financial crisis of 2007-2009, a large change in investor sentiment did not have negative effects on the dollar or interest rates despite a decline in the current account to GDP ratio. The dollar initially decreased before rising through the crisis, while U.S. Treasuries remained desirable despite low interest rates. During the financial crisis of 2007-2009, U.S. Treasuries remained a desirable destination despite the budget deficit. Interest rates fell, but risk premiums on private assets rose. The crisis led to a decline in private capital flows in 2008, affecting the current account balance. During the financial crisis of 2007-2009, U.S. Treasuries remained desirable despite the budget deficit. Private capital flows declined in 2008, impacting the current account balance. Foreigners sold U.S. securities, but official sources continued to purchase U.S. assets, preventing a swing to surplus. Official capital inflows have been significant since 2002, exceeding $200 billion annually since 2003 and $400 billion since 2006. Since 2002, official capital inflows into the United States have been significant, exceeding $200 billion annually since 2003 and $400 billion since 2006. These inflows have helped prevent a precipitous fall in the current account deficit and the value of the dollar. However, there are concerns that these inflows could prove unreliable or give foreign governments leverage over U.S. policy aims. It is difficult to predict how these inflows will evolve in the future, as they are likely driven by factors other than rate of return. Despite this uncertainty, the United States remains an important export market for foreign countries. The financial crisis has shown that foreign governments have increased purchases of U.S. securities to maintain the status quo, despite some reducing their U.S. holdings. Capital flow data during the crisis should be viewed cautiously due to the difficulty in tracking private capital flows and issues of reliability in the data. There is also a problem of causality in interpreting these results. The financial crisis has raised concerns about the interpretation of capital flow data, with difficulties in tracking private capital flows and issues of reliability. The instability in the economy and international capital flows may have a causal relationship, making it challenging to determine the extent to which the financial crisis is attributed to movements in international capital flows. The comparison of CA deficits in Greece from 2009 to 2010 highlights global issues with CA sustainability. The size of the United States economy and financial system means that economic events in the US can have significant ramifications for the world economy, unlike changes in the CA balance of smaller countries. The United States' ability to run higher sustainable current account deficits may be due to the dollar's role as the world's reserve currency. This differs from smaller countries where large deficits can lead to financial crises. The United States' flexible exchange rate regime and status as a safe haven for investment allow it to sustain higher current account deficits compared to other countries. Historically, only a few industrialized nations like Ireland and New Zealand have had long-lasting deficits similar to the US. Large countries experiencing sharp declines in their current account (CA) also saw per capita GDP growth decline by 3.6% to 5.0%. Economists at Goldman Sachs analyzed episodes in industrialized countries since 1980 where the CA improved by more than 2% of GDP. In disruption episodes, the economy typically started from a position of overheating, with the output gap worsening by an average of 3.6% of GDP. This suggests that the CA shift may be a symptom rather than a cause of economic slowdown. The CA shift may be a symptom rather than a cause of economic slowdown, with little real exchange rate depreciation in disruption cases. Consumption growth was negative on average, and interest rates fell in most cases. Only two cases were associated with a severe recession. The sample includes countries with small CA deficits or surpluses, not directly applicable to the U.S. experience. The International Monetary Fund conducted a study on advanced economies with initial current account deficits of at least 2.5% of GDP, finding that a real exchange rate decline of 12.2% led to a shift in the current account of 5.7% of GDP over 4.6 years. This resulted in a move from deficit to surplus on average, with GDP growth falling by 1.4% annually during the reversal. Some countries experienced a slowdown in economic growth, but not all cases of large current account deficits end in a reversal. The IMF identified five other advanced economies with persistent large current account deficits: Australia, Greece, New Zealand, Portugal, and Spain. Economists found little evidence that current account adjustments lead to financial market disruption. Economists use statistical regressions to estimate the probability of a currency crash based on macroeconomic variables. They find that the current account balance has little predictive power for a currency crash. Obstfeld and Rogoff found that in 2003, the US net debt to foreigners was about 23% of GDP, near an all-time high. If current account deficits continue at more than 5% of GDP per year, US net debt to foreigners could reach 70% of GDP within 30 years. The authors conclude that large U.S. current account deficits cannot be sustained indefinitely, as seen in countries with high net foreign debt-to-GDP ratios. Simulations suggest that the net foreign debt could increase to 60% of GDP by 2020, resulting in modest annual net investment income payments. Countries with high net foreign debt tend to have slightly higher interest rates. Countries with high net foreign debt have slightly higher interest rates and mixed effects on exchange rates. Recent academic papers address sustainability, using theoretical models to estimate changes in the dollar and current account deficit. Obstfeld and Rogoff estimate that a 5% GDP current account deficit could be eliminated by a depreciation of the real exchange rate between 14.7% and 33.6% through changes in aggregate demand or tradeable goods supply. The predicted dollar depreciation is significant due to the nontradeable nature of U.S. output, slow adjustment of import and export prices, and limited ability to shift production. Economists suggest that a current account deficit would eventually decrease as demand for U.S. assets is finite, leading to a decline in the deficit over time. The economists argue that while demand for U.S. assets would initially cause the dollar to appreciate, it would later depreciate to finance debt service. They estimate a 15% decline in the dollar would reduce the current account deficit by 1.4% of GDP. Stabilizing the net-debt-to-GDP ratio at 2003 levels would require an immediate 56% depreciation of the dollar. However, if foreigners maintain their current share of U.S. assets, the depreciation would be gradual over a few decades. The model predicts a gradual depreciation of the dollar based on different assumptions about foreign demand for U.S. assets. Under an optimistic scenario, the CA deficit would peak at 7.3% of GDP before eventually declining to 3.2% of GDP, with the dollar declining 21% in the first three years after the deficit began falling. If net debt were to decline to 50% of GDP after 2010, the decline in the dollar would still be significant. The CA deficit and dollar would decline further if the deficit remains at 60% of GDP, with a projected 5.3% decrease in the deficit and a 28% depreciation of the dollar after three years. Economists Roubini and Setser analyze three scenarios for the net foreign debt over the next 10 years, highlighting the unsustainability of the current path in one scenario where the deficit exceeds 12.8% of GDP. The net foreign debt stabilizes at 5% of GDP, but the CA deficit would increase to 8.8% of GDP in 2012. To reduce the trade deficit to 5% of GDP, the dollar would need to depreciate by about 10%. The third scenario projects a trade deficit decline, stabilizing the net foreign debt at nearly 60% of GDP. Economist Paul Krugman estimates that the dollar would need to depreciate by at least 35% from its 2005 value in real terms in the long run for the trade deficit to be reduced to zero. He looks for evidence of whether this depreciation will happen gradually or abruptly, arguing that it must be anticipated by rational investors to be smooth. Economist Paul Krugman estimates that a rate of return premium would be needed for holding U.S. assets to offset future dollar depreciation. He considers two hypothetical paths for the dollar's decline and finds no evidence of a significant rate of return premium, suggesting that investors do not foresee significant dollar depreciation in the future. The dollar's depreciation could lead to a reduction in demand for U.S. assets, causing the dollar to plummet. Despite a 16% depreciation from 2002 to 2006, the current account deficit continued to rise. Exports increased, but imports also rose rapidly, contributing to the deficit. The current account deficit started to decline in 2007, along with a continued decline in the dollar through 2008. The CA deficit began declining in 2007, with a significant drop in 2009 despite the real value remaining similar to 2007. The wide range of estimates on dollar depreciation highlights the complexity of factors influencing its value. Model-based projections are further complicated by non-market forces like central banks accumulating foreign reserves. No model reliably predicts how much or how quickly the CA deficit will decrease in the long run. In the long run, the CA deficit is expected to decline to stabilize net foreign debt relative to GDP. The decline in the deficit between 2007 and 2009 may be temporary or part of a long-term adjustment process. Policymakers' concern about a future decline in the deficit depends on whether it happens orderly or disruptively. The CA deficit is expected to decline to stabilize net foreign debt relative to GDP. A sudden decline in foreign capital inflows could disrupt U.S. financial markets, causing negative spillover effects. While unlikely, the risk of a sudden CA reversal is worth policy consideration due to potential high costs to the U.S. economy. The recent financial crisis in the United States, similar to concerns about a sudden outflow of capital, led to a large withdrawal of private foreign capital in 2008 and 2009. However, official capital inflows from foreign governments helped offset the destabilizing effect on the U.S. economy."
