An action under this section must be filed within seven years of the victim being freed from trafficking, or within 10 years after a minor victim reaches the age of majority. Disability, such as being a minor or lacking legal capacity, will pause the statute of limitations for the action. The statute of limitations is paused for minors or those lacking legal capacity, even if a guardian ad litem is appointed. A defendant cannot use the statute of limitations defense if their actions caused the delay in filing. The suspension of the statute of limitations also applies to related claims in trafficking cases. The statute of limitations is postponed during criminal proceedings against the victim. The running of the statute of limitations may be suspended for those unable to discover the cause of action due to trafficking circumstances.
