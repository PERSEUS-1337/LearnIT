    "content": "The Act titled \"International Monetary Fund Reform Act of 1998\" defines the term \"appropriate congressional committees\" and amends the Bretton Woods Agreements Act to include a quota increase. The International Monetary Fund Reform Act of 1998 includes a provision for a quota increase of 10,622,500,000 Special Drawing Rights for the United States, subject to appropriations. Additionally, conditions for the release of funds are outlined in the Act. The International Monetary Fund Reform Act of 1998 allows for a quota increase for the United States, but funds cannot be used until the Secretary of the Treasury certifies transparency measures to Congress. The International Monetary Fund Reform Act of 1998 requires the IMF to provide timely and accurate information to the public, release documents like working papers and evaluations, increase accessibility for policymakers and the public, and publish Article IV consultations. The Secretary of the Treasury must certify to Congress that the IMF enforces lending standards as a standard condition for using its resources. The IMF Reform Act of 1998 mandates borrower countries to comply with international trading obligations, banking standards, and bankruptcy laws. The Secretary of the Treasury must report annually on these requirements. The Secretary of the Treasury must annually report to congressional committees on the steps taken by the United States to achieve specified objectives. The Bretton Woods Agreements Act is amended to increase the borrowing limit to $6,712,000,000 and include new arrangements made on January 27, 1997."
