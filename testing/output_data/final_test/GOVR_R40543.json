    "content": "The TSA is facing challenges in maintaining and improving passenger screening functions, including addressing airline traffic growth, optimizing efficiency, detecting explosives, and defining funding requirements. Policy issues related to these challenges are also being discussed. Passenger screening at 450 airports in the US includes over 750 checkpoints and 2,000 lanes. The FAA projects a 3% annual increase in domestic passenger traffic and a 4.5% increase in international traffic until 2020. TSA screened over 700 million passengers in 2006, with a projected 25% increase in passenger volume at checkpoints over the next eight years. The TSA is expected to screen over one billion passengers annually by 2024 due to predicted growth in airline traffic. Initiatives for random and targeted screening of airport employees may be expanded to meet this demand. Resources will be needed to maintain screening efficiency and keep average passenger wait times to ten minutes or less. Larger airports often exceed this wait time objective, causing passengers to experience long screening waits. Passengers frequently face long waits in screening queues at airports, especially during peak periods. Space constraints and design limitations at larger airports have led to wait times exceeding 40 minutes. Smaller regional airports also struggle with seasonal fluctuations and workforce constraints, making it challenging to respond to spikes in passenger traffic. The TSA faces ongoing challenges to improve efficiency and accommodate future growth in passenger volumes at various airports. The TSA faces challenges at airports to improve passenger screening efficiency and meet wait time objectives. Space constraints may hinder the expansion of screening lanes and checkpoints to accommodate new technologies. The agency aims to create a more relaxed atmosphere for travelers and enhance behavioral detection efforts. The TSA may face challenges in optimizing screening checkpoints at older airports due to limited space and resources. Redesigning and expanding airport facilities may be necessary to accommodate future changes intended to improve efficiency and performance. Smaller regional airports and larger airports with older terminals may encounter particular challenges in implementing new security measures. The 9/11 Commission recommended that the TSA prioritize implementing technology to address security concerns. The 9/11 Commission recommended that the TSA focus on implementing technology and procedures for screening passengers for explosives. This includes testing walk-through trace detection portals and conducting pat-down searches. Deployment of puffer machines for secondary screening has been delayed due to maintenance issues. The TSA's initiative to improve explosives detection has been put on hold due to maintenance issues with deployed systems. The effectiveness of the strategy has been questioned after a foiled plot to bomb U.S.-bound airliners using liquid explosives in 2006. The TSA is working on identifying better strategies and technologies to address the explosives threat from passengers and carry-on items, facing challenges in meeting 9/11 Commission recommendations and statutory mandates. Concerns remain about vulnerabilities in detecting concealed explosives and non-metallic weapons at passenger checkpoints. The TSA is pursuing various technologies to detect explosives at passenger screening checkpoints, including walkthrough portals, whole body imaging systems, liquid scanners, and X-ray systems. Deployment of this technology will be focused on the largest airports and limited to selected passengers for secondary screening or resolving alarms during primary screening. The TSA is exploring technologies to detect explosives at passenger screening checkpoints, focusing on large airports and selected passengers for secondary screening. Full-scale deployment for screening all passengers and carry-on items requires a significant long-term investment and technology strategy that is still under discussion. Challenges include privacy concerns and a strategy for implementing future checkpoint concepts. The Government Accountability Office reported limited progress in fielding explosives detection technologies at passenger checkpoints, with TSA lacking a strategic plan for acquisition and deployment. Covert testing shows vulnerabilities in the screening system, particularly in detecting explosives materials and screener performance. The TSA was required by P.L. 110-53 to finalize a strategic plan for checkpoint explosives detection within one year of enactment. The act also mandated specialized training for screeners in security skills and the hiring of sufficient personnel to reduce security-related delays. Additionally, a \"Checkpoint Security Screening Fund\" was created with $250 million from security fees collected during FY2008. The Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act (P.L. 110-53) established an Airport Checkpoint Screening Fund with $250 million from security fees collected in FY2008 for improving explosives detection at passenger checkpoints. The FY2009 Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act (P.L. 110-329) allocated $250 million for Checkpoint Support to enhance checkpoint technologies and supplies. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 allocated an additional $1 billion for aviation security, specifically for the procurement and installation of checkpoint explosives detection equipment. This funding is expected to expedite the deployment of new technologies over the next two years, with projects prioritized based on security risks. Implementing these technologies and optimizing screening lanes may cost over $500,000 per lane. The cost to upgrade screening checkpoints is likely to exceed one billion dollars in equipment costs alone, with additional costs for operation and maintenance. Current funding levels may not support a full-scale deployment of emerging passenger checkpoint technologies. Congress may need to consider various funding options to accelerate deployment. The TSA may need additional funding to deploy advanced checkpoint technologies system-wide. Focusing only on larger airports could leave vulnerabilities at smaller regional airports. Future funding and a strategy are necessary for detecting explosives and nonmetallic threats at checkpoints. The security system heavily relies on human perception and decision-making, especially in checkpoint screening functions. Ongoing challenges include improving screener performance to detect dangerous items and addressing weaknesses in screening procedures that could be exploited by terrorists or criminals. Weaknesses in the aviation system, including screener human performance, can be exploited by terrorists. Human factors like training, fatigue, and decision-making affect the effectiveness of passenger and baggage screening. About 30,000 screeners conduct screening activities at airports, making up a significant portion of the TSA workforce. The screening workforce is seen as a potential weak link in the aviation security system. The aviation screening system is vulnerable due to limitations in human perception and performance, resourceful adversaries, and job pressures. Adversaries may exploit these limitations to carry out hijackings or bombings. Factors such as inadequate training, lack of motivation, fatigue, and workplace issues contribute to these human performance limitations. The aviation screening system faces challenges such as inadequate training, lack of motivation, fatigue, and workplace conditions. Balancing privacy rights with screening effectiveness is a human performance challenge. Screeners must carefully inspect private body areas for concealed items. Pat-down inspections are controversial due to complaints of inappropriate touching and unprofessional conduct. The TSA has faced complaints about inappropriate touching and unprofessional conduct by screeners during pat-down procedures. However, a 2005 DHS OIG investigation found that the TSA adequately informed passengers of their rights, trained screeners properly, and addressed complaints effectively through a screening Performance Management Information System. Complaints logged in the database are reviewed by analysis teams and federal security directors to track trends and take appropriate actions. Allegations of discrimination are forwarded to the TSA's Office of Civil Rights for further investigation. Despite concerns raised, the DHS OIG found no systematic issues with pat-down screening procedures. Privacy groups continue to express concerns over potential intrusion on individual rights and alleged cases of harassment and abuse by TSA screeners. The TSA faces challenges in balancing security measures with passenger privacy rights. Whole body imaging technologies are being considered as an alternative to pat-down searches, but they also raise privacy concerns due to the revealing nature of the generated images. Pat-down searches at checkpoints may be rushed, leading to potential oversights in detecting threat items. The difficulty in detecting threat items on passengers is compounded by the need to respect privacy, social and cultural norms, and individual differences. Screeners may be hesitant to perform thorough searches on individuals with prosthetics, which can be exploited by terrorists. Covert testers also use these methods to conceal simulated threat items to test screeners' abilities under real-world conditions. Covert testing of airport screening operations has revealed weaknesses in detecting weapons and explosives. These tests have been conducted since the 1970s, with more sophisticated \"red team\" tests introduced after the Pan Am flight 103 bombing in 1988. The term red team originated from Cold War military exercises where teams simulated enemy strategies. Aviation security red team testing was suspended post-9/11 due to safety concerns. In 2003, TSA resumed covert testing of airport security measures under TSA-OI. The TSA conducts nationwide covert testing, while Federal Security Directors at airports perform local covert testing known as the Aviation Screening Assessment Program (ASAP). Failure rates in covert testing are high, with screeners often missing simulated explosive devices. For example, in 2006, screeners at LAX missed fake bombs 75% of the time. The TSA conducts nationwide covert testing at airports like LAX and ORD, with screeners missing simulated explosive devices. The high failure rates are attributed to sophisticated concealment methods used by testers to uncover vulnerabilities for corrective action. This dynamic testing approach simulates real terrorist probing and keeps security officers alert and informed of the latest techniques. The TSA conducts covert testing at airports to identify vulnerabilities in the system and improve screener performance. Covert testing methods are used to assess areas needing improvement through training, operational emphasis, or procedural redesign. The TSA plans to conduct over 2,500 covert tests annually to enhance checkpoint screening based on intelligence about terrorist threats. The TSA conducts covert testing at airports to identify vulnerabilities in the system and improve screener performance. Current failure rates in detecting threat objects are comparable to those observed in 1987. Concerns over advance warning given prior to covert testing and screener performance evaluations have been ongoing issues. The TSA maintains procedures to minimize the likelihood of screeners being tipped off during covert tests. Cases of screeners being tipped off regarding covert testing have been documented, with instances of advance information being provided to field personnel. This includes details about the testers' gender, race, test items, and testing methods. TSA has responded by investigating these allegations. The TSA found that internal communication about upcoming covert testing was considered suspicious but not a deliberate attempt to tip off screeners. Concerns were raised about the lack of processes to document covert testing failures and take corrective action. A GAO audit of TSA's covert testing programs highlighted these issues. The GAO audit of TSA's covert testing programs found that TSA-OI failed to systematically record and inform management of test failures, lacking a process to ensure recommendations are considered and documented. TSA management often took no action or unclear action in response to recommendations, making it difficult to assess the effectiveness of remedial actions. The GAO found that TSA lacked a formal process to link recommendations to covert testing results, hindering the ability to strengthen aviation security. It recommended establishing a system to document and track actions taken in response to recommendations from covert testing. Additionally, other agencies like the Department of Homeland Security Office of Inspector General and the GAO also conduct covert testing to assess TSA screening functions. In 2007, GAO investigators conducted covert tests at airport passenger screening checkpoints, revealing vulnerabilities in detecting concealed explosives. Improvised explosive and incendiary devices were constructed using easily accessible materials, highlighting the need for improved screening procedures. The GAO investigators conducted covert tests at airport screening checkpoints, revealing vulnerabilities in detecting concealed explosives. They were able to pass IED and IID components, including liquid items, through security checkpoints without detection by exploiting specific security weaknesses. The GAO conducted covert tests at airport screening checkpoints, revealing vulnerabilities in detecting concealed explosives, including banned liquid items. The tests showed that current screening methods failed to detect improvised explosives or prohibited items, highlighting checkpoint vulnerabilities acknowledged by the TSA. The GAO recommended improvements in airport screening operations to reduce risks posed by IEDs and IIDs. Suggestions included dedicated lanes for high-risk passengers, aggressive and unpredictable screening procedures, and the development of new technology to better detect concealed items. Despite investments since 9/11, significant vulnerabilities persist. Despite investments since 9/11, significant vulnerabilities persist in checkpoint screening operations. Former DHS Inspector General Clark Kent Ervin highlighted the ease of sneaking deadly weapons past screeners, leading to recommendations for extensive training, retraining, and termination of underperforming employees. The TSA is recommending action for screeners and supervisors who fail performance tests, including termination for habitual underperformance. They are also deploying next-generation screening technologies like whole body imaging and advanced X-ray systems to improve human factors and training for screening personnel. The TSA is actively pursuing improvements in checkpoint screening technology and human factors through their checkpoint evolution initiative, which includes covert testing and monitoring screener performance with Threat Image Projection technology. Threat Image Projection (TIP) technology overlays virtual threat objects on X-ray images during passenger screening. Initially fielded by the FAA in 1999, TIP was reintroduced by the TSA in 2003 with an expanded database of threat images. This system is used for operational testing and performance evaluation. The TSA's TIP system has over 2,000 images constantly updated based on threats and concealment methods. TRX equipment at screening checkpoints is TIP-ready, displaying threat images to promote alertness and combat boredom and complacency. The TSA's TIP system provides valuable data for human factors researchers to study screener performance, optimize shift scheduling, and tailor training. It allows for evaluation of screener performance at various levels of analysis. The TSA's TIP system tracks screener performance levels and can document deficiencies for dismissal. It addresses human performance in checkpoint screening but is limited to preliminary threat identification of X-ray images. It does not provide data on proper procedures post-threat identification or the use of ETD systems for secondary evaluations. The TSA's TIP system evaluates screener performance in checkpoint screening by tracking deficiencies for dismissal. It focuses on preliminary threat identification of X-ray images, providing higher resolution and image enhancement features for better differentiation of materials. Newer X-ray systems offer selective coloration and image enhancement functions to improve detection of organic and metallic materials. Research suggests that individual enhancements may not enhance IED detection, but combining multiple enhancements can help resolve image ambiguities. The greatest advantage of current single-view X-ray systems may be their improved image resolution. Object orientation in X-ray view is crucial for detection, especially for prohibited items like guns and knives. Computer-based training using threat item imagery at various angles is used to improve detection performance. Experience and exposure to threat object recognition continually enhance detection skills. Retention of experienced X-ray screeners is crucial for maintaining high screening performance. Pre-employment screening to assess aptitude for interpreting X-ray images can improve performance. Emphasis should be placed on screener selection, training, and retention to enhance screening effectiveness. Addressing human factors like fatigue and motivation is also important for improving screening outcomes. Factors such as fatigue, motivation, and environmental conditions can impact the ability to detect threats in the screening work setting. Advanced X-ray systems offer multiple image views and automated threat detection features, but high false alarm rates can slow down the screening process. It is important to consider the specific performance characteristics of the X-ray systems being used. The specific performance characteristics of AT X-ray systems acquired by the TSA are important for operational deployment. Policy considerations for acquisition and deployment are discussed in the section on \"Next Generation Checkpoint Technologies.\" Maintaining checkpoint efficiency is a priority, but increasing system throughput can lead to missed threats. Policymakers focus on balancing efficiency and effectiveness. Aviation security focuses on balancing wait times and threat detection. The Department of Transportation and TSA aim for passengers to wait no more than 10 minutes at security checkpoints. Determining the number of checkpoints to meet this goal is challenging due to passenger variability. The TSA uses various methods to select the peak hour for modeling passenger screening demand, based on daily and hourly passenger volumes. The number of checkpoints needed is estimated by dividing the modeled passenger demand for a busy hour by the throughput achievable from a single checkpoint. The TSA estimates the number of screening lanes needed by considering passenger arrival rates and wait times. For example, if 3,000 passengers are expected in an hour with a target wait time of 10 minutes, the total queue size would be 500 passengers. In a configuration with ten screening lanes, this would mean 50 passengers in queue per lane. The TSA determines the optimal number of screening lanes based on passenger arrival rates and wait times. Design guidelines recommend 7-15 square feet per person for queue space, totaling 3,500-7,500 square feet. Space constraints at airports may hinder meeting these guidelines, leading to overcrowded queues that pose security risks. Unique airport factors can also impact the number of screening lanes needed. Airport factors can impact the number and configuration of screening lanes, with space limitations and resource constraints leading to suboptimal lane numbers. The TSA aims to screen 85% of passengers within 10 minutes, using a model based on projected peak travel volumes. The TSA aims to screen 85% of passengers within 10 minutes based on projected peak travel volumes. However, at the busiest airports, average wait times consistently exceed the 10-minute goal, with many passengers experiencing longer waits during peak travel periods like Thanksgiving and Christmas. This model, used for TSA staffing allocation, aims to minimize long waits but in practice, a significant number of passengers still experience delays. Despite efforts to improve efficiency, long wait times exceeding 40 minutes are common at major airports during peak travel periods. The TSA may investigate staffing and resource issues for consistent long waits. The GAO recommends periodic assessment of staffing allocation models. Checkpoint lines remain vulnerable to terrorist attacks due to large congregations of individuals. Large congregations of individuals in the non-sterile portion of airport terminals before screening for threat items introduce vulnerabilities that can be mitigated through efforts to increase checkpoint efficiency and specific design considerations. Better access control and streamlining of passenger screening checkpoints can reduce these vulnerabilities. The TSA is working on integrating next-generation screening technologies to improve checkpoint procedures and reduce vulnerabilities. Previously, airports had the primary responsibility for controlling access to security screening queues, but now the TSA is deploying Transportation Security Officers for this purpose. The TSA has hired Transportation Security Officers (TSOs) to serve as document checkers, eliminating the need for airport document checkers at screening lines. TSOs have diversified job functions including document checking, behavioral observation, and bomb appraisal. The Registered Traveler program is expanding, offering streamlined checkpoint processing for passengers who submit background information for vetting. Elite flyer lanes are being designated at airports for first class and business class travelers. Some passengers argue that all travelers should receive equal treatment during security screening, as fees are paid by everyone. However, the TSA believes that separating experienced travelers from others improves efficiency. TSA now offers self-selection lanes for expert travelers and tailored screening for families and individuals needing assistance. The TSA offers self-selection lanes for experienced travelers and tailored screening for families and individuals needing assistance. The Registered Traveler program provides paying members with preemptive queuing or dedicated lanes, aiming to expedite the screening process. The TSA is exploring ways to make checkpoint screening more efficient for all passengers. The TSA has introduced screening lanes based on travelers' knowledge and experience with TSA procedures and the number of carry-on items they have. This includes a \"Black Diamond\" lane for expert travelers with one carry-on, a \"Blue Square\" lane for frequent flyers with multiple items, and a \"Green Circle\" lane for families and those needing special assistance. Lane selection may be limited for some travelers, such as those with multiple bags. Passengers can self-select screening lanes based on their knowledge and number of carry-on items. The \"Black Diamond\" lane is for expert travelers with one bag, while the \"Green Circle\" lane is for families and those needing assistance. Choosing the Black Diamond lane may not always be the fastest route if it's frequently chosen by inexperienced travelers. Passenger education could improve checkpoint experiences, but the TSA notes reduced wait times for those using the Black Diamond lanes in the trial program. The TSA has observed reduced wait times and smoother operations in lanes where passengers can self-select based on their expertise. Families feel less rushed and have more time to prepare for screening, leading to a decrease in prohibited item confiscations. The TSA plans to expand this initiative to more airports based on support and passenger characteristics, with a 21% increase in throughput in expert lanes and reduced alarm rates in lanes for families and those needing assistance. The TSA has reduced rates for lanes for families and those needing assistance by 11%. They have expanded the use of self-select lanes at airports. The Registered Traveler program is seen as a way to streamline checkpoint processing for low-risk passengers, allowing resources to focus on higher-risk individuals. Airlines and airports recommended the registered traveler concept after 9/11. After 9/11, airlines and airports recommended the registered traveler concept to vet trustworthy passengers and focus security screening on higher-risk individuals. The DOT's Airport Security Rapid Response Team urged the establishment of a nationwide program for expedited processing of most travelers, known as the \"trusted traveler\" concept. The \"trusted traveler\" concept was recommended post-9/11 to focus security screening on higher-risk individuals. The TSA has implemented a limited Registered Traveler (RT) program using biometrics for passenger vetting, with about 64,000 participants as of December 2007. The program has since expanded to more airports under a public-private partnership model. The TSA's Registered Traveler (RT) program, initially involving background checks and biometric identity cards issued by private providers, has shifted to a private sector model. RT participants receive identity verification at screening checkpoints, with some airports offering dedicated lanes. In certain airports like Orlando International Airport, participants test new technologies such as shoe scanners. The TSA's Registered Traveler program tests emerging technologies like shoe scanners to expedite screening for participants. However, current technologies are not advanced enough to allow participants to bypass minimal screening requirements due to security concerns. The main benefit of the program is its identity verification capabilities. The TSA's Registered Traveler program focuses on identity verification capabilities. After pilot testing, TSA found that some background check elements were redundant and decided to eliminate them, along with the $28 fee for applicants. Despite being available at all airports, the program's future is uncertain due to limited benefits. The TSA suspended the Clear\u00ae Identity Pass RT program in 2008 after a potential data breach involving unencrypted personal data of 33,000 applicants. Enrollment was halted while security audits were conducted, but resumed after the laptop was recovered and encryption procedures were implemented. This incident raised concerns about the protection of private information in such programs amidst fears of identity theft. There is anxiety over identity theft in the RT program. Security breaches may deter applicants from using the program. Data security is a key issue for the program's future. Questions remain about the efficiency of RT security lines and time saved at checkpoints. The airline industry now questions the benefits of the program. Some RT vendors are promoting the program as a way to develop advanced screening technologies, offering prizes for innovations that can improve checkpoint efficiency. Congress included language in the FY2008 Consolidated. The FY2008 Consolidated Appropriations Act directed TSA to establish an international RT program incorporating biometrics and e-passport technologies. Some international carriers participate in the existing RT program for outbound flights from JFK and Newark Liberty airports. The future of domestic and international RT implementation is of interest for streamlining screening processes and allocating resources based on risk. Eliminating the need to remove shoes and laptops during passenger checkpoint screening could significantly improve efficiency. Shoe scanners tested in the Registered Traveler program in 2007 did not meet TSA's criteria. The TSA tested shoe scanner systems under the RT program, which did not meet detection criteria. Further testing was suspended. The TSA then began field testing the L3 PassPort shoe scanner at Los Angeles International Airport in August 2008. These systems use explosives trace detection methods to collect samples from shoes. While passengers still need to remove their shoes for additional screening, if successful, shoe scanners may eventually be deployed nationwide, allowing most passengers to keep their shoes on during screening. The TSA is approving laptop carrying cases designed to allow laptops to remain in the bag during screening. The cases must provide an unobstructed X-ray image of the laptop by using a pull out or flip out sleeve. Passengers are instructed to place only the laptop in this sleeve to avoid image obstruction. The use of TSA-approved laptop cases is voluntary and may take time to improve checkpoint efficiency. The TSA implemented restrictions on liquids and gels in 2006 after a terrorist plot targeting airliners. This has caused confusion, delays, and hassles for passengers, impacting checkpoint efficiency and wait times. The TSA implemented restrictions on liquids and gels in 2006 after a terrorist plot targeting airliners. The total ban on liquids and gels was in effect for several weeks, with limited exceptions for essential liquids. In September 2006, the TSA relaxed the passenger liquid ban by establishing specific quantity limits and special procedures for carrying liquids through screening checkpoints. The TSA implemented restrictions on liquids and gels in 2006 after a terrorist plot targeting airliners. In September 2006, the TSA relaxed the passenger liquid ban by establishing specific quantity limits and special procedures for carrying liquids through screening checkpoints. The TSA settled on the \"3-1-1 for carry-ons\" concept, allowing travelers to carry liquids in bottles of three ounces or less, fitting in a one quart clear plastic bag, with a limit of one bag per traveler. This approach was adopted by the European Union, Canada, and other countries to harmonize international aviation security procedures. The TSA implemented restrictions on liquids and gels in 2006 after a terrorist plot targeting airliners. In September 2006, the TSA relaxed the passenger liquid ban by establishing specific quantity limits and special procedures for carrying liquids through screening checkpoints. The \"3-1-1 for carry-ons\" concept allows travelers to carry liquids in bottles of three ounces or less, fitting in a one quart clear plastic bag, with a limit of one bag per traveler. This approach was adopted by other countries to harmonize international aviation security procedures. Passengers can also bring liquid medicines, baby formula, breast milk, and juices in reasonable quantities exceeding the three ounce limit imposed on other liquids, without needing to place them in the quart-sized bag. The TSA has implemented procedures for carrying liquids through screening checkpoints, including the \"3-1-1 for carry-ons\" concept. While efforts have been made to educate the public, confusion and delays still occur. The TSA is exploring tailored screening lanes to separate inexperienced passengers from seasoned travelers. Despite criticism, the TSA emphasizes the threat of liquid explosives. The TSA has faced criticism for the liquids ban due to the known threat of liquid explosives, as seen in past incidents like the Korean Airlines and Philippine Airlines bombings. Plotters intended to assemble liquid explosive devices in aircraft lavatories for suicide attacks, similar to the Bojinka plot. The TSA imposed restrictions on carrying liquids after uncovering a plot involving suicide attacks with liquid explosives on aircraft. Despite the ban, the TSA planned to phase out restrictions by fall 2009, aiming to allow passengers to carry liquids through screening checkpoints by the end of 2010. Former TSA Administrator Kip Hawley mentioned the need for new technologies to detect liquid explosives reliably. The TSA has made efforts to inform the public about checkpoint requirements, including the 3-1-1 policy for liquids. However, security procedures can still be confusing due to changes in threat assessments and inconsistent application in the past. Public education will become more important as new checkpoint screening technologies are introduced in the coming years. The TSA is implementing new screening technologies at airports to improve performance, detect explosives, and increase efficiency. The Checkpoint Evolution initiative aims to integrate these technologies and address operational and human factors needs, marking the most significant change to airport checkpoints since the 1970s. Former TSA Administrator Kip Hawley emphasized the importance of these advancements. The TSA's Checkpoint Evolution initiative aims to modernize airport screening checkpoints, with a prototype future checkpoint concept being tested at Baltimore Washington International Airport. The concept includes new technologies like multiview AT X-ray equipment and millimeter wave whole body imaging portals. Deployment plans for these concepts are still being evaluated. The TSA is evaluating proposed changes to screening checkpoints to improve efficiency, reduce congestion, and enhance security measures. The future checkpoint design includes streamlined queuing processes and separate queuing areas to mitigate threats of explosives, shootings, or bombings. The goal is to create a calmer environment for screeners and behavioral detection officers to better detect potential threats. The TSA is implementing changes to screening checkpoints to enhance security and efficiency. The new design includes mood lighting, soothing music, improved signage, and personal storyboards to create a calmer environment for screeners to detect potential threats. Additionally, there will be a designated \"prep stop\" for passengers to discard prohibited items and organize belongings. The TSA is implementing changes to screening checkpoints to enhance security and efficiency. The new design includes mood lighting, soothing music, improved signage, and personal storyboards to create a calmer environment for screeners to detect potential threats. Travel document checking stations are positioned at the transition between the queue and screening lanes. Various technologies and procedures are included in the future checkpoint concept to streamline the screening process, such as an automated conveyor system to process carry-on bags and separate alarm items for additional scrutiny. Sensitive cameras in the collection area identify and alert passengers about items. The TSA is implementing changes to screening checkpoints to enhance security and efficiency. The new design includes mood lighting, soothing music, improved signage, and personal storyboards. A future checkpoint concept involves an automated conveyor system for carry-on bags and alerting passengers about left items. Plans for re-composure benches and an \"end zone\" for regrouping before boarding are in place. Challenges include acquisition costs and airport space requirements. The Bush Administration's Budget Request for FY2009 allocated $11.5 million for checkpoint reconfiguration and expansion costs, focusing on increasing screening lanes to accommodate passenger air travel growth. Future funding for implementing checkpoint evolution concepts and next-generation screening technologies is still undetermined. These concepts aim to address concerns about detecting explosives on passengers and in carry-on items, moving beyond reliance on magnetometers. The use of magnetometers for primary screening is limited in detecting explosives or nonmetallic threat items. X-ray systems for carry-on items screening also have limitations in assisting human operators in detecting objects. The 9/11 Commission recommended improving screening checkpoints to detect explosives on passengers. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act directed the Department of Homeland Security to prioritize developing equipment for detecting nonmetallic, chemical, biological, and radiological weapons and explosives at airport screening checkpoints. The TSA was also directed to develop a strategic plan for deploying explosives detection equipment, including technologies like walkthrough portals, document scanners, shoe scanners, and X-ray devices. The Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act reiterated the need for this strategic plan. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act mandated the development of equipment for detecting various weapons and explosives at airport checkpoints. The TSA has been field testing emerging technologies to improve passenger screening, with a focus on detecting explosives. Funding for checkpoint technology acquisition has been maintained at $250 million for FY2009. Key emerging technologies are now reaching technical maturity for deployment in airport settings. The examination of screening technologies includes explosives chemical trace detection methods, whole body imaging systems, advanced X-ray capabilities, CT-based explosives detection systems, and MRI technologies for detecting explosives in carry-on items. Various explosives trace detection methods are available for screening passengers and carry-on items, such as ETD machines, handheld bottled liquids scanners, and walk-through explosives trace detection portals. Walk-through explosives trace detection portals are used for screening individuals at aviation checkpoints. These systems can detect minute quantities of explosive compounds using various techniques like mass spectrometry and gas chromatography. ETD machines will continue to play a central role in screening carry-on items for traces of explosives. The TSA has been interested in detecting explosives in liquids without direct contact since the 2006 U.K. aircraft liquid bombing plot. They are testing handheld units like the Fido PaxPoint and SABRE 4000, which rely on ion mobility spectrometry for field testing. The TSA is testing handheld units like the SABRE 4000 and Fido PaxPoint, costing $43,000 each, to detect explosives and chemical weapons. The TSA plans to deploy 250 units in FY2009 at two-thirds of screening lanes in certain airports, a reduction from earlier estimates of 800 units. The TSA is testing handheld units like the SABRE 4000 and Fido PaxPoint to detect explosives. They have also considered technologies for detecting liquid explosives and peroxide-based explosives. The TSA is testing handheld units like the SABRE 4000 and Fido PaxPoint to detect explosives, including peroxide-based explosives. In 2004, the TSA initiated pilot testing of walkthrough explosives trace detection portals that use ion mobility spectrometry for versatile detection of explosives. The TSA suspended deployment of ion mobility spectrometry trace portal systems due to reliability issues and is now focusing on whole body imaging technologies for detecting concealed items carried by passengers, including explosives and non-metallic weapons. The TSA is exploring integrating whole body imaging technologies with other screening methods like explosives trace detection to improve checkpoint security. The Transportation Security Laboratory is considering a concept called the \"tunnel of truth\" which combines various screening techniques for enhanced passenger screening. Whole body imaging technologies are being considered for primary screening in the future \"tunnel of truth concept\" but are currently only used for secondary screening by the TSA. Critics argue that these technologies are invasive and should only be used in limited circumstances, with the ACLU urging Congress to ban their use for primary screening due to privacy concerns. The ACLU opposes the use of whole body imaging technologies for primary screening, citing privacy concerns and potential delays. They argue that these technologies invade privacy without significant efficiency gains, although they do offer the capability to detect nonmetallic threat items like explosives. The TSA is field testing whole body imaging technologies to detect non-metallic threat items at airport screening checkpoints. Two candidate technologies being tested are X-ray backscatter and millimeter wave imaging. These technologies have the capability to penetrate objects for improved security screening. Both X-ray backscatter and millimeter wave technologies offer unobtrusive monitoring and scanning capabilities for security applications, including screening passengers at airport checkpoints and screening air cargo, carry-on items, checked baggage, vehicles parked near airport terminals, and vehicles entering access-controlled areas. The use of X-ray backscatter technology for screening passengers at airport checkpoints raises concerns about personal privacy, detection capabilities, and potential health risks from radiation exposure. Unlike traditional X-ray machines, X-ray backscatter systems excel at differentiating organic materials due to their ability to measure scatter or reflections of the X-ray beam. X-ray backscatter technology is effective at detecting organic materials like explosives and drugs, but raises privacy concerns due to its ability to image body parts under clothing. The use of these devices also raises public health concerns as they emit ionizing radiation in small doses. The TSA's X-ray backscatter technology meets safety standards and is considered safe for all passengers. However, the TSA is moving towards using high resolution X-ray systems for carry-on screening instead of X-ray backscatter solutions. Millimeter wave screening technology can create detailed images of concealed items. Millimeter wave technologies can create high-detail images of visually concealed items by emitting electromagnetic waves in the 30-300 giga-Hertz frequency range. These devices have various security applications, including screening individuals, vehicles, shipping containers, and baggage. The reflections of the waves bouncing off concealed items are captured, with different materials showing varying levels of reflectivity in the generated images. Metals and the human body appear light or white, while materials like plastics, ceramics, and organic explosives are partially reflective and appear partially transparent. The resolution of current millimeter wave imaging systems allows for high-detail images to be generated, but like X-ray backscatter screening, images must be taken from multiple angles. Millimeter wave technology can detect concealed items but cannot analyze their composition, requiring additional screening techniques. The scanning technology being evaluated by the TSA can scan individuals in about two seconds. The TSA uses millimeter wave imaging systems to scan individuals quickly and safely. Health concerns are minimal as the technology emits low levels of non-ionizing signals. Occupational exposure for TSA screeners is regulated, and public exposure is expected to be much lower. The TSA is exploring Advanced Technology X-ray systems for screening carry-on items at checkpoints. The TSA is field testing advanced technology X-ray systems for screening carry-on items at passenger checkpoints. They plan to deploy over 900 of these systems at Category X and Category I airports by the end of FY2009, costing around $200,000 each. The focus is on larger airports to cover 60% of lanes, prioritizing high-risk flights and passengers. Passengers are typically screened once at their originating airport using a single gateway concept. Concerns arise that smaller airports may lack advanced checkpoint technologies, making them vulnerable to terrorist exploitation. Policy debate may focus on whether to prioritize deploying advanced technologies at larger airports first or include small and mid-sized airports as well. Various technologies, such as small-footprint CT-based scanners, are available for screening carry-on items with high throughput rates and automated explosives detection algorithms. CT-based systems offer advantages over AT X-ray with automated explosives and weapons detection algorithms, generating 3-D images for analysis. However, they are more expensive. The key policy issue is whether the benefits of CT-based systems outweigh the cost difference compared to AT X-ray. TSA currently favors AT X-ray technologies for passenger checkpoint screening. The TSA currently prefers AT X-ray technologies over CT-based systems for passenger checkpoint screening. The DHS Science and Technology Directorate is collaborating with Los Alamos National Laboratory to develop ultra-low field MRI scanning capabilities for threat item screening. The prototype system, SENSIT, aims to detect liquid explosives by differentiating fluids using MRI signatures. Ultra-low field MRI technology is non-invasive, safe for human exposure, and can potentially integrate with existing airport screening checkpoint architecture. Millimeter wave technology can be adapted for screening carry-on items and covert scanning of objects. It has potential applications in inspecting vehicles for suspect items and remote inspection of unattended items in terminals. However, privacy and legal concerns arise regarding individual rights. The use of millimeter wave technology in aviation security raises privacy and legal questions. Currently, the technology is mainly used for consensual passenger searches at screening checkpoints. Concerns have been raised about the lack of mandatory screening for airport workers accessing secure areas, leading to debates on implementing screening programs nationwide. Airport workers accessing secure areas lack mandatory screening, creating vulnerabilities for threat objects to be passed into secured areas. Full checkpoint screening is deemed time-consuming and resource-intensive by TSA and airport operators. Representative DeFazio expressed concerns about this practice in 2003. In 2007, a security incident on a Delta Airlines flight from Orlando to San Juan led to the discovery of 14 guns and 8 pounds of marijuana in a carry-on bag belonging to a Comair employee. This incident prompted the TSA to order a reverse-screening of all passengers and baggage upon arrival in San Juan. The incident involved employees of Comair smuggling items onboard a flight using their access credentials to bypass security checkpoints. This highlighted the insider threat posed by airline employees. Following the incident, TSA increased employee screening, but not all airports require 100% screening of airport employees. Miami International Airport had a screening program in place, and Orlando International Airport implemented a similar program after the incident. Other airports conduct screening on certain workers or randomly, if at all. The TSA is testing techniques for random and targeted screening of airport workers accessing secured areas under the Aviation Direct Access Screening Program (ADASP) initiated in July 2006. The program emphasizes unpredictable, random screening to prevent terrorists from exploiting operational patterns. TSA can quickly increase worker screening in response to threat intelligence. Both TSA and the industry support the program. The TSA and the industry support the risk-based, random screening concept developed under the ADASP instead of costly 100% screening of airport employees. Miami and Orlando have implemented full screening programs for airport workers, while Boston Logan International Airport has a trial program requiring 100% physical screening. TSA screeners were added at BOS, with speculation about full-time screening requirements for all airport workers. Implementing 100% airport worker physical screening may require thousands of new screeners, either from TSA or private vendors. The TSA believes that random screening, along with background checks and surveillance, can provide adequate security without the need for universal screening of all airport workers. The TSA believes that stepped up random screening of airport workers, along with behavioral profiling techniques, can enhance airport security. They are considering implementing a voluntary program for certified employees with extensive background checks to be exempt from routine inspections. The TSA is exploring options to exempt certain airport workers, like maintenance workers, from routine screenings by implementing additional background checks and vetting procedures. They are also developing a system to validate the identity of airline crews for access to sterile areas without physical screening at security checkpoints. This is in line with the 9/11 Act's requirement for the TSA to assess the feasibility of such measures. The 9/11 Act mandated the TSA to consider implementing a credentialing system for airline flight crews to access airport sterile areas without physical screening. Pilots and flight attendants have raised concerns about being subjected to screening while other airport workers are not. The TSA had concerns about pilots and flight attendants having access to aircraft and cockpits without proper screening, fearing potential sabotage or hijacking. Before 9/11, crew members from other airlines could ride in the cockpit, but this practice was terminated after the attacks. After 9/11, the practice of airline crews flying standby to commute to and from their flight assignments was terminated due to a lack of industry-wide credential authentication. To address this, the Cockpit Access Security System (CASS) was developed, allowing gate agents to verify flight crew identity using a database maintained by ARINC, Inc. The system includes up-to-date photographs and background information for comparison with employee credentials, ensuring secure access to aircraft. The TSA is testing a system called crewPASS at various airports to validate the identity of airline flight crew members using the CASS database. The program may be extended to cabin crew members based on the results of the testing. TSA is studying ways to enhance airline crew identity validation and potentially reduce the need for physical screening. The TSA is testing crewPASS to validate airline flight crew identities, potentially reducing the need for physical screening. Pilots participating in the test are issued biometric identity cards for bypassing routine security screening. Pilots participating in the crewPASS test may still be subject to random or targeted screening as a secondary security measure."
