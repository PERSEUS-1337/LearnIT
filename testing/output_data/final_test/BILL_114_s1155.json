    "content": "The Act titled \"Geothermal Exploration and Technology Act of 2015\" includes a provision for a Geothermal Exploratory Drilling Loan Program. The Geothermal Exploration and Technology Act of 2015 includes the establishment of a direct loan program for high-risk geothermal exploration wells. Applicants can submit applications to the Secretary of Energy for loans under the program, with project criteria considered for selection. The Secretary considers potential geothermal resources, applicant expertise, and project importance. Preference is given to projects leading to successful geothermal development for electricity production. Data from exploratory wells must be shared for mapping national geothermal resources. The Secretary determines cost share and number of wells for geothermal projects eligible for loans under this section. Higher risk projects may receive a higher Federal share. Unproductive projects may receive further consideration. The Secretary may grant delays or waive repayment for unproductive geothermal projects. Repayment for a geothermal facility loan starts 4 years after the loan or when the facility begins commercial production, with a 4-year term for repayment. The Geothermal Investment Fund, administered by the Secretary, allows for loan extensions up to 4 years and repayment amounts to be deposited in the Fund without fiscal year limitation. The Fund consists of appropriated amounts and repayments from loans made under the section. The Geothermal Investment Fund, administered by the Secretary, allows for loan extensions and repayments to be deposited in the Fund without limitation. Amounts in the Fund may only be used for specific purposes and annual reports must be submitted to Congress detailing Fund operations. The Geothermal Investment Fund, administered by the Secretary, allows for loan extensions and repayments to be deposited in the Fund without limitation. Expenditures made from the Fund for the fiscal year must be described, along with recommendations for additional authorities to fulfill the Fund's purpose. Guidelines for program implementation must be issued by the Secretary within 180 days of the Act's enactment, specifying terms and conditions for cost sharing levels. The Secretary will determine cost sharing levels for loans under the Geothermal Investment Fund, including conditions for loan modifications or forgiveness. Loans will only be provided after the developer commits their share of expenditures. Authorization of Appropriations: Sums necessary for fiscal years 2016 through 2025 are authorized for this section. Successful well loans must be repaid by the developer within 10 years. SEC. 3. LARGE-SCALE GEOTHERMAL ENERGY. Amends Title VI of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 by adding section 616A for large-scale geothermal energy projects. Congress finds that the Geothermal Technologies Program and the Building Technologies Program focus on the direct use of geothermal energy and energy efficiency in buildings, including geothermal heat pumps. Geothermal heat pumps and direct use of geothermal energy have potential for large-scale applications. Geothermal energy has potential for large-scale applications but is underrepresented in research and development. The goal is to improve components and systems for geothermal heat pumps and increase energy efficiency in buildings and large projects. The direct use of geothermal energy involves utilizing water between 38 to 149 degrees Celsius for heating buildings or industrial processes. Geothermal heat pumps exchange heat from shallow ground or surface water using closed or open loop systems. The Secretary will establish a program for research, development, demonstration, and commercialization of geothermal energy systems, including large-scale applications. The program for geothermal energy systems includes research, development, and commercial application of geothermal ground loop efficiency improvements and cost reduction through various methods. The geothermal energy program focuses on improving ground loop efficiency and reducing costs through various methods such as installing geothermal ground loops near new construction, using wastewater for heat exchange, integrating geothermal systems with other building systems, and utilizing advanced geothermal systems. The geothermal energy program includes advancements in geothermal systems like variable pumping rates, heat pump efficiency improvements, utilizing hot water from mines and surface waters, heating districts and large buildings, and integrating geothermal systems with solar thermal and desiccants for energy storage. The geothermal energy program includes utilizing hot water for energy storage, integrating direct use with electricity production, and mitigating environmental impacts. Grants are available for various entities to support these initiatives. The geothermal energy program offers grants to various entities such as higher education, nonprofits, utilities, and for-profit companies to promote geothermal heat pumps and direct use of geothermal energy. Priority is given to proposals for large buildings, commercial districts, and residential communities. The Secretary will conduct a national solicitation for grant applications within 180 days of enactment. The Secretary is required to submit annual reports to the Senate and House committees on progress and results of the geothermal energy program, including analysis of advancements in specified areas and plans to address any recommendations. Authorization of Appropriations: The Secretary is authorized to receive necessary funds for fiscal years 2016 through 2020 to carry out the geothermal energy program. Facilitation of coproduction of geothermal energy on oil and gas leases. Section 4(b) of the Geothermal Steam Act of 1970 is amended to allow land under an oil and gas lease with approved drilling permits and production to be available for geothermal leasing if certain conditions are met. The Geothermal Steam Act of 1970 is amended to allow land under an oil and gas lease to be available for geothermal leasing to facilitate coproduction of geothermal energy with oil and gas."
