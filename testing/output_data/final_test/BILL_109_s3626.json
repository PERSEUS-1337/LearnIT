    "content": "The Act titled \"Estate Tax Relief and Reform Act of 2006\" provides estate tax relief and reform after 2009. The \"Estate Tax Relief and Reform Act of 2006\" provides an exclusion equivalent of a unified credit equal to $5,000,000 against estate tax. The applicable credit amount is based on the tentative tax computed under section 2001(c) with the applicable exclusion amount set at $5,000,000. The tentative tax is computed as exceeding $100,000,000 and is subject to an inflation adjustment. The flat estate and gift tax rates are outlined in subsection (c) of section 2001. The flat estate and gift tax rates are amended to set the tentative tax at 35 percent. The aggregate reduction in fair market value allowed under special use valuation is increased to $5,000,000. Additionally, the tax deduction for family-owned business interests is addressed in section 2057(a) of the Internal Revenue Code. Section 2057(a) of the Internal Revenue Code is amended to increase the deduction for family-owned business interests to $2,500,000 and eliminate paragraph (3). Section 2057 is also amended to remove subsection (j). Modifications are made to estate and gift taxes to reflect differences in unified credit resulting from different tax rates. Specifically, section 2001(b)(2) is amended to refer to modifications described in subsection (g) for estate tax computation. Modifications are made to estate and gift taxes to reflect differences in unified credit resulting from different tax rates. Specifically, for purposes of applying subsection (b)(2) with respect to gifts, the rates of tax in effect at the decedent's death are used to compute the tax imposed by chapter 12 and the credit allowed against such tax under section 2505. The amendments made to estate and gift taxes reflect differences in unified credit due to varying tax rates. The applicable credit amount for any calendar year before 1998 is determined based on specific dollar amounts. For gift tax purposes, the rates of tax in effect for a calendar year are used to calculate the credit for preceding periods. The amendments made by this section apply to estates of decedents dying, generation-skipping transfers, and gifts made after December 31, 2009. Certain provisions of the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 are repealed, and the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is to be applied as if those provisions had never been enacted. The Sunset provision in the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 does not apply to title V. Sections 2011 and 2604 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 are repealed."
