    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Congressional Oversight and Audit of Agency Rulemaking Actions Act\". The Congress acknowledges the positive impact of Federal regulations on protecting the environment and health but recognizes the need to control the increasing costs associated with regulations. It emphasizes the oversight responsibility of the legislative branch to ensure proper implementation of laws by the executive branch and the importance of accurate information for decision-making. Effective implementation of Congressional review of agency actions is crucial. The United States Code plays a vital role in controlling the regulatory burden on the economy through Congressional review of agency rulemaking. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. The Act defines key terms such as \"agency\" and \"Comptroller General,\" and specifies that an \"economically significant rule\" is one that may have a significant impact on the economy or various sectors. The term \"audit and assessment\" refers to a review of an agency's underlying assessments and assumptions used in developing a rule. The General Accounting Office Pilot Program will perform congressional review functions. The Comptroller General of the United States will establish a pilot project for reviewing economically significant proposed or interim rules at the request of a congressional committee. The independent audit and assessment of such rules will include analyzing potential benefits and identifying beneficiaries. The Comptroller General will conduct a separate benefit assessment and cost analysis of agency rules, including identifying potential costs and alternative approaches for achieving objectives more cost-effectively. The Comptroller General will analyze and assess impact statements or reports prepared by agencies, including impacts on State and local governments, as part of the rulemaking process. This analysis may include developing separate alternatives not cited by the agency or submitted by the public. The Comptroller General will consult various analyses, groups, entities, and sources in developing assessments. Procedures for prioritizing review requests will be determined by the Comptroller General. Agencies must cooperate by providing relevant records, information, and data for economically significant rules. The Comptroller General will submit an interim audit to the Committee within 30 days after the comment period closes for economically significant rules. The final audit will be prepared by the Comptroller General. The Comptroller General will submit an independent audit on the final rule within 30 days of publication in the Federal Register, including assessments, analyses, and a summary of differences between proposed and final rules. The final report may incorporate material from the interim report submitted earlier. SEC. 5. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. $5,200,000 authorized for the Comptroller General for fiscal year 2001. SEC. 6. EFFECTIVE DATE AND DURATION OF PILOT PROJECT. The Act will take effect 90 days after enactment. The pilot project will last 5 years with an annual appropriation of at least $5,200,000. A report on the project's effectiveness will be submitted to Congress before the 5-year period ends."
