    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Freedom of Choice Act of 1993\". Congressional statement of findings and purpose is included. The 1973 Supreme Court decision in Roe v. Wade established limits on States' power to restrict a woman's right to choose abortion. Since 1989, the strict scrutiny standard has not been applied, leading to some States limiting this right. Certain States have restricted women's right to choose abortion and contraception, leading to an increase in unsafe abortions, burdening interstate commerce, interfering with freedom of travel, and straining medical and economic resources. States obstruct access to safe and legal abortion, interfere with medical professionals, hinder access to contraceptives, discriminate against minorities, and infringe on women's rights under Federal and State law. Congress has the power to enact legislation to create statutory rights in areas of national concern and to prohibit State interference with interstate commerce, liberty, or equal protection of the laws. The purpose of this Act is to establish limitations on States restricting a woman's freedom to terminate a pregnancy. The Act aims to establish limitations on States restricting a woman's right to terminate a pregnancy, subject to the same constitutional limitations as outlined in Roe v. Wade and subsequent cases from 1973 to 1988. SEC. 3. FREEDOM TO CHOOSE. In general, a state may not restrict a woman's freedom to choose to terminate a pregnancy before fetal viability, but may restrict it after viability if necessary to preserve the woman's life or health. The state can also impose medically necessary requirements on abortion procedures. Nothing in this Act can prevent a state from protecting individuals or institutions opposed to abortion or from declining to pay for abortions. The curr_chunk states that a state cannot prevent individuals or institutions from being conscientiously opposed to abortion, from declining to pay for abortions, or from requiring a minor to involve a parent before terminating a pregnancy. The term \"State\" in this Act includes the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and other U.S. territories or possessions."
