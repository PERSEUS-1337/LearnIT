    "content": "The text chunk \"PERMANENT EXTENSION OF 50-PERCENT BONUS DEPRECIATION\" is a section discussing the extension of a tax incentive for businesses. The text chunk discusses an amendment to the Internal Revenue Code regarding 50-percent bonus depreciation property acquired after May 5, 2003, with specific conditions for eligibility. The amendment to the Internal Revenue Code eliminates termination dates for 30-percent bonus depreciation property acquired after September 10, 2001, with specific conditions for eligibility. Technical amendments were made to section 168(k) of the Internal Revenue Code, removing subparagraphs and clauses related to specific dates before January 1, 2005. The subsection heading for section 168(k) was also revised. Section 168(k)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code is amended to include long-term contract accounting under the percentage of completion method. Additionally, there is an election to increase the minimum tax credit limitation instead of bonus depreciation. The amendment to Section 53 of the Internal Revenue Code allows corporations to increase the limitation under subsection (c) by an amount equal to the bonus depreciation amount for a taxable year. The bonus depreciation amount is calculated as 35 percent of the excess of the aggregate depreciation under section 168. The amendment allows corporations to increase the limitation under subsection (c) by the bonus depreciation amount for a taxable year, which is 35 percent of the excess of aggregate depreciation under section 168. An election under this subsection exempts property from Section 168(k), and the credit allowed by this section is refundable. The amendment allows corporations to increase the limitation under subsection (c) by the bonus depreciation amount for a taxable year. The credit allowed by this section is refundable and treated as a credit allowed to the taxpayer under subpart C. The amendments made by this Act apply to taxable years ending after May 5, 2003."
