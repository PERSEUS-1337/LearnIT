    "content": "The \"Immunization Now Act of 1993\" may be cited as the official title of this legislation. The Congress finds that childhood illnesses preventable by vaccinations are increasing at an alarming rate, with measles cases rising significantly in 1989. The cost of immunizations is minimal, estimated at $130 per child, while the price per dose of a vaccine is around $24. A child who was not immunized from measles tragically died. In 1990, a child died from measles complications in California after significant efforts and costs to treat the illness. The measles rate that year exceeded previous years since 1978, with over sixty deaths reported. A large percentage of cases occurred in unvaccinated infants and preschool children, particularly in poor urban areas where immunization rates are low compared to other industrialized nations. In the United States, preschoolers now account for 47 percent of measles cases, up from 25 percent in 1988. Other countries have implemented computerized systems to track immunization status and aid in monitoring vaccine distribution. Establishment of an entitlement program for infant immunization against vaccine-preventable diseases. Each infant in the United States under two years old, regardless of citizenship status, is entitled to free immunizations against vaccine-preventable diseases through a voucher system established by the Federal Government. The Federal Government covers the costs of providing specified immunizations for infants through vouchers. Licensed health care professionals or providers authorized to administer specified immunizations for infants must do so when presented with a voucher, regardless of their participation in federal health programs or receipt of federal payments. \"Vouchers must be issued for licensed health care professionals to administer specified immunizations for infants.\" The Secretary of Health and Human Services will issue vouchers for infant immunizations, which must include the infant's name, parent's name and address, legal rights and obligations, and information on required immunizations. Vouchers are only issued for infants meeting eligibility criteria and with a signed application from a parent. The Secretary of Health and Human Services issues vouchers for infant immunizations, with hospitals and community health centers responsible for issuing vouchers to parents of eligible infants. The center determines eligibility for infant vouchers based on parent information and completes the application on behalf of the infant. The Secretary provides vouchers directly to parents upon application if not issued by the center. SEC. 6. REIMBURSEMENT FOR PROVISION OF IMMUNIZATIONS. The Secretary will make quarterly payments to professionals/providers for immunizations provided under vouchers issued under section 5, if certain conditions are met. The reimbursement amounts for different types of immunizations will be established by the Secretary. Reimbursement for immunizations will be provided for vaccines and professional services under specified conditions. The Secretary will establish specified immunizations based on recommendations from the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practice. General provisions are also outlined. The Secretary will provide information to the public and professionals about the entitlement and application process under the program. Regulations will be issued within ninety days, and the entitlement will apply after forty-five days from the issuance of the final rule. Definitions are provided for clarity. The Act defines key terms such as \"Secretary,\" \"parent,\" and \"United States.\" Appropriations are authorized for the implementation of the Act. The Act establishes a National Immunization Registry System. The Secretary will establish a national immunization registry system for childhood immunization surveillance through age six. Grants will be provided for research and demonstration projects to develop the registry, including testing methods for collecting birth certificate and immunization information. The Secretary will establish a national immunization registry system for childhood immunization surveillance through age six. Grants will be provided for research and demonstration projects to develop the registry, including tracking children in mobile populations and demonstrating the efficient use of registry information for providing immunization status. Authorization of appropriations is set at $7,000,000 in fiscal year 1994 and $12,000,000 in fiscal year 1995. The Secretary will expand the national immunization registry to cover the entire nation by linking birth certificate records, enhancing technical capacity, promoting private provider participation, and collecting information on all vaccine doses for preschool age children. Authorization of appropriations is provided for these efforts. Authorization of $50,000,000 in appropriations for fiscal year 1996 to implement the registry. Starting in fiscal year 1997, the Secretary will ensure full implementation of the registry, including registering all infants through birth certificate information related to immunization tracking, collecting vaccine doses for children under six, providing notices to parents about overdue vaccinations, and giving parents appropriate records. The Secretary will provide appropriate records to parents for children entering schools or day care programs. $50,000,000 is authorized for this subsection annually starting in fiscal year 1997. Annual reports on the registry's operation will be submitted to Congress."
