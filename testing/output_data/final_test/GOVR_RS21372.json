    "content": "The European Union (EU) is a political and economic partnership of 28 member states, formed after World War II to promote peace and economic recovery in Europe. It includes a customs union, a single market with free movement of goods, services, capital, and people, a common trade policy, agricultural and environmental policies, and a common currency (the euro) used by 19 member states. The EU, with 19 member states using the euro, has also made strides in political integration, including a Common Foreign and Security Policy and cooperation in Justice and Home Affairs. Twenty-two members participate in the Schengen area for free movement. Brexit, the UK's impending exit from the EU, poses a significant challenge. The EU member states work together through common institutions to set policy and promote their collective interests, with decision-making processes varying depending on the subject. Integration in economic and social policies has led to pooling of sovereignty and executive authority held by EU institutions. The EU's decision-making process in trade and agriculture is supranational, with most areas subject to majority voting among member states. Common Foreign and Security Policy decisions require unanimous agreement, while Justice and Home Affairs issues now use majority voting post the 2009 Lisbon Treaty. EU institutions govern the decision-making process. The EU's decision-making process is governed by several institutions with a dual supranational and intergovernmental character. The European Council guides EU policy and is composed of Heads of State or Government and the President of the European Commission. The European Commission acts as the EU's executive, implementing and managing decisions, and has the sole right of legislative initiative in most policy areas. The European Commission is composed of one Commissioner from each EU country, appointed by member states to five-year terms. The Commission President and other Commissioners hold distinct portfolios. The Council of the European Union represents national governments and enacts legislation based on Commission proposals, with decisions subject to a complex majority voting system. The European Parliament represents EU citizens with 751 directly elected members for five-year terms. It shares legislative power with the Council of Ministers in many policy areas through the \"ordinary legislative procedure\" or \"co-decision.\" The European Parliament shares legislative power with the Council of Ministers in the \"ordinary legislative procedure\" or \"co-decision.\" Other key EU institutions include the Court of Justice, Court of Auditors, European Central Bank, and advisory committees. The Lisbon Treaty, in force since 2009, amends EU governing institutions and decision-making processes. The Lisbon Treaty, in force since 2009, introduced changes to EU institutions and decision-making processes. It established new leadership positions, including the President of the European Council and the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, to enhance the EU's effectiveness, role in foreign policy, and democracy and transparency within the EU. The Lisbon Treaty introduced new leadership positions in the EU, including the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. This representative acts as an agent for the Council of Ministers on foreign policy issues and manages the Commission's diplomatic activities. The treaty also simplified the EU's voting system, increased the power of the European Parliament in budgetary processes, and extended its role in policy areas. The Lisbon Treaty gives the European Parliament equal say with member states in most EU legislation and introduced an exit clause (Article 50) for member states to leave the EU. The UK invoked Article 50 in 2017 to leave the EU. Nineteen EU member states use the euro as their common currency. The gradual introduction of the euro began in January 1999 when 11 EU member states adopted it. Euro notes and coins replaced national currencies in participating states in January 2002. The Eurozone shares a common central bank, the European Central Bank (ECB), and monetary policy. However, there is no common fiscal policy, and member states control national spending and taxation. In 2009-2010, a crisis in the eurozone started in Greece due to high sovereign debt. The eurozone crisis in 2009-2010 began with Greece's high sovereign debt leading to increased borrowing costs and the risk of default. This spread to other eurozone countries with high debt levels, impacting the European banking system, economic growth, and causing rising unemployment. European leaders and EU institutions responded with bail-out loans to Greece, Ireland, Portugal, and Cyprus to prevent default and stem contagion. The eurozone crisis led to bail-out loans for Greece, Ireland, Portugal, and Cyprus with austerity measures attached. Spain also implemented austerity measures and a recapitalization plan for its banks. Key initiatives included the creation of the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) for emergency support, a single bank supervisor for the eurozone, and ECB efforts to stabilize financial markets. The crisis began to improve in late 2012 as market confidence increased. The eurozone crisis started to stabilize in late 2012, with countries like Ireland, Portugal, and Cyprus exiting financial assistance programs. Despite improvements, many member states still faced weak economic growth and high unemployment. Greece's economy remained in distress, leading to concerns of a potential \"Grexit\" as negotiations for further financial aid and debt relief stalled. France and Italy emphasized the political importance of the eurozone, while Germany and other countries stressed the need for all members to adhere to agreements. In late June, Greece failed to make a payment to the IMF, leading to the closure of banks and imposition of capital controls. The Syriza-led government eventually agreed to EU demands for austerity and reforms to receive financial assistance, averting Grexit. Tensions persist over Greece's assistance program and debt relief, with creditors agreeing to extend loan maturities in June 2018. Greece received $330 billion in loans from the EU, ECB, and IMF between 2010 and 2018. Despite exiting its financial assistance plan in August 2018, Greece must still meet strict financial conditions and face ongoing monitoring. Concerns remain about the fragility of Greece's economy, austerity measures, and the strength of its banking system. The eurozone crisis highlighted structural weaknesses and tensions among member states over austerity measures and growth stimulation. The EU faced challenges in balancing austerity measures and growth stimulation during negotiations with Greece in 2015. Despite this, EU governments remain committed to the euro and EU project. Efforts to strengthen the eurozone's architecture have led to economic recovery and positive prospects in 2018. EU enlargement since 2004 has brought stability and prosperity to Europe. The European Union has expanded significantly since its inception, with various countries joining over the years. Membership criteria include having a functioning democracy and market economy. Accession negotiations are complex, involving the adoption of EU laws and regulations. Analysts emphasize the meticulous process of EU enlargement. EU enlargement is a carefully managed process involving adoption of EU laws and regulations. It has helped transform many European countries into democratic and affluent societies. The process requires unanimous agreement from existing member states, and relationships with individual members can influence a country's accession prospects. Albania, Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia, and Turkey are official candidates for membership, each at different stages of the process. Bosnia-Herzegovina and Kosovo are potential future candidates. The EU maintains that the enlargement door remains open to any European country that fulfills the EU's political and economic criteria for membership. EU leaders reaffirmed support for the European perspective of Western Balkan countries, but concerns exist about further expansion, especially to Turkey or countries farther east, due to fears of migrant labor and implications on the EU's institutions and identity. Brexit could impact EU enlargement prospects, especially for Turkey, given its size, Muslim culture, and economy. The EU's Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) was established in 1993 to improve collective foreign policy actions, following the Balkan crisis in the early 1990s. Previous attempts at political integration had faced challenges due to member states' concerns about sovereignty and foreign policy differences. The Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) of the EU, established in 1993, aims to improve collective foreign policy actions. Member states dominate CFSP decision-making, requiring unanimous agreement. While progress has been made in forging common policies on international issues, consensus can be challenging, as seen during the divisive U.S.-led war in Iraq in 2003. The EU's Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) was divisive among members due to differing viewpoints. The Lisbon Treaty established a High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy to enhance the EU's global presence and coherence in foreign policy. This position combines the roles of the Council of Ministers' High Representative for CFSP and the Commissioner for External Relations, aiming to unify the EU's diplomatic activities and foreign aid programs. The Lisbon Treaty created the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy to enhance the EU's global presence and coherence in foreign policy. This position combines diplomatic activities and foreign aid programs, aiming to improve the EU's ability to respond to security crises through the Common Security and Defense Policy (CSDP). EU forces are not a standing army but a catalogue of troops and assets at appropriate readiness levels for EU operations. Improving European military capabilities for CSDP operations has been challenging due to flat or declining defense budgets. Capability gaps exist in air- and sealift, command and control systems, intelligence, and deployable forces. Analysts suggest pooling assets and developing niche capabilities among member states. The EU established the European Defense Agency in 2004 to coordinate defense-industrial and procurement policy. Recent calls for increased defense spending and EU defense integration are driven by new security challenges and the desire to strengthen the EU project post-Brexit. Brexit may lead to closer EU defense cooperation as the UK traditionally opposed certain measures. Since 2016, EU leaders have announced new initiatives to bolster EU security and defense cooperation, including the European Defense Fund and the launch of a new EU defense pact (PESCO) in December 2017. Member states aim to spend defense funds more efficiently, jointly develop military capabilities, and increase military interoperability. EU leaders insist that these efforts do not signal the creation of an EU army and that member states will retain control over national military assets and defense decisions. The EU aims to improve European defense capabilities through initiatives like the European Defense Fund and the launch of PESCO in 2017. Efforts include joint development of military capabilities and increased military interoperability. The EU emphasizes that these measures do not indicate the formation of an EU army and that member states will maintain control over national defense assets and decisions. The US supports EU efforts as long as they are tied to NATO and do not duplicate NATO structures or resources. The Berlin Plus arrangement, established in 2003, allows EU-led military missions access to NATO planning capabilities and common assets, benefiting NATO with 22 countries belonging to both organizations. Despite strained NATO-EU relations, cooperation has been seen in missions in the Balkans, Afghanistan, and Africa. However, political-level cooperation on various issues has been hindered by tensions with Turkey and the Cyprus dispute. The NATO-EU cooperation has faced challenges due to bureaucratic rivalry, differing views on their future roles, and security threats in Europe. However, progress has been made with new arrangements in countering migrant smuggling and cyber defense. Both organizations have agreed to enhance their ability to counter hybrid threats, cooperate on migration, and strengthen coordination on cybersecurity. NATO leaders reaffirmed the importance of cooperation in July 2018. Some analysts worry about political uncertainty and tensions with Turkey potentially derailing efforts to improve NATO-EU relations. Concerns exist that certain EU member states, led by France, may seek to establish a more independent EU defense arm from NATO in the long term. Brexit could further empower the EU to pursue autonomous defense capabilities, although cooperation with NATO and the US is still emphasized. The EU's new defense pact, PESCO, is supported by U.S. officials but should not detract from NATO commitments. The Justice and Home Affairs (JHA) field focuses on internal security, migration, terrorism, and border control within the EU. Efforts to harmonize JHA policies were previously hindered by concerns over sovereignty. The EU has made significant progress in the Justice and Home Affairs (JHA) field following terrorist attacks in the early 2000s. Measures include a common definition of terrorism, an EU-wide arrest warrant, and enhanced tools to combat terrorist financing. Recent attacks have led to a focus on combating foreign fighters and individuals inspired by groups like the Islamic State. The Lisbon Treaty granted the European Parliament more power in JHA policy areas, and decisions in the Council of Ministers now use qualified majority voting to expedite EU decision-making. The EU has shifted to a majority voting system in Justice and Home Affairs (JHA) to speed up decision-making, but member states still aim for consensus on sensitive policies. Some countries have opt-out options for certain JHA measures. The Lisbon Treaty renamed JHA as the \"Area of Freedom, Security, and Justice.\" The Schengen area allows free movement without internal border controls among participating countries. The Schengen Agreement allows for free movement without internal border controls among participating countries. The Schengen Borders Code governs external and internal border controls, including rules on visas, asylum requests, and border checks. Participating countries can reintroduce internal border controls in cases of security threats or exceptional circumstances. The Schengen Agreement established free movement within participating countries and the Schengen Information System (SIS) to enhance cooperation in law enforcement. It includes alerts for wanted persons, missing individuals, criminal suspects, and stolen property. Some EU countries are not yet full Schengen members but are required to join once security conditions are met. Ireland and the UK have opt-outs from full participation. The EU's trade policy is an exclusive competence of the EU, preventing member states from negotiating their own international trade agreements. It aims to prevent unfair competition within the common market by regulating trade in goods and services, intellectual property rights, and foreign direct investment. The European Commission and the Council of Ministers collaborate on setting common customs tariffs, export policies, and trade protection measures. The Council makes trade decisions through qualified majority voting but usually seeks consensus. The Commission negotiates trade agreements on behalf of the EU, which require approval from both the Council and the European Parliament. The process for new trade agreements involves discussions among EU institutions, impact assessments, and informal scoping exercises with potential partners. The European Commission formulates negotiating directives for new trade agreements with partner countries or trade blocs, which are approved by the Council and shared with the European Parliament. The Directorate General for Trade leads the negotiations, which can last for two to three years or longer. The Commission keeps the Council and Parliament informed of progress during negotiations. After negotiations reach the final stage, both parties initial the proposed trade accord, which is then reviewed by the Council and Parliament. If approved by the Council, the Commission signs the agreement. The Parliament can consent or request the Commission to address concerns. Member states must ratify the agreement, and once Parliament gives consent and member states ratify, the Council adopts the final decision to conclude the agreement, which then enters into force. EU member states have differing views on integration, with tensions between those seeking closer union and those prioritizing national sovereignty. Some states have opted out of certain integration aspects like the eurozone and Schengen area. Small states are cautious of initiatives that could favor larger countries, and historical and geographical factors influence policy preferences. The EU's enlargement to the east has brought in members with Soviet histories, affecting views on EU reform, relations with Russia, and migration. Southern EU countries bordering the Mediterranean may prioritize North Africa interests. European public sentiment towards the EU has been historically favorable, with citizens valuing freedom of movement. However, euroskepticism exists due to concerns about national sovereignty and the EU's democratic deficit. Growing support for populist, antiestablishment parties in Europe, many of which are euroskeptic and hold varying views on the future of the EU. Countries like Austria, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, and the UK have prominent euroskeptic parties. The rise of euroskeptic parties in Europe has led to the formation of new coalition governments in several countries, challenging the pro-European establishment. In Germany, the far-right Alternative for Germany party entered parliament in 2017, while in the UK, pressure from euroskeptics led to the 2016 EU membership referendum. Pressure from euroskeptics within and outside the Conservative Party and euroskeptic parties influencing EU policies. Italy's new euroskeptic government may challenge eurozone rules and EU trade deals. Despite this, majority of EU citizens support the EU. Anti-EU parties like France's National Rally and Netherlands' Freedom Party did not perform as well in 2017 elections. Euroskeptic parties hold up to 25% of seats in the European Parliament but struggle to form a cohesive opposition. In June 2016, UK voters favored leaving the EU in a referendum. The UK government enacted Brexit in March 2017 by invoking Article 50. Negotiations between the EU and UK are ongoing for the UK's withdrawal, expected in March 2019. Despite an agreement in December 2017 on key withdrawal issues, EU-UK negotiations remain contentious. The UK remains divided on the type of Brexit it wants, with details on customs, trade, and the Irish border still needing to be worked out with the EU. Speculation of a \"no deal\" scenario in March 2019 has increased, but some analysts believe an agreement will be reached to avoid this outcome. The UK's departure could have significant political and economic implications for the EU. The UK's departure from the EU could have significant political and economic implications for the EU, potentially affecting its integration project. Brexit negotiations have seen the EU taking a tough stance to deter other member states from considering a similar path. Experts suggest that Brexit may impact EU enlargement and diminish its global influence without the UK's contributions. The EU faces a choice between further integration or scaling back in certain areas. The EU's future integration has sparked debate, with some calling for a halt or reversal of current efforts. Brexit may lead to a more cohesive EU, potentially pursuing deeper integration without UK opposition. A \"multispeed EU\" model is being considered, allowing some members to integrate further while others opt out. EU leaders met in Rome in 2017 to mark the Treaties of Rome's 60th anniversary and discuss the future direction of the EU. EU-27 leaders reaffirmed their commitment to the EU project in the Rome Declaration, but discussions on a multispeed EU were toned down due to concerns about creating different classes of EU membership. Despite this, the union is moving towards greater integration, particularly in defense cooperation, with new initiatives announced by key countries like Germany and France. Germany and France, key countries in the EU, have called for strengthening the eurozone's economic governance. In June 2018, they proposed a road map for eurozone reforms, but other members had reservations. Discussion on the EU's future structure and purpose will continue. The US and EU have maintained diplomatic and economic ties for decades. The NTA aimed to promote stability, democracy, and world trade while strengthening ties across the Atlantic. The Transatlantic Legislators' Dialogue facilitated engagement between the U.S. House of Representatives and the European Parliament. U.S.-EU summits involve meetings between the U.S. President and EU leaders. Key interlocutors include the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and the European Commissioner for Trade. The European Commissioner for Trade directs the EU's trade policy, with U.S. officials interacting at various levels. The U.S. supports European integration to prevent nationalism and promote democratic allies and trading partners. European integration is supported by the United States to foster democratic allies and strong trading partners in Europe. The EU project was crucial during the Cold War to deter the Soviet threat, and the US has backed efforts to extend benefits to Central and Eastern Europe. The US often partners with the EU on common foreign policy concerns, promoting peace and stability in various regions and enhancing cooperation in law enforcement and counterterrorism. The United States and the EU have collaborated on various issues such as containing Iran's nuclear ambitions, addressing climate change, imposing sanctions on Russia, and promoting peace and stability. However, differences on the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, data protection, and privacy vs. security have strained the U.S.-EU political relationship at times. Privacy and security concerns have been longstanding issues in U.S.-EU relations, particularly following the 2013 unauthorized disclosures of U.S. surveillance programs. EU worries about data privacy safeguards have put pressure on information-sharing arrangements between the two entities. Despite efforts by the Obama Administration and Congress to address these concerns, some in the EU remain apprehensive about the protection of EU citizens' personal data by U.S. laws and regulations. The partnership between the U.S. and EU is valued for serving their strategic and economic interests, but differences on privacy and security issues continue to be a point of contention. President Trump's criticisms of the EU's trade practices have raised concerns in Europe about the future of U.S.-EU relations. The EU is also uneasy with elements of the Trump Administration's \"America First\" foreign policy, leading to divisions on various issues. The EU is particularly worried about President Trump's decision to withdraw from the 2015 nuclear agreement with Iran. The EU is concerned about President Trump's decision to withdraw from the 2015 nuclear agreement with Iran (JCPOA), fearing it could destabilize the region and harm EU business interests in Iran. They view the JCPOA as a significant foreign policy achievement and are working to preserve it by protecting European companies from U.S. sanctions. EU leaders were also dismayed by Trump's actions on the Paris climate agreement and Jerusalem. Some in the EU are wary of the Trump Administration's actions, including withdrawing from the Paris climate agreement and recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital. There are concerns about improving relations with Russia at the expense of European security, as well as ambivalence towards multilateral organizations like the United Nations and WTO. EU officials question the US's reliability as a partner and are preparing for potential disengagement, focusing on enhancing defense cooperation and trade agreements independently. EU efforts to enhance defense cooperation and conclude trade agreements with other countries aim to reduce European dependence on the United States post-Brexit. Despite tensions, the EU seeks to work with the Trump Administration on common interests like countering terrorism and cybersecurity, preserving long-term relations. European Commission President Juncker's efforts to reduce trade tensions with President Trump show the EU's commitment to close U.S.-EU relations. The U.S. and EU share the largest trade and investment relationship globally. The U.S. and EU have the largest trade and investment relationship globally, accounting for a significant portion of global GDP, exports, and imports. They are each other's biggest investors and most profitable markets, generating billions in commercial sales and employing millions of workers. Despite some tensions, their economic relations are traditionally viewed as mutually beneficial. U.S.-EU trade disputes persist over poultry, bioengineered food products, protection of geographical indications (GIs), and subsidies to airplane manufacturers Boeing and Airbus. Resolving these disputes is challenging due to equal economic strength and differences in domestic values and regulatory frameworks. Negotiations for the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (T-TIP) aim to increase market access, strengthen investment rules, reduce barriers, and enhance cooperation on global trade issues. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (T-TIP) aims to increase market access, strengthen investment rules, reduce barriers, and enhance cooperation on global trade issues. Negotiations have been inactive under the Trump Administration, with unresolved differences on sensitive issues such as investor-state dispute settlement, digital trade, treatment of GIs, and government procurement. U.S.-EU economic cooperation is crucial for managing emerging economies like China, India, and Brazil in the future, despite divisions among EU countries and with the United States in some policy areas. The EU and the United States have disagreements over agricultural subsidies and global trade imbalances, leading to stalled trade negotiations. EU officials are concerned about the Trump Administration's trade policies and view them as protectionist. President Trump has criticized the EU for the goods deficit, calling them a \"foe.\" In mid-July 2018, President Trump labeled the EU as a \"foe\" in trade, citing a goods deficit. However, EU officials argue that U.S.-EU economic relations are balanced when considering the U.S. services surplus and higher profits earned by U.S. companies in Europe. A key point of contention is the Trump Administration's tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from U.S. trading partners. The Trump Administration imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from the EU on June 1, 2018, citing national security concerns. EU leaders argue that the tariffs are baseless and have retaliated with their own tariffs on selected U.S. imports. The EU imposed retaliatory tariffs on selected U.S. imports, including Kentucky bourbon and Harley-Davidson motorcycles. President Juncker and President Trump reached an initial agreement to de-escalate trade tensions, aiming for zero tariffs and resolving trade differences. The EU interprets the deal to mean no new tariffs on European automobiles while trade talks continue. The U.S. and EU are in talks on trade and tariff issues, with concerns about possible auto-related tariffs. President Trump's approach has compelled the EU to address U.S. trade concerns, leading to a more positive outlook on economic relations. The agreement aims to boost EU purchases of U.S. soybeans and LNG, but some in the EU remain cautious about its longevity. Some U.S.-EU differences have emerged regarding the scope of proposed trade talks. U.S. officials want all agricultural products included, but EU officials disagree, saying only soybeans are on the table. Analysts question the EU's ability to increase imports of U.S. soybeans or LNG due to the EU's lack of control over private companies."
