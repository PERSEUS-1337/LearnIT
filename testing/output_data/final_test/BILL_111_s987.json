    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"International Protecting Girls by Preventing Child Marriage Act of 2010\". Child marriage is a harmful traditional practice that violates human rights, particularly for girls. An estimated 60 million girls in developing countries were married before the age of 18, with projections of an additional 100 million in the next decade. Between \\1/2\\ and \\3/4\\ of girls are married before age 18 in several countries, perpetuated by factors like poverty, lack of opportunities, parental concerns, dowry system, and devaluation of girls. Child marriage leads to health risks for girls and infants, including maternal death, obstetric fistula, and HIV/AIDS. According to USAID, delaying the age of first birth for women can improve their chances of survival as pregnancy complications are a leading cause of death for young women in developing countries. Despite legal minimum age of marriage in many countries, child marriage persists due to traditional norms and lack of enforcement. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton condemns child marriage as a violation of human rights and child abuse. Investments in girls' schooling, safe community spaces, and skills building programs are effective strategies to prevent child marriage in high-prevalence areas where 40% or more of girls under 18 are married. These efforts empower girls by addressing poverty, low status, and harmful norms contributing to child marriage. Child marriage is defined as the marriage of a girl or boy below the minimum age for marriage in their country or under 18 if no such law exists. Congress acknowledges the importance of addressing child marriage. Congress recognizes child marriage as a violation of human rights and believes that preventing it should be a foreign policy goal of the United States. Child marriage undermines U.S. investments in foreign assistance for education, skills building for girls, reducing maternal and child mortality, preventing HIV/AIDS transmission, gender-based violence, and poverty. Expanding educational and economic opportunities for girls and women, as well as reducing maternal and child mortality, are crucial for achieving global health and development goals, including efforts to prevent HIV/AIDS. SEC. 5. STRATEGY TO PREVENT CHILD MARRIAGE IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. The President is authorized to provide assistance to prevent child marriage in developing countries through various organizations, prioritizing regions with high rates of child marriage and supporting successful community-based programs. The President is required to establish a multi-year strategy to prevent child marriage and empower girls at risk in developing countries. This strategy should address the unique needs of girls under 18 and involve consultation with Congress, federal departments, agencies, multilateral organizations, and civil society representatives. The President must establish a multi-year strategy to prevent child marriage in developing countries, focusing on high prevalence areas. The strategy should include diplomatic and programmatic initiatives related to human rights, education, health, and democracy building. A report on the progress should be submitted to Congress within three years of enacting the Act. The President must submit a report to Congress detailing the implementation of the strategy to prevent child marriage in developing countries, examples of best practices, and an assessment of current US-funded efforts. Assistance should be integrated with existing US development programs and may support activities in education, health, income generation, agriculture development, legal rights, democracy building, and human rights. Support for community-based activities to address beliefs promoting child marriage, educate on health risks, and promote access to education, health care, and livelihood skills for adolescents, especially girls. Support for educating girls in primary and secondary school, reducing education fees, and enhancing safe conditions in schools. Support for adolescent girls includes access to water, hygiene facilities, female teachers, safe routes to school, and eliminating violence. Additionally, assistance is provided for health care, nutrition, financial literacy, economic opportunities, and education support. Support for education through community and faith-based organizations, youth programs, and efforts targeted at men and boys to remove gender stereotypes and bias against girls used to justify child marriage. Promotion of zero tolerance for violence, gender equality, and increasing the perceived value of girls. Assistance in creating peer support, female mentoring networks, and safe social spaces for girls. Support for local advocacy work to provide legal literacy programs at the community level to ensure governments and law enforcement officials prevent child and forced marriage. SEC. 6. RESEARCH AND DATA. Congress urges the President and relevant agencies to collect data on child marriage in countries receiving US assistance and its impact on development goals. SEC. 7. DEPARTMENT OF STATE'S COUNTRY REPORTS ON HUMAN RIGHTS PRACTICES. The Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 is amended to require reports on the status of child marriage in countries receiving US assistance. This includes a description of the practice of child marriage in each country where it is prevalent, defining child marriage as the marriage of a girl or boy below the minimum age for marriage or under 18 if no such law exists. The Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 now mandates reports on child marriage in countries receiving US aid, defining it as marriage below the legal age or under 18 if no law exists.
