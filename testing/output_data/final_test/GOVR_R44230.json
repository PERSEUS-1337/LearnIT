    "content": "The 114th Congress has focused on immigration-related measures, particularly border security, intercountry adoption, Afghan special immigrant visas, and the Visa Waiver Program. Additionally, the Congress has extended the E-Verify system and other immigration programs through FY2016, with bills addressing interior enforcement and visa security also receiving attention. The 114th Congress has addressed various immigration-related issues, including criminal sanctions, inadmissibility, deportability, relief from removal, state and local involvement in immigration enforcement, worksite enforcement, visa issuances, asylum, refugees, and unaccompanied alien children. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is responsible for protecting U.S. borders from various threats, including weapons of mass destruction, terrorists, smugglers, and unauthorized aliens. Border security involves securing the country's entry points. Border security involves controlling official ports of entry and patrolling land and maritime borders to prevent illegal entries. U.S. Customs and Border Protection protects U.S. international land borders and coastal shorelines. The Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act of 2015 authorizes CBP. CBP's Office of Field Operations conducts inspections at ports of entry, while the U.S. Border Patrol enforces immigration law between ports of entry. CBP's U.S. Border Patrol (USBP) enforces immigration law and federal laws along the border, with apprehensions of unauthorized migrants declining since FY2005. Recent upticks in apprehensions of Central American families and unaccompanied alien children have been noted. Border security has been a key issue in Congress, with debates on strengthening security as part of comprehensive immigration reform. DHS, CBP, OFO, and USBP have published strategic plans, but details on implementation are lacking. The absence of a comprehensive operational strategy and clear metrics for measuring border security has led to disagreements. The Secure Our Borders First Act of 2015 aims to establish new requirements for border strategy and metrics, including gaining situational awareness and operational control over both the southern and northern borders. H.R. 399 aims to establish a Border Security Verification Commission to certify DHS's operational control of the border. The bill requires the Secretary to submit an operational plan with various components, including assessing border security threats, staffing requirements, research objectives, and technology deployment impediments. Metrics for each border zone must be developed within 120 days of enactment. The Border Security Verification Commission established by H.R. 399 aims to certify DHS's operational control of the border. Metrics for each border zone must be developed within 120 days of enactment, as specified by various bills such as S. 1864, S. 2943, and S. 2976. H.R. 3586 would establish border security joint task forces and require the Secretary of Homeland Security to submit a maritime plan to Congress. H.R. 3586 requires the Secretary of Homeland Security to submit a maritime operations coordination plan to Congress, prevent unauthorized migrants from obtaining Transportation Worker Identification Credentials, and conduct a cost-benefit analysis of co-locating aviation and maritime assets. Additionally, CBP's Office of Air and Marine Operations must use a risk-based assessment for asset deployment. The Northern Border Security Review Act (H.R. 455) and Southwest Security Threat Assessment Act of 2016 (H.R. 4482) require threat analyses for the northern and southwest borders respectively. These analyses could serve as a basis for future planning despite not directly addressing strategy and metrics. The United States has significantly increased border enforcement resources over the past three decades, especially since 2001. The bill H.R. 399 involves CBP maintaining a minimum number of personnel and allows for the transfer of agents to high-traffic areas with incentive bonuses. The Border Jobs for Veterans Act of 2015 directs the expedited hiring of qualified veterans as CBP officers and enhances recruitment of separating Armed Forces members. H.R. 399 requires infrastructure, technology, and equipment to achieve border control, including deploying technology, erecting fencing, completing road construction, and building forward-operating bases in specified border patrol sectors within specific timeframes. The FAST Act authorizes appropriations for surface transportation infrastructure and planning. The FAST Act allows states to designate up to 5% of their Surface Transportation Block Grant funds for border infrastructure projects. The Border Security Technology Accountability Act of 2015 addresses cost-related issues associated with border technology acquisition programs. The Senate bill S. 1873 and the Cross-Border Trade Enhancement Act of 2015 (S. 461) allow CBP commissioner to enter cost-sharing agreements for services at ports of entry. The PREPARE Act (H.R. 3583) adds language to the Homeland Security Act of 2002 for preparing and responding to emergencies. The House-passed Act (H.R. 3583) would establish FEMA's Operation Stonegarden Grant Program (OPSG) under the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to enhance border security cooperation. CBP has had preclearance operations since 1952, allowing inspections on foreign soil before boarding direct flights to the U.S. Congress has restricted funds for new CBP preclearance operations since FY2014. The Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act of 2015 (P.L. 114-125) allows the Secretary of Homeland Security to establish CBP preclearance operations in foreign countries to prevent security threats. The Secretary must notify congressional committees 60 days before entering into a preclearance agreement and provide assessments and certifications. The Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act of 2015 (P.L. 114-125) requires the CBP commissioner to submit a plan to reduce processing times at domestic POEs if reassignment of CBP officers to preclearance operations causes delays. Failure to submit the plan within 60 days halts preclearance operations expansion. The Act also mandates passenger rescreening from foreign airports with preclearance operations. The Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 requires DHS to maintain a biometric entry-exit system for aliens entering and departing the United States. The Office of Biometric Identity Management collects and stores this data and provides entry-exit information to other components. H.R. 399 proposes implementing a biometric exit data system for visitors entering and leaving the United States. The bill includes a six-month pilot program to test the system before full implementation, with staggered deadlines outlined for completion. The Asylum Reform and Border Protection Act of 2015 (H.R. 1153) aims to improve the expedited removal process for aliens lacking proper documentation or committing fraud. It requires quality control procedures for screening questions and recording interviews uniformly. Sworn statements should be accompanied by interview recordings as evidence. H.R. 1153 aims to improve the expedited removal process for aliens by requiring quality control procedures for interviews and recordings as evidence. It also mandates the use of competent interpreters not affiliated with the asylum seeker's home country. Additionally, there are concerns about DHS access to public lands for law enforcement purposes. Legislation in the 114th Congress aims to give DHS more access to public lands for border security activities, with bills like S. 750 and H.R. 399 proposing broader authority for CBP personnel on federal lands within 100 miles of the borders with Mexico and Canada. Federal agencies must review the impact of proposed projects on natural and cultural resources before committing resources. Environmental review requirements may delay border infrastructure construction, but DHS has authority to waive legal requirements. H.R. 399 would exempt specific laws for CBP border construction projects on federal lands within 100 miles of U.S. borders. The INA establishes rules for foreign nationals' admission, presence, and departure, as well as an enforcement regime for immigration violations. The INA establishes an enforcement regime to deter violations of federal immigration law, with penalties including civil monetary fines, criminal fines, and imprisonment. ICE is responsible for immigration enforcement in the US. H.R. 1148 would modify enforcement provisions for individuals found within the US. H.R. 1148 would modify enforcement provisions for individuals found within the United States, including changes to existing immigration-related criminal offenses such as passport and immigration document fraud. Other bills with similar provisions in the 114th Congress include H.R. 1153, H.R. 3009, and S. 1635. H.R. 1148 and S. 2146 aim to increase penalties for unlawful entry and reentry of aliens, including making unlawful presence a criminal offense. The bills would also expand the scope of the statutes to cover illegal border crossings, regardless of surveillance by immigration authorities. The INA provides grounds for alien inadmissibility and deportability, including criminal activities and threats to U.S. security. H.R. 1148 and H.R. 1153 propose new grounds for inadmissibility and deportability, such as fraud-related offenses. H.R. 1148 includes provisions to make aliens involved in fraud-related offenses or criminal street gangs inadmissible or deportable. It also expands grounds of inadmissibility to cover crimes like domestic violence, child abuse, stalking, and violation of protection orders. The bill amends the definition of aggravated felony to include unlawful entry, presence, reentry, DUI convictions, and additional firearms offenses. H.R. 1148 and H.R. 1153 propose amendments to the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) to broaden grounds of inadmissibility for criminal aliens, including those involved in fraud, domestic violence, and child abuse. Additionally, S. 1635 aims to amend inadmissibility-related provisions, particularly regarding child abduction, regardless of the child's location. The ground of inadmissibility does not apply if the child is in a country party to the Hague Convention on International Child Abduction. Section 402 of S. 1635 would amend INA Section 214(b) to eliminate exceptions for certain nonimmigrant visas, making the presumption of immigrant intent apply to all prospective nonimmigrants. These changes were not included in the House Committee's report on S. 1635. H.R. 1148 aims to enhance immigration authorities' ability to detain aliens identified for removal, particularly those involved in criminal activity or deemed a threat to the community. It includes provisions for mandatory detention of unlawfully present aliens convicted of DUI offenses and those involved with criminal street gangs. H.R. 1153 aims to increase the number of immigration judges to address the backlog of cases in immigration courts. ICE has the resources to remove approximately 400,000 foreign nationals a year, but there are over 450,000 cases pending. The bill would require an increase of at least 50 immigration judges each year from FY2015 through FY2017, subject to appropriations. H.R. 1148 and H.R. 1153 aim to increase the number of immigration judges and ICE attorneys to address the backlog of cases in immigration courts. H.R. 1148 would require an increase of 60 ICE trial attorneys, deportation officers, and support staff, while H.R. 1153 would require an increase of at least 60 trial attorneys each year from FY2015 through FY2017. The Obama Administration has issued guidance on prosecutorial discretion in immigration enforcement activities. The Obama Administration issued guidance on prosecutorial discretion in immigration enforcement in November 2014. Due to limited resources, DHS must prioritize enforcement efforts. Critics argue that deferred action initiatives are an abdication of statutory responsibilities. The Obama Administration implemented initiatives like DACA and DAPA to provide temporary relief to certain qualifying aliens, sparking debate on the legality of granting deferred action and work authorization to unlawfully present individuals. The Obama Administration implemented DACA and DAPA to provide relief to certain qualifying aliens. Legal challenges have prevented the implementation of DAPA and DACA expansion. H.R. 1148 aims to restrict prosecutorial discretion and enforce federal immigration law. The bill H.R. 1148 aims to restrict DHS from using funds to implement select guidances on prosecutorial discretion issued since 2011, including DAPA and intended DACA expansion. It also prohibits federal funds from being used for new or previously adjudicated DACA applications. Additionally, the DHS Appropriations Act, 2016 includes a provision to prevent funding for DACA and DAPA expansion while the preliminary injunction in Texas v. United States is in effect. ICE implemented the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) in 2003 after the 9/11 attacks. H.R. 1148 proposes changes to SEVP and SEVIS, including new accreditation requirements for schools accepting foreign students and background checks for SEVIS users. The bill aims to expedite the process of revoking a school's certification. The bill aims to make changes to the law to accelerate the process of withdrawing a school's certification to prevent problematic institutions from accepting foreign students. It also includes increasing penalties for fraud related to visa documents and prohibiting individuals convicted of such fraud from holding positions of authority at schools that accept foreign students. The role of states and localities in enforcing federal immigration law has been a topic of interest, with some seeking independent enforcement and penalties for facilitating unauthorized aliens, while others have proscribed certain activities. The Supreme Court's decision in Arizona v. United States limited states and localities' ability to enforce federal immigration law and impose criminal sanctions on activities that facilitate unauthorized immigration. States generally cannot arrest aliens based on immigration-related activities. H.R. 1148 aims to override aspects of the Supreme Court's ruling in Arizona v. United States by providing states and localities with express statutory authorization to engage in immigration enforcement activities, including arresting and transferring removable aliens to federal authorities and imposing their own criminal penalties for violations of federal immigration law. The bill also includes provisions for greater information sharing among federal, state, and local authorities for immigration purposes. The proposed legislation would require increased information sharing between federal, state, and local authorities for immigration enforcement purposes. It would also allow states and localities to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement through written agreements. Additionally, certain federal funding for states and localities would be conditioned on their cooperation with enforcing federal immigration law. Employers must comply with employment eligibility verification laws under Section 274A of the INA, which prohibits hiring unauthorized aliens. ICE enforces worksite enforcement, and violators may face penalties. Employers use the I-9 system to verify new hires' identity and work eligibility. Employers must comply with employment eligibility verification laws under Section 274A of the INA, which prohibits hiring unauthorized aliens. They may also choose to participate in the E-Verify system, administered by DHS's USCIS. E-Verify electronically verifies new hires' employment authorization through databases. The program is authorized through September 30, 2016, with potential for permanent authorization under the Legal Workforce Act (H.R. 1147) in the 114th Congress. The new electronic verification system proposed in H.R. 1147 would be mandatory for all employers in cases of hiring, recruitment, and referral. Verification requirements would be phased in by employer size, with the largest employers required to participate six months after enactment and the smallest employers required to participate two years after enactment. Mandatory reverification of workers with temporary work authorization would also be phased in on the same schedule. H.R. 1147 proposes a new electronic verification system that would be mandatory for all employers in hiring, recruitment, and referral. The verification requirements would be phased in by employer size, with the largest employers required to participate six months after enactment and the smallest employers two years after enactment. Special provisions for agriculture workers would exempt them from certain verification requirements until two years after enactment. Additionally, employers could conduct electronic verification after making a job offer but before hiring, and verification of previously hired individuals would be mandatory in some cases. H.R. 1147 proposes a new electronic verification system for all employers, with phased implementation based on employer size. It would increase penalties for unauthorized employment violations and allow for blocking of social security numbers in cases of misuse. Individuals could limit the use of their information for verification purposes, and the bill would preempt any conflicting state or local laws. H.R. 1147 proposes preempting state or local laws related to employment eligibility of unauthorized aliens. It allows penalties for non-compliance and establishes an office for complaints. The bill also includes an Identity Authentication Employment Eligibility Pilot Program. The focus on U.S. visa issuance and national security screening procedures by the Department of State (DOS) and DHS is crucial for admitting foreign nationals to the United States. Consular officers use the Consular Consolidated Database (CCD) to screen visa applicants for various grounds of inadmissibility, including health, criminal history, security concerns, public charge, and previous immigration offenses. The Consular Consolidated Database (CCD) automates visa applications, storing records since the mid-1990s. It includes photos and 10-finger scans of applicants, links to security databases, and contains comments by consular officers. The Visa Integrity and Security Act of 2016 (H.R. 5203) imposes new requirements on visa applications, such as mandatory signatures and completion of all documents. The Visa Integrity and Security Act of 2016 requires complete visa applications in English, background checks including social media review, and a higher burden of proof for foreign nationals applying for visas. The Strong Visa Integrity Secures America Act focuses on reviewing social media accounts of visa applicants from high-risk countries. H.R. 5203 proposes changing visa application requirements to include DNA testing for biological relationships and Security Advisory Opinions for applicants from specified countries. DHS and DOS share responsibilities for visa issuance. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 addressed visa issuances, with ongoing debate on which agency should lead. H.R. 1148 proposes giving the Secretary of Homeland Security exclusive authority over visa regulations and sharing information with foreign governments for immigration purposes. H.R. 1148 proposes narrowing the Department of State's authority to waive personal interviews for visa applicants, adding national security concerns as a reason for interviews. It also gives consular officers the authority to refuse interviews for ineligible visa applicants and grants the Department of Homeland Security the power to refuse or revoke visas based on national interest. The Visa Security Program (VSP) operated by ICE Office of International Affairs sends special agents to high-risk consular posts to screen visa applicants for security risks. Despite some shortcomings identified by the U.S. Government Accountability Office in 2011, the VSP provides law enforcement resources not available to consular officers. The Visa Security Program (VSP) operated by ICE Office of International Affairs sends special agents to high-risk consular posts to screen visa applicants for security risks. GAO identified shortcomings in the VSP, including the failure to expand to key high-risk posts as planned. Legislation such as H.R. 1148 aims to expand the VSP by requiring onsite reviews of visa applications at designated high-risk posts and expedited placement of DHS personnel overseas. H.R. 4780 requires DHS to submit a comprehensive three-year strategy for international programs within 180 days of enactment. H.R. 5203 and H.R. 5253 aim to enhance the Visa Security Program by assigning DHS employees to visa-issuing posts and screening applicants for security risks. The bills also authorize additional fees on passports and visa applications to support the program. The bill H.R. 5253 aims to enhance the Visa Security Program by assigning DHS employees to posts for visa security duties and establishing a Visa Security Advisory Opinion Unit within ICE. It also ensures that foreign nationals seeking refugee status or asylum are not returned to countries where their life or freedom is threatened. Foreign nationals seeking asylum in the United States can apply with USCIS or seek asylum before an EOIR immigration judge. If a foreign national lacks proper documents or commits fraud, they may be placed in expedited removal, but can express a fear of persecution to seek asylum. H.R. 1153 would amend asylum procedures by adding a new requirement to the definition of \"credible fear of persecution.\" USCIS officers would need to determine if an alien has a credible fear of persecution to be considered for asylum, instead of being subject to expedited removal. H.R. 1153 would amend asylum procedures by requiring USCIS officers to determine if an alien could establish eligibility for asylum and if their statements are true. It would also amend INA Section 101(a)(42) and establish new grounds for terminating refugee or asylee status. H.R. 1153 would amend asylum procedures by requiring USCIS officers to determine eligibility for asylum and establish new grounds for terminating refugee or asylee status, including for individuals returning to their home country without a compelling reason. The American SAFE Act of 2015 places additional requirements on the admission of refugees from Iraq or Syria. H.R. 4731, reported by the House Judiciary Committee, aims to limit the President's authority to admit and resettle refugees in the U.S. It proposes an annual refugee ceiling of 60,000, allows states to block refugee resettlement, and includes provisions for adjusting refugee status and conducting background checks. The \"Lautenberg amendment\" allows for easier proof of refugee status for certain groups, with provisions for adjustment to LPR status. The \"Specter amendment\" added Iranian religious minorities to qualify for refugee status. The Lautenberg Amendment has been regularly extended over the years. The Lautenberg amendment, regularly extended over the years, is now in effect through September 30, 2016. Unaccompanied alien children are defined as children under 18 without lawful immigration status and without a parent or legal guardian in the US. UAC apprehensions peaked at 68,500 in FY2014, declined to 39,970 in FY2015, and numbered 42,591 in the first nine months of FY2016. In FY2016, there were 42,591 UAC apprehensions, a 62% increase from FY2015 but a 25% decline from FY2014. Congress is considering legislation to redefine UAC and modify how unaccompanied children are handled. H.R. 1153 and H.R. 1149 aim to amend current laws regarding UAC asylum seekers, treating them similarly to adult asylum seekers and changing USCIS jurisdiction. The bill H.R. 1149 aims to amend current laws regarding unaccompanied children from noncontiguous countries, requiring immediate return if certain criteria are met. It also allows the Secretary of State to negotiate repatriation agreements with foreign countries. The bill mandates screening for all unaccompanied children, placing those not at risk of trafficking or asylum claims in removal proceedings. The bill H.R. 1149 would amend laws for unaccompanied children from noncontiguous countries, requiring immediate return if specific criteria are met. It mandates screening for all unaccompanied children, placing those not at risk of trafficking or asylum claims in removal proceedings. The bill also requires HHS to provide identifying information about the individual an unaccompanied child will be placed with, and DHS to investigate their immigration status. If the individual is unlawfully present, DHS must initiate removal proceedings within 30 days. H.R. 1153 would amend parole provisions in the INA to limit the DHS Secretary's authority to grant parole based on humanitarian or public interest reasons. It would also prohibit parole for aliens found ineligible for refugee status. The Afghan special immigrant program, established by P.L. 111-8, grants lawful permanent resident status to Afghan nationals who have worked for the U.S. government or ISAF in Afghanistan for at least one year, provided valuable service, and face ongoing serious threats. Initially capped at 1,500 principal aliens annually from FY2009 to FY2013, the program was amended by laws passed by the 113th Congress to provide additional visas through FY2016. The Afghan special immigrant program, established by P.L. 111-8, grants lawful permanent resident status to Afghan nationals who have worked for the U.S. government or ISAF in Afghanistan for at least one year, provided valuable service, and face ongoing serious threats. Laws passed by the 113th Congress provided for additional visas through FY2016, with the latest enactment (P.L. 113-291) increasing the number of special immigrant visas available and extending the application deadline. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016 (P.L. 114-92, \u00a71216) further amends the program by increasing the number of additional special immigrant visas available and extending the employment period and application deadline. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 extends the employment period and application deadline for the Afghan special immigrant visa program until December 31, 2017. Eligibility is limited to Afghans employed in Afghanistan to serve as interpreters, translators, or to perform sensitive activities for U.S. military personnel. The Senate-passed version of the bill does not include any provisions on the Afghan special immigrant visa program. The Senate-passed version of S. 2943 does not address the Afghan special immigrant visa program. The Visa Waiver Program allows nationals from certain countries to enter the U.S. without a visa, provided they meet certain criteria and obtain approval through the ESTA system. Countries must offer reciprocal privileges to U.S. citizens, have a low nonimmigrant refusal rate, issue machine-readable passports with biometric identifiers, and develop a program for tamper-resistant visa documents with biometric identifiers to qualify for the VWP. The Visa Waiver Program Improvement and Terrorist Travel Prevention Act of 2015 (H.R. 158) enacted changes to the VWP, including prohibiting travel under the program for individuals present in certain countries since March 1, 2011. These countries include Iraq and Syria, as well as those designated as supporting terrorism. The program requires tamper-resistant, machine-readable visa documents with biometric identifiers for entry into the U.S. The Visa Waiver Program Improvement and Terrorist Travel Prevention Act of 2015 prohibits travel under the program for individuals present in certain countries deemed as supporting terrorism. Dual nationals of VWP countries and specified countries are also ineligible. The Secretary of DHS can waive the restriction on a case-by-case basis. Foreign nationals traveling under the VWP must present an electronic passport. VWP countries must certify mechanisms to validate passports at each port of entry by October 1, 2016. The Visa Waiver Program Improvement and Terrorist Travel Prevention Act of 2015 requires program countries to screen foreign nationals using INTERPOL databases. The Secretary of DHS evaluates countries annually for high-risk nationals and can suspend a country if necessary. Changes to the ESTA system allow for shorter validity periods and collection of citizenship information. The Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2016 includes provisions related to the Visa Waiver Program (VWP), allowing Poland to be designated as a VWP country. H.R. 5253 requires the Commissioner of CBP to screen electronic passports at airports using biometric technology and continuously screen individuals issued visas or arriving in the United States. H.R. 5203 would require DHS to proactively screen immigration petitions for fraud and national security threats, similar to visa applications. USCIS must confirm eligibility for immigration status or reject applicants who do not meet legal requirements. H.R. 5203 would mandate that all immigrant or nonimmigrant petitions or applications must be signed by required parties, complete, and accompanied by English translations. Background checks and DNA testing for biological relationships would also be required. The H-2B visa program allows temporary admission of foreign workers for nonagricultural labor when U.S. workers are unavailable. The H-2B visa program is subject to an annual cap of 66,000 visas, which was reached in FY2014 and FY2015. Employers must accurately indicate the dates of need for H-2B workers in their applications. Staggered entry of workers based on a single date of need is generally not allowed, except for employers in the seafood industry. The H-2B visa program has an annual cap of 66,000 visas, which was reached in FY2014 and FY2015. Employers in the seafood industry have an entry prohibition, but can bring in H-2B workers between day 90 and day 120 with additional U.S. worker recruitment. The FY2016 Consolidated Appropriations Act extends the H-2B seafood industry staggered entry exception and exempts certain returning H-2B workers from the cap. The FY2016 Consolidated Appropriations Act extends the H-2B seafood industry staggered entry exception and exempts certain returning H-2B workers from the cap. The Senate FY2017 LHHS appropriations bill would also extend the staggered entry exception and includes provisions on prevailing wage determinations. The House FY2017 LHHS appropriations bill contains similar provisions. The House FY2017 Department of Homeland Security appropriations bill (H.R. 5634) extends the H-2B returning worker provision by exempting certain returning H-2B workers from the cap. H.R. 1148 includes language amending statutory provisions on naturalization, such as barring aliens involved in terrorism. The bill on naturalization would bar aliens involved in terrorism or crime-related activities from meeting the good moral character requirement, clarify that the list of disqualifying conduct is not exhaustive, restrict naturalization for aliens with security-related issues, and limit judicial review of delays and denials. The bill aims to denaturalize individuals involved in terrorism or supporting terrorism, receiving military training from terrorist organizations, or engaging in activities against the U.S. government. It also enhances immigration consequences for unlawfully obtaining citizenship. Additionally, it extends posthumous citizenship to qualified noncitizens who served in the U.S. Armed Forces during military hostilities, addressing exclusions for individuals who enlisted during World War II. The bill extends posthumous citizenship to qualified noncitizens who served in the U.S. Armed Forces during World War II in the Philippines. It also includes provisions for LPR investors coming to the United States through the EB-5 visa program to benefit the U.S. economy. The EB-5 visa program in the United States requires investors to develop a new commercial enterprise, invest $1 million ($500,000 in targeted areas), employ at least 10 people, and maintain the business and jobs for two years. The Regional Center Program, authorized in 1992, encourages investment in specific geographic regions to achieve economic activity and job creation goals. P.L. 114-113 reauthorizes the Regional Center Program through September 30, 2016, with the majority of EB-5 immigrant investors participating in this program. Special immigrants in the fourth preference category of the employment-based immigration system include ministers of religion and religious workers. The special immigrant religious worker program has been extended through September 30, 2016. Foreign medical graduates can enter the U.S. on J-1 nonimmigrant visas. Foreign medical graduates (FMGs) can enter the United States on J-1 nonimmigrant visas for medical education and training. They must return to their home countries for two years before applying for other visas or LPR status, unless granted a waiver. States can request waivers through the Conrad State Program, applicable to FMGs with J status before September 30, 2016. The provision increases fees for employers of L-1 and H-1B visa holders, with funds allocated to a 9-11 Response and Biometric Exit Account. It also establishes a biometric entry-exit system and allocates fees to intercountry adoption and general Treasury. The Adoptive Family Relief Act (P.L. 114-70) aims to assist American adoptive parents facing financial challenges with intercountry adoptions, particularly from the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The act waives immigrant visa fees for lawfully adopted children of U.S. citizens if they were unable to use the original visa due to extraordinary circumstances. The Adoptive Family Relief Act (P.L. 114-70) helps U.S. adoptive parents with intercountry adoptions, waiving immigrant visa fees for children facing extraordinary circumstances. President Obama's Immigration Accountability Executive Action aimed to revise immigration policies, with S. 534 and H.R. 1148 proposing to block funding for policy changes in certain memoranda. The policy changes were carried out in 11 memoranda issued in November 2014."
