    "content": "Credit for certain home purchases is allowed under section 25E of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The Internal Revenue Code allows a 10% tax credit for individuals purchasing a principal residence in the US within 12 months of enactment, capped at $10,000. No credit is given for homes bought with nonconforming loans exceeding certain limits. The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation has a limitation on the maximum original principal obligation of a mortgage that can be purchased. The tax credit allowed for any taxable year should not exceed the regular tax liability plus the tax imposed by section 55, minus the sum of other credits allowable for the year. This credit is one-time only for individuals. In the case of purchasing a principal residence, no credit is allowed for any other principal residence by the same individual or spouse. For joint purchases by multiple individuals, no credit is allowed if any individual has already claimed a credit for another principal residence. Unused credit can be carried forward. Unused credit for purchasing a principal residence can be carried forward to the succeeding taxable year if it exceeds the limitation imposed by the tax regulations. Unused credit for purchasing a principal residence can be carried forward to the next taxable year, subject to limitations. Married individuals filing separately have a lower dollar limit for the credit compared to other individuals. When unmarried individuals buy a principal residence, the credit allowed is allocated among them as prescribed by the Secretary, not exceeding $10,000 in total. The term 'principal residence' has the same meaning as in section 121, and 'purchase' refers to any acquisition not from a related person, with a specific basis. The term 'purchase price' refers to the adjusted basis of the principal residence on the date of purchase, regardless of the previous owner's adjusted basis or property acquired from a decedent. Additionally, a residence constructed by the taxpayer is considered purchased on the date of occupancy. The adjusted basis of the principal residence on the date of purchase is crucial for determining eligibility for certain tax credits. Related persons are defined in a way that prevents the disallowance of losses. Exceptions to the tax credit include situations where a credit for first-time homebuyers in the District of Columbia has already been claimed. The taxpayer's eligibility for a tax credit is determined by the adjusted basis of their principal residence at the time of purchase. Exceptions to the credit include being a nonresident alien, disposing of the residence before the end of the taxable year, or the residence no longer being the principal residence. Rules similar to section 1400C(f) apply for reporting requirements, and the basis of the residence is reduced by the amount of the credit allowed. This section does not apply after December 31, 2009. Conforming amendments include updating section 23(c)(1) of the Code. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to include sections 25D, 25E, and 1400C for tax credit eligibility based on the adjusted basis of the principal residence. Clerical amendments are made to the table of sections for subpart A of part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1. Section 25E provides a credit for certain home purchases, effective for residences bought after the enactment of the Act in taxable years ending after that date."
