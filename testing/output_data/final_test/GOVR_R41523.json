    "content": "The Small Business Administration (SBA) offers various programs to support small businesses, such as loan guaranty and contracting programs. Congressional interest in these programs has grown due to their potential to stimulate economic activity and create jobs. Research shows that business startups are key to job creation. Research suggests that business startups are important for job creation, but their impact on net job creation over time is limited due to high closure rates. Startups with fewer than 20 employees have a negligible effect, while those with 20-499 employees tend to have a positive employment effect. The Small Business Administration aims to promote business competition to prevent monopoly formation. The Small Business Administration (SBA) aims to prevent monopoly formation within industries by providing assistance to qualifying businesses. Congressional interest in job creation has led to a focus on targeting SBA assistance to small businesses most likely to create and retain jobs. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) has raised concerns about the limited information provided by the SBA's program performance measures, which primarily focus on output rather than outcomes for participating small businesses. This report examines the potential consequences of adding net job creation as a SBA program performance measure and the arguments for federal assistance to small businesses. Economists argue that federal assistance may reallocate jobs within the economy rather than increase them, but support it for correcting market failures. The assessment of employment dynamics in the United States is provided using the latest economic data from the U.S. Bureau of the Census. The U.S. Bureau of the Census provides economic data on small and large enterprises' number and employment. Job gains and losses are assessed by small and large establishments, including startups, using data from the U.S. Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics. Employment dynamics focus on decisions of establishments, firms, and enterprises. An enterprise engages in economic activities across multiple industries and may report under one or more EINs. Multiunit businesses are perceived to act as a whole entity rather than individual establishments, making unified decisions on hiring, plant closures, and layoffs. This supports the use of higher aggregation levels for understanding employment dynamics. In 2016, there were nearly 7.76 million employer establishments, over 24.81 million non-employer establishments, and over 5.95 million employer firms. The firm may act more like a set of individual establishments rather than a unified entity, impacting hiring decisions. In 2016, there were nearly 7.76 million employer establishments and over 5.95 million employer firms. Small employer enterprises provided almost half of all jobs. Opening/startup establishments accounted for 30% of employment gains each year. Small establishments contributed two-thirds of net employment gains annually. Large establishments with 500 or more employees have accounted for nearly 30% of all employment gains in the United States each year since 2011. Despite the prevailing belief that small businesses create the majority of new jobs, large establishments have played a significant role in job generation. Small businesses, on the other hand, have continued to contribute about two-thirds of net new jobs since 2010. Some researchers challenge the prevailing view that small businesses are responsible for most net job creation. Studies show varying roles of small businesses in job growth over different time periods. The importance of small businesses in creating new jobs may be overstated, as most new jobs are created by startups, which are typically small. Many startups are small due to challenges in obtaining resources for larger businesses. Studies show that a significant percentage of startups close within a few years, impacting job creation. Startups with fewer than 20 employees have a positive initial employment effect that diminishes over time, while those with 20-499 employees show increasing job growth after the first year, peaking at five years. The positive employment effect from larger small businesses increases after the first year, peaks at five years, and then stabilizes. These firms were able to boost productivity sooner due to their size and access to capital, challenging existing firms and enhancing competitiveness. The age of a business is more crucial than size in understanding employment dynamics, emphasizing the role of startups in U.S. employment growth. Young firms in the U.S. exhibit a dynamic of rapid growth but also high exit rates, leading to significant job creation and destruction. The age of a business is more important than size in understanding employment dynamics, with policies focusing on business age likely to be more successful. The study's authors found that young firms, defined as firms in their first two years of existence, have higher job creation and destruction rates than older firms, higher rates of net job creation, and exhibit significantly higher worker churning. Startups play a significant role in job creation, but their positive effect diminishes over time as most businesses start small, stay small, and close within a few years. Studies suggest that nearly all net job creation in the U.S. since 1980 has occurred in businesses less than five years old. The SBA may target resources to promote net job creation by focusing on small businesses less than five years old. Studies show startups account for most job creation in their early years, but their impact diminishes over time. Startups and continuing firms play a significant role in job creation. A study found that existing firms' expansions and contractions account for most job flows, with continuing firms creating 69% of net jobs from 1993 to mid-2008. Firm turnover contributes to 31% of net job creation. Young businesses (1-5 years old) are net job destroyers, but surviving firms balance out job losses from failed businesses. About half of all firms fail within their first five years. The study found that while many startups fail within five years, those that survive are vital for long-term job creation. In 2007, net job creation primarily came from startups, surviving young businesses (1-5 years old), and the oldest surviving businesses (over 28 years old). The study found a \"barbell effect\" in job creation, with most jobs coming from the youngest and oldest businesses. There was little net job creation from businesses between 6 and 28 years old. The authors suspected that job growth in the oldest businesses came from acquiring younger businesses that innovate. They also found a strong relationship between job growth in an industry and the performance of young businesses within that industry. The performance of young businesses is crucial for job creation, as they are responsible for the majority of net job creation in the economy. Studies using Census Bureau data from different time periods consistently show that young firms create more jobs than older firms, even during economic downturns. The finding that young companies are the engines of job creation contradicts the idea that businesses between one to five years old are net job destroyers. The explanation lies in how studies treat the role of startups in job creation. Excluding startup job creation suggests older businesses play a larger role, while including it shows younger businesses have a bigger impact. High-impact businesses, also known as gazelles, play a significant role in job creation, with sales doubling over four years and employment growth quantifier of two or more. Younger and much older businesses contribute more to net job creation than businesses between 6 to 28 years old. This contradicts the notion that businesses between one to five years old are net job destroyers. High-impact businesses, accounting for a small percentage of all businesses, are responsible for almost all job creation in the economy. A study from 1994 to 2006 showed that these businesses, of varying sizes, drove nearly all employment growth, with businesses under 20 employees leading in both numbers and job growth. High-impact businesses, accounting for a small percentage of all businesses, drove almost all job creation in the economy from 1994 to 2006. They were found in all regions, tended to be in metropolitan areas, and existed in various industries. These businesses were smaller and younger on average, with the typical high-impact business operating for about 25 years. The study's authors suggested that economies with diverse industries grow faster than specialized ones, advocating for policies that encourage diversity over targeting specific industries. A follow-up study on high-impact businesses in the United States from 2004-2008 found that these businesses, representing 6.3% of all firms, accounted for nearly all net job creation. They were diverse in size, region, and industry, with 85% located in urban areas. These businesses were also younger on average compared to other businesses. The study on high-impact businesses in the United States from 2004-2008 found that they were more productive and had a proportionate number of women-owned businesses compared to non-high-impact businesses. High-impact businesses across different size categories had been in business for fewer years on average than other businesses in the same size category. A 2013 study by the Kauffman Foundation found that new businesses in STEM industries are driving job creation and are becoming more geographically dispersed. Most nascent entrepreneurs are not focused on high-growth businesses but rather on providing existing services to existing customers. In contrast, entrepreneurs in high-technology industries are more focused on creating new services and expanding their customer base. The study found that entrepreneurs in high-technology industries, such as computer equipment, communications, and pharmaceuticals, are more growth-oriented and have experienced rapid employment growth. Despite downturns like the dot-com bust and the Great Recession, young firms in these industries have provided net job creation rates more than twice that of businesses across the economy. The author's analysis highlights the importance of startups in job creation, noting that while startups with fewer than 20 employees have a limited impact on net job creation over time, those with 20-499 employees have a positive employment effect that continues to increase for five years before decreasing. The next few years of data releases will provide critical insights into economic dynamism and entrepreneurship in the United States. The study suggests that startups with 20-499 employees have a positive employment effect that increases for five years before decreasing. This finding emphasizes the importance of considering the size of startups in SBA program performance and job creation. Additionally, research shows that net job creation is driven by startups, younger small businesses, and high-impact businesses. The Small Business Act of 1953 authorized the SBA, emphasizing the importance of small businesses in maintaining the free enterprise system. Current economic research does not definitively identify businesses that contribute most to net job creation, but suggests that startups with at least 20 employees and surviving younger businesses play a significant role. However, criteria to predict high-impact businesses are still lacking. The American economic system relies on free competition to ensure opportunities for personal initiative and growth. The government aims to support small businesses to maintain a fair and competitive marketplace. The Small Business Act aimed to deter monopoly formation and promote business competition within various industries. The Act did not mention job creation, but the SBA's second Administrator testified that part of its mission was to provide credit to small businesses to enable them to create additional employment. The Small Business Act aimed to promote business competition and deter monopoly formation. The SBA's mission includes providing credit to small businesses to support job creation. Small businesses face challenges in accessing credit due to factors like limited credit history and innovative products. Credit rationing in the lending market affects small businesses more, as lenders struggle to assess their risk. Federal assistance is advocated for minority, women, and immigrant-owned businesses due to barriers in accessing capital and credit. Small business owners face challenges in accessing capital and credit, especially minority, women, and immigrant-owned businesses. Lenders perceive operating in low-income communities as risky for loan repayment. The SBA emphasizes the importance of credit access for economic recovery and job creation, although economists argue that federal assistance may only reallocate jobs within the economy. The size of the labor force depends on population, demographics, and factors affecting home vs market production. Increased federal spending may create short-term jobs. SBA reported that small business funding from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 created or retained 785,955 jobs. Assistance is available to US-based for-profit small businesses meeting SBA size requirements. The SBA's program performance measures focus on output rather than outcomes, hindering assessment of its impact on small businesses. GAO recommends outcome-based measures to evaluate success in helping small businesses succeed. The government loan programs use performance benchmarks as assessment tools for economic growth and job creation. The SBA is required to use outcome-based measures for some programs, such as creating or retaining jobs based on project debenture amounts. The SBA requires job creation or retention based on project debenture amounts. The agency also reports job creation data and commissions studies on small businesses' contributions to the economy. Using net job creation as a performance measure could enhance congressional oversight. The SBA could enhance congressional oversight by providing information on the nature of jobs created by its programs, which could help Congress compare programs and make funding decisions. However, implementing net job creation as a performance measure poses challenges such as counting part-time and seasonal workers, tracking employment levels, and verifying data. Economists may argue that using net job creation as a criteria is inappropriate. Using net job creation as a performance measure for SBA programs may not be appropriate as it reallocates jobs within the economy. Some small businesses are concerned that this measure could result in receiving less assistance. However, incorporating net job creation into SBA assistance targeting could align with congressional efforts to promote job growth, a top priority for recent Congresses. There is debate on whether subsidizing small businesses that create the most jobs is the most effective way to stimulate job growth. The Small Business Administration (SBA) may need to update its criteria periodically to account for changes in the economy. Using net job creation as a factor in allocating SBA assistance is debated due to the lack of consensus on criteria. Economists may oppose this approach as economic theory suggests it may not be the most effective means of promoting job growth. The Small Business Administration (SBA) debates using net job creation as a performance measure for its programs. Some small businesses are concerned it may reduce assistance they receive. The SBA already considers net job creation to some extent in its loan guaranty programs by subjecting lenders to losses on defaulted loans. The SBA's lending process aims to have a positive effect on net job creation by weeding out firms likely to have a negative impact. However, SBA borrowers may be at greater risk of failing and less likely to create jobs. The SBIC program indirectly considers net job creation by guaranteeing debentures sold to investors. The SBIC program invests revenue from debenture sales in small businesses, considering factors like economic growth potential. Unlike SBA loan guaranty programs, SBIC does not require certification of credit unavailability. SBIC is smaller than SBA's loan programs, with a focus on job creation. The Small Business Administration (SBA) does not prioritize net job creation in allocating resources, as its loan programs represent a small share of capital accessed by small businesses. Research shows that while startups are crucial for job creation, many close within a few years, indicating a limited long-term impact on net job creation. It is argued that focusing on broader economic policies may be more effective for promoting job creation than relying solely on SBA assistance. The economic research suggests that startups with 20-499 employees have a positive employment effect that continues to increase for five years before decreasing. This finding implies that the size of startups should be considered when providing assistance. Net job creation is concentrated among younger, smaller \"high-impact\" businesses that have been in operation for around 25 years. Recent economic research indicates that startups, young small businesses, and surviving high-impact businesses are significant contributors to net job creation. The research suggests that small business startups with at least 20 employees and surviving younger businesses play a crucial role in job creation. However, there are no definitive criteria yet to predict which businesses are most likely to contribute to net job creation. The literature lacks criteria to predict which surviving younger businesses will become high-impact firms. There is a debate on whether the SBA should use net job creation as a program performance measure."
