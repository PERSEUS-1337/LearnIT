    "content": "The State of California enacts the following. The State of California enacts Section 44258.6 of the Health and Safety Code, requiring the development of a program to promote zero-emission and near-zero-emission vehicle deployment by January 1, 2019. The program includes incentives for employers and low-income individuals to purchase or lease such vehicles. The State of California enacts a program to promote zero-emission and near-zero-emission vehicle deployment, including onroad incentives such as grants, loans, and other measures. Moneys from specific funds will be available for the program, and an annual report on its efficacy will be submitted to the Legislature. Section 6012.4 of the Revenue and Taxation Code exempts a portion of the cost of near-zero or zero-emission vehicles purchased by low-income individuals from gross receipts and sales price calculations. Low-income purchasers are defined as those with household incomes below 80% of the county's median income. A near-zero-emission vehicle uses technologies that reduce pollutants and greenhouse gases, as defined by the State Air Resources Board. A zero-emission vehicle produces no emissions when stationary or operating, as determined by the State Air Resources Board. Section 17060.3 of the Revenue and Taxation Code allows a credit of $2,500 against the \"net tax\" for qualified taxpayers from 2017 to 2026. This exemption does not apply to taxes levied by counties, cities, or districts under certain laws. Qualified taxpayers who purchased a near-zero or zero-emission vehicle during the taxable year are eligible for a $2,500 credit under Section 17060.3 of the Revenue and Taxation Code. Near-zero-emission vehicles utilize technologies that reduce pollutants and greenhouse gas emissions, as defined by the State Air Resources Board. A zero-emission vehicle produces no emissions of pollutants or greenhouse gases, as defined by the State Air Resources Board. Excess tax credit can be carried over for up to six years or refunded by the Legislature. Taxpayers must elect to claim the credit instead of a deduction. Section 17072 of the Revenue and Taxation Code is amended to apply certain sections of the Internal Revenue Code for taxable years between 2017 and 2026. A new section, 17206.3, is added to allow deductions for adjusted gross income. This section will be in effect until December 1, 2026. Section 17206.3 of the Revenue and Taxation Code allows a deduction of $2,500 for qualified taxpayers who purchased a near-zero or zero-emission vehicle between 2017 and 2026. A qualified taxpayer is defined as an individual meeting income eligibility requirements set by the State Air Resources Board. A near-zero-emission vehicle utilizes technologies that reduce pollutants and greenhouse gas emissions, as defined by the State Air Resources Board. A zero-emission vehicle produces no emissions when stationary or operating. Qualified taxpayers can claim a deduction instead of a credit for purchasing these vehicles. The section will be in effect until December 1, 2026, and then repealed. The Franchise Tax Board will provide annual reports to the Legislature on the effectiveness of certain Revenue and Taxation Code sections. The Legislature acknowledges the importance of reducing pollutants and greenhouse gas emissions through near-zero and zero-emission vehicles. The Legislature recognizes that advanced-technology light-duty vehicles face barriers such as higher costs, the need for new infrastructure, and a lack of consumer information on benefits and incentives. The state is leading programs to support plug-in electric and fuel-cell vehicles in disadvantaged communities, but long-term plans should also focus on new and used car sales in these areas. A new chapter is added to the Health and Safety Code for Advanced-Technology Light-Duty Vehicles. The state is implementing a program to promote advanced-technology light-duty vehicles to increase their use and meet established goals. The program includes long-term market signals, sustainable funding mechanisms, and a portfolio of approaches. The program established may include long-term market signals, sustainable funding mechanisms, and various incentives for low-income deployment in disadvantaged communities. These incentives can range from on-road incentives to consumer tax incentives."
