    "content": "Peru's turbulent political history dates back to the Spanish conquest, leading to economic, ethnic, and geographic divisions. Since independence in 1821, Peru has had 13 constitutions and struggled with democratic transitions. The transition to democracy in 1980 was followed by economic crisis and the fight against the Shining Path insurgency. President Alan Garc\u00eda's first term was marked by challenges and criticism. In 1990, Peru elected Alberto Fujimori as an independent candidate, praised for economic reforms and counterinsurgency efforts. However, he became increasingly autocratic, dissolved the legislature, and engaged in military tactics against the Shining Path, leading to human rights violations. Reelected in 2000, his government collapsed due to electoral fraud and corruption, resulting in his fleeing the country and later being convicted and sentenced to 25 years in prison in 2009. Former President Fujimori was convicted in 2009 for \"crimes against humanity\" and sentenced to 25 years in prison. Peru saw political stability, economic growth, and poverty reduction under President Paniagua and President Toledo. Alan Garc\u00eda won the presidential race in 2006 after softening his populist rhetoric. In the 2006 presidential race, Alan Garc\u00eda won against Ollanta Humala, who had nationalist and anti-globalization policies. Garc\u00eda maintained orthodox macro-economic policies, leading to economic growth but also popular protests over social conditions and resource exploitation. Humala later won the presidency in 2011, adopting a more center-leftist approach. Ollanta Humala won the presidency in 2011, defeating Keiko Fujimori. He promised to maintain free-market policies while addressing economic inequality and social exclusion. Humala aimed to reduce poverty from 30% to 15% by the end of his term in 2016. By the end of 2012, the poverty rate had dropped to 26%. His cabinet initially included a diverse range of political ideologies. After winning the presidency in 2011, Ollanta Humala implemented a more centrist approach by reshuffling his cabinet and negotiating with the mining sector to increase royalties. The Peruvian Congress passed the bill in January 2012, providing an additional US$1 billion annually for social inclusion programs and infrastructure projects. President Humala committed to reducing social conflicts and implementing social inclusion programs and infrastructure projects. He signed a prior consultation law requiring companies to consult with indigenous communities, aligning Peru with international standards. Peru ratified the International Labor Organization's Convention on Indigenous Peoples in 1993, requiring companies to consult indigenous groups before exploiting natural resources in their ancestral territories. Regulations were implemented in April 2012, with no prior consultations conducted by May 2013. The Humala administration established an office of conflict prevention and reported on 15 mining conflicts under state prevention measures. However, tensions persist due to the law not granting local communities veto power over investments or requiring consultation for government coca eradication efforts. Tensions persist in Peru over government coca eradication efforts and conflicts related to land use issues. Businesses fear bureaucratic obstacles from new consultation processes. Despite government efforts to increase dialogue, major conflicts continue, particularly in regions like Cajamarca and Madre de Dios. Protests against mining and illegal mining activities have led to violence, pollution, and deforestation in the Amazon rainforest. The government has imposed stricter penalties for illegal mining, but the situation remains challenging. The government in Peru imposed stricter penalties for illegal mining in February 2012, resulting in the removal of thousands of miners. The ombudsman reported 84 new conflicts in 2012, with 24 deaths and 649 injuries. As of April 2013, there were 229 cases of social conflict, with 76% of them active, mostly related to mining activities. Tensions between indigenous groups and businesses have caused conflicts within the government. The Energy and Mines Ministry in Peru proposed amending the Prior Consultation law to exclude Quechua and Aymara-speaking groups, affecting indigenous populations in the highlands where most mining and social conflicts occur. The deputy minister of intercultural affairs resigned in protest, citing delays in publishing the Official Database of Indigenous Peoples. The Humala administration allowed 14 mining projects to proceed without consulting indigenous communities. The Peruvian government allowed mining projects to proceed without consulting indigenous communities, arguing it was necessary to speed up investment approval. However, the Human Rights Ombudsman insists that communities should be consulted before projects advance further. Social divisions over development approaches continue to challenge political stability, with some advocating for leftist policies like nationalization, while others, including the business sector and wealthy elite, resist radical changes. The Humala administration faces resistance from various sectors, including a strong business sector, a conservative wealthy elite, and a divided Congress. Humala's weakening position in Congress is evident as he alienates leftist forces and loses support from his own party members. His weak alliance with the centrist Peru Posible party has dissolved, leaving him without a majority in key positions. In the midst of facing resistance from various sectors, including a strong business sector and a divided Congress, President Humala managed to push through reforms in his first year. However, his weakening position in Congress became evident as he alienated leftist forces and lost support from his own party members. Additionally, a potentially destabilizing element arose when former President Fujimori's family petitioned for his release from prison on humanitarian grounds due to mouth cancer, despite his conviction for crimes against humanity. Human Rights Watch opposes granting Fujimori amnesty, citing it as incompatible with Peru's international obligations. Some are opposed to former President Fujimori's release on humanitarian grounds due to mouth cancer, fearing social unrest and increased influence. A Mercy Commission is reviewing the case and will make recommendations to President Humala, who will ultimately decide on the pardon. Possible contenders are already positioning themselves for the 2016 presidential elections, as Humala is constitutionally barred from running for reelection. Former presidents Alan Garcia and Alejandro Toledo are expected to run for the 2016 presidential elections despite being under investigation for corruption. The Humala administration denies using government intelligence operations to discredit opponents. Humala's wife, Nadine Heredia, is influential but constitutionally barred from running for office. Nadine Heredia, influential but barred from running for office, may seek a way to run in the next elections through a possible deal between her party and Keiko Fujimori's party. Speculation persists despite government denials. Keiko Fujimori is also likely to run for president in 2016. Peru's economy has been strong compared to other Latin American countries since 2001. Peru's economy grew by 8.8% from 2001 to 2008, slowed to 0.9% during the 2008-2009 global financial crisis, but maintained positive growth. In 2011, the economy grew by 6.9%, with estimates of 6.3% GDP growth for 2012. Most growth is due to natural resource exports. President Humala has pursued free market policies, but recently considered a stronger state role in the economy. Peru is affiliated with various regional economic integration organizations, including Mercosur, CAN, UNASUR, and the Pacific Alliance. The Pacific Alliance, formed by Chile, Colombia, Mexico, and Peru, established the largest free trade zone in Latin America in 2013. These countries have free market economies and embrace globalization. The Pacific Alliance, consisting of Chile, Colombia, Mexico, and Peru, aims to promote regional economic integration through increased trade, economies of scale, and efficient value chains. They have merged stock markets and eliminated visa requirements among citizens. The Alliance also seeks to strengthen economic ties with Asia and has signed free trade agreements with key partners. Peru has trade agreements with the United States, Canada, Chile, China, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, and Thailand. It is an active member of APEC, hosting the summit in 2008. Peru also hosted the South American-Arab Countries Summit in 2012, where joint projects were discussed. Additionally, Peru signed a trade agreement with the Gulf Cooperation Council and a free trade agreement with the European Union in 2013. During his second term, Garc\u00eda continued Peru's orthodox economic policies, focusing on reducing the fiscal deficit. The U.S. State Department praised Peru's well-managed economy under Garc\u00eda, with improved tax collection and growth. President Humala also prioritized free-market policies while aiming to reduce poverty through wealth distribution. Peru's rapid economic growth has significantly decreased poverty rates since 2000. Peru's poverty rates have been decreasing since 2000, with extreme poverty falling from 24.1% in 2001 to 9.8% in 2010. Overall poverty decreased from 54.3% in 2001 to 25.8% in 2012. However, social unrest has been on the rise as many feel economic prosperity has not reached them. Disparities between rural and urban populations persist, with over 60% of some rural areas living in poverty. The income distribution gap is significant, with the top 20% earning 52.6% of the income while the lowest 20% only earn 3.9%. According to the World Bank, poverty rates remain high in Peru despite improvements in access to essential services. Chronic malnutrition among children has decreased overall, but is still significantly higher among the poorest 20% of the population. Infant mortality rates are also much higher in the poorest quintile compared to the wealthiest. Peru's infant mortality rate is significantly higher among the poorest quintile compared to the wealthiest, with 64 deaths per 1,000 live births for the poorest and 14 per 1,000 for the wealthiest. The country scores 70 on the 2010 World Bank Human Opportunity Index, ranking 14th out of 18 Latin American countries. President Humala has approved an increase in mining royalties to fund social development programs aimed at reducing the social and economic distribution gap. Additionally, his administration has increased the minimum wage and pension for poor individuals over 65, and passed a law to expand natural gas use for low-income sectors. Social spending and poverty reduction, along with economic growth, have led to a faster decrease in poverty rates in rural areas compared to urban areas. Economic disparity between urban and rural populations, environmental concerns from mining in rural communities, and a perception of limited benefits from the mining economic boom are factors driving social unrest. The limited capacity of Peru's institutions has hindered the implementation of social policies by both the Garc\u00eda and Humala administrations. The Humala administration faces the challenge of increasing government effectiveness to sustain positive trends. The Camisea natural gas project highlighted the lack of skills in sub-national governments to manage social and environmental risks, leading to damage in indigenous communities. Poverty in these areas remained high at 60%. The Humala administration aims to marshal funds effectively to address poverty in areas with a 60% poverty rate. U.S. assistance programs provide training and technical assistance to improve social services and citizen access to information. Humala's administration has taken steps to protect Peru's environment but has faced criticism for favoring business interests. The prior consultation law requires companies to consult with indigenous communities on resource projects, but the consultation process has not been defined or implemented yet. The government in Peru has approved 14 mining projects without consulting the communities affected. There are tensions between promoting investment and protecting the environment, with conflicts leading to cabinet shuffles and resignations in the environment ministry. President Humala declared an environmental state of emergency in part of Peru's Amazon jungle region in response to pollution caused by an Argentinian oil company. Residents along the Pastaza River have reported damage to the river and surrounding rainforest, leading to social unrest and debate over natural resource exploitation. The biggest dispute involves a mine owned by U.S. parent company Newmont Mining and operated by its local subsidiary, Yanacocha. The Conga gold and copper mine in Cajamarca, Peru, owned by U.S. parent company Newmont Mining, has been suspended since late November 2011 due to violent protests over environmental concerns. Opponents fear contamination of water resources and advocate for sustainable development based on agriculture and eco-tourism. President Humala imposed additional conditions on the project after a reassessment by international experts in April 2012. Newmont Mining halted construction of the Conga mine in Peru to build reservoirs as part of an environmentally sensitive approach. Violent protests have occurred, with five protesters killed in 2012. Clashes with police occurred in 2013 over water transfer to new reservoirs. The project's future hinges on community response to lake water removal. Environment Minister Manuel Pulgar-Vidal supports the reservoirs. Construction of the Conga mine in Peru is on hold as reservoirs are being built for community use. The government requires completion of the reservoirs before allowing mine construction to start. Regional president Gregorio Santos Guerrero opposes the mine expansion and is under investigation for alleged misuse of public funds. Investor interest in the case reflects Peru's business environment. Other regions in Peru are also facing protests against mining and energy projects. Peru faces tensions with Chile over maritime borders, with disputes escalating in 2005 and 2009. The International Court of Justice is expected to make a decision on the matter. President Humala demanded an apology from Chile for past conflicts during the War of the Pacific in 1879. Peru demanded an apology from Chile for past conflicts during the War of the Pacific in 1879. President Humala later traveled to Chile to improve relations between the two countries. Both countries agreed to respect the International Court of Justice's decision on the maritime border dispute. Peru and Ecuador have resolved border disputes and are working on a joint border integration project with international support. Peru has strong relationships with various international organizations and countries, including the United States. They collaborate on democratic institutions, human rights, environmental protection, and counternarcotics efforts. President-elect Humala aimed to enhance ties with the U.S. during a meeting with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and President Barack Obama in 2011. President Obama and President Humala plan to strengthen ties during their meeting at the White House in June 2013. They will discuss U.S. support for social inclusion, economic growth, and citizen security in Peru. Additionally, they will collaborate on the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement, education, energy, climate change, science, technology, and trade. President Humala will also establish partnerships with U.S. universities during his visit. Defense Secretary Panetta met with President Humala and Defense Minister Cateriano in Peru to discuss military cooperation, including humanitarian assistance, internal security, defense reform, U.N. peacekeeping, and regional security. They also talked about joint planning, information sharing, trilateral cooperation with Colombia, updating the Defense Cooperation Agreement, Peru's interest in acquiring U.S. helicopters, and using counternarcotics resources for counterinsurgency efforts. The U.S. aims to assist Peru in consolidating democratic rule, combating narcotrafficking and terrorism, and improving public infrastructure. Funding for Peru has been decreasing since FY2010, with Congress allocating funds for various regional programs. In FY2013, $10 million of Economic Support Funds will be available for labor and environmental capacity building activities in Peru, Central American countries, and the Dominican Republic related to free trade agreements with the United States. Additionally, $10 million is designated for biodiversity conservation programs in the Andean Amazon region. The Obama Administration requested $73 million for Peru in FY2013, but funding is currently at FY2012 levels due to a continuing resolution. Sequestration measures are in effect, requiring across-the-board reductions from the FY2013 funding level. The Obama Administration requested just under $73 million for Peru for FY2014, with no legislative action taken yet. A $35.6 million Millennium Challenge Threshold program was signed between Peru and the United States for 2008 to 2010, focusing on reducing corruption and improving child immunization coverage. The program was extended to July 2011 and successfully completed the nationwide immunization program. In 2011, the nationwide immunization program in Peru was completed, with the Millennium Challenge Corporation extending the end date for an anti-corruption program. The focus of relations between Peru and the United States is on combating the flow of illegal drugs, particularly cocaine, from Peru. Peru is a major producer of coca, with high potential for cocaine production. Coca cultivation in Peru increased by 2% in 2011. Coca cultivation in Peru increased from 61,200 hectares in 2010 to 62,500 hectares in 2011. The U.S. government estimated 53,000 hectares in 2010 and 49,500 hectares in 2011. The upper Huallaga valley saw a decrease in cultivation due to eradication efforts, while the VRAE region is now the largest coca cultivating region. 93% of coca grown in Peru is illegal for cocaine production. Peru is a major importer of precursor chemicals for cocaine production, leading to social issues. Coca eradication is controversial, with farmers resisting and some aligning with the Shining Path terrorist group involved in drug trafficking. The Shining Path conducted 87 terrorist acts in 2012. Drug addiction is a growing problem, with insufficient treatment centers. The State Department estimated 150,000 addicts in 2011, with a significant number addicted to cocaine and marijuana in 2013. The 2013 report highlighted 32,000 to 45,000 cocaine addicts and a large number of marijuana addicts in Peru. Illicit coca cultivation has led to environmental damage, including deforestation of 2.5 million hectares and pollution of forests and streams. U.S. counternarcotics programs in Peru focus on eradication, interdiction, and alternative development, with a $26 million request for FY2014. Alternative development programs have shown positive results in increasing legal incomes and reducing poverty levels. USAID programs supported over 19,000 families with cultivating alternative crops. President Humala reevaluated Peru's counternarcotics policy and viewed the United States as a strategic partner in combating illegal drug production. USAID supported over 19,000 families with cultivating alternative crops in 2012. Despite initially halting eradication, the Humala administration resumed it in August 2011, leading to the removal of officials in charge of counter-narcotics policy. Critics argue for a gradual transition for farmers to alternative crops to maintain a source of income. In March 2012, Peru adopted a new five-year counternarcotics strategy with a 200% increase in coca eradication. President Humala declared a state of emergency in coca-producing areas with a Shining Path presence in September 2011, leading to military intervention to take control of the region and develop infrastructure. The military imposed full control over the VRAE region for the first time since the administration of former President Alberto Fujimori, raising concerns over human rights and development issues. The area remains an emergency zone due to protests over eradication and the presence of Shining Path insurgents operating alongside drug traffickers. In response to a Shining Path attack in October 2012, the Humala administration planned to monitor the group via satellite and discussed using U.S. helicopters for counter-narcotics operations. The United States supports Peru in counter-narcotics and counterinsurgency operations, focusing on the Shining Path's activities in the VRAEM region. Trade between the two countries is significant, with the U.S. being one of Peru's top trading partners. The U.S.-Peru Trade Promotion Agreement promotes trade and environmental protection. The U.S.-Peru Trade Promotion Agreement (PTPA) went into effect in 2009, with environmental amendments committing both countries to enforce domestic laws and promote legal trade in timber products. A conservation organization petitioned the U.S. Trade Representative to investigate illegal wood shipments from Peru, with reports indicating millions of dollars' worth of illegal wood exported to the U.S. between 2008 and 2010. If illegality is found, the U.S. government can take actions to prohibit companies from exporting until Peru provides evidence of legality. Peru must provide evidence of compliance with laws and regulations before companies can export to the United States. The U.S. Congress allocated funds for environmental and labor capacity building activities related to free trade agreements with Peru. Peru is a negotiating partner in the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). The Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) is a trade agreement involving Peru as a negotiating partner. Critics argue that the economic benefits may be small and regulatory costs high. The 17th round of negotiations in Lima addressed issues like services, government procurement, and labor. Peru and the United States signed a debt-for-nature swap in 2008. In 2008, Peru and the United States signed a debt-for-nature swap reducing Peru's debt by over $25 million until 2015. The funds were to be used for grants to protect Peru's tropical forests. Both countries reviewed progress on environmental provisions and cooperation activities, making progress towards establishing an independent secretariat for enforcement matters as required by the TPA."
