    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Chronic Absenteeism Reduction Act\" and includes findings related to chronic absenteeism. Congress finds that chronically absent students, missing 10 percent or more of the school year, are 68 percent less likely to graduate and more prone to hardships later in life. Over 6.8 million students were chronically absent in 2013-2014, making up 14 percent of all students. This leads to a higher risk of high school dropouts, poverty, health issues, and involvement in the criminal justice system. The Department of Education and the Everyone Graduates Center have identified various factors contributing to chronic absenteeism, including health issues, transportation challenges, and safety concerns. Collaborative efforts and multifaceted strategies involving parents and the community are crucial in addressing this issue. Students of color, including Latino, African-American, American Indian, and Pacific Islander students, are disproportionately chronically absent compared to their White peers. Mentors have been shown to reduce chronic absenteeism, with students who meet regularly being less likely to skip school or classes. In one program, students with \"Success Mentors\" gained over 51,000 additional days of school. The impact of mentoring programs on reducing school absenteeism is significant. \"Success Mentors\" helped students gain over 51,000 additional days of school compared to those without mentors. Studies show that mentoring can cut absenteeism in half and that an estimated 9.4 million at-risk youth could benefit from having a mentor. Interventions to address chronic absenteeism. Interventions for chronic absenteeism include implementing data collection systems, creating data-sharing agreements with partner agencies, and tracking attendance data for students missing 10% or more of school days.
