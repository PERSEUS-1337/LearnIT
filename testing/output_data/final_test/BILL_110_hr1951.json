    "content": "The \"Legal Employee Verification Act\" may be cited as the short title. Document and visa requirements are outlined in the act. The Immigration and Nationality Act is amended to require visas and immigration documents to comply with authentication and biometric standards. These documents must be machine-readable, tamper-resistant, and use biometric identifiers consistent with specific requirements. The Immigration and Nationality Act is amended to require visas and immigration documents to comply with authentication and biometric standards set by the International Civil Aviation Organization. The information on these documents must include the alien's personal details, citizenship, immigration status in the US, and authorization date. The Immigration and Nationality Act is amended to require visas and immigration documents to comply with authentication and biometric standards. The amendment specifies the expiration date of an alien's authorization to work in the United States. It will take effect 6 months after the enactment of the Act. The Immigration and Nationality Act is amended to include an employment eligibility confirmation system in Chapter 8. The Immigration and Nationality Act is amended to establish an Employment Eligibility Confirmation System (referred to as the 'System') to verify individuals' identity and employment authorization. The System aims to transition all businesses from the current employer verification system to this new system. The Employment Eligibility Confirmation System, established in section 274A, utilizes machine-readable documents with encrypted electronic information to verify employment eligibility. The System provides confirmation or tentative nonconfirmation of identity and employment eligibility within 1 working day. In cases of tentative nonconfirmation, a secondary verification process is established by the Commissioner of Social Security. The Commissioner of Social Security, in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security, establishes a secondary verification process for tentative nonconfirmations. Employers must make a secondary verification inquiry within 10 days of receiving a tentative nonconfirmation. If an employee contests a secondary nonconfirmation, the employer must provide a referral letter for the employee to resolve the discrepancy within 10 working days at a DHS or SSA office. The System is designed to maximize reliability and ease of use while protecting privacy and security. Employers can verify newly hired individuals' authorization to work, and individuals can contest confirmations without it constituting knowledge. The System allows individuals to view and correct their records for accuracy, prevents discrimination based on national origin or citizenship status, and prohibits unlawful use by employers or third parties. The System prohibits employers from using it to discriminate against individuals based on national origin or citizenship status, deny employment benefits, interfere with labor rights, or take adverse actions such as terminating or suspending employees who receive a tentative nonconfirmation. The Commissioner of Social Security is required to maintain an Employment Eligibility Database. The Commissioner of Social Security, in consultation with other agencies, must establish an Employment Eligibility Database for non-citizens seeking employment in the U.S., containing information like country of origin, immigration status, and employment eligibility. The Commissioner of Social Security will establish a system to annually reverify employment eligibility using machine-readable documents or telephonic/electronic communication. Access to the database will be restricted to authorized individuals. Access to the Database containing employment verification information will be limited to authorized personnel from the Social Security Administration, Department of Homeland Security, and Department of Labor. The information will be protected from unauthorized disclosure as per regulations set by the Commissioner of Social Security, in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security and the Secretary of Labor. Authorization of appropriations will be provided as necessary. The Database will be designed, implemented, and maintained with necessary appropriations. A plan will be developed to phase workers into the Database and phase out the employer verification system. Employers must notify employees of the System's use and use machine-readable documents or electronic systems to access the Database. The Database will provide employee information such as occupation, metropolitan area of employment, and annual compensation. It must retain confirmation codes for investigations and provide verification receipts to employees. Good-faith compliance with employment verification requirements establishes an affirmative defense against violations. Before the Employment Eligibility Confirmation System is fully implemented, an interim system will be put in place to confirm employment eligibility. The Comptroller General of the United States will submit reports to the Senate Judiciary Committee regarding the System's effectiveness after the second and third years of implementation. The Comptroller General will submit reports to the Senate and House Judiciary Committees on the impact, accuracy, privacy, and implementation of the Employment Eligibility Confirmation System. The Comptroller General will submit reports to assess the nondiscriminatory implementation of the System and provide recommendations on potential modifications. SEC. 4. IMPROVED ENTRY AND EXIT DATA SYSTEM. Section 110 of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 is amended to change references from \"Attorney General\" to \"Secretary of Homeland Security\" and to include the collection of biometric information from aliens' visa or immigration-related documents upon arrival in the United States. The amendment to Section 110 of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 includes changes to determine the lawful presence of aliens entering or departing the United States, and updates references from \"Departments of Justice and State\" to \"Department of Homeland Security and the Department of State\". SEC. 5. PROTECTION OF EMPLOYMENT RIGHTS OF H2B WORKERS. The Secretary and the Secretary of Homeland Security will establish a process for H2B workers to seek other employment in the U.S. if they file a valid complaint. SEC. 6. INCREASED FINES FOR PROHIBITED BEHAVIOR. SEC. 6. INCREASED FINES FOR PROHIBITED BEHAVIOR. Amendments to the Immigration and Nationality Act increase fines for prohibited behavior."
