President Trump issued an Executive Order for a report on significant trade deficits. President Trump issued an Executive Order for a report on significant trade deficits, including with China, despite efforts to reduce bilateral trade deficits, the overall U.S. merchandise trade deficit and the bilateral deficit with China increased in 2017 and 2018. The bilateral trade deficit with China increased from $736.6 billion in 2016 to $878.7 billion in 2018. Debate over the actual size of the deficit persists, with discrepancies between U.S. and Chinese figures. The U.S. trade deficit with China is a key factor in proposed legislation addressing trade relations. The United States Reciprocal Trade Act (H.R. 764) aims to address the imbalanced trading relationship with China by imposing restrictions on Chinese investment due to its negative impact on the trade deficit and wages. The act would allow the President to negotiate agreements with countries having higher tariff barriers or impose additional duties on their exports to the U.S. Official trade statistics show a significant increase in the U.S. bilateral trade deficit with China from 2001 to 2018. The U.S. bilateral trade deficit with China increased significantly from $83 billion in 2001 to $419 billion in 2018, while China's trade surplus with the U.S. rose from $28 billion to $323 billion during the same period. The discrepancy in trade data between the two nations mainly stems from differing figures for China's exports to the U.S., with a growing gap in recent years. China's exports to the U.S. differed by $48.3 billion in 2001 and $61.1 billion in 2018, according to the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System. The Harmonized System (HS) Code classifies traded goods into 10-digit codes, with the first two digits corresponding to one of the 98 HS chapters. The U.S. version is called the Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS). The top five HS chapters where the U.S. imports from China exceed Chinese exports are footwear (64), machinery (84), electrical machinery (85), optical and medical instruments (90), and toys and sporting goods (95), accounting for over 94% of the trade difference. In 2018, machinery (84), electrical machinery (85), and toys and sporting goods (95) were among the top five chapters for both U.S. imports from China and Chinese exports to the United States, accounting for over half of the total trade value. China's exports exceeded U.S. imports by more than $1 billion in railway equipment (86), knit apparel (61), woven apparel (62), and non-railway vehicles (87). In 2018, China's exports exceeded U.S. imports by more than $1 billion in various categories including apparel, non-railway vehicles, machinery, electrical machinery, and optical and medical equipment. The discrepancies in trade statistics for machinery and electrical machinery have been consistently large since 2001. Since 2001, discrepancies in trade statistics between China and the United States have been consistently large, with China's official figures lower than the U.S. Canada also experiences significant differences in reported bilateral trade statistics with China. Scholars and officials have analyzed the reasons for these discrepancies, categorizing explanations into \"technical\" and \"non-technical\" causes. China evaluates exports using F.O.B. terms and imports using C.I.F. terms, while the United States uses F.A.S. terms for exports and a customs definition for imports. This difference in evaluation methods leads to discrepancies in trade data between the two countries, making direct comparisons potentially misleading. To accurately compare trade balances, both nations should use the same terms for evaluation. The United States includes Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands in its trade data, while China does not. Goods in transit at the end of the year are counted as exports by China but not as imports by the United States. Importers may be misidentifying a significant amount of imports according to some analysts. Some analysts believe importers are misidentifying a significant amount of imports as Chinese. The exchange rate between the renminbi and the U.S. dollar can cause the value of a shipment to change between leaving China and arriving in the United States. Exchange rate changes are not a major factor in the trade figures discrepancy. Studies show that about half of the trade discrepancy between U.S. imports from China and Chinese exports to the United States is due to changes in export and import values. Some analysts believe that discrepancies in trade figures between China and the United States may be caused by intentional under-invoicing of exports and imports, as well as the use of \"phantom goods\" shipments to move financial capital offshore. Many analysts believe that discrepancies in trade figures between China and the United States may be due to under-invoicing and the use of third-party locations like Hong Kong for exports. This can lead to value differences in shipments, accounting for about half of the discrepancies in merchandise trade statistics. Many analysts attribute discrepancies in trade figures between China and the United States to under-invoicing and the use of third-party locations like Hong Kong for exports, accounting for about half of the differences in merchandise trade statistics. In April 2004, the 15th JCCT established a statistical working group to address the large and growing statistical discrepancies in bilateral trade data. The group conducted a reconciliation study to determine the causes of the discrepancies, emphasizing that the results were not meant to imply errors in either nation's statistical systems. The U.S. and China conducted studies under the JCCT to address discrepancies in trade data. The main cause of the differences is in \"eastbound trade,\" with goods leaving China, passing through intermediate countries, and then re-exported to the U.S. This has led to concerns about the U.S. trade deficit with China. China has disputed the accuracy of the U.S. trade deficit figures for at least two decades, citing different statistical methods as a reason for discrepancies in trade data. The U.S. trade deficit figures with China have been disputed for years due to different statistical methods. Main discrepancies are in electrical machinery, machinery, toys, and sporting goods. Congress may oversee data compilation to address issues. China's customs services may need to review trade compilation procedures to address discrepancies in bilateral trade data with the United States. Detailed analysis of the data could help persuade China to amend laws and policies related to imports and exports. The report discusses the statistical discrepancy in merchandise trade between the United States and China, highlighting the differences in trade balance and the need for China to review its trade compilation procedures. The U.S.-China Trade Imbalance was discussed at the UNDP-HIID Conference on China's Integration in the Global Economy in January 1998 by Sarah Y. Tong in China: An International Journal in March 2005."
