    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Hepatitis C Epidemic Control and Prevention Act\". Congress finds that hepatitis C virus (HCV) is the most common blood borne virus infection in the US, with over 3 million chronically infected individuals. Approximately 2% of the population has been infected, and 35,000 Americans are newly infected each year. HCV can lead to life-threatening liver disease, and there is no vaccine available for prevention. Infected individuals may unknowingly transmit the virus to others. To combat the HCV epidemic in the United States, treatments are available to slow the progression of chronic hepatitis C. An estimated 2.4 to 2.7 million chronically infected individuals are not receiving treatment, leading to significant costs in lost productivity and medical care. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have developed recommendations and strategies to prevent and control HCV infection and related chronic disease. The National Hepatitis C Prevention Strategy was established in 2001, with the National Institutes of Health holding Consensus Development Conferences on the Management of Hepatitis C in 1997 and 2002. Federal support is crucial to increase awareness and assist prevention efforts at the state and local levels. The Federal Plan for the Prevention, Control, and Medical Management of Hepatitis C is added to Title III of the Public Health Service Act. The Secretary is required to develop a plan for hepatitis C prevention, control, and medical management, including education, surveillance, and research. The plan must consider recommendations from CDC and NIH, and consult with various federal agencies. The Secretary is mandated to develop a plan for hepatitis C prevention, control, and medical management, involving offices, medical advisory bodies, and the public, including individuals infected with HCV and advocates. The plan must be updated biennially to incorporate new knowledge and observations related to HCV and chronic HCV. The Secretary is required to publish assessments results biennially in the Federal Register, including any revisions to the hepatitis C prevention plan based on the assessments. The Secretary must publish biennial assessments in the Federal Register, including revisions to the hepatitis C prevention plan to further promote its goals and objectives, or provide an explanation if no revision is needed. \"SEC. 399BB. ELEMENTS OF THE FEDERAL PLAN FOR THE PREVENTION, CONTROL, AND MEDICAL MANAGEMENT OF HEPATITIS C.\" The Secretary will implement programs to increase awareness and understanding of hepatitis C through health education, public awareness campaigns, and training of healthcare professionals on prevention, detection, and management of hepatitis B and C. This includes promoting awareness of risk factors, transmission, prevention, early detection, and treatment options for chronic hepatitis C. The Secretary will support activities for early detection of HCV infection and the development of curricula for hepatitis counseling. The Secretary will support and promote the development of State, local, and tribal voluntary hepatitis C testing programs to aid in early identification of infected individuals, ensuring confidentiality of test results. The Secretary will support State, local, and tribal programs for counseling on viral hepatitis in various healthcare settings, excluding issues related to health insurance or employment screening. The Secretary will provide education and counseling on ongoing risk factors and infection prevention for hepatitis C virus in both private and public sectors. Vaccination will be offered to individuals infected or at risk for HCV. The Secretary will support vaccination against hepatitis A, HBV, and other infectious diseases for at-risk individuals, as well as counseling on viral hepatides. Medical referral will be provided for HCV-infected individuals for appropriate treatment and evaluation of their chronic stage. The Secretary will provide Hepatitis C Coordinators to State health departments for enhanced management and integration of prevention activities. The Secretary will also support State HCV surveillance efforts. The establishment and maintenance of State HCV surveillance databases to identify risk factors, trends in incidence and prevalence of HCV infection among high-risk groups, and to assess and improve prevention programs. The Secretary will also conduct a population-based seroprevalence study. The Secretary will conduct a population-based seroprevalence study to estimate the impact of hepatitis C, considering economic, clinical impacts, and quality of life. Information in databases will be de-identified for confidentiality. Additionally, a research network will be established to conduct epidemiologic research for HCV prevention best practices and support clinical research. The Secretary will establish a Hepatitis C Clinical Research Network for research on treatment and management, including basic research for prevention and new approaches. They will also support referral programs for medical evaluation and management of HCV-positive individuals, especially for underserved populations. Additionally, the Secretary will evaluate the program's effectiveness. The Secretary will develop benchmarks to evaluate the effectiveness of programs and activities for hepatitis C. The Secretary may award grants to entities with expertise in HCV for activities under this part. To be eligible, entities must submit an application as required. $90,000,000 is authorized for fiscal year 2004, with additional funding for fiscal years 2005 through 2008. Additionally, a Liver Disease Research Advisory Board will be established. The Liver Disease Research Advisory Board will be established as part of the grant program for entities with expertise in HCV. The Liver Disease Research Advisory Board, established within 90 days of this section, will advise on liver disease research and develop the Liver Disease Research Action Plan. It will consist of 18 members appointed by the Director of the National Institutes of Health, including 12 scientists and 6 lay persons. The Liver Disease Research Advisory Board will consist of 18 members appointed by the Director of the National Institutes of Health, including scientists and lay persons. The Director will select one member to serve as the Chair of the Advisory Board. Ex officio members will include directors of national research institutes funding liver disease research, as well as representatives from the CDC, FDA, and VA. Each ex officio member can appoint a representative. A Liver Disease Research Action Plan must be developed within 15 months. The Liver Disease Research Advisory Board will develop a comprehensive Liver Disease Research Action Plan within 15 months to prioritize research on liver diseases and improve treatment protocols. The Liver Disease Research Advisory Board will revise the Liver Disease Research Action Plan every 3 years, meeting annually to review progress and make appropriate amendments due to new scientific discoveries."
