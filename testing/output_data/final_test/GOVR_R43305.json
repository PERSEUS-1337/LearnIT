    "content": "A pension is a voluntary benefit offered by employers to assist employees in providing for their financial security in retirement. In 2017, 65% of full-time workers in the US participated in a retirement plan sponsored by their employer. There are two types of pension plans: defined contribution (DC) plans and defined benefit (DB) plans. DC plans have individual accounts for retirement income, while DB plans provide regular monthly benefit payments. Pension plans can be single employer plans or multiemployer and multiple employer plans. Multiemployer plans are sponsored by employers in the same industry, while multiple employer plans are sponsored by more than one employer. Multiple employer pension plans are not common and are not maintained as part of a collective bargaining agreement. Nearly all private-sector pension plans are governed by ERISA, enforced by the Department of the Treasury, DOL, and PBGC. Single and multiemployer DB pension plans have different rules under ERISA, including separate funding rules and pension insurance programs. Multiemployer DB plans are a concern for Congress due to projected insufficient plan assets to pay 100% of benefits promised to participants within the next 20 years. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 created the Joint Select Committee on Solvency of Multiemployer Pension Plans to address impending insolvencies of large plans. Possible solutions include increased employer contributions and benefit cuts for participants. ERISA (P.L. 93-406) was enacted by Congress to protect pension plan participants and beneficiaries. It sets standards for plan participation, vesting requirements, plan funding, and fiduciary duties. ERISA established the PBGC, an independent federal agency that insures DB pension plans covered by ERISA. PBGC is an independent federal agency that insures DB pension plans covered by ERISA, which only applies to private-sector pension plans. Pension plans can be classified based on various criteria, such as tax preferences, sponsorship, and benefit distribution. Sponsors can choose to have tax-qualified plans, which offer tax advantages like deductible employer contributions and meeting IRC requirements for vesting and funding. Pension plans can be classified based on tax preferences, sponsorship, and benefit distribution. Qualified DB pension plans must prefund future benefits, while nonqualified plans are not required to be prefunded. Nonqualified plans are designed for top-level executives and highly compensated employees. Most pension plans are single-employer plans, covering eligible workers employed by the sponsor. When an employee stops working for the employer sponsoring the plan, the worker stops accruing benefits under that plan. The sponsor may freeze or terminate the plan, with frozen plans no longer accruing benefits but employers maintaining responsibility for funding shortfalls. Terminated DB pension plans require employers to purchase annuities to guarantee participants' future benefits. If underfunded plans are terminated due to company bankruptcy, participants' benefits are protected. If underfunded DB pension plans are terminated due to company bankruptcy, the PBGC becomes the trustee and pays participants their benefits. Multiple employer pension plans are treated as single employer plans for funding purposes. Multiemployer plans pool risk to protect against employer withdrawals, but an increasing number of employers have left these plans in recent years. Participants in multiemployer pension plans may have unfunded vested benefits if employers withdraw from the plan. Pension plans can be either defined benefit (DB) or defined contribution (DC). The percentage of participants in DB plans has decreased over the past 30 years. In DB plans, participants receive monthly payments based on their length of service and a dollar amount contributed by employers. Married participants may receive a joint-and-survivor annuity. In retirement, married plan participants may receive a joint-and-survivor annuity. Private sector DB pension plans are funded by employer contributions. In 2011, 4% of private-sector workers in DB plans made employee contributions. In 2017, 91% of public-sector workers in DB plans made contributions. DC plan participants contribute a percentage of their wages to an account, with employers possibly matching the contribution. The account grows with investment returns and provides income in retirement. In retirement, DC plans like 401(k) do not guarantee lifetime income unless an annuity is purchased. In 2015, there were 1,413 multiemployer DB pension plans covering 10.3 million participants, with 40% active and 60% retired. Plans with more active workers can rely on future contributions to address underfunding. Employers' contributions towards underfunding in multiemployer DB pension plans vary based on the percentage of active workers. Some plans are well funded, while others may become insolvent within 10 to 20 years. Insolvent plans can receive financial assistance from PBGC. The Pension Protection Act of 2006 requires plans with funding shortfalls to notify DOL and establish a plan to improve funding levels. DB pension benefits are accrued by eligible employees and paid as a monthly annuity during retirement. The benefits in DB plans subject to ERISA are required to be prefunded, with plan sponsors setting aside funds for pension benefits earned each year. Employers in multiemployer DB pension plans have fixed contributions for several years. Many pension plans have insufficient funds compared to promised benefits due to various factors. The curr_chunk discusses the factors affecting pension plan funding, such as declines in plan assets and increases in the value of future benefits. Multiemployer DB plans maintain funding standard accounts to manage funding requirements. Charges and credits to the account impact the balance, with a \"credit balance\" occurring when credits exceed charges, eliminating the need for contributions until future charges offset the balance. In 2010, 90 out of 1,471 pension plans reported funding deficiencies. In 2015, 56.16% of multiemployer DB plans had a funding ratio below 50%, with 7.5 million participants affected. Exiting a multiemployer DB plan requires a company to pay its share of unfunded vested benefits. The Pension Protection Act of 2006 addresses the issue of orphan participants in multiemployer DB pension plans, where employers may withdraw due to bankruptcy, leaving participants with vested benefits but no employer to contribute to their unfunded benefits. This can worsen the plan's funding situation as assets are not assigned to specific employers or participants, leading to benefit payments drawing down general plan assets. The Pension Protection Act of 2006 requires annual certification of multiemployer DB pension plans' status as critical, endangered, or neither based on funded status. The Multiemployer Pension Reform Act of 2014 made these provisions permanent and added a critical and declining category for plans with funding ratios below 65%. Plans in critical status are those where the funding ratio is less than 65% and the assets and contributions are projected to be insufficient to cover benefits in the next few years. If the plan is not receiving the required contributions or is expected to be insolvent within a certain timeframe, a rehabilitation plan must be adopted. A rehabilitation plan must be adopted for plans in critical status with options like increased employer contributions and benefit accrual reductions. Plans in critical status cannot increase benefits and must notify relevant parties. Plans in critical and declining status are projected to become insolvent within a specified timeframe. Plans in endangered status must adopt a funding improvement plan to reduce underfunding by 33% over a 10-year period. Plans in seriously endangered status must adopt a plan to reduce underfunding by 20% over a 15-year period. Plans in endangered or seriously endangered status must adopt a funding improvement plan to reduce underfunding by 20% over a 15-year period. Plans in endangered status must notify various parties. Plans not in critical and declining, critical, seriously endangered, or endangered status are considered in green status and likely able to pay benefits without changes. PBGC oversees multiemployer DB plans to protect participants' benefits. The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) was established in 1974 under ERISA to safeguard the benefits of participants in private-sector DB pension plans. PBGC operates two insurance programs for single employer and multiemployer plans. In the single employer program, PBGC takes over underfunded plans and pays benefits up to a maximum amount. For multiemployer plans, PBGC provides financial assistance through loans to insolvent plans unable to fulfill promised benefits, with no expectation of repayment. Plans in different statuses have specific requirements to address underfunding. The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) provides financial assistance through loans to multiemployer pension plans, with the condition that benefits are reduced to a statutory maximum. PBGC's multiemployer insurance program faces a deficit of $65.1 billion, with a high likelihood of insolvency by 2036. PBGC's FY2017 Projections Report warns of significant financial challenges for the multiemployer insurance program, with a 99% likelihood of insolvency by 2026. Assets total $2.3 billion, with estimated future financial assistance ranging from $7.2 billion to $7.4 billion over the next 10 years. This could result in a potential deficit of $2.4 billion. The PBGC's FY2017 Projections Report warns of significant financial challenges for the multiemployer insurance program, with a potential deficit of $2.4 billion by 2026. The report also estimates a future deficit ranging from $68.0 billion to $68.9 billion in 2027. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) provided cash-based estimates for PBGC's financial condition from 2017 to 2026. The PBGC's FY2017 Projections Report warns of significant financial challenges for the multiemployer insurance program, with a potential deficit of $2.4 billion by 2026. CBO estimates that PBGC will be obligated to pay $9 billion in claims from 2017 to 2026 but will only have sufficient resources to pay $6 billion. From 2027 to 2036, claims are estimated to be $35 billion but PBGC will only have resources to pay $5 billion. CBO's fair-value estimate of PBGC's future obligations is $101 billion. In FY2017, 72 multiemployer plans received $141 million in financial assistance from PBGC. Plans are classified as \"probable\" if terminated and underfunded but not yet receiving assistance or expected to be insolvent within 10 years. 68 plans had been terminated but not yet received assistance, with a net liability of $2.0 billion. 47 plans were ongoing but expected to be insolvent within 10 years, with a net liability of $62.7 billion. The probable exposure to future financial assistance increased from $58.9 billion in FY2016 to $64.6 billion in FY2017. In FY2017, PBGC estimated its reasonably possible exposure to future financial assistance to be $14 billion, a decrease from $19.5 billion in FY2016. Plans classified as \"reasonably possible exposure\" are ongoing but projected to be insolvent in 10 to 20 years. PBGC guarantees benefits in pension plans up to a statutory maximum level. When an insolvent multiemployer DB pension plan becomes insolvent, participants' benefits are reduced to the PBGC maximum amount before receiving assistance. The statutory maximum benefit for multiemployer plans receiving PBGC assistance is based on years of service and accrual rate. PBGC reported $291 million in premium income from multiemployer plans in FY2017, with a $53 million loss in investment income. Premiums are invested in Treasury securities. The PBGC multiemployer insurance program is funded per participant. The PBGC multiemployer insurance program is funded by a per participant premium paid by each pension plan, indexed to increases in the average national wage. PBGC does not become trustee of insolvent multiemployer pension plans. Funding for financial assistance comes from premiums paid by plan sponsors and interest income from investments in U.S. Treasury bonds. If financial assistance exceeds premium revenue, the revolving fund could be depleted. PBGC estimated future financial assistance exposure to be $64.6 million. PBGC estimated its future financial assistance exposure to be $64.6 billion over the next 10 years, with a possible exposure of $14 billion. The multiemployer program's premium income was $291 million in FY2017. PBGC predicts insolvency in 10 to 15 years, indicating premium levels may not be sufficient to guarantee benefits. Once resources are exhausted, insolvent plans would need to reduce benefits to sustainable levels through premium collections. Premiums are legislatively set, potentially hindering increases. The Multiemployer Pension Reform Act of 2014 addressed challenges faced by sponsors of multiemployer DB pension plans and PBGC's insurance program. It made certain funding rules permanent and allowed plans to reduce benefits to stave off insolvency. Policymakers have been focusing on issues related to multiemployer pension plans and PBGC's insurance program. The Multiemployer Pension Reform Act of 2014 addressed challenges faced by sponsors of multiemployer DB pension plans and PBGC's insurance program. Policymakers have subsequently shown interest in new proposals to improve the funding position of underfunded plans and prevent insolvency. PBGC has sufficient assets to assist currently insolvent plans and smaller plans at risk, but may face challenges if larger plans become insolvent. PBGC may not have enough resources to pay 100% of benefits owed to plan participants once assets in the multiemployer insurance program revolving funds are exhausted. Participants' benefits could be cut below the current maximum, with most receiving less than $2,000 per year. Premiums may need to increase by 59% to 85% to ensure solvency over the next 10 years, or federal financial assistance to PBGC would be necessary. In December 2014, Congress enacted MPRA to address solvency issues in multiemployer DB pension plans. The legislation increased premiums, modified funding rules, and allowed plans to reduce benefits. NCCMP proposed many of these provisions in 2013, leading to the creation of a commission to gather input for reform proposals. The commission proposed reforms to existing funding rules for multiemployer pension plans, solutions for deeply troubled plans, and new plan designs. MPRA addressed some funding rules and troubled plans but did not include new plan designs. The U.S. Treasury received 32 applications to reduce benefits under MPRA as of September 21, 2018. The Central States, Southeast and Southwest Areas Pension Plan (Central States) had 27 applications to reduce benefits under MPRA. Ten applications were withdrawn, seven approved, and decisions pending on the remaining ten. Central States, with over 400,000 participants, was the first to apply but was denied by the U.S. Treasury on May 6, 2016. The plan's insolvency could lead to PBGC insolvency. In 2016, the U.S. Treasury denied Central States' application to reduce benefits under MPRA due to actuarial projections not showing solvency, inequitable benefit reductions, and unclear participant notices. Central States decided not to resubmit the application. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 established a committee to address insolvencies in multiemployer pension plans and PBGC. The committee, consisting of 16 Members of Congress, including House and Senate leaders from each party, must hold public meetings and hearings to address multiemployer pension plans' solvency. Co-chairs Senators Orrin Hatch and Sherrod Brown will select witnesses for hearings. A report with proposed legislative language is due to Congress by November 30, 2018, and must be approved by a majority of committee members. The joint committee provisions outline procedures for Senate committees to consider the bill. No House committees are required to review the bill. Appendix A explains Defined Benefit Plan funding, including balance sheet details. The funding ratio of a Defined Benefit Plan measures its ability to pay promised benefits. A ratio of 100% means there are enough funds to cover all obligations, while ratios below 100% indicate potential shortfall in meeting future obligations. Underfunded plans may still pay benefits in the short term but could face challenges without additional contributions. Many multiemployer DB pension plans increased benefits in response to strong investment returns in the 1990s, leading to underfunding in the early 2000s due to various factors. The Value of Plan Assets is reported using market values or smoothed values. The smoothing of asset values in pension plans helps create a more predictable funding environment for plan sponsors, but it can lead to discrepancies with market values. Advocates of reporting market values argue that smoothed values may overstate the financial health of pension plans, especially during market declines. Plan liabilities represent future benefit obligations spread out over many years. Future benefits in pension plans are calculated as current dollar values through a process called discounting. This involves projecting the value of benefits expected to be paid in the future as a current value using a formula. The present value of a dollar amount is influenced by the discount rate and the number of years in the future, with higher rates or longer periods decreasing the present value. For example, at a 10% discount rate, $121 in two years would be worth $100 today. The present value of future benefits in pension plans is calculated by discounting future dollar amounts. The discount rate and number of years in the future impact the present value, with higher rates or longer periods decreasing it. Plan actuaries estimate benefit obligations based on accrued benefits and expected payment years. Multiemployer pension plans use reasonable assumptions for discounting liabilities. Pension plans typically discount liabilities using the expected rate of return on assets, but multiemployer plans must also consider bond yields. The discount rate on Schedule MB of Form 5500 is lower than the expected return on assets. Experts have differing opinions on the appropriate discount rate for valuing plan liabilities. Some recommend using the expected return on investments, while others suggest using a lower rate. Some financial economists recommend discounting pension obligations based on the likelihood of payment to plan participants, while actuaries suggest using a discount rate reflecting the return on investments to set aside funds for future obligations. Some financial economists recommend discounting pension obligations based on the likelihood of payment to plan participants, while actuaries suggest using a discount rate reflecting the return on investments to set aside funds for future obligations. Actuaries' approach may inappropriately connect the value of liabilities to the rate of return on assets, potentially allowing pension plans to reduce underfunding by investing in riskier assets. This results in higher discount rates compared to the approach favored by financial economists, leading to higher pension plan benefit obligations and lower funding ratios. The National Coordinating Committee for Multiemployer Plans (NCCMP) created a Retirement Security Review Commission in 2013 to gather input for multiemployer DB pension reform proposals. Many of the commission's proposals were included in the Multiemployer Pension Reform Act of 2014, which increased PBGC premiums for multiemployer plans. The Multiemployer Pension Reform Act of 2014 increased PBGC premiums for multiemployer plans from $12 to $26 per participant and made changes to funding rules, allowing plans to enter critical status if they anticipate it within five years and preventing reentry into critical status for at least one year after emergence. The Multiemployer Pension Reform Act of 2014 increased PBGC premiums for multiemployer plans and made changes to funding rules, allowing plans to enter critical status if they anticipate it within five years and preventing reentry into critical status for at least one year after emergence. Plans meeting criteria for endangered status with funding improvement plans not requiring additional contributions or benefit changes are not certified as endangered. Plan actuaries for plans in endangered status can use the funding status as of the certification date when developing funding improvement plans. The Multiemployer Pension Reform Act of 2014 allows plans in endangered status to adopt rules previously only available to critical status plans, such as contribution decreases and waiver of excise taxes. Plans in endangered status can specify actions if a collective bargaining agreement expires. The Multiemployer Pension Reform Act of 2014 allows plans in endangered status to adopt rules previously only available to critical status plans. It also addresses conflicts between rules for plans in reorganization and those in endangered or critical status, and permits contribution increases to be disregarded in determining withdrawal liability. The Multiemployer Pension Reform Act of 2014 allows plans in endangered status to adopt rules previously only available to critical status plans. It addresses conflicts between rules for plans in reorganization and those in endangered or critical status. Plans with increased withdrawal liability and insolvent or terminated status are ineligible for preretirement survivor annuities. Some deeply troubled plans may become insolvent, posing challenges for the PBGC to guarantee benefits without federal assistance. The Multiemployer Pension Reform Act of 2014 allows troubled plans to adopt new rules, but some may still face insolvency. Financial assistance for PBGC is uncertain, and options like increased contributions may not be enough. PBGC may need to reduce benefits if resources are insufficient. MPRA gives PBGC authority to facilitate plan mergers and partitions. The Multiemployer Pension Reform Act of 2014 allows PBGC to promote and facilitate mergers between multiemployer plans, providing training, technical assistance, and financial aid if necessary for the merged plan to remain solvent. PBGC can also approve partitions to divide a plan into two to restore financial health. The goal of the partition process is to restore the original plan to financial health. Key features include transferring orphan participants to a newly created plan, administered by the original plan, with financial assistance from PBGC. No assets are transferred from the original plan to the successor plan. Section 201 of MPRA allows certain multiemployer DB plans in critical and declining status to reduce benefits for participants. The Treasury Secretary, in consultation with PBGC and the Labor Secretary, may reject benefit reduction applications if deemed \"clearly erroneous.\" Participants can reject benefit reductions with a majority vote. Systemically important plans can reduce participants' benefits without a vote if PBGC would pay $1 billion or more in benefit payments. Benefits cannot be cut below 110% of the PBGC maximum guarantee, which was $12,870 in 2015. Disabled individuals and retirees aged 80 or older are protected from benefit reductions. Those between 75 and 80 may not receive the maximum reduction. Benefit reductions must be distributed fairly, considering factors like age and life expectancy. The sponsor may consider various factors when determining benefit reductions, such as age, life expectancy, length of time receiving benefits, and years to retirement. Benefit reductions are prioritized for participants whose employers failed to pay withdrawal liability, with exceptions for certain participants like those from United Parcel Service. Retirees' benefit reductions have been a contentious issue. MPRA addressed concerns about retirees' benefits in troubled multiemployer DB pensions, providing protections for disabled and elderly individuals. Not all recommendations from the Retirement Security Commission were included in MPRA, including automatic triggers for funding relief. The changes proposed in the curr_chunk aimed to address funding relief issues in pension plans by introducing automatic triggers for financial market declines and allowing for additional benefits like a 13th check. These changes also eliminated the risk of IRS excise tax for plans with amortization extensions. The IRS allowed plans to extend time for funding improvements due to market losses in 2008. Plans failing to meet requirements may face IRS excise tax. PPA provided amortization extensions, eliminating the need for pre-PPA extensions. Participants could convert DC accounts into annuities for lifetime income."
