    "content": "The ARRA provides $96.764 billion in discretionary appropriations for education programs administered by the U.S. Department of Education. Funds are available until September 30, 2010, in addition to regular FY2009 appropriations. Section 807 allows the Secretary to award funds based on state and LEA eligibility for FY2008 awards. About $43.164 billion were appropriated for existing education programs like Title I-A, Education for the Disadvantaged. The ARRA provides significant funding for education programs, including Title I-A Grants to LEAs, with a 76.2% increase over FY2008 levels. This funding is part of the discretionary appropriations totaling $96.764 billion for education programs administered by the U.S. Department of Education. The ARRA provides increased funding for various education programs, including IDEA and Pell Grants. The total FY2009 appropriations for these programs amount to $90.298 billion, representing significant increases over FY2008 levels. The ARRA allocated $90.298 billion for education programs in FY2009, a 111.2% increase from FY2008. $53.600 billion was designated for the State Fiscal Stabilization Fund, with $48.318 billion going to governors through formula grants.

The Department of Education released funds for various programs under the ARRA, including IDEA, Vocational Rehabilitation State Grants, and Services for Older Individuals who are Blind. States can receive up to 90% of their grants under the State Fiscal Stabilization Funds program if they demonstrate the need. Funds for the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Program and Impact Aid Construction grants were distributed, with the remaining Impact Aid funds to be distributed later through a competitive grant process. The ARRA provides funding for various education programs, including Title I-A Grants, IDEA Part B Grants, School Improvement Grants, Education Technology, and McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act. The House and Senate bills differ in funding for IDEA Part B (Preschool Grants) and other programs like Fund for the Improvement of Education and Impact Aid Section 8007. The House bill would have provided funds for Credit Enhancement Initiatives to Assist Charter Schools and a new program for school construction funds to LEAs, which are not covered by the ARRA. The primary federal aid for K-12 education is through the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, particularly Title I, Part A program for Education for the Disadvantaged. The Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) includes various programs such as grants for migrant students, teacher recruitment, language instruction for LEP students, drug abuse prevention, after-school care, charter schools, and education services for Native American students. Title I, Part A provides federal aid to local educational agencies for disadvantaged students. The House and Senate bills propose additional funding for ESEA programs. Title I-A of the ESEA provides federal aid to local educational agencies for disadvantaged children, offering supplementary educational services to low-achieving students in schools with high numbers of low-income families. The program received $13.9 billion in funding for FY2008, allocated through four different formulas. These formulas consider the number of children in poor families and state expenditures per pupil for K-12 education. Title I-A of the ESEA provides federal aid to local educational agencies for disadvantaged children, offering supplementary educational services to low-achieving students in schools with high numbers of low-income families. The program received $13.9 billion in funding for FY2008, allocated through four different formulas based on factors like state expenditures per pupil for K-12 education and poverty levels. These formulas aim to provide varying shares of allocated funds to different LEAs. The House and Senate bills proposed $11 billion in supplemental appropriations for Title I-A Grants to LEAs, with funds allocated through the Targeted Grant and EFIG formulas. The House bill would have split the funds over two years, while the Senate bill would have allocated the entire amount in FY2009. The Senate bill proposed $2.75 billion in appropriations through the EFIG formula for Title I-A Grants to LEAs. It included requirements for LEAs to allocate funds for activities serving children not yet at grade level and to report per pupil expenditures. The ARRA provided $10 billion in supplemental appropriations for Title I-A, split equally between the Targeted Grant and EFIG formulas. The ARRA provided $10 billion in supplemental appropriations for Title I-A Grants to LEAs, split equally through the Targeted Grant and EFIG formulas. LEAs with a child poverty rate below 5.0% are not eligible for grants. Funds are meant to help mitigate the impact of reduced local and state education support. Reporting on per-pupil expenditures is required, with data due to the Secretary of Education by December 1, 2009. School Improvement Grants provide supplementary funds to states and LEAs for school improvement purposes. States must report data to the Secretary of Education by March 31, 2010. Subgrants must be between $50,000 and $500,000 for each school and must be used to support school improvement. LEAs with the lowest-achieving schools must ensure funds are used to provide adequate resources. In FY2008, the School Improvement Grants program received $491 million in annual appropriation. States must reserve 4% of their Title I-A grants for school improvement activities. The House bill proposed $2 billion in supplemental appropriations for School Improvement Grants, with $1 billion available in 2009 and the rest in 2010. The Senate bill suggested $1.4 billion in supplemental appropriations, with all funds available in 2009. The Senate also wanted states to allocate 40% of their funds for middle and high schools. The ARRA provides $3 billion in supplemental FY2009 appropriations for School Improvement Grants, with funds available to LEAs in 2009-2010 and 2010-2011 to mitigate the impact of revenue reductions. LEAs must report per-pupil expenditures by December 1, 2009, and SEAs must report to the Secretary by March 31, 2010. ED is required to encourage states to allocate 40% of School Improvement Grants for middle and high schools. The EdTech program offers grants to SEAs and LEAs to enhance educational technology integration. The EdTech program aims to support the integration of technology into education, enhance technological literacy, and provide professional development for teachers. Funds are allocated to states based on Title I-A grants, with a minimum grant amount of 0.5% of total funding. In FY2008, the program received $267 million in appropriations, and the ARRA provided an additional $650 million in FY2009. Both the House and Senate proposed supplemental appropriations of $1 billion for EdTech. The House and Senate proposed $1 billion in supplemental FY2009 appropriations for EdTech to support technology integration in education. The Credit Enhancement program provides grants to assist charter schools in acquiring facilities, with the House bill proposing a one-time grant of $25 million. The Senate bill did not allocate additional funds for this program. The ARRA does not provide funds for the Credit Enhancement program. ESEA Title V-D authorizes competitive grant programs for innovative K-12 educational activities. In FY2008, Title V-D-1 received $122 million in appropriations. The House bill proposed $200 million for Subpart 1 activities in FY2009. These funds were to be used for competitive grants to LEAs and states. In FY2008, $200 million in appropriations were proposed for competitive grants to develop performance-based teacher and principal compensation systems in high-need schools under the Teacher Incentive Fund program. The systems would consider student academic achievement, classroom evaluations, and provide incentives for leadership roles. Up to 5% of the funds would be available for technical assistance and evaluation activities. Additionally, a portion of the funds had to be used for an evaluation by the Institute of Education Sciences. The ARRA provides $200 million in supplemental FY2009 appropriations for performance-based teacher and principal compensation systems in high-need schools. The Impact Aid program compensates LEAs for financial burdens from federal activities, including federal land ownership and children of parents in the military or living on Indian lands. Section 8007 specifically provides funds for construction and facilities upgrading to certain LEAs. Section 8007 of the Impact Aid program provides funds for construction and facilities upgrading to certain LEAs with high percentages of children living on Indian lands or children of military parents. In FY2008, $18 million was appropriated for these payments, with 40% allocated for construction payments by formula to eligible LEAs. The remaining 60% is used for school facility emergency and modernization competitive grants. The House bill proposed $100 million in supplemental appropriations for school facility emergency and modernization grants in FY2009, while the Senate bill did not allocate funds for this purpose. The ARRA provided $100 million in supplemental appropriations for Impact Aid Section 8007, with 40% of funds distributed through formula grants based on each LEA's proportion of military children and 60% through competitive grants with modified eligibility criteria. The ARRA modifies requirements for formula grants based on military children and children on Indian lands, allowing for greater participation of LEAs. IDEA supports special education for children with disabilities. States and LEAs must provide free services to receive IDEA funding. The IDEA requires states and LEAs to provide a free appropriate public education to children with disabilities. It is divided into four parts: Part A contains general provisions, Part B focuses on school-aged children, Part C is for infants and toddlers, and Part D covers national activities. In FY2008, Part B received $10.9 billion, Part C received $436 million, and Part D received $225 million in annual appropriations. In FY2008, IDEA received annual appropriations of $10.9 billion for Part B, $436 million for Part C, and $225 million for Part D. Both House and Senate bills proposed supplemental appropriations for Part B and Part C in FY2009, with discussions on federal funding for educating children with disabilities based on the national average per-pupil expenditure. The federal government would pay up to 40% of excess costs under IDEA, Part B. Estimated percentages of federal funding for FY2008, FY2009, and FY2010 ranged from 17.2% to 37.6%. For Part C, the House bill allocated $600 million with funds becoming available in 2009 and 2010. The Senate bill proposed $500 million for FY2009. The ARRA provides $11.3 billion in supplemental FY2009 appropriations for IDEA Part B, with 15% of funds for special education services for preschool children. The federal government will pay 34.2% of the \"excess\" cost of educating children with disabilities. Additionally, $500 million in FY2009 funds is allocated for IDEA Part C. The ARRA specifies that any remaining funds after incentive grants are awarded will be allocated to states by formula. $400 million is provided for the IDEA preschool program. Special issues have arisen regarding the allocation of IDEA funds to outlying areas or the Bureau of Indian Affairs. The Education for Homeless Children and Youth program ensures equal access to education for homeless children. Funds are allocated based on ESEA Title I-A grants, with a state minimum of $150,000 or 0.25% of total grants. In FY2008, $64 million was appropriated for this program. In FY2008, $64 million was appropriated for the Education for Homeless Children and Youth program. Competitive grants are given to facilitate enrollment, attendance, and success in school for homeless children and youth. Funds can be used for tutoring, supplemental instruction, and health services. States must submit a plan for identifying homeless children, ensuring their participation in food programs, and addressing issues like transportation and immunization. The House bill proposed $66 million for FY2009. The Education for Homeless Children and Youth program received $66 million in supplemental FY2009 appropriations, with funds allocated to states based on the number of homeless students identified. States would make subgrants to LEAs on a competitive basis. The ARRA provided $70 million in supplemental funding for the program. The ARRA provides $70 million in supplemental funding for the Education for Homeless Children and Youth program. Grants will be allocated to states based on the number of homeless students identified, with subgrants to LEAs on a competitive basis or using a formula. SEAs must make subgrants to LEAs within 120 days of receiving funds. The House bill proposed $14 billion in FY2009 for school renovation, with funds allocated to states based on FY2008 Title I-A funding received by LEAs. No federal education programs currently provide grants for school renovation. The House bill proposed allocating $14 billion in FY2009 for school renovation based on FY2008 Title I-A funding received by LEAs in each state. States could reserve up to 1% for technical assistance and developing a database on school facilities. Remaining funds would be distributed to LEAs based on their Title I-A funding. The minimum grant amount for LEAs would have been $5,000, with restrictions on fund usage for certain facilities. The ARRA did not provide dedicated federal funds for school modernization. The ARRA provides federal funds for school modernization, renovation, and repair under the State Fiscal Stabilization Fund. It also allocates funds for programs authorized under the Higher Education Act, including the Federal Pell Grant program, Federal Work-Study program, and Teacher Quality Partnership Grant program. The House bill proposed additional discretionary funding for these programs. The House bill proposed $1.474 billion in mandatory funding for the Federal Pell Grant program and increased borrowing limits on Stafford Loans for undergraduate students. It also included $6 billion in discretionary funding for grants to state higher education agencies for facility modernization. The Senate bill offered $13.980 billion in discretionary funding for HEA programs but did not allocate funds for higher education modernization. The Federal Pell Grant program provides grants to low-income undergraduate students to help with postsecondary education costs. Pell Grants are portable and based on expected family contribution. They are considered the foundation of a student's financial aid package. The Federal Pell Grant program provides grants to low-income undergraduate students to help with postsecondary education costs. Pell Grants are funded by both discretionary and mandatory appropriations, with the maximum award amount for the 2008-2009 award year being $4,731. The House bill proposed $15.636 billion for the program, in addition to anticipated discretionary funds. The House bill proposed increasing the maximum Pell Grant award amount to $5,350 for the 2009-2010 award year, with additional mandatory appropriations of $643 million for FY2009 and $831 million for FY2010. The Senate bill would have provided $13.869 billion for the Federal Pell Grant program. The Senate bill proposed $13.869 billion for the Federal Pell Grant program, increasing the maximum award amount by $281 for 2009-2010 and by $400 for 2010-2011. Funds were allocated to reduce or eliminate the Pell Grant shortfall. The ARRA provided $15.64 billion in supplemental discretionary appropriations for FY2009 and $1.474 billion in mandatory appropriations. The Federal Pell Grant program received $643 million for FY2009 and $831 million for FY2010, with a maximum award of $5,350 for the 2009-2010 award year. The program also includes a mandatory add-on of $490 for FY2009 and $690 for FY2010-2011. The Federal Work-Study (FWS) program provides need-based aid to students for paid employment related to their field of study or community service. Students receive compensation for their work hours. The Federal Work-Study (FWS) program provides need-based aid to students for paid employment. Awards are based on factors like financial need and availability of funds. Institutions receive federal funding for the program to offer need-based aid to students. Students are compensated with a combination of federal and matching funds, with a maximum federal share of 75%. For FY2008, $980.5 million was provided for the FWS program, with a maximum federal share of 75%. The House bill proposed $490 million in supplemental FY2009 appropriations for the FWS program, while the Senate bill did not provide any additional funding. The ARRA allocated $200 million in supplemental discretionary appropriations for the FWS program for FY2009. The Federal Perkins Loan program offers low-interest federal student loans to undergraduate, graduate, and professional students, with undergraduates able to borrow up to $5,000 per year. The Federal Perkins Loan program provides low-interest federal student loans to undergraduate, graduate, and professional students. Borrowers may qualify for loan cancellation benefits if employed in certain public service jobs. Federal funding is authorized for capital contributions to participating institutions' revolving loan funds, allocated based on prior years' funding and institutional need. The Federal Perkins Loan program received no funding for capital contributions in FY2008, with $64.3 million allocated for loan cancellations. The Senate bill proposed $61 million for capital contributions, while the House bill did not allocate any funds. The ARRA did not provide funding for the Federal Perkins Loan program. Additionally, the House bill included $50 million for student aid administration in FY2009. The Federal Perkins Loan program did not receive funding for capital contributions in FY2008, with $64.3 million allocated for loan cancellations. The House bill included $50 million for student aid administration in FY9, while the ARRA provided $60 million for student aid administration in FY2009 for various student aid programs. The administration of various federal grant and loan programs, including Pell Grants, Teacher Quality Partnership Grants, and higher education facility modernization grants, received funding in FY2008 and FY2009. The ARRA provided additional funding for Teacher Quality Partnership Grants in FY2009. The House bill allocated $6 million for the Secretary of Education for grants to SEAs in all states and territories based on the number of undergraduate students. SEAs would use the funds to support modernization, renovation, or repair of facilities at postsecondary schools, with priority given to minority-serving institutions and those impacted by disasters. The ARRA does not provide dedicated federal funds for higher education facilities modernization but allows the use of funds under the State Fiscal Stabilization Fund. The federal government offers student loan programs through the FFEL and DL programs to help finance postsecondary education costs for students and parents. The FFEL and DL programs offer low-interest student loans with maximum rates set by statute. Subsidized Stafford Loans are need-based, with the government paying interest while borrowers are in school. Unsubsidized Stafford Loans and PLUS Loans are non-need-based, with borrowers responsible for interest. Loan amounts are limited by statutory limits. The ECASLA increased annual and aggregate borrowing limits for total Stafford Loans for dependent undergraduate students, independent undergraduate students, graduate and professional students. The ECASLA increased annual and aggregate borrowing limits for total Stafford Loans for undergraduate students, effective for loans first disbursed on or after July 1, 2008. The HEOA made technical changes to these loan limits. Annual total Stafford Loan limits were increased by $2,000 for most undergraduate student borrowers. Aggregate borrowing limits were increased by $8,000 for dependent undergraduate students and by $11,500 for independent undergraduate students. The House bill would have further increased these limits for loans first disbursed on or after January 1, 2009. The Senate bill did not make changes to Stafford Loan limits under the ARRA. Lenders receive a federal subsidy on loans through the special allowance payment (SAP) under the FFEL program. The SAP amount is determined quarterly, and the federal government pays any special allowance due lenders from disbursement through repayment. The House bill proposed a temporary change to the special allowance payment (SAP) formula for loans disbursed after January 1, 2000, switching the index from the three-month CP rate to the three-month LIBOR for USD. This change would have been effective from October 1, 2008, to December 31, 2008. The Senate bill did not make any changes to the SAP formula, and under the ARRA, no changes were made either. IES conducts research and evaluation activities in education to inform practice and policy. The House bill proposed $250 million in FY2009 for a grant program to support statewide data systems for education. The ARRA also includes $250 million for this program, allowing for postsecondary and workforce data integration. ARRA allows statewide data systems to include postsecondary education and workforce information, with up to $5 million for state data coordinators and organizations to improve data collection. The House and Senate bills proposed supplemental FY2009 appropriations for a State Fiscal Stabilization Fund, with $79 billion in the House bill and $39 billion in the Senate bill. Funds would be available in different installments, with reservations made before grants to states. The Secretary could reserve up to $12.5 million each year. The Senate bill proposed reserving funds for administration, oversight, State Incentive Grants, and an Innovation Fund. After reservations, $31.790 billion would be available in 2009 and 2010 for grants to states. Under the House and Senate bills in 2010, funds for grants to states would be allocated based on population measures. Governors would be required to use a portion of the funds for education, with differences in allocation percentages between the two bills. The Senate bill proposed using funds to restore state funding for elementary and secondary education to FY2008 levels, as well as for state equity and adequacy adjustments. The governor would also need to use the funds to restore state support for postsecondary education to FY2008 levels. The Senate bill proposed restoring state funding for elementary and secondary education to FY2008 levels, along with equity/adequacy adjustments. The governor would allocate funds between elementary and secondary education and postsecondary education based on the relative shortfall in state support at each level. Any remaining funds would be used to provide grants to LEAs based on their share of Title I-A funding. The House bill allowed for up to 39% of state funds to be used for public safety and government services, with the possibility of additional assistance for education and higher education. Both the House and Senate bills proposed using funds from the State Fiscal Stabilization Fund for education, with states required to provide assurances to the Department of Education. States had to maintain support for elementary and secondary education and public institutions of higher education at FY2006 levels for FY2009 and FY2010. Additionally, states had to establish a longitudinal data system as outlined in the America COMPETES Act. Both the House and Senate bills proposed using funds from the State Fiscal Stabilization Fund for education. The bills required states to provide assurances related to the equitable distribution of teachers between high- and low-poverty schools, but they approached this assurance differently. The House bill required compliance with ESEA requirements to eliminate teacher distribution inequities, while the Senate bill focused on implementing activities to reform teacher certification and establish alternative routes for certification. The House and Senate bills aimed to increase the number of effective teachers and principals in high-poverty schools by reforming teacher certification and improving state assessments. Compliance with ESEA and IDEA requirements for including children with disabilities and limited English proficient students in assessments was also required. The Senate bill focused on improving state academic standards to align with postsecondary education and workforce needs, while also ensuring compliance with requirements for schools in corrective actions under ESEA Title I-A. $7.5 billion would be reserved for State. The bills required the Secretary to reserve $7.5 billion for State Incentive Grants and an Innovation Fund. State Incentive Grants would be awarded to states making progress in meeting requirements, with at least 50% allocated to LEAs. The Secretary could also establish an Innovation Fund with funds for discretionary grants to eligible entities showing significant gains. The Secretary would allocate funds to grantees showing gains in closing academic achievement gaps to expand activities and serve as models. Funds could be used for various educational purposes under ESEA, IDEA, or Perkins Act, excluding capital expenditures. No funds could be used for financial assistance. The ARRA provides $53.6 billion in supplemental FY2009 appropriations for a State Fiscal Stabilization Fund (SFSF). Funds could be used by public IHEs for educational and general expenditures, but not for raising endowments or construction. The fund includes provisions from both the House and Senate bills, allowing for special education services for pupils with disabilities and mitigating the need to raise tuition for in-state students. The State Fiscal Stabilization Fund under P.L. 111-5 allocates $53.6 billion, with a maximum reservation of $268 million for outlying areas. These funds are distributed based on needs determined by the Secretary of Education. Outlying areas must use the funds for authorized activities. The Secretary can reserve funds for administration and oversight, as well as provide State Incentive Grants and establish an Innovation Fund. The State Fiscal Stabilization Fund allocates $53.6 billion, with $5 billion reserved for State Incentive Grants and an Innovation Fund. $48.318 billion will be available for grants to states, allocated based on population measures. Governors must use 81.8% of the state's allocation for education programs, including restoring funding for elementary and secondary education in FY2009, FY2010, and FY2011. The State Fiscal Stabilization Fund allocates $53.6 billion, with $5 billion reserved for State Incentive Grants and an Innovation Fund. $48.318 billion will be available for grants to states, allocated based on population measures. Governors must use 81.8% of the state's allocation for education programs, including restoring funding for elementary and secondary education in FY2009, FY2010, and FY2011 through the state's funding formula. Funds must be provided directly to LEAs, and the governor is required to use these funds to restore state support for public IHEs to the greater of FY2008 or FY2009 level for FY2009, FY2010, and FY2011. The governor must allocate funds to restore state support for education to FY2008 or FY2009 levels, with formula increases and adjustments for FY2009, FY2010, and FY2011. If funds remain, 81.8% goes to LEAs based on Title I-A funding, and 18.2% for public safety and government services, including education and school modernization. The ARRA provides funds for modernization, renovation, and repair of public school facilities and IHEs' facilities, with the option to use a green building rating system. Governors can allocate funds for IHEs based on HEA criteria and Title IV eligibility. Funds for elementary and secondary education can be used for various authorized activities under ESEA, IDEA, Adult and Family Literacy Act, or Perkins Act. The Perkins Career and Technical Education Act (Perkins Act) allows LEAs to use funds for school facilities modernization, renovation, and repair consistent with green building systems. Impact Aid programs provide funds to LEAs for various authorized activities under state and local law. According to ED policy guidance, school districts use Impact Aid for various expenses such as teacher salaries, purchasing equipment, after school programs, and enrichment programs. Most funds are considered general aid and can be used as needed, including for capital expenditures. LEAs can also use funds from the State Fiscal Stabilization Fund for activities authorized under the ESEA, including Impact Aid programs. LEAs can use State Fiscal Stabilization Funds for various purposes authorized under state and local law, including new construction, but not for maintenance costs, stadiums, vehicles, or improvements of private schools. Public IHEs receiving State Fiscal Stabilization Funds must use the funds for education and general expenditures, modernization, renovation, or repair of facilities primarily used for instruction, research, or student housing. Non-public IHEs meeting the criteria may receive funds from the 18.2% of state funds available for public safety and other government services, with unclear guidelines on fund usage. The ARRA includes prohibitions on fund use. The ARRA includes prohibitions on the use of funds by IHEs, such as not using funds to increase endowment or for maintenance of systems, equipment, or facilities. Additionally, funds cannot be used for modernization, renovation, or repair of stadiums primarily used for athletic events, or facilities used for religious instruction. States applying for funds must submit an application with required information and assurances. The State Fiscal Stabilization Funds will be used for maintenance of effort requirements under ESEA and IDEA, focusing on state support for education, equity in teacher distribution, data collection, standards and assessments, and support for struggling schools. States must agree to maintain support for education at least at the level provided in FY2006 for FY2009, FY2010, and FY2011. The state must ensure equitable distribution of teachers between high- and low-poverty schools to comply with ESEA requirements. They must establish a longitudinal data system and enhance state assessments in reading, math, and science. The state must comply with ESEA and IDEA requirements for assessments in reading, math, and science, including accommodations for students with disabilities and limited English proficiency. They also need to improve academic standards in alignment with the America COMPETES Act. The state must ensure compliance with academic standards aligned with postsecondary education and workforce needs. The Secretary reserves funds for State Incentive Grants and an Innovation Fund to support struggling schools. The Secretary allocates a large amount of funding at their discretion for State Incentive Grants. States must submit an application detailing their progress in meeting assurances, strategies for disadvantaged students, achievement rates, and strategies for meeting academic standards. The Secretary allocates funding for State Incentive Grants based on state applications detailing progress in meeting academic standards, strategies for disadvantaged students, and achievement rates. States must use at least 50% of the grant for subgrants to LEAs. Up to $650 million can be used to establish an Innovation Fund for academic achievement awards to LEAs or partnerships. The Secretary allocates funding for State Incentive Grants based on state applications detailing progress in meeting academic standards and strategies for disadvantaged students. Up to $650 million can be used to establish an Innovation Fund for academic achievement awards to eligible entities that have significantly closed achievement gaps, exceeded state objectives, shown improvement in various areas, and have private sector partnerships with matching funds. Funds received by eligible entities will be used to expand their work, partner with the private sector, document best practices, and create models to be shared. States must report on fund usage, job creation, tax savings, meeting assurances, tuition changes, enrollment shifts, and project funding. The Secretary must report to committees within six months. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) must evaluate State Incentive Grants and Innovation Fund programs. Congress debates giving states and LEAs more flexibility with fiscal accountability requirements for federal education funds. There is discussion on whether State Fiscal Stabilization Fund money could be considered \"non-federal\" funds in certain cases. The fiscal accountability requirements for federal education funds aim to ensure that federal funding supplements, not replaces, state and local education funding. These requirements ensure that federal funds provide a net increase in financial resources for specific educational services, rather than serving as general subsidies to state and local governments. The fiscal accountability requirements for federal K-12 education aid programs include maintenance of effort (MOE) and supplement, not supplant (SNS) provisions. MOE mandates a minimum level of state and local funding from the previous year, while SNS ensures that federal funds enhance, not replace, existing state and local resources for eligible students. The fiscal requirements under ESEA Title I-A include providing services funded by state and local funds that are comparable to non-Title I-A schools within the same LEA. Comparability is a distinctive fiscal requirement that ensures services are equitable across all schools participating in Title I-A. The MOE requirement for federal K-12 education programs mandates that LEAs must spend at least 90% of the previous year's funding from state and local sources to be eligible for ESEA Title I-A grants. Failure to meet this requirement results in a reduced grant. The Secretary can waive the MOE requirement in cases of exceptional circumstances or financial decline. Under IDEA, MOE applies to both SEAs and LEAs based on 100% of previous spending levels. LEAs can reduce funding by up to 50% of annual increases in IDEA allocations for specified purposes. MOE is based on spending for special education services, not total state and local spending. Failure to meet MOE results in a reduced grant, which can be waived in exceptional circumstances. Under IDEA, the state must provide clear evidence that all children with disabilities receive a free appropriate public education to waive SNS requirements. IDEA also includes a requirement for FAPE to be provided to pupils with disabilities. SNS is applied to both SEAs and LEAs under Title I-A, with limited waiver authority. Waiver authority for SNS and MOE under ESEA programs was granted to areas affected by the 2005 Gulf. The waiver authority for SNS and MOE under ESEA programs was granted to areas affected by the 2005 Gulf Coast hurricanes for FY2006 and 2007. The ARRA implicitly applies current statutory provisions regarding MOE and SNS to increased appropriations for ESEA Title I-A and the IDEA. The State Fiscal Stabilization program has a MOE requirement based on state-source revenues for public K-12 education and higher education in FY2006, with no SNS requirement at any level. The MOE requirement for the Fiscal Stabilization program could be waived or modified by the Secretary of Education. The Secretary of Education can waive or modify the MOE requirement for the State Fiscal Stabilization program for FY2009-FY2011 if the state maintains or increases funding for education. States can use State Fiscal Stabilization Fund grants as \"non-federal funds\" with approval to meet MOE requirements under various education programs. The Secretary will be concerned if a state reduces the proportion of state revenues spent on education. The Secretary of Education can waive or modify the MOE requirement for the State Fiscal Stabilization program for FY2009-FY2011 if the state maintains or increases funding for education. States can use State Fiscal Stabilization Fund grants as \"non-federal funds\" with approval to meet MOE requirements under various education programs. The Secretary will consider reductions in state revenue spent on education, without impacting required levels of state and local funding in subsequent years. This provision may allow approved states to reduce spending for K-12 education without jeopardizing eligibility for funding under IDEA or Title I-A and other ESEA programs. However, the full impact of this authority is unclear, as SNS requirements would still apply to certain programs. The Congressional Research Service (CRS) provides estimates for congressional decision-making on legislation, but the executive branch is responsible for implementing laws and developing allocations. CRS estimates may differ from actual allocations due to data differences or interpretation of statutory language. Once executive branch agencies develop state allocations for formula grants, they are the authoritative sources on grant amounts. The executive branch agencies are the authoritative sources on grant amounts for education programs. The House-passed version of H.R. 1 would have provided $145.005 billion, while the Senate bill would have provided $79.964 billion for such programs. Table A-1 provides an overview of the specific funding provided by the ARRA, and the funding that would have been provided under the House and Senate bills."
