    "content": "The U.S. and South Korea signed the KORUS FTA in 2007, the second-largest U.S. free-trade agreement. The auto sector provisions, including rules of origin for automobiles and auto parts, have been controversial and modified in 2010. Debate continues in Congress over these provisions determining duty-free benefits under the agreement. The report discusses the rules of origin for automotive goods in the KORUS FTA between the United States and South Korea, comparing them to the EU agreement. It also raises concerns about potential circumvention of rules by allowing components from North Korea's Kaesong Industrial Complex to enter the US duty-free in assembled vehicles. Motor vehicle assemblers like Ford, Chrysler, General Motors, Honda, and Hyundai are involved in the production process. Motor vehicle assemblers like Ford, Chrysler, General Motors, Honda, and Hyundai build vehicles using parts from a global network of suppliers. Around 15,000 components are needed to assemble a vehicle, with Tier 1 suppliers providing entire systems like seats and cooling systems. Tier 2 suppliers provide components to Tier 1 suppliers, while Tier 3 suppliers offer simpler products like bolts and plastic moldings. The diversity of parts in a 2011 Hyundai Sonata is shown in Figure 1. Automakers source parts globally for vehicle assembly in the US. Rules of origin impact tariffs on imported inputs. Mexico and Canada are major suppliers under NAFTA, while China's share of parts imports has increased. South Korea's share has grown due to Korean-owned assembly plants in the US. The American Automobile Labeling Act (AALA) mandates the documentation of the percentage of a vehicle's parts that originate in the United States and Canada. This information is provided annually by the U.S. Department of Transportation's National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). The AALA does not differentiate between U.S. and Canadian parts, making it difficult to determine the exact percentage of U.S. content in vehicles. The percentage of U.S. content in motor vehicles has become increasingly international, with domestic carmakers relying more on imported parts. For cars assembled in the United States, the percentage of imported auto parts increased from 20% in 1997 to 29% in 2005. Foreign carmakers are also using more parts produced in the U.S., with some cars having less than 5% domestic content while others have 80% or more. For example, 60% of parts in the Ford F-Series pickup truck are from the U.S. or Canada. The U.S. and Canadian content in South Korean carlines varies from 2% in the Hyundai Accent to 41% in the Hyundai Sonata. Free trade agreements aim to eliminate trade barriers between countries, with rules of origin ensuring products receive preferential tariff treatment. Determining the country of origin becomes complex when a product's component parts are manufactured in multiple countries. Determining the origin of products for favorable tariff treatment under free trade agreements can be complex due to the various rules of origin. Different industry sectors within an FTA may have specific rules, such as the motor vehicle industry which uses a regional value content test. This test requires a certain percentage of the product's value to originate within the FTA member countries. The regional value content (RVC) requirements for automotive products under free trade agreements (FTAs) vary and create incentives for sourcing within the agreement region. The United States has concluded multiple FTAs over the past two decades, leading to consultations between industry representatives and trade negotiators to ensure compliance with rules of origin. The regional value content requirements in FTAs create incentives for sourcing within the agreement region. Tariff incentives may not always prompt changes in supply chains, as seen with the low U.S. NTR tariff rate for passenger cars. However, the higher tariff on light trucks could lead to cost savings for manufacturers building trucks in the U.S. or an FTA partner country, influencing production locations. The United States benefits from manufacturing in North America due to higher tariff rates on automobiles in FTA partner markets. For example, NTR tariffs in CAFTA-DR countries can be as high as 20%, highlighting the advantage for U.S. automakers. NAFTA requires a 62.5% regional value content for automotive products to receive tariff benefits. The NAFTA agreement requires a 62.5% regional value content for automotive products to receive tariff benefits. Other FTAs have varying regional value content rules for auto products, ranging from 30% to 50%. Current U.S. NTR tariffs for autos and most auto parts are 2.5%, while in South Korea, tariffs for comparable products can be as high as 8%. If the KORUS FTA is enacted, tariffs on passenger cars, light trucks, and auto parts in the US and South Korea would be phased out over 10 years. US and South Korean car tariffs would be eliminated in 5 years, while the US light truck tariff would be phased out over 10 years. South Korea would eliminate its 10% tariff on US light trucks immediately. Auto parts tariffs would be eliminated right after the KORUS FTA implementation. The agreement also has specific rules of origin requiring products to be produced in either the US or South Korea. Under the proposed KORUS FTA, products must be produced in the United States or South Korea to meet the rule of origin requirements. Automotive assembly alone is not enough to qualify for preferential treatment, as a significant portion of the cost must come from components sourced from the US or South Korea. Automakers and component manufacturers have flexibility in calculating regional value content, with three options available. RVC is determined as a percentage of the product's adjusted value. The three options for calculating regional value content under the proposed KORUS FTA vary in required percentage: 55% under build-down method, 35% under build-up method, or 35% under net-cost method. The build-down method subtracts non-originating merchandise value from adjusted value of finished product, including all costs and expenses. This method allows manufacturers to count all costs involved in building and marketing the final product. The build-down method accounts for 55% of regional value content calculation in the KORUS FTA. Auto parts suppliers use similar methodologies for imported components. The build-up method combines values from South Korea and the US, qualifying for benefits if it exceeds 35% of the adjusted value. The net cost method in the KORUS FTA benefits manufacturers of exports other than automobiles by capturing only manufacturing costs like labor and materials, excluding other expenses. U.S. automakers prefer this method as it aligns with their production and accounting practices, making it easier to calculate Regional Value Content (RVC). The KORUS FTA allows motor vehicle producers to average their content over their fiscal year when calculating their regional value content under the net cost method for automotive goods. This method is preferred by U.S. automakers as it aligns with their production and accounting practices, making it easier to calculate RVC. In addition, the South Korean government has negotiated the KOREU FTA with the European Union, which requires importers of automotive products to use a different method. The KOREU FTA requires importers of automotive products to use the ex-works price method for calculating regional value content, with a 45% limit on foreign content. This corresponds to the 55% regional value content rule in the KORUS FTA build-down method. The KOREU FTA requires using the ex-works price method for calculating regional value content with a 45% limit on foreign content, similar to the 55% rule in the KORUS FTA. The methodologies for calculating RVC differ between the two FTAs, but both require a certain percentage of the product's value to originate in the US or South Korea for preferential tariff treatment. Enforcement of automotive rules of origin in the KORUS FTA depends on identifying the value of products made in the US or South Korea. South Korean manufacturers use inputs from the Kaesong Industrial Complex in North Korea, raising concerns about circumventing US restrictions on North Korean goods. The KORUS FTA allows North Korea duty-free access to the U.S. market, potentially impacting automotive imports due to low labor costs at the Kaesong Industrial Complex. Annex 22-B establishes a process for determining goods produced on the Korean Peninsula as \"originating goods\" for preferential tariff treatment. A Committee on Outward Processing Zones would be created by the U.S. and South Korea for this purpose. The United States and South Korea would establish a committee to consider duty-free treatment for products from the Kaesong Industrial Complex in North Korea. The committee would assess criteria such as environmental and labor standards, as well as progress on denuclearization. If approved by OFAC, North Korean inputs could be included in South Korean products exported to the U.S. under KORUS FTA rules. The United Steelworkers labor union raised concerns about the potential for products or components from the Kaesong Industrial Complex (KIC) in North Korea to enter the U.S. market under the KORUS FTA. U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) faces challenges in identifying the origin of every component in vehicles due to the complex supply chain. CBP officials believe their targeting, verification, and enforcement processes help mitigate this risk. CBP faces challenges in identifying the origin of components in vehicles due to the complex supply chain. While monitoring and assurances from South Korean officials may indicate no North Korean content in goods under the KORUS FTA, it is impossible to be 100% certain. Illicit North Korean parts could enter U.S. commerce illegally, with or without the KORUS FTA in force. Custom cooperation and trade facilitation in the agreement aim to address these concerns. The facilitation chapter in the KORUS FTA will simplify the detection of unauthorized North Korean products by allowing U.S. officials to inspect South Korean factories and shipment documentation. Mandated information sharing and intelligence will help reduce unlawful trade. The Korean Customs Service is implementing new measures to prevent circumvention of origin rules, including establishing an office of 157 customs officers to track the shipment process for all products, not just the auto industry. Targeted inspections of high-risk cargoes will also be conducted. The KORUS FTA includes targeted inspections of high-risk cargoes, such as auto parts shipments, to detect unauthorized North Korean products. U.S. customs officials utilize the \"e-Allegations\" online trade reporting system for additional targeting information. Automotive-related issues are prominent in the agreement due to South Korea's significant vehicle production and export capabilities. The South Korean automobile industry, led by Hyundai and Kia, has found success in the United States market due to the high quality of their cars and low U.S. tariffs. In 2010, Hyundai and Kia sold nearly 895,000 cars and light trucks in the U.S., marking a 22% increase from the previous year. Additionally, South Korea imported over 90,000 cars in 2010, with 7,450 coming from the United States. Daewoo Motors, a subsidiary of General Motors, also sold over 125,000 vehicles in South Korea. Daewoo Motors, a subsidiary of General Motors, sold over 125,000 vehicles in South Korea in 2010. The KORUS FTA may impact U.S. automotive exports to South Korea, with a focus on reducing non-tariff barriers and changing environmental and safety rules for imported vehicles."
