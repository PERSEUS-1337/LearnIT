    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Education for Retirement Security Act of 2002\". Improving financial literacy is crucial for Americans of all ages. Low savings and high debt levels are serious issues for many nearing retirement. Only 53% of working Americans have pension coverage, with 3 out of 4 women over 65 receiving no pension income. Limited time for mid-life and older individuals to make informed financial decisions has immediate consequences for those nearing retirement age. Research shows that retirement income security relies on social security benefits, pensions, savings, healthcare insurance, and earnings from working during retirement. The $5 trillion loss in stock market equity since 2000 has negatively impacted mid-life and older individuals, affecting their pension plans and retirement accounts. Despite the perception that older individuals are financially stable, nearly 18% are living below 125% of the poverty line. Over the next 30 years, the number of older individuals in the United States is expected to double to nearly 75,000,000. Financial exploitation is a major issue for this population, with identity theft incidents targeting individuals over 60 increasing threefold from 2000 to 2001. SEC. 3. Grant program to enhance financial and retirement literacy, reduce financial abuse and fraud among mid-life and older Americans. The Secretary is authorized to award grants to eligible entities to provide financial education programs for mid-life and older individuals to enhance financial knowledge and reduce financial abuse and fraud. Eligible entities include State agencies, area agencies on aging, and nonprofit organizations with a proven record of serving older individuals and low-income families. An eligible entity seeking a grant must submit an application to the Secretary with a plan for sustaining programs post-grant. Recipients are limited to using 4% of the grant for administrative costs annually. The Secretary will establish performance measures to evaluate the programs funded by the grant. The Secretary will evaluate programs funded by grants to judge performance, identify best practices, and determine replicable programs. Annual reports to Congress will include program descriptions and evaluation results. The National Training and Technical Assistance Program is established. The Secretary is authorized to award grants to eligible entities for creating financial education materials and providing training. Eligible entities must be national nonprofit organizations with experience in financial education. Applications must be submitted to the Secretary, and grants are awarded on a competitive basis for a 5-year term. SEC. 5. DEFINITIONS. This Act defines financial education as promoting understanding of consumer, economic, and personal finance concepts, including retirement savings and education on predatory lending. It also defines \"mid-life individual\" as aged 45-64 and \"older individual\" as aged 65 or older. SEC. 6. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. Authorization of Appropriations: $100,000,000 authorized annually for fiscal years 2003-2007. Limitations on fund usage: $200,000 for evaluation and report, 5-10% for training and technical assistance."
