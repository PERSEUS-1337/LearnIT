    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Microbicides Development Act of 2000\". It includes findings related to microbicides development. The Congress finds that annually at least 1 billion people worldwide contract one of eight sexually transmitted diseases, with hepatitis B, herpes, HIV, and human papilloma virus being incurable and representing two-thirds of new infections. In 1999, 15.4 million people in the United States acquired at least one of these diseases, making it the highest rate in the industrialized world. At least 66 million Americans are now living with an incurable viral STD. The total costs of STDs to the U.S. economy, excluding HIV, were $16 billion, which increases to $23 billion when including HIV. STDs cause high human costs in pain, disability, and mortality, with women facing infertility, cancers, and pregnancy complications. These infections can also affect infants with low birthweight, pneumonia, and congenital abnormalities, while increasing susceptibility to HIV. Individuals of all backgrounds are affected by STDs. In the United States, HIV morbidity and mortality are highest among African Americans, who account for almost half of AIDS deaths and new cases. African American women aged 25-44 have AIDS as the second leading cause of death. Women are more vulnerable to STDs than men, with many infections going undetected in women, leading to delayed diagnosis and severe complications. Adolescents are also affected by STDs globally. (8) Adolescents and young adults in the United States and globally are at high risk of acquiring sexually-transmitted infections, with a significant number of new cases occurring in teens and young people aged 15-24. By age 24, at least 1 in 3 sexually-active Americans will have contracted an STD, with teenage girls being particularly vulnerable. \n(9) STDs pose significant social, health, and economic burdens, especially in developing countries where they are the second largest cause of mortality and disability among women aged 15-49. \n(10) AIDS is increasingly affecting women, with women in the United States being the fastest-growing group affected by the disease. In the United States, women are the fastest-growing group newly infected with HIV, while in Africa, more women are getting infected than men. Globally, almost half of the 14,000 adults infected daily with HIV in 1998 were women, with 9 out of 10 living in developing countries. Microbicides are being explored as a new technology to prevent STDs, including HIV, by being used vaginally to protect women, partners, and infants from transmission. Safe, effective, undetectable topical microbicides can be used discreetly without partner knowledge or consent, in addition to condoms or when condom use is not possible. The National Institutes of Health are conducting research on microbicides to prevent the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases. These microbicides can be used discreetly without partner knowledge or consent, in addition to condoms or when condom use is not possible. The Director of NIH is expanding and coordinating research activities on microbicides to prevent sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV. This includes establishing a program to support the development of microbicides that can reduce transmission. The Director of NIH is expanding research on microbicides to prevent sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV. This involves developing microbicides to reduce transmission through various research activities such as basic research, animal models, mucosal delivery systems, clinical trials, and behavioral research on microbicide use. An implementation plan will be developed to ensure the success of these research programs. An implementation plan will be developed to ensure the success of research programs on microbicides to prevent sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV. The plan will include objectives, institutes involved, capacity for research, grant and contract mechanisms, and plans for increasing research capacity. The Director will develop a plan to increase the number of investigators in microbicide research. Public comments will be solicited, and a report to Congress will be submitted annually on the activities of the Institute in this research area. The Director will assess the development, revision, and implementation of the plan for microbicide research, evaluate progress in research, analyze expenditures by the National Institutes of Health, and provide comments and recommendations. Coordination with other agencies like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the United States Agency for International Development will be done in developing the research plan. The authorization of appropriations for microbicide research includes $50,000,000 for fiscal year 2001, $75,000,000 for fiscal year 2002, and $100,000,000 for fiscal year 2003, with additional funding for 2004 and 2005 as needed. Title II of the Public Health Service Act authorizes funding for microbicide research at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to prevent the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases. The Secretary will expand, intensify, and coordinate microbicide research activities to prevent sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV. $7,000,000 for fiscal year 2001, $11,000,000 for fiscal year 2002, and $15,000,000 for fiscal year 2003 are authorized for this purpose."
