    "content": "The Act titled \"Grand Teton National Park Extension Act of 2007\" defines key terms like \"Park,\" \"Secretary,\" and \"Subdivision,\" which refers to the GT Park Subdivision. It also includes details on the acquisition of land. The Secretary may accept land donations for the Park and must include it in the Park boundaries. Land acquisition should be completed within 1 year, and any transfer of acquired land requires Congressional authorization. The Act also mentions the Craig Thomas Discovery and Visitor Center. Congress acknowledges Craig Thomas' strong connection to Yellowstone National Park and Grand Teton National Park, highlighting his dedication to public land values. During his 18-year congressional tenure, Thomas made significant legislative contributions in various areas such as public land management, agriculture, fiscal responsibility, and rural health care. As Chairman and Ranking Member of the National Parks Subcommittee, he played a key role in overseeing the National Park System, including frequent visits to Yellowstone and Grand Teton. Craig Thomas, as a strong proponent for the National Park System, authored legislation for funding and management reforms to protect natural and cultural resources. He also supported public-private partnerships to enhance visitor services and citizen involvement in park stewardship. Craig Thomas was instrumental in obtaining federal funding for a public-private partnership to build a new visitor center at Grand Teton National Park. He passed away in 2007 after battling cancer for 7 months, leaving behind his wife and children. In his memory, the Grand Teton Discovery and Visitor Center should be dedicated to honor his service to the National Park System and specifically to Grand Teton National Park. The Grand Teton Discovery and Visitor Center in Moose, Wyoming will be named the \"Craig Thomas Discovery and Visitor Center\" in honor of Craig Thomas, who played a key role in securing funding for its construction. Any references to the center in official documents will now be to the \"Craig Thomas Discovery and Visitor Center.\" Authorization of appropriations is granted to the Secretary as necessary to carry out the Act."
