The act defines a 10-percent shareholder and outlines short-term capital gain dividends. Short-term capital gain dividends from regulated investment companies are generally not taxed, except for nonresident alien individuals subject to tax under subsection (a)(2). These dividends are designated as short-term capital gain dividends in written notices. The company designates short-term capital gain dividends in written notices to shareholders within 60 days after the close of its taxable year. If the total designated amount exceeds the company's qualified short-term gain for the year, the distribution of short-term capital gain dividends is based on the proportion of qualified short-term gain to the total designated amount. The term 'qualified short-term gain' for a regulated investment company is the excess of its net short-term capital gain over any net long-term capital loss for the taxable year. This calculation includes treating short-term capital gain dividends as short-term gains. The excess of net short-term capital gain over net long-term capital loss for a taxable year is determined without considering any losses from transactions after October 31.
