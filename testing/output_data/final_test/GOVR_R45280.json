    "content": "The Board of Governors of the U.S. Postal Service, established in 1970, functions like a board of directors for the USPS. Comprised of 11 members, including nine Governors appointed by the President, the Board oversees the Postal Service's operations and expenditures. The Board also includes the Postmaster General, who is appointed by the Governors. The Board of Governors of the U.S. Postal Service consists of 11 members, including nine Governors appointed by the President. The Governors serve staggered terms, with the first nine appointees serving terms of one to nine years. The Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act reduced the staggered terms to seven years and requires that Governors represent the public interest. The President consults with key congressional leaders in selecting a nominee to the Board. The process of selecting a nominee to the Board of Governors of the U.S. Postal Service involves consultation between the President, the leader of the Senate, and the minority leader of the Senate. The statute specifies that no more than 5 Governors can be from the same political party, but does not outline the order of nominations. Senate procedural considerations, such as holds placed by Senators, can impact the confirmation process. Ultimately, the majority leader decides whether to honor a hold request. The appointment and removal of the Postmaster General and Deputy Postmaster General at USPS are unique, as they are done by the Governors rather than the President and Senate. There are no term limits for these positions, and the current composition of the Board raises questions about the appointment process. The Board currently has no Governors, with the last term expiring in 2016. The Board includes the Postmaster General, Megan J. Brennan, and the Deputy Postmaster General, Ronald A. Stroman. President Obama nominated seven Governors for the USPS during the 114th Congress, but all nominations were returned to him. Only one nomination received a hearing, and all were reported favorably by the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs. President Trump sent four nominations for Governors of the USPS to the Senate during the 115th Congress. President Trump sent four nominations for Governors of the USPS to the Senate on October 30, 2017. Three nominees were placed on the Senate Executive Calendar on May 7, 2018, with one nominee receiving a hearing on April 18, 2018. Certain matters are reserved for decision by the Governors alone, including the appointment and removal of the Postmaster General. The absence of Governors on the USPS Board may not affect day-to-day operations, but certain actions require Board approval. Vacancies do not prevent the Board from conducting business as long as there is a quorum of at least six members present. The Board lost its quorum in 2014 when a Governor's term expired. The former Governor Mickey D. Barnett's term expired on December 8, 2014, reducing the USPS Board to five members. Before losing its quorum, the Board delegated authority to a Temporary Emergency Committee (TEC) for continuity of postal operations. The absence of Governors on the Board leaves the USPS without legal authority for certain actions that require Governor approval. The Inspector General is appointed by the Governors and may be removed only for cause with the concurrence of at least 7 Governors. In case of incapacitation of the Postmaster General, the Deputy Postmaster General followed by the Vice President, Area Operations, Eastern Area, are in line to perform duties. The Governors have sole authority to establish rates for Competitive Mail Products and adjust rates of Market Dominant Products. Without at least one sitting Governor, the USPS cannot perform these actions. Without a sitting Governor, the USPS cannot perform actions listed in Table 2 without legal challenge. Governor Bilbray allowed for a rate increase for USPS competitive products in January 2018. The Board's quorum was lost before new Governors could act on reserved matters. The Board delegated authority to the TEC for continuity of postal operations due to the loss of its quorum. The Board will operate without a quorum until four or more Governors are confirmed. Newly appointed Governors' membership in the TEC was not specified in the resolution."
