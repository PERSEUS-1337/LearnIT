    "content": "Several hundred informal Member organizations exist within the House of Representatives and Senate, reflecting Members' shared legislative objectives or representational interests. These groups, known as congressional caucuses, working groups, or task forces, are collectively referred to as informal Member organizations in this report. Some groups in the House of Representatives register with the Committee on House Administration to form Congressional Member Organizations (CMOs), which can include House Members or both House Members and Senators. Informal Member organizations not registered with the Committee are called informal Member groups. Informal Member organizations in the House and Senate, known as congressional caucuses, working groups, or task forces, can be either registered as Congressional Member Organizations (CMOs) with the Committee on House Administration or remain unregistered as informal Member groups. CMOs support common legislative objectives and may consist of House Members exclusively or include Senators as well. The process of forming a CMO involves considerations such as defining the group's objective and potential membership, which may also be relevant for Senators or House Members forming informal Member groups. To register as a Congressional Member Organization (CMO) with the Committee on House Administration, at least one officer must be a House Member. Groups seeking CMO status must submit a letter with details like the group's name, purpose, officers, and staff contact information. Approval by the committee is required for CMO designation. Registered CMOs approved by the Committee on House Administration can access House resources like internal mail and the intranet. They must re-register each Congress. CMOs can receive assistance from personal office staff but cannot have separate legal identities or use official funds for certain activities. Members' Representational Allowance (MRA) cannot directly support a CMO as an independent entity. Official resources can be used for CMO communications and materials, but funds from private individuals or organizations are not allowed. Personal funds can be used to support a CMO, and activities must comply with House rules and ethics guidelines. Additional guidance on CMO funding is available on the House Committee on Ethics website. Members can access CMO and informal Member group funding information on the House Committee on Ethics website. Regulations applicable to House Members also apply to their participation in CMOs. Members can seek guidance from various committees for information. Certain CMOs can be designated as ECMOs in the 114th Congress, allowing personal office staff to work for them and transfer MRA funds for salaries and expenses. H.Res. 6 directs the Committee on House Administration to create relevant regulations. The ECMO status requires groups to have been registered CMOs in the previous Congress, with shared employees from 15 House Member offices, register as a CMO in the 116th Congress, designate a single House Member as administrator, and have at least three House employees. The Committee on House Administration provides information on eligibility, disclosure requirements, registration, and regulations for ECMOs and informal Member groups in the House and Senate. Informal Member groups in the House and Senate operate similarly to CMOs but are not registered with the Committee on House Administration. Rules and regulations for House Members apply to their participation in these groups, with guidance available from the Committee on House Administration and House Committee on Ethics. The Senate does not have a registration process for informal groups, which historically have utilized resources available to Senators without additional funding or specific regulation. The Senate does not have separate regulations for informal groups of Senators, unlike the House which has rules for participation in such groups. Guidance for Senators on informal groups can be obtained from the Senate Committee on Ethics and Committee on Rules and Administration. The number of informal Member organizations has increased since the 1970s, with a significant rise since the 1990s. Informal Member organizations in Congress serve as forums for discussing public policy and legislative advocacy. The House has 158 groups and the Senate has 178 groups, some of which are bicameral. These groups facilitate discussions, educate members on policy matters, and raise public awareness on various topics through regular meetings. Informal Member organizations in Congress serve as forums for discussing public policy and legislative advocacy. These groups hold regular meetings to exchange information and develop legislative strategy, inviting outside speakers and groups to make presentations. They can have narrow or broad focuses, addressing multiple issues of concern. Members participate in these groups to achieve electoral and policy objectives, and these organizations can be established easily without enacting legislation or changing rules. Informal Member organizations in Congress serve as forums for discussing public policy and legislative advocacy. They provide a platform for resolving issue and policy differences, conducting briefings, attracting attention to important issues, and enhancing Members' relations with constituencies. However, some argue that the significance of these groups has been diminished due to their large numbers. The significance of informal Member organizations in Congress has been diminished due to their large numbers. These groups compete with formal leadership, undermine the legislative process, and may give undue attention to special interests. Ethical concerns arise regarding Member participation in outside organizations with ties to these groups. Nonprofit organizations with ties to Congressional Member Organizations (CMOs) allow Members to fundraise without conflicts of interest. House Members can serve on boards of outside groups as long as they are not compensated and their service aligns with public obligations. Fundraising for organizations controlled by Members requires approval from the House Committee on Ethics. Questions about a nonprofit's relation to a Member's duties can be directed to the Ethics Committee. Informal Member organizations are distinct from CMOs and may have broader activities. Informal Member organizations can be categorized into six groups based on their purpose: intraparty, personal interest, industry, regional, state/district, and national constituency. These groups advocate for various interests within political parties, specific industries, regions, states/districts, and national constituencies. Members who join intraparty Member organizations, such as the Blue Dog Coalition and the Republican Study Committee, exchange information and develop legislative strategy with party colleagues who share their political ideology. They work on a wide range of issues and play a significant role in agenda setting. Personal interest Member organizations, like the Congressional Diabetes Caucus and the Congressional Sportsmen's Caucus, focus on increasing awareness of issues and influencing the congressional agenda. Industry-focused CMOs, such as the Congressional Automotive Caucus, Congressional Shipbuilding Caucus, and Congressional Steel Caucus, advocate for issues related to specific industries. Members who join industry-focused Congressional Member Organizations (CMOs) like the Automotive Caucus, Shipbuilding Caucus, and Steel Caucus are strongly committed to promoting their industry's interests. They use their membership to increase congressional awareness, develop legislative strategy, and signal to constituents their active promotion of industry interests. Regional and state/district CMOs focus on promoting legislative provisions that benefit their specific region or state. National constituency CMOs, such as the Congressional Black Caucus and Congressional Hispanic Caucus, address broad concerns that span multiple committees. National constituency CMOs engage in agenda-setting activities, testify before congressional committees, and draft bills. Members join to raise awareness, exchange information, and develop legislative strategy. Informal Member organizations have existed since the earliest Congresses, promoting mutual interests outside formal systems. Key changes include the development of Legislative Service Organizations and the creation of informal Member organizations. The early Congresses saw Members residing in boardinghouses, forming voting blocs, and informal groups like the War Hawks and the Invisibles influencing decisions. The Congressional Temperance Society advocated abstinence, while the Abolitionist Group opposed slavery in the 1840s. In the mid-20th century, the Chowder and Marching Society, founded by 15 Republican House Members including Nixon and Ford, opposed costly legislation for war veterans. It later became a social forum for leading Republican Members to discuss legislation. The Acorns, formed in 1957 by freshman House Republicans, served as a social group and legislative discussion forum. The Democratic Study Group, established in 1959 by moderate and liberal House Democrats, was the first modern informal Member organization. The Democratic Study Group (DSG) was formed in 1959 by moderate and liberal House Democrats to counter the influence of southern conservative Democrats in the House committees. The membership of the DSG grew over time, reaching around 250 Members in 1980 before decreasing to around 200 in the late 1980s. The group gained influence by establishing a whip system, using paid staff for research and policy analyses, and providing essential briefing papers and information on scheduled floor votes for Members. The Democratic Study Group (DSG) provided essential briefing papers and information on scheduled floor legislation, filling an information gap for Members and legislative assistants. By 1977, a significant percentage of House Members and legislative assistants relied heavily on DSG material for legislative information. In 1963, moderate and liberal House Republican freshmen formed the Wednesday Group for exchanging information on legislation. Senators and Representatives later formed the nonpartisan Members of Congress for Peace Through Law to advocate views on foreign affairs and defense policy. Representative Paul McCloskey praised MCPL for providing knowledge outside formal committee work. The DSG is a rebel organization rebelling against close ties between the Administration and committee chairmen. Informal Member groups like the Wednesday Group and MCPL gained visibility in Congress during the 1970s. The number of informal Member organizations increased, with the establishment of groups like the Conference of Great Lakes Congressmen and the Congressional Black Caucus. By 1980, there were 59 informal Member organizations. Scholars noted that Members were expected to follow norms of seniority and legislative specialization within the committee system. Informal Member organizations emerged in the 1970s as an alternative system for policy work, allowing for individual policy specialization and representation of constituent interests. Calls for regulation of these groups arose due to concerns about lack of congressional oversight and accountability for public spending. In 1977, the Commission on Administrative Review recommended holding informal Member groups accountable for their use of public funds. The Commission on Administrative Review recommended criteria for recognizing Legislative Service Organizations, but their recommendations were not considered by the House. Informal Member groups were found to be exempt from certain House rules regarding office accounts and use of official terms. On July 18, 1979, the Committee on House Administration issued regulations governing informal Member groups' activities to prevent circumvention of House ethics rules. Groups receiving disbursements had to register as an LSO, provide financial summaries semi-annually, and have a House Member certify their compliance. LSOs receiving disbursements of $1,000 or more must have their chair certify employee salaries, locations, and duties monthly. Concerns were raised about LSOs potentially circumventing House spending rules and receiving unlimited funds from lobbying groups. The Ad hoc Subcommittee on Legislative Service Organizations was formed to address concerns about LSOs receiving funds from special interest groups, foreign governments, and federal agencies. Regulations were adopted to restrict LSOs from receiving income or contributions from sources other than Congress or its Members. The Ad hoc Subcommittee on Legislative Service Organizations was formed to address concerns about LSOs receiving funds from special interest groups, foreign governments, and federal agencies. Regulations were adopted to restrict LSOs from receiving income or contributions from sources other than Congress or its Members. LSOs are prohibited from being located in House-controlled spaces and receiving support from the House or its Members. Salary payments for LSO employees must be disbursed by the Clerk of the House based on monthly certifications from the employing Member and relevant committee members. LSOs must submit quarterly reports to the Clerk of the House with details on organization, finances, employees, and assistance provided. The reports are publicly available and aim to ensure transparency and accountability. LSOs must submit quarterly reports to the Clerk of the House detailing organization, finances, employees, and assistance provided. In the 1980s and early 1990s, the number of informal House Member organizations increased while the number of LSOs remained stable. In 1990, there were 30 registered LSOs and 63 informal House Member groups. Some Members and political organizations questioned financial integrity during this time. Some Members and political organizations raised concerns about the financial integrity of certain LSOs, criticizing incomplete and late quarterly financial reports. At a hearing in 1993, a Committee member highlighted millions of missing tax dollars in LSOs, calling it a potential national disgrace. Independent reviews revealed over $34 million in tax funds funneled into LSO operations, with $7.7 million unaccounted for. LSOs reported spending $26.8 million, with $7.7 million missing and unaccounted for. Concerns were raised about LSOs' links with external groups, nepotism, cronyism, and misuse of taxpayer funds. New financial accounting requirements were issued in response to lax filing of LSO reports. The administration issued new financial accounting requirements for LSOs in 1994, placing management under the House Finance Office. This included budget filings, adherence to House ethics rules, and annual financial disclosures. Changes in House leadership led to the elimination of LSOs and the creation of CMOs. House Speaker-elect Newt Gingrich announced the House Republican Conference resolution to prohibit LSOs, removing institutional funding. Some scholars believe this centralized control in the House by eliminating LSOs, aligning with a more hierarchical congressional structure. Members from minority parties and established LSOs opposed this decision. The Democratic Study Group, Hispanic Caucus, and Congressional Caucus for Women's Issues opposed the dissolution of LSOs. Over 150 members signed a letter to the incoming Speaker, criticizing the prohibition as an attempt to censor opposing views. LSOs were eliminated on January 4, 1995, with instructions to cease spending and vacate offices by January 31, 1995. Any remaining funds were to be returned to the U.S. Treasury. After LSOs were dissolved in January 1995, balances in LSO accounts were to be returned to the U.S. Treasury. Regulations issued on February 8, 1995, defined CMOs as informal organizations of Members sharing resources to carry out activities. CMOs have no separate legal identity, cannot appoint staff, or have separate office space. CMO organizers must register with the committee and provide necessary information. Members cannot use official funds to support CMO activities or lend their frank to a CMO. After LSOs were dissolved in January 1995, CMOs were defined as informal organizations of Members sharing resources to carry out activities. Most LSOs reorganized as informal Member groups or CMOs, while some disbanded or transferred responsibilities. Despite predictions of decline, the number of CMOs and informal Member groups increased in the late 1990s. Since the late 1990s, informal Member organizations have continued to grow in number, playing an important role in congressional policymaking. House regulations apply to Members' participation in these groups, with additional regulations from the Committee on House Administration affecting a subset known as CMOs. The independence of these organizations from formal institutions allows for collaboration among Members and leadership opportunities outside of party lines. Informal Member organizations in Congress provide opportunities for collaboration and leadership outside of party or committee assignments. Concerns may arise regarding oversight, fractionalization of the legislative process, and competition with formal leadership. These groups can facilitate deliberation, policy development, and public awareness on various topics. Considerations for House Members forming a Congressional Member Organization (CMO) include defining objectives, assessing interest, and consulting prospective core members. Various methods can be used to determine interest, such as informal discussions, communications with constituents, and personal judgment. CMOs can help consolidate issues dispersed among committees and subcommittees. When forming a Congressional Member Organization (CMO), House Members should consult with colleagues to enlist support and avoid duplication with existing groups or party positions. Considerations should also be given to the group's name and potential internal institutional concerns. When forming a Congressional Member Organization (CMO), organizers should carefully consider the group's name to avoid confusion with existing entities. Membership in CMOs is voluntary and can be open to all willing Members or limited to invitees. Membership criteria can be based on various factors such as party affiliation, regions, personal characteristics, committee assignments, and issue interests. Prospective members can be identified through committee and subcommittee membership lists. To form a Congressional Member Organization (CMO), consider the group's name to avoid confusion. Membership is voluntary and can be open to all Members or limited to invitees based on various factors. Prospective members can be identified through committee lists. The Committee on House Administration provides regulations for CMOs, available online. Contact relevant authorities for guidance. Notify the CMO's formation when necessary. To announce the formation of a Congressional Member Organization (CMO), it can be done through various channels such as the House floor, Congressional Record, media, and internal communication like \"Dear Colleague\" letters. The announcement typically invites Members to join, explains the group's goals and activities, and assures it does not replace any existing structures. Groups wishing to use personal staff or mention their membership in official communications should register with the Committee on House Administration. To register a Congressional Member Organization (CMO), groups must submit a registration form to the Committee on House Administration. Each CMO determines its own organizational structure, with at least one leader designated as the group's sponsor. Many CMOs have minimal formal structure, with founding Members often serving as officers or coordinators without formal election. Leadership responsibilities are typically informal. Several Congressional Member Organizations (CMOs) have minimal formal structure, with leadership responsibilities undertaken by volunteer Members. The structure may include officers, an executive committee, and subunits. The chair is usually a Member highly interested in the group's issues and may designate staff as key contacts. Several Congressional Member Organizations (CMOs) have a structured leadership with co-chairs from different parties, while some have a chair, vice chair, and secretary. Class groups typically have a president, vice president, and secretary. Most bicameral groups are bipartisan, reflecting their organizational structure. Many bicameral Congressional Member Organizations (CMOs) have bipartisan leadership structures, requiring members from both parties and houses. The executive committee administers activities, sets agendas, and provides expertise and advice on certain issues. Members on the committee may have jurisdiction over the group's concerns or represent specific states or regions. The selection of chairs and other officers in Congressional Member Organizations (CMOs) is left to the discretion of each CMO, with various methods such as informal selection or volunteerism being used. Some CMOs have separate advisory committees from the executive committee to handle administrative and advisory roles. In CMOs, members may serve during different sessions and can be nominated and elected. The initial chair is often the founder and may serve until no longer a member. CMOs cannot employ staff, so individual members handle business. Staff members typically work on issues related to the group. The House amended rules to allow certain CMOs to enter agreements with individual Members to contribute employment slots and a portion of their allowance to a dedicated account of the ECMO. Members interested in registering a CMO as an ECMO can consult with the Committee on House Administration for eligibility requirements and registration process."
