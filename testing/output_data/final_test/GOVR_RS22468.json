    "content": "The European Union originated in 1957 with the formation of the European Economic Community (EEC), focusing on free movement of goods, capital, services, and people among its founding members. Progress was made in reducing trade barriers, but services, capital, and people movement remained restricted. National controls on capital flows and passport checks hindered commerce and travel within the EEC. The goal was to establish a single European market for goods, services, and capital. The Single European Act (SEA) was enacted in 1987 to create a single European market for goods, services, capital, and people by 1992. Member states agreed to pass single market legislation by a qualified majority. The European Commission in Brussels proposes EU-level directives to overcome remaining barriers, which are adopted by the Council of Ministers and implemented by each member state. This legislative process has taken more than a decade to craft and implement directives governing the free movement of capital, labor, and services. Since 1987, the Single European Act aimed to create a single market for goods, services, capital, and people by 1992. Directives on capital market liberalization have been watered down, leading to limited market liberalization. Some EU member states have erected barriers to cross-border mergers, citing economic nationalism. Notable actions include France orchestrating a quick merger of two utilities, Suez SA and Gaz de France. In response to potential takeovers, France passed a decree allowing government intervention in foreign takeovers in sensitive sectors. French President Jacques Chirac opposed the merger of the New York and Euronext stock exchanges. Italian politicians considered blocking French bids for Italian companies. Spain aimed to prevent a hostile takeover of its gas utility Endesa SA by a German company. Spain aims to protect its energy companies from foreign takeovers, while Poland and Luxembourg also seek to block mergers to protect their national interests. Germany's 'Volkswagen Law' has caused tension with the European Commission over hostile bids, posing a challenge to the EU's free movement of capital principle. The EU faces challenges enforcing free movement of capital due to resurgent economic nationalism in member states. EU officials warn against protectionism, with threats to break up energy giants and counter national champions. Commission President Barroso emphasizes the need for unity, stating economic nationalism is not the solution. In 2006, the Commission took actions to address the rise of economic nationalism. The Commission initiated actions to counter economic nationalism, including requests to comply with European Court rulings on foreign investment restrictions in Poland, Italy, Spain, and France. EU regulators lack sufficient powers to enforce competition treaties effectively. The European Commission investigates mergers that impede competition and may impose conditions on them. The EU takeover directive allows intervention if protective measures against foreign investors violate EU rules. Lawsuits against rule-breaking member states can take years to resolve in the European Court of Justice. The European Commission's lawsuits against member states in the European Court risk sparking nationalistic sentiments. The resurgence of economic nationalism is viewed optimistically as a reflection of the single market's advancement, but pessimistically as a threat to trade liberalization and a strong Europe. Recent actions to stop foreign takeovers in the EU represent the end of a battle where national authorities still have power in issues of corporate control. Opposition to the Single Market now comes from national governments and politicians fearing loss of prestige and jobs due to merger activity. With high unemployment and slow growth in many EU countries, there is a backlash against policy changes encouraging competition and corporate restructuring. The resurgence of economic nationalism in Europe is occurring alongside a wave of mergers, particularly in telecommunications, banking, and energy industries. Despite some controversy, most mergers are proceeding without much public or political opposition, with many being settled in line with free market principles. This trend is driven by firms developing Europe-wide ambitions, leading to increased cross-border merger activity. Despite objections from Luxembourg and France, Mittal and Arcelor merged in June 2006 to create the world's largest steel group, hailed as a victory over economic protectionism. However, some view anti-merger actions as hindering progress on economic integration and the Single Market in the EU, raising concerns about conflicting national and European interests. Progress on implementing the Single Market is also slowing down. Progress on implementing the Single Market in the EU is slowing down, with newer members excelling while older members lag behind. There is a trend of member states avoiding EU-wide obligations, leading to an increase in infringement cases. Economic nationalism is on the rise, with some governments prioritizing national ownership. This contradicts the spirit of the EU, which promotes shared sovereignty and disregards nationality in business dealings. Some countries or populist leaders prioritize defending sovereignty over ceding powers to Europe, leading to tensions with the EU. Member states are challenging Brussels' authority, citing legitimacy concerns. France and Poland present protectionism positively, ignoring EU treaty obligations.

The United States and the EU share a significant economic partnership, with potential repercussions for the global economy. If anti-foreign merger actions escalate in Europe, the US could have concerns about resurgent protectionism. Resurgent protectionism in Europe could harm economic growth and impact U.S. exports and investments. Discriminatory economic nationalism may lead to retaliatory measures, undermining mutual economic benefits and job creation. EU's market opening efforts outweigh limited anti-merger actions by some governments. Limited anti-merger actions by some governments have had minimal economic and political effects so far."
