    "content": "Accounting is the language of finance with established principles and rules. Auditors follow a set of audit principles to examine financial statements. Standards are regulated by federal, state, and self-regulatory agencies in the US. Congress has enacted legislation like the Sarbanes-Oxley Act to achieve specific policy objectives in accounting and auditing. The report examines the U.S. accounting and auditing regulatory structure, discussing the creation and regulation of standards in the private sector, federal government, and state/local governments. It also explores the relationship between international accounting standards and U.S. GAAP/GAAS, as well as the emerging Sustainability Accounting Standards. Three appendixes are included in the report. In the private sector, different accounting and auditing standards have evolved to address stakeholders' specific needs. Financial statements communicate how the company used its resources to generate profit or incur loss, catering to investors, creditors, employees, regulators, and others. Appendices in the report include a table of acronyms, a glossary of financial statements, and the AICPA's Principles of Professional Conduct for CPAs. The curr_chunk discusses how public-sector entities issue reports to communicate the use of tax revenues, with distinct accounting and auditing standards for federal, state, and local governments. Financial statements in the private sector provide benefits through accurate information dissemination for efficient capital allocation. Investors rely on financial statements for informed investment decisions. Firms use financial statements to communicate with stakeholders. Public companies follow accounting standards overseen by the SEC. Congress oversees the SEC and appropriates its funding. Accountants and auditors must adhere to accounting and auditing standards, as well as ethical requirements from membership organizations like CPAs' Principles of Professional Conduct. Accounting involves identifying, measuring, and communicating financial information using Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). The SEC has the authority to establish accounting standards for the private sector in the United States. The SEC has the authority to establish accounting standards for the private sector in the United States, relying on the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) to develop GAAP. Financial statements for companies include income statements, balance sheets, shareholder equity statements, and cash flow statements. The differences between private and public sectors impact the financial statements used. Financial statements in the private and public sectors differ due to the nature of business activities. Public companies are required to disclose performance information regularly under federal securities laws. Domestic companies must submit Form 10-K, 10-Q, and 8-K reports to provide comprehensive financial information. The SEC requires companies to file various forms like 10-K, 10-Q, and 8-K to disclose financial information. Foreign companies in U.S. markets have similar requirements but may follow different reporting standards. In 2007, the SEC changed filing requirements for Foreign Private Issuers to align with potential adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards. In 2007, the SEC authorized foreign firms to file Form 20-F using IFRS or Form 10-K using U.S. GAAP to prevent delisting from U.S. exchanges. The SEC was debating whether to converge with IFRS or continue with U.S. GAAP. The annual report to shareholders includes a CEO letter, financial data, results of operations, market segment info, new product plans, subsidiary activities, and R&D on future programs, required to be sent to shareholders by the SEC. The SEC requires listed companies to post annual reports and proxy materials on their website, providing shareholders with information on firm-related issues. Proxy materials allow shareholders to influence board and management decisions. The annual report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC may contain more detailed financial information than the report sent to shareholders. Registered FPIs must meet similar requirements as domestic firms. Stakeholders need assurance on financial statements. In the private sector, independent auditors provide assurance to shareholders and stakeholders by giving an unbiased professional opinion on the accuracy of financial statements. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 created the PCAOB to oversee audits of public companies and brokers, ensuring compliance with GAAP. The PCAOB consists of five board members appointed by the SEC for staggered five-year terms. The PCAOB, established by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, has five board members appointed by the SEC for staggered five-year terms. The SEC oversees the PCAOB, approving its rules, standards, and budget. The PCAOB's funding comes from accounting support fees assessed on public companies, brokers, and dealers registered with the SEC. The PCAOB's 2017 budget was $269 million, with $233 million allocated to public companies and $35 million to brokers and dealers. SOX (\u00a7404) also requires public companies to include their assessment of internal control over financial reporting in annual reports, along with an auditor's attestation. The different types of audit opinions an auditor may issue are discussed, followed by a discussion of internal control integrated frameworks. Auditors form opinions by examining risks and controls to mitigate them, then determine if financial statements are presented fairly. There are four types of audit opinions: Unqualified Opinion, Qualified Opinion, Adverse Opinion, and Disclaimer of Opinion. The auditor's report may contain different types of opinions: Unqualified Opinion, Qualified Opinion, Adverse Opinion, and Disclaimer of Opinion. These opinions reflect the auditor's assessment of whether the financial statements present a fair view in accordance with GAAP. A disclaimer of opinion from an auditor states they do not express an opinion on the financial statements due to limitations in audit procedures and the possibility of fraud. The auditor can only provide reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free of material misstatement. Section 404 of SOX requires public companies to assess and report on the effectiveness of their internal controls using the COSO framework. Internal controls help organizations achieve objectives and manage risks. The COSO framework, depicted in Figure 3, helps assess internal controls as an integrated system for achieving management objectives. It consists of three objectives (Operations, Reporting, Compliance) and five components. The COSO framework outlines five components of internal control to help achieve management objectives: Control Environment, Risk Assessment, Control Activities, Information and Communication, and Monitoring Activities. These components must be effective and integrated across all levels of an organization. There is debate on whether current taxpayers should bear the costs for benefits received in the near term through deficit spending. Periodic assessments are needed to determine if the government's financial position has improved. Periodic assessments are crucial to determine the government's financial position, which has social and political implications. The financial statements provide a comprehensive view of how tax revenue is managed and the effectiveness of government services. The U.S. government's financial report serves as a means of communication to stakeholders, similar to an annual report issued by a publicly traded company. The Federal Accounting Standards Advisory Board (FASAB) and the Government Accountability Office (GAO) are the standard-setting bodies for federal financial reporting and auditing standards. FASAB, funded by the GAO, Department of the Treasury, and the Office of Management and Budget, sets Generally Accepted Accounting Principles for federal entities. FASAB's objectives for federal financial reporting include providing a comprehensive view of tax revenue management and government services effectiveness. According to FASAB, federal financial reporting should ensure budgetary integrity by providing information on how budgetary resources are obtained and used in accordance with legal authorization. This helps stakeholders assess the status of budgetary resources and their relation to program costs, ensuring consistency with other accounting information on assets. Federal financial reporting should provide information for evaluating the services, efforts, costs, and accomplishments of the government, helping stakeholders determine the costs of specific programs, efforts, and accomplishments associated with federal programs, and the efficiency and effectiveness of the government's management of assets and liabilities. It should also assist in assessing the government's operations and investments for the given period, and how the financial condition of the government and the nation may change in the future. Financial reporting should provide information on the government's financial position, budgetary resources, and contribution to the nation's well-being. It should also ensure that financial management systems and controls are adequate to prevent fraud and support performance measurement. The financial statements of federal agencies and the U.S. government are audited by inspectors general, independent accounting firms, or GAO, an independent agency of Congress with a mission to support Congress in meeting its responsibilities and improve government performance. GAO issues the Generally Accepted Government Auditing Standards (GAGAS) and has a budget authority of $545 million for 2017. Audit organizations in the federal government use a hybrid method of external and internal auditors, all required to adhere to established standards. When performing audits in accordance with GAGAS, auditors must consider the visibility and sensitivity of government programs in determining materiality thresholds. Lower materiality levels may be used in GAGAS audits compared to non-GAGAS audits due to the public accountability of government entities and entities receiving government funding. Audits conducted under GAGAS can lead to improved government management through better decision-making, oversight, and accountability. GAGAS requires federal financial reporting to disclose compliance with laws, regulations, contracts, and grant agreements. It also recommends utilizing the COSO framework for internal control policies and procedures, as well as other standards for internal control in the Federal Government. Practitioners adopt best practices from various entities to improve audit practices. The federal government follows auditing standards influenced by various organizations like The Red Book, The Green Book, and The Green Book. State and local governments also provide financial statements to communicate their financial position and responsibilities to taxpayers and the legislature. The Comprehensive Annual Financial Report (CAFR) issued by each state or local jurisdiction serves the same purpose as the annual report issued by a publicly traded company to its investors. Each state or territory has flexibility to choose accounting and auditing standards that suit its needs, similar to federal levels. Financial reporting and auditing standards for state and local governments overlap with private-sector concepts but have different expected outcomes. Financial reporting and auditing standards for state and local governments are aligned with the federal government's objectives. The Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) sets accounting standards for state and local governments, which are considered Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) for states and municipalities. Unlike publicly traded companies, state and municipal governments are not required to follow GASB standards unless they receive federal funds. States and municipalities can choose to adopt, modify, or not adopt GASB accounting standards, which are considered GAAP for them. This flexibility can impact financial reporting outcomes, with 87,575 nonfederal government entities in 2008. Twenty-seven states have varying policies on following GASB standards. Local governments in 27 states are required to follow GAAP standards as promulgated by GASB, while 28 states mandate some or all counties to adhere to GAAP. Additionally, 36 states have laws or regulations that require some political subdivisions to follow GAAP, and 34 states require some or all school districts to do the same. Despite these requirements, some local jurisdictions do not comply with GAAP, with no enforcement mechanism in place. GASB is funded by fees collected from broker-dealers by the SEC through FINRA, with accounting support fees collected from member firms reporting trades to MSRB. GASB, a subsidiary of FAF, incurred $10 million in expenses in 2015, primarily paid through accounting support fees. Financial reporting by GASB holds the government accountable to taxpayers, promoting transparency and debate among citizens and officials. The Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) emphasizes the importance of financial reporting for accountability and evaluation by the public. Financial information should enable stakeholders to assess the government's accountability, evaluate its operating results, and ensure compliance with legal and budgetary requirements. The Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) emphasizes the importance of financial reporting for accountability and evaluation by the public. Financial information should enable stakeholders to assess the government's accountability, evaluate its operating results, and ensure compliance with legal and budgetary requirements. Financial reporting should provide information on sources and uses of financial resources, how activities were financed, and the entity's financial position. It should also disclose nonfinancial resources with useful lives beyond the current year and any legal or contractual restrictions on resources. State and local governments issue Comprehensive Annual Financial Reports (CAFR) to meet accountability objectives. Audits are conducted by elected or appointed auditors, who may follow the GAGAS issued by GAO. Despite variations in financial reporting and audit needs, the common theme of government accountability prevails. States and local governments, like California and Florida, follow GAGAS for audits. Cities such as Miami and San Diego also adhere to these standards. The Blue Book from the Government Finance Officers Association guides accounting and auditing practices. Policy issues of interest include the influence of international standards on U.S. GAAP and GAAS. The influence of international standards on U.S. GAAP and GAAS is a key policy issue. Additionally, emerging sustainability accounting standards encompass ESG issues for businesses. Capital markets are global, with investors worldwide relying on financial statements for informed decisions. International accounting and auditing standards play a crucial role in this global landscape. International accounting and auditing standards, like IFRS and U.S. GAAP, allow countries to adopt or modify them. The EU accepts both IFRS and U.S. GAAP as equivalent. International Standards on Auditing (ISA) are the counterpart to U.S. GAAS. These standards aim to facilitate efficient financial reporting. IFRS is a principles-based accounting standard promulgated by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), while U.S. GAAP is a rules-based accounting standard. IFRS allows for broad, flexible guidelines that can be tailored to suit different jurisdictions, leading to potential inconsistent interpretation and application. Countries with less-developed economies can benefit from working with other countries to develop accounting standards. The U.S. institutional infrastructure addresses the needs of the largest capital market, the United States. Unlike IFRS, U.S. GAAP is rules-based and may not cover unforeseen issues. The evolution of IFRS into a rules-based standard like U.S. GAAP is uncertain. Despite differences, U.S. and international regulators sometimes coordinate on standards. IFRS originated from the International Accounting Standards Committee in 1973. The IASC, a nonbinding agreement, was created to establish global accounting standards in response to economic integration. EU countries switched to IFRS in 2005, with over 100 countries adopting or converging with IFRS since 2003. The IASB, part of the IFRS Foundation in the UK, is responsible for promoting IFRS internationally. In 2015, the IFRS Foundation's income was \u00a330.6 million, with contributions from various US entities like the Federal Reserve and AICPA. The IASB promotes unified accounting standards through IFRS, which can be adopted without modification or converged with local GAAP. For example, in China, the Chinese Accounting Standards have substantially converged with IFRS but remain distinct for their governance system. The International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (IAASB) establishes International Standards on Auditing (ISA) for global adoption, ensuring financial statements of foreign firms are free from material misstatement. Auditors provide unbiased opinions on the fairness of financial statements in accordance with local GAAP. The IAASB promulgates International Standards on Auditing (ISA) for global adoption. It is a member organization of the IFAC, which was founded in 1977 and has grown to include 175 members from 130 countries. The PCAOB has observer status with IAASB. The IFAC, founded in 1977, has 175 members from 130 countries. It is funded by members and governed by the IFAC Council and board of directors. The PIOB oversees IFAC standards and is accountable to a monitoring group including various international organizations. The United States does not have entities in PIOB. The United States does not have entities in PIOB but influences through international organizations like the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and the World Bank. The SEC has the authority to establish accounting standards for the private sector in the U.S., relying on the private sector to set standards. The SEC has considered adopting IFRS or converging U.S. GAAP with global standards since the early 2000s. The SEC has considered adopting IFRS or converging U.S. GAAP with global standards since the early 2000s. Congressional interest in accounting convergence has been shown through hearings, letters, and legislation. Members of Congress have expressed concerns about further incorporation of IFRS into the U.S. financial reporting system. The U.S. financial reporting system faces challenges such as accounting arbitrage, investor confusion, and potential legal issues. Previous congressional interest in IFRS led to the SEC studying the adoption of a principles-based accounting system. The Dodd-Frank Act of 2010 did not specifically address accounting convergence issues. The SEC report in 2003 suggested a unified global accounting standard could benefit the US, but a 2012 report did not recommend incorporating IFRS. The National Securities Markets Improvement Act of 1996 required the SEC to report on international accounting standards, finding that improvements were needed before acceptance in the US. The future of accounting standards in the US could be determined by Congress, the SEC, or FASB, with no current legislation requiring or prohibiting the use of IFRS. The SEC has the authority to establish accounting standards in the US but has delegated this responsibility to FASB. There have been different proposals on how to incorporate IFRS in the US, but consensus has not been reached. Former SEC Chairman Mary Jo White proposed a single set of global accounting standards, while SEC Commissioner Kara M. Stein suggested a globally recognized set. In a March 2015 speech, SEC Commissioner Kara M. Stein expressed concerns about the shortcomings of a single set of globally recognized accounting standards and proposed developing standards responsive to the digital world. Former SEC Chief Accountant James Schnurr suggested allowing IFRS financial statements as supplementary information to U.S. GAAP. The SEC continues to seek clarity on incorporating IFRS into U.S. GAAP. The SEC is considering incorporating IFRS into U.S. GAAP, but currently believes that U.S. GAAP best serves investors' needs. There is ongoing debate about disclosure requirements for public firms, particularly regarding sustainability accounting standards and ESG issues. Shareholder expectations in ESG issues have been increasing, with a rise in shareholder proposals related to these issues filed with SEC-registered firms. The percentage of firms focusing on sustainability issues increased from 40% to 67% between 2011 and 2016. Sustainability topics include environmental, social, and governance (ESG) issues. Proponents believe investments in sustainability can increase shareholder value by differentiating competitors, fostering investor confidence, and increasing access to capital. Critics argue that current regulations address many ESG issues, making additional disclosures and reporting requirements unnecessary regulatory burdens. Legislation and regulatory requirements enacted in the last decade address ESG issues. In the last decade, requirements addressing ESG issues include CEO pay compared to median employee compensation, clawback provisions on incentive-based pay, conflict mineral disclosure, GAAP material information disclosure, and Regulation S-K for nonfinancial information sharing. The Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) has created provisional standards for corporations to address shareholder interest in ESG issues, but SEC does not mandate following SASB standards for corporate filers. Publicly traded firms are subject to various ESG-related requirements, including existing GAAP disclosure regulations. The SEC requires publicly traded firms to disclose significant sustainability issues, environmental remediation obligations, and potential material impacts on financial statements. Other federal or state requirements may also mandate disclosure on sustainability issues. In an international context, regulatory requirements or stock exchanges may also require disclosure on ESG issues. Over 33 countries have ESG disclosure requirements, with questions raised about the usefulness of existing disclosures for investors. Sustainability disclosures often use boilerplate language to meet regulatory requirements or avoid lawsuits. The Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) was established in 2011 to set sustainability accounting standards for the private sector. The Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) sets sustainability accounting standards for the private sector, but it is not officially recognized by Congress or the SEC. Implementation of SASB standards is voluntary, and materiality is defined based on shareholder interest and financial impact. SASB does not dictate what constitutes material disclosure for companies. Immaterail sustainability issues or boilerplate disclosures have minimal impact on shareholders. SASB found inconsistency in how companies disclose ESG issues, ranging from boilerplate to industry-specific or metrics-based disclosures. This inconsistency makes it difficult to measure firm performance within and across industries. Even industry-specific disclosures may not be materially relevant or directly correlated to financial performance. SASB has developed a sustainable industry classification system (SICS) to address this issue. SASB developed a sustainable industry classification system (SICS) with 79 industry-specific standards to measure material sustainability disclosure based on 5 topics and 13 metrics. Analysts and investors can compare firms based on both financial and sustainability metrics. SASB's 2015 operating expenses were $8.3 million, funded by donors like Bloomberg Philanthropies and borrowed $2 million. Other international standards compete with SASB for ESG disclosures. Criticisms of reporting requirements focus on compliance rather than materiality and value. GRI, founded in the late 1990s, competes with SASB in sustainability reporting. Approximately 2,500 companies worldwide follow GRI standards. Dow Jones Sustainability Indices also measure sustainability. The Dow Jones Sustainability Indices measure companies' sustainability performance based on economic, environmental, and social criteria. ISO 26000 provides guidance on social responsibility, OECD's Guidelines offer principles for multinational enterprises, and the UN Global Compact aligns companies with universal principles on human rights, labor, environment, and anticorruption. Increased interest in sustainability issues has led to corporations voluntarily disclosing information about ESG issues, with a high percentage of global and S&P 500 companies issuing sustainability reports. Standardization and focus on materiality are crucial for measuring the effectiveness of these sustainability efforts. Measuring the effectiveness of sustainability efforts by companies is challenging for investors and stakeholders. Congress may scrutinize sustainability disclosures in corporate reports as sustainability accounting standards evolve. Options for Congress include letting markets determine disclosures or requiring compliance with SASB standards. Governments could also use SASB disclosures in their reports. Another option is for the SEC to conduct a cost-benefit study. The SEC may need to formalize sustainability disclosures in annual reports by requiring a cost-benefit study and assessing investor interest. If SASB becomes a GAAP requirement, new auditing standards may be necessary to ensure compliance with evolving industry practices. Investors may view additional ESG disclosures positively, potentially increasing investor interest and reducing future lawsuits. However, including extra disclosures could also lead to negative effects on firm stock prices and invite lawsuits from stakeholders. Time-intensive and costly reporting may not be beneficial if not done correctly. Investors have shown increased interest in additional ESG disclosures. Firms that proactively address material ESG issues may benefit from higher stock prices, easier access to capital, and improved forecasting of potential business disruptions. Sustainability reporting can enhance the perception of a firm's management quality and efficiency, leading to increased access to capital and potential earnings growth. The Financial Statements Appendix B describes the income statement, balance sheet, and statement of shareholders' equity for private and publicly traded companies. The income statement shows profitability, the balance sheet summarizes financial position, and the shareholders' equity statement represents ownership interest. Publicly traded companies issue these statements quarterly and annually. The statement of shareholders' equity details changes in stockholder equity accounts for publicly traded companies quarterly and annually. The statement of cash flows shows cash generated and used, divided into operations, investing, and financing. Notes to the Financial Statements provide additional information. The notes in financial statements provide critical information about assumptions and methodologies. Management's Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) offers an overview of past performance and future projections, including growth, challenges, and market conditions. MD&A is not audited and represents management's opinions. The Federal Government Statement of Operations shows accrual-based results. The Balance Sheet presents the federal government's financial position at the end of the fiscal year, summarizing assets, liabilities, and net position. The Statement of Changes in Cash Balance from Unified Budget and Other Activities explains how changes in cash balance affect the budget surplus or deficit, detailing how deficits were financed. Budget deficits occur when expenditures exceed revenue. The Statement of Net Cost shows annual agency-level government operating costs. Financial reports use accrual basis for costs and revenue, while budget statements use cash basis. The Reconciliation of Net Operating Cost and Unified Budget Surplus (Deficit) explains the relationship between the unified budget surplus (deficit) and changes in government assets and debt. The Statement of Social Insurance estimates major social insurance program costs. The Statement of Social Insurance provides estimates of significant social insurance programs like Social Security and Medicare, based on economic and demographic assumptions. The Notes to the Financial Statements offer details on assumptions and methodologies. The 2016 financial report included 13 pages for financial statements and 101 pages for notes. A Citizen's Guide summarizes the U.S. government's financial position and key topics. Management's Discussion and Analysis provides management's perspective on the financial report. The financial report to Congress and citizens provides detailed analysis, including audit opinions, accounting differences, and supplementary information. It covers topics like Social Security and Medicare trust funds, fiscal policy sustainability, and the Budget of the U.S. Government. This section contains information on past performance, future expectations, economic assumptions, and interactions. The State and Local Governments Statement of Activities presents detailed information about the operations, revenues, expenses, and net assets of the government. The Statement of Net Assets shows the balance of net assets at the end of the fiscal year, reflecting how well officials manage revenues and expenses. Required Supplementary Information provides additional details to enhance understanding. The curr_chunk discusses how information in the Comprehensive Annual Financial Report (CAFR) enhances understanding of state or local government operations and financial condition. It covers various topics like pension plans, infrastructure status, financial statements, fund statements, and notes providing critical information. The Letter of Transmittal summarizes the government's financial position and key topics. The curr_chunk provides a detailed analysis of the local government's financial position, key financial topics, long-term goals, and policies regarding cash and investments. It complements the management's discussion and analysis in the Comprehensive Annual Financial Report (CAFR), which offers management's perspective on the financial information presented to the state or local legislature and citizens. The curr_chunk also includes information on primary financial statements, fund financial statements, and the Statistical Section for users of the financial statements. The Statistical Section in the CAFR provides historical perspective and detail in five categories: Financial Trends, Revenue Capacity, Debt Capacity, Demography and Economy, and Operating Information. Appendix C discusses the ethical requirements for CPAs, including mandatory ethics courses and disciplinary actions for violations. The AICPA Principles of Professional Conduct emphasize the ethical responsibilities of members towards the public, clients, and colleagues. Members are expected to uphold honorable behavior and exercise professional judgment in all activities. Members of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants have responsibilities to society, including cooperating with each other to improve accounting practices, maintain public confidence, and uphold the profession's self-governance. They are obligated to act in a way that serves the public interest, honors the public trust, and demonstrates professionalism. The accounting profession's public includes clients, credit grantors, governments, employers, investors, and the business community. Members have a public interest responsibility to maintain the orderly functioning of commerce by acting with integrity and serving the collective well-being of the community. Expectations include discharging responsibilities with integrity, objectivity, due professional care, and a genuine interest in serving the public. Members of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants are expected to provide quality services, enter into fee arrangements, and offer a range of services in a professional manner consistent with the Code of Professional Conduct. They commit to honoring the public trust and demonstrating dedication to professional excellence. Integrity is a fundamental element of character that members must uphold to maintain public confidence and trust. Integrity is a key aspect that members of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants must uphold to maintain public trust. It involves being honest, candid, and adhering to ethical standards, while prioritizing service and the public trust over personal gain. Integrity requires members to make decisions based on what is right and just, and to always question if their actions align with the principles of integrity. Members of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants are required to uphold principles of objectivity and independence in their professional responsibilities. Objectivity entails being impartial, intellectually honest, and free of conflicts of interest, while independence ensures that members are unbiased in providing auditing and other attestation services. This includes maintaining a state of mind that adds value to their services and demonstrating objectivity in various circumstances, such as when rendering attest, tax, and management advisory services. Members in public practice provide attest, tax, and advisory services, while others work in various financial and management roles. All members must uphold integrity, objectivity, and independence in their work. For those in public practice, maintaining objectivity and independence is crucial in client relationships and public responsibility. Independence is especially important for those providing auditing and attestation services. Non-public practice members must also maintain objectivity and avoid conflicts of interest. Members not in public practice must maintain objectivity in rendering professional services, even though they cannot maintain the appearance of independence. They are charged with the same responsibility for objectivity as members in public practice and must adhere to ethical standards and principles. Due care requires members to strive for excellence, improve competence, and discharge professional responsibilities diligently. The obligation of competence in professional services requires a commitment to continuous learning and improvement throughout a member's career. Competence is essential for maintaining a high level of professionalism and quality in all engagements. Competence is crucial for professionals to provide services effectively and within their capabilities. Members must assess their own competence and seek consultation or referral when needed. Diligence and due care are essential in discharging responsibilities to clients, employers, and the public. Members are required to plan, supervise, and adhere to technical and ethical standards in their professional activities. The SEC, states, AICPA, and PCAOB have the authority to discipline accountants for unethical or improper conduct in their professional activities. This includes fines, suspension, or barring from practice, as well as potential loss of membership in professional organizations. The auditing profession is overseen by the PCAOB to ensure compliance with auditing standards."
