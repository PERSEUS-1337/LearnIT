    "content": "The National Child Protection Improvement Act establishes a National Center on Volunteer and Provider Screening under the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974. Congress acknowledges the significant role of volunteers in child and youth organizations, as well as in serving the elderly and individuals with disabilities through public and private voluntary organizations. While most services provided are essential and safe, there are instances of abuse, with estimates of child sexual abuse ranging from 1 to 7 percent in various settings. Abuse in child care settings, foster care homes, and schools ranges from 1 to 7 percent. Congress has implemented laws to address concerns about abuse through criminal record checks for care providers and volunteers. However, safety issues for vulnerable groups still persist despite some states conducting background checks. Criminal history checks, including fingerprint checks, are important for volunteers and providers who may have lived in multiple states. The high cost of fingerprint background checks can be a barrier for organizations with many volunteers. The current system for retrieving national criminal background information on volunteers is slow and cumbersome, leaving children at risk. A national volunteer and provider screening center is needed to protect vulnerable groups by providing efficient national criminal history background checks at no-cost or minimal-cost for care providers. \"A national volunteer and provider screening center is needed to protect vulnerable groups by providing efficient national criminal history background checks at no-cost or minimal-cost for care providers. SEC. 603. DEFINITIONS.\" \"A qualified entity is defined as a business or organization that provides care services, a volunteer provider is someone who volunteers with a qualified entity, and a provider is someone employed by or volunteering with a qualified entity. The Act aims to establish a national criminal background check system.\" The term 'national criminal background check system' refers to the FBI's criminal history record system. 'Child' is defined as a person under 18, 'individuals with disabilities' and 'State' have specific meanings from the National Child Protection Act of 1993, and 'care' includes various services for children, the elderly, or individuals with disabilities. Establishment of a National Center for Volunteer and Provider Screening. The Attorney General will establish a national center for volunteer and provider screening to conduct nationwide background checks on individuals working with children, the elderly, or individuals with disabilities to ensure they are fit for their responsibilities. The national criminal history background check system will provide checks on volunteer and non-volunteer providers at minimal cost, determined by the National Task Force. The determination of the background check will be provided to the requesting entity within 15 business days. It will also serve as a national resource center for various entities and individuals. The National Volunteer Screening Task Force, chaired by the Attorney General, includes members from various federal agencies and organizations to provide information on volunteer screening. The National Volunteer Screening Task Force, chaired by the Attorney General, includes members from national organizations representing private nonprofit qualified entities using volunteers to serve the elderly, individuals with disabilities, and children. They oversee the work of the Center and report annually to the President and Congress on its progress. The National Volunteer Screening Task Force, chaired by the Attorney General, oversees the progress of the States in complying with the National Child Protection Act of 1993. Authorization of appropriations for background checks of volunteers working with vulnerable populations is outlined in the National Child Protection Act of 1993. $80 million is authorized for fiscal year 2001, with $25 million for each subsequent year until 2005. The funds will remain available until expended. Requests for national background checks under this section are submitted to the National Center for Volunteer Screening, which conducts searches using the Integrated Automated Fingerprint Identification System or other criminal record checks. Qualified entities must provide fingerprints or identifying information and obtain a signed statement from the provider with necessary details. The provider or volunteer must provide a valid identifying document and disclose any criminal record. They are informed that a criminal history background check may be conducted, and the entity has the right to deny access to vulnerable individuals based on the results. The National Center retains statements obtained for at least 2 years. Providers or volunteers can request and challenge their criminal history record report through the National Center. The National Center contacts State and local systems for complete criminal history information. They determine if a provider is unfit based on set criteria and convey this to the qualified entity. The National Task Force encourages maximum use of background checks. The National Center encourages the use of best technology for criminal background checks and provides guidelines for fitness determinations. Qualified entities and states are not liable for damages solely for failure to request background checks on providers. The National Center or a qualified entity relying on criminal history record information from background checks conducted after December 20, 1993, shall not be liable for inaccuracies. Fees for background checks on volunteers with qualified entities are waived, but reasonable fees can still be collected for checks on paid employees. Establishment of a model program in each state to strengthen criminal data repositories and fingerprint technology. A model program will be established in each state and the District of Columbia to improve fingerprinting technology. Each state will receive $50,000 to purchase Live-Scan fingerprint technology or electric fingerprint imaging machines for background checks. Additionally, $50,000 will be provided to each state to hire personnel for training law enforcement agencies. The National Child Protection Act requires states to input criminal and disposition data into the national background check system and provide annual progress reports to the National Task Force. $5.1 million is authorized for fiscal year 2001, with additional funding for subsequent years. Funding is allocated for fiscal years 2002-2005 to enhance fingerprint technology and hire data entry personnel in all 50 States and the District of Columbia. The appropriated sums will remain available until expended."
