This project aims to improve access to primary and preventive care for those in need. The Secretary will establish a demonstration project for up to 30 integrated health systems to receive grants for expanding access to primary and preventive services for the medically underserved. Integrated health systems must apply to participate in the demonstration, and selection criteria will be determined by the Secretary. The Secretary will select integrated health systems from various states and locations to participate in a 3-year demonstration project. Reports on the demonstration will be submitted to Congress. The report for the demonstration project must be submitted within 3 months after 24 months of operation, and a final report within 3 months after the project ends. The reports will evaluate the effectiveness of the demonstration in providing better access to primary and preventive care for medically underserved populations. $25,000,000 is authorized for each fiscal year 2009-2011 for this section.

The integrated health system must ensure financial responsibility, offer services to eligible individuals, and set fees to cover operational costs. Discounts are provided based on the patient's ability to pay, and no patient will be denied care due to inability to pay. Grant funds must supplement, not supplant, expenditures for primary and preventive health services for the medically underserved. Qualifying integrated health systems may include nurse-managed health clinics meeting specific requirements. Reports must be submitted to the Secretary for compliance determination.

The term 'integrative health services' refers to services that aim to improve patient care coordination within a health care delivery system. The Secretary may waive the requirement for integrated health systems serving a targeted population to provide certain primary and preventive health services if deemed unnecessary for that population. Integrative health services aim to improve patient care coordination by providing a broad range of culturally competent services, including outreach activities, case management, chronic care management, transportation to health care facilities, provider network development, personnel recruitment and training, and technology acquisition for care coordination. Improvements in provider communication, shared information systems, eligibility determination for various programs, prevention tools, translation services, evaluation measures, integration of primary care and mental health services, and other related activities are key components of integrative health services. Specialty care refers to care provided through a referral by a physician or nonphysician practitioner, including services like surgical consultative services, radiology services, audiology, optometric services, cardiology services, MRI services, CAT scans, nuclear medicine studies, and ambulatory surgical services. A nurse-managed health clinic is a nurse-practice arrangement managed by advanced practice nurses that provides care for underserved populations."
