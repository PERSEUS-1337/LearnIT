    "content": "Bank regulators have implemented regulations requiring banks to hold minimum levels of capital to improve safety and stability. Capital ratio requirements can have benefits but also impose costs, such as reducing credit availability. There is debate on how these requirements should be calibrated and applied. Capital ratios can be either a leverage ratio or a risk-weighted ratio, with the former treating all assets the same and the latter assigning a risk weight to each asset. The debate over bank regulation includes discussions on capital ratio requirements for small, safe banks. Policymakers generally agree that smaller banks should face simpler, less costly regulations compared to larger banks. However, some argue for further tailoring regulations for smaller banks to better suit their resources and risk profiles. The Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act of 2018 mandated further tailoring of capital rules for small banks through the creation of the Community Bank Leverage Ratio (CBLR). Banks with less than $10 billion in assets can opt to exceed a single CBLR threshold instead of multiple complex ratios, simplifying compliance and regulatory considerations. The Community Bank Leverage Ratio (CBLR) allows small banks to opt out of complex capital ratio requirements. The federal bank regulatory agencies have discretion in setting the ratio, with a proposed 9% threshold receiving criticism from the banking industry and policymakers. Despite this, the regulators finalized the rule in October 2019. The regulators issued a joint press release on October 29, 2019, finalizing the rule with a 9% threshold. The CARES Act temporarily lowered the CBLR to 8% until the end of 2020, with plans to raise it to 8.5% in 2021 before returning to 9% on January 1, 2022. This report examines capital ratios and the CBLR option for small banks. The report discusses the CBLR option, Section 201 of EGRRCPA, the CARES Act's temporary lowering of the threshold, and estimates on the number and characteristics of banks affected by CBLR implementation. It explains how a bank's balance sheet is divided into assets, liabilities, and capital for funding purposes. Banks raise capital through various methods to fund their operations, including issuing equity or convertible bonds. Capital allows banks to absorb losses when their assets underperform, which can lead to reduced or cancelled payouts on capital during times of financial stress. This practice helps banks earn more interest on their assets than they pay on their liabilities, but it also exposes them to risks that can result in failure. Banks use capital to meet liability obligations and avoid failure by reducing payouts when assets underperform. Regulators require banks to maintain minimum capital levels, expressed as ratios on balance sheets. Basel Capital Accords established ratio requirements in 1988, evolving into Basel II before the 2008 financial crisis. The Basel II requirements in effect before the 2008 financial crisis were replaced by more stringent Basel III standards in 2010. U.S. regulators finalized new capital requirements in 2013, including a 4% minimum leverage ratio for most banks and a 5% ratio for well-capitalized banks. Advanced approaches banks have additional requirements. The Basel III standards introduced stricter capital requirements in 2010, including a 5% leverage ratio for well-capitalized banks. Advanced approaches banks must also maintain a 3% supplementary leverage ratio. Globally systemically important banks (G-SIBs) have to meet an enhanced SLR requirement of 5% at the holding-company level and 6% at the depository level. Risk-weighted ratios vary based on bank size and capital quality, with most banks needing to meet a 4.5% ratio for the highest-quality capital. The Basel III standards introduced stricter capital requirements in 2010, including a 5% leverage ratio for well-capitalized banks. Banks must maintain ratios of 6%, 8%, and 10% for different capital types to be considered well capitalized. Additional capital conservation buffers of 2.5% are required to avoid restrictions on capital distributions. G-SIBs face an extra capital surcharge of 1% to 4.5% based on systemic importance. Advanced approaches banks have a countercyclical buffer of 0%-2.5% and G-SIBs must meet an enhanced SLR requirement of 5% at the holding-company level and 6% at the depository level. The debate on capital requirements' balance between benefits and costs for banks is ongoing. Higher capital levels and meeting certain ratios impose costs on banks, potentially leading to reduced credit availability or higher credit prices. Leverage ratios and risk-based ratios each have strengths and weaknesses, with the CBLR exempting certain banks from risk-weighted ratio requirements. The CBLR exempts certain banks from risk-weighted ratio requirements, allowing them to use a single leverage ratio. Bank regulators consider strengths and weaknesses in determining eligibility for the CBLR option. Riskier assets offer higher returns, incentivizing banks to hold them without risk weighting. However, risk weighting ensures more capital is held against risky assets. Risk weighting presents challenges as it may inaccurately estimate assets' true risks, leading banks to potentially overinvest in assets with low risk weights. Poorly calibrated risk weights before the financial crisis encouraged banks to invest in risky assets, exacerbating the downturn. The risk-weighted system for assets offered higher returns but suffered large losses during the crisis. Critics argue it is needlessly complex and favors large banks over small banks. Congress mandated a simpler system for qualifying banks exceeding a non-risk-weighted Community Bank Leverage Ratio. The provision defined qualifying banks as those with less than $10 billion in assets, but also authorized federal bank regulators to disqualify banks based on risk profile, including off-balance sheet exposures, trading assets and liabilities, total notional derivatives exposures, and other factors. Qualifying banks exceeding the threshold ratio of capital to unweighted assets would be considered well capitalized. The CBLR regulation allows qualifying banks with assets under $10 billion to be considered well capitalized if they exceed the threshold ratio of capital to unweighted assets. CBLR-compliant banks above the threshold can opt into the regime, freeing them from meeting risk-based minimums and reporting ratios. The CBLR regulation provides regulatory relief to small banks by allowing them to be considered well capitalized if they exceed the threshold ratio of capital to unweighted assets. Banks below the threshold can choose to remain in the preexisting capital regime or raise capital to become CBLR compliant. Public comment was invited on a proposed CBLR rulemaking on November 21, 2018. The CBLR regulation allows small banks to be considered well capitalized if they exceed the 9% threshold ratio of capital to unweighted assets. The banking industry criticized the rule, with an industry group supporting an 8% community bank leverage ratio instead. The bank regulators finalized a rule with a 9% threshold for capital to unweighted assets, despite industry criticism. Banks may reduce credit availability to maintain regulatory thresholds when borrowers miss payments, which can worsen economic downturns. The COVID-19 pandemic led to economic disruption, prompting Congress to pass the CARES Act to mitigate its effects. The CARES Act (P.L. 116-136) temporarily lowers the CBLR to 8% for qualifying banks to support lending during the pandemic. Regulators provide a grace period for banks below this level to comply, with the mandate expiring at the end of 2020. The ratio will increase to 8.5% in 2021 and return to 9% in 2022. This decision impacts hundreds of banks and is crucial for maintaining financial stability. The section provides estimates of how many banks would be affected by setting the CBLR threshold at 8% or 9% as of June 30, 2019. The estimates are based on data from FDIC-insured depository institutions and the CBLR notice of proposed rulemaking. The CRS analyzed data from FDIC-insured depository institutions to estimate the impact of setting the CBLR threshold at 8% or 9% as of June 30, 2019. They found that out of 5,352 banks, 141 would not qualify due to having $10 billion or more in assets. After applying risk-profile criteria, 5,078 banks were found to qualify for CBLR compliance. The study analyzed data from FDIC-insured depository institutions to assess the impact of setting the CBLR threshold at 8% or 9%. Out of 5,078 qualifying banks, 4,440 had CBLRs above 9% and would have been compliant. 638 banks did not meet the threshold, with 515 falling between 8% and 9%. The analysis compared balance-sheet values and ratios at qualifying and nonqualifying banks to measure bank size, concentration in core banking activities, and risk exposure. The risk-weighted ratio requirements for banks involve three different minimum risk-weighted requirements using different types of capital: common equity Tier 1 (CET1), Tier 1, and total capital. These ratios indicate how well capitalized banks are under the existing capital regime. Banks not meeting the CBLR threshold based on risk-profile criteria were analyzed. Nonqualifying banks that did not meet the CBLR threshold had larger average sizes compared to qualifying banks, but both were mostly small banks. While their concentrations in lending, deposit taking, and trading were similar, nonqualifying banks had significantly higher off-balance-sheet exposures and lower risk-based capital ratios than qualifying banks. Regulators set risk-profile criteria to disqualify banks with large off-balance-sheet exposures and thin capitalization. Allowing banks to opt out of risk-based requirements could pose high failure risks. A comparison of banks exceeding the 9% CBLR threshold, meeting it at 8%, or not meeting any threshold shows similarities in size and activities, but 8% banks had lower risk-based capital ratios. Banks with CBLRs between 8% and 9% had lower risk-based capital ratios compared to those at 9%. Regulators did not allow these banks to opt out of risk-based capital requirements due to their capital characteristics. Banks with CBLRs above 9% had higher risk-based ratios, influenced by holding high levels of capital. The threshold for CBLRs cannot exceed 10%, leading regulators to differentiate between banks with CBLRs between 9% and 10% and those at 8%-9%. The risk-based differences between banks with CBLRs of 9%-10% and 8%-9% were not significant. Most U.S. depositories would be CBLR compliant if their capital exceeds the 9% threshold. Regulators can set the threshold as low as 8%, potentially allowing more banks to be exempt from risk-based ratio compliance. Nonqualifying banks were typically larger but still relatively small in the industry. The CBLR compliant banks at a 9% threshold were similar in size and activities to 8% threshold banks, but had significantly larger off-balance-sheet exposures and held about a quarter less capital. The difference in risk-based measures between 9%-10% CBLR banks and 8%-9% CBLR banks was not significant, with the 1 percentage point increase in the CBLR threshold reflected in the risk-based measures. The proposed Capital Rule for Qualifying Community Banking Organizations was published in the Federal Register on February 8, 2019. Data from Consolidated Reports on Condition and Income as of June 30, 2019 was used to calculate the CBLR. Challenges with data availability may result in differences between estimated and actual numbers. Deferred tax assets counting and deductions differed from values reported in call report Schedule RC-R. CRS used deferred tax asset values from call reports as a proxy in the absence of exact data from the proposal. This could lead to misclassification of banks near the qualifying threshold. Some off-balance-sheet exposures identified in the proposal were not found in the call report data. The proposal includes various types of exposures such as unused commitments, trade-related contingent items, credit protection, off-balance sheet securitization, letters of credit, and securities lending transactions. CRS used values from banks' call reports to assess these exposures. The proposal includes exposures like credit protection, off-balance sheet securitization, letters of credit, and securities lending transactions. CRS calculated off-balance sheet exposures using values from banks' call reports. Some exposures were not located, leading to underestimates for certain banks. The CRS estimate of qualifying banks for CBLRs may be an overcount due to omitting certain off-balance sheet exposures. Calculations and call report items were used to determine the CBLRs."
