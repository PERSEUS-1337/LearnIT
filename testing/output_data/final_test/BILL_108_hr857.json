    "content": "\"The American Horse Slaughter Prevention Act may be cited as the Act. Findings are outlined in Section 2.\" Congress finds that horses have a significant historical and cultural role in the United States, not raised for food or fiber, and should be protected from slaughter. The foreign-owned horse slaughter industry has processed over 3 million American horses for human consumption in the last 20 years, with approximately 55,000 horses slaughtered annually in the US. Many horses shipped to slaughter in the United States endure long journeys in crowded trucks, leading to suffering, injury, and death. The killing of horses in foreign-owned slaughterhouses contrasts with the preferable method of chemical euthanasia. Horses often endure repeated blows to the head with stunning equipment that may not render them unconscious. The lack of disclosure by agents and dealers for slaughter plants leads to horses being acquired and slaughtered through fraud and misrepresentation, providing an outlet for stolen horses. The ban on selling horseflesh for human consumption is consistent with international obligations. The ban on selling horseflesh for human consumption aligns with international agreements allowing measures to protect animal health and prevent deceptive trade practices in commerce. The purpose of this Act is to prohibit the slaughter, sale, possession, and trade of horses for human consumption. The Act defines key terms such as euthanasia, export, horse, and horseflesh. Euthanasia refers to humane killing of animals, export means taking from US jurisdiction, horse includes all equids, and horseflesh is the flesh of a dead horse. The term \"human consumption\" refers to people eating food. \"Import\" means bringing items into the US from outside its jurisdiction. \"Person\" includes individuals, corporations, and government entities. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Agriculture. \"Slaughter\" is defined as the commercial slaughter of horses for human consumption. \"State\" includes various territories and possessions of the United States. \"Transport\" means moving or loading onto a vehicle for transportation. The term \"United States\" refers to the customs territory of the United States as defined in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule. SEC. 5 prohibits slaughtering horses for human consumption, importing or exporting horseflesh or live horses for slaughter, selling or possessing horseflesh for human consumption, and causing any prohibited acts. SEC. 6 outlines penalties and enforcement measures. (a) Criminal Penalties: Violating section 5 can result in a fine, imprisonment for up to 1 year, or both.\n(b) Civil Penalties: Anyone who violates section 5 may face a civil penalty of $2,500 to $5,000, have all horses intended for slaughter confiscated, and be prohibited from certain horse-related activities in the United States. The Secretary may assess monetary penalties for violations of the Act after a final judicial or administrative determination. Notice and a hearing must be provided to the person before any penalty is imposed. The Secretary has the authority to enforce the Act and can utilize personnel, services, and facilities from other agencies. Civil penalties may be remitted or mitigated for good cause shown. The Secretary has the authority to remit or mitigate civil penalties and enforce the Act by executing warrants, arresting violators, and seizing cargo or conveyances used in violations. After enforcing the Act by seizing horses and horseflesh, authorities must temporarily place confiscated live horses with animal rescue facilities that are tax-exempt organizations. Authorities must work with animal welfare societies and animal control departments to temporarily place confiscated horses with facilities that prioritize humane treatment. Owners can prevent permanent placement by posting a bond with the court. The court requires a bond to cover expenses for the care of a confiscated horse for 60 days. If the bond is not posted, the custodial facility will arrange permanent placement following humane practices. Owners can prevent permanent placement by posting a bond with the court. The owner must post a new bond within ten days of the prior bond's expiration to prevent permanent placement of the horse by the custodial facility. If a new bond is not posted, the facility will determine permanent placement following humane practices. The facility can deduct reasonable care costs from the bond. The Act requires providing care for confiscated horses until final disposition in criminal cases. Confiscated horses not returned to owners are placed permanently in animal rescue facilities upon conviction, surrender, or owner's failure to act. The Act allows for the immediate euthanasia of injured horses in the field under emergency circumstances, following guidelines from the American Veterinary Medical Association. This can be ordered by the Secretary or law enforcement individuals if the horse is beyond recovery and suffering irreversibly. The Act allows for the euthanasia of confiscated horses that are injured, disabled, or diseased beyond recovery and cannot be placed in a suitable facility within 90 days. Euthanasia must be performed by a qualified veterinarian following AVMA guidelines, excluding certain methods like electrocution or penetrating captive bolt. The Act allows for euthanasia of confiscated horses that are injured, disabled, or diseased beyond recovery, excluding certain non-chemical methods. Funding for animal rescue facilities includes grants and the use of penalties, fines, and forfeited property for care of seized horses. Calculation of Violations: Each live horse transported, traded, slaughtered, or possessed in violation of this Act constitutes a separate offense. Every four hundred pounds or less of confiscated horseflesh also constitutes a separate offense. SEC. 7. REPORT ON ENFORCEMENT EFFORTS.\n\nThe Secretary must report to Congress on the enforcement efforts of this Act within 2 years of enactment and annually thereafter.\n\nSEC. 8. EXEMPTIONS.\n\nStates can regulate their horse population, and designated officials can enforce the Act.\n\nSEC. 9. DATE OF ENFORCEMENT.\n\nThe Act will be enforced one year after enactment."
