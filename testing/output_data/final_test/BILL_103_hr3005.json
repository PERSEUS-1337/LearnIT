This includes OMB-CBO reports for better regulatory budget cost control. The \"Federal Regulation Reduction, Reform, and Budget Act of 1993\" mandates OMB and CBO to issue a report projecting the direct cost to the private sector of complying with Federal regulations and the estimated cost as a percentage of GDP. The \"Federal Regulation Reduction, Reform, and Budget Act of 1993\" requires OMB and CBO to report on the estimated cost to the private sector of complying with Federal regulations, including the impact on GDP and the necessary reductions in costs over a six-year period. The \"Federal Regulation Reduction, Reform, and Budget Act of 1993\" mandates OMB and CBO to provide recommendations for improving the Federal regulatory budgeting process. Update reports are required every five years, with an initial baseline report due within 30 days of enactment.

Update reports are required every five years, with an initial baseline report due within 30 days of enactment. The baseline for the first budget year after 120 days of enactment will project the total cost to the private sector of complying with existing Federal regulations. SEC. 322. AGGREGATE REGULATORY BASELINE. The aggregate regulatory baseline projects the cost to the private sector of complying with Federal regulations, adjusting for GDP growth each fiscal year. The first budget year with this baseline is the one corresponding to the initial OMB-CBO report under section 321(c). The OMB and CBO issue a joint report by September 15 each year containing the baseline for the upcoming budget year. SEC. 323. RECONCILIATION AND ALLOCATIONS. The reconciliation directives in a concurrent resolution on the budget for any fiscal year must specify changes in laws and regulations to reduce the aggregate direct cost to the private sector of complying with Federal regulations by 6.5 percent for the budget year and by equal percentage increments for each outyear. Additionally, changes in laws are required to achieve reductions in regulations producing direct costs to the private sector. The reconciliation directives in a concurrent resolution on the budget must specify changes in laws to reduce the aggregate direct cost to the private sector of complying with Federal regulations by specified percentages for each outyear. Section 310(c) shall not apply with respect to directions made under this section. The Committees on the Budget of the House and Senate allocate regulatory authority among committees and categories for budget years. Committees then subdivide allocations among subcommittees or programs. A point of order prohibits bills causing allocation changes. The point of order prohibits bills that would exceed the allocated regulatory authority for a fiscal year. It can only be waived with a three-fifths majority vote. The level of regulatory authority is determined by the House or Senate Budget Committee. If a House committee exceeds its allocation, a privileged bill can be offered for debate.

SEC. 324 requires the Congressional Budget Office to estimate private sector costs for bills reported by committees, comparing them with existing estimates. SEC. 325 provides definitions. SEC. 325 defines key terms such as CBO, OMB, regulatory authority, and direct costs related to complying with Federal regulations. The President's annual budget submissions will now include a regulatory authority budget analysis of the direct costs to the private sector for complying with Federal regulations. Additionally, there will be an estimation and disclosure of the costs of Federal regulation. The Regulatory Flexibility Act is amended to include the monetary costs to small entities, businesses, and individuals of complying with proposed rules. Initial regulatory flexibility analysis must now include a description of the monetary costs incurred by these entities. The Regulatory Flexibility Act is amended to require agencies to include a statement of the monetary costs incurred by small entities, businesses, and individuals in complying with proposed rules. Agencies must also submit a cost estimate and cost benefit analysis to Congress, CBO, and OMB for any new regulations with an aggregate direct cost of at least $10,000,000 to the private sector in a fiscal year."
