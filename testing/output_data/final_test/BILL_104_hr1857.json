    "content": "Section 1 introduces a new deduction for individuals aged 55 and above for real property tax insurance related to their principal residence. Individuals aged 55 and above can deduct premiums paid for qualified real property tax insurance contracts on their principal residence. These contracts can only be paid for between ages 55 and 65. Individuals aged 55 and above can deduct State and local real property taxes on their principal residence for each real property tax year in the insured period, compared to the last tax year before the insured period. The insured period allows individuals aged 55 and above to deduct real property taxes on their principal residence for each tax year. The insurance contract provides a refund of cash value if the residence is sold or the insured period ends. For joint policyholders, there is a premium waiver after the death of either spouse. The insured period for individuals aged 55 and above allows deduction of real property taxes on their principal residence for a specified number of years after turning 65. The policyholder can choose between 10 years or select 5, 10, 15, or 20 years. The insured period ends upon the death of the last policyholder. The term 'principal residence' is defined as per section 1034, and 'State and local real property taxes' refer to any real property tax. The term 'State and local real property taxes' refers to any real property tax that is a State or local tax, excluding amounts not deductible under section 164(c)(1). An insurance contract must not exceed 150 percent of the previous year's real property taxes on the policyholder's principal residence to be considered a qualified real property tax insurance contract. Paragraph (1) does not apply if the taxpayer receives the premium amount from their individual retirement plan or a lump sum distribution equal to the premium. The paragraph also does not apply if the total premium paid exceeds the amount necessary to fund the payments specified in subsection (b)(1)(B). Special rules apply for married individuals under this section. In the case of joint policyholders, only the age of the older spouse is considered for applying this section. If the older spouse dies during the specified period and premiums were paid before their death, the older spouse's age continues to be the only age considered. Special rules apply for tax treatment of cash value refunds from qualified real property tax insurance contracts. The cash value of qualified real property tax insurance contracts is taxable when received, and no deduction is allowed for tax payments under these contracts. A deduction for qualified real property tax insurance premiums is allowed regardless of whether the taxpayer itemizes other deductions. The table of sections for part VII of subchapter B of chapter 1 of the Code is amended by adding new items. Sec. 220 allows a deduction for individuals aged 55 or older for real property tax insurance on their primary residence. Sec. 221 provides a cross-reference. The amendments in this section apply to taxable years after the enactment of the Act."
