    "content": "In June 2009, the World Health Organization declared the H1N1 influenza outbreak a pandemic, the first since 1968. The virus, a reassortment of different strains, was first identified in California in April and has since spread globally. The U.S. CDC has been monitoring the virus through seasonal flu surveillance systems, although these systems are not precise in tracking total deaths and hospitalizations. The CDC estimates that between April and October 17, there were 14-34 million cases of H1N1 infection, 63,000-153,000 H1N1-related hospitalizations, and 2,500-6,000 H1N1-related deaths in the United States. The novel H1N1 flu is similar to seasonal flu in symptoms and transmission. Antiviral drugs like oseltamivir and zanamivir are effective in treating illnesses caused by the pandemic strain. Pregnant women and children are more susceptible to serious illness from the pandemic strain compared to the elderly. In response to the H1N1 outbreak, Janet Napolitano coordinated federal response efforts as the Principal Federal Official. Charles E. Johnson declared a public health emergency, allowing FDA to issue Emergency Use Authorizations for antiviral drugs and protective facemasks. HHS established the website www.flu.gov for information dissemination. HHS has set up a government website (www.flu.gov) with information for planners, healthcare providers, and the public. President Obama declared the pandemic a national emergency on October 24, allowing waivers of some Medicare and Medicaid requirements. The applicability of the Stafford Act to infectious disease incidents is unclear. Many U.S. communities closed schools due to the new flu strain, following CDC guidance. The U.S. response to the pandemic was based on initial CDC guidance, which was later revised due to the widespread circulation of the virus. CDC now advises against routine school closures for small numbers of infected students, as closures may not effectively reduce virus spread and burden the community. Previous efforts since 2004 aimed at addressing global flu concerns, including the H5N1 avian flu, received $6.1 billion in FY2006 for pandemic planning across various departments and agencies. The Obama Administration's response to the H1N1 pandemic included requesting $2 billion in emergency appropriations and transferring an additional $7 billion from existing HHS accounts. The President signed a bill providing $1.9 billion immediately and an additional $5.8 billion contingent upon a presidential request. A national pandemic vaccination campaign is ongoing, with a liability waiver and compensation program in place for vaccine-related injuries. The CDC has developed recommendations for priority groups to receive the pandemic vaccine. Costs for the vaccination program are funded by public and private sources. Vaccine distribution to states is based on their populations, with delivery handled by a CDC contractor. Issues have arisen with vaccine availability, leading to concerns about reaching priority groups in a timely manner. The report provides information on federal emergency management authorities' response to the pandemic, including actions by DHS and HHS, as well as state and local authorities. It also covers congressional hearings, funding for pandemic flu preparedness, U.S. government planning documents, and WHO's process for determining pandemic phases. The Secretary of Homeland Security leads federal incident response, while the Secretary of HHS leads public health and medical response. The Government Accountability Office has recommended that HHS and DHS conduct training and exercises to clarify federal leadership roles in pandemic response. GAO also suggested updating federal pandemic plans published in 2006. DHS Deputy Secretary Jane Holl Lute testified that an implementation plan for the current pandemic response was being finalized. The National Security Council is finalizing an implementation plan for the current pandemic. The President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology recommended clarifying leadership roles between DHS and HHS during the pandemic response. Primary federal responsibilities for epidemic response are divided between HHS and DHS, with coordination by White House staff. The National Strategy for Pandemic Influenza Implementation Plan assigns tasks to various government offices, agencies, and departments involved in Federal planning. The Working Group suggests clarifying responsibilities and assigning the Homeland Security Advisor to ensure timely decision-making. President Obama declared an emergency on October 23 due to the H1N1 pandemic. The 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic in the United States is declared a national emergency, allowing the President to waive certain statutory requirements under the National Emergencies Act. This includes provisions in the Social Security Act that can be waived during a public health emergency declared under the Stafford Act. The National Emergencies Act and \"Section 1135\" waiver authority were invoked for the response to the flu pandemic. The Stafford Act was not invoked for the H1N1 pandemic response. The Secretary of HHS waived Social Security Act requirements to help healthcare facilities manage patient surges. The applicability of the Stafford Act and \"Section 1135\" waivers are discussed in subsequent sections. On April 27, Janet Napolitano, Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, assumed the role of Principal Federal Official for the federal response to the flu outbreak. The Stafford Act has not been invoked for the H1N1 pandemic response, which authorizes federal assistance to entities affected by disasters. Declarations of emergency and major disaster provide different levels of assistance. The Stafford Act, administered by FEMA, provides different levels of assistance through declarations of emergency and major disaster. Major disaster assistance historically focuses on meteorological or geological disasters, wildfires, and terrorist acts, raising debate on its applicability to infectious disease threats. Emergency assistance under the Stafford Act may not be tailored for infectious disease outbreaks due to their different consequences. The legal analysis by CRS concluded that emergency assistance under the Stafford Act could be provided by the President in the event of a flu pandemic, but major disaster assistance authorization is unclear. There is no precedent for a major disaster declaration for infectious disease threats, and the legislative history of the Stafford Act does not address this issue. The National Strategy for Pandemic Influenza assumed the President's authority to declare a major disaster could apply to a flu pandemic. FEMA issued a Disaster Assistance Policy in 2007 regarding Stafford Act assistance during a flu outbreak. The Disaster Assistance Policy under the Stafford Act may be invoked for a flu pandemic response, allowing for emergency medical care costs to be covered by eligible entities. DHS Secretary Janet Napolitano initially did not plan to invoke the Stafford Act, but Deputy Secretary Jane Holl Lute stated it could be used under certain circumstances. HHS suggested that state governors could request a Stafford Act declaration from the President if local resources are insufficient for the pandemic response. FEMA provided guidance to states on assessing impacts. The FEMA fact sheet referenced for assessing impacts and federal assistance under the Stafford Act for the H1N1 flu pandemic response. Customs and Border Protection monitored incoming travelers for symptoms and referred symptomatic persons for evaluation. No border restrictions were in effect, with standard health monitoring at ports of entry. Administration officials resisted calls for more aggressive measures such as closing the U.S.-Mexico border, citing scientific evidence that does not support border closures as an effective means of controlling the spread of influenza. On April 26, a public health emergency was declared, allowing for the emergency use of unapproved medical treatments and tests under specified conditions. During a public health emergency declaration, the HHS Secretary can authorize the use of unapproved medical treatments and tests. However, emergency funding mechanisms like the Public Health Emergency Fund have not been accessible since the 1990s. The public health emergency determination was renewed by HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius multiple times. During a public health emergency, the HHS Secretary can waive administrative requirements under the Social Security Act and health information privacy provisions to streamline healthcare delivery. President Obama declared a national emergency on October 23, allowing for these waivers. President Obama declared a national emergency on October 23 due to the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic, allowing the HHS Secretary to waive certain requirements of healthcare programs and HIPAA Privacy Rule to enable emergency operations plans. In response to the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic, the Secretary of HHS implemented 1135 waivers to waive certain healthcare program requirements and HIPAA Privacy Rule sanctions. This allowed hospitals to redirect patients with flu symptoms to alternate facilities for triage and medical recordkeeping. The 1135 waivers, administered by HHS CMS, can be applied to geographic emergency areas with concurrent declarations. These waivers have been used in response to various emergencies, including Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and the H1N1 pandemic. The National Emergencies Act was utilized for the H1N1 pandemic response, enabling the use of 1135 waivers. FDA Commissioner can authorize medical products under certain conditions for emerging threats. The FDA Commissioner can issue Emergency Use Authorizations (EUAs) for unapproved medical products during public health emergencies. EUAs have been issued for antiviral drugs like Tamiflu and Relenza, disposable respirators, and diagnostic tests for new flu strains. These EUAs allow for the use of products in ways not explicitly approved on the product label, such as in young children or for longer durations. Peramivir, an unapproved antiviral drug, can also be used under EUAs. Peramivir is an unapproved antiviral drug that can be given intravenously to seriously ill patients who cannot take oral Tamiflu or inhaled Relenza. The U.S. government has not purchased H1N1 pandemic vaccines containing adjuvants, all purchased vaccines have been approved through routine licensing processes. Management authorities for the H1N1 flu pandemic response are shown in Figure 1. Health officials believe that cases of the novel H1N1 flu may be underreported due to mild symptoms. Some U.S. states have stopped confirmatory tests on suspected cases to focus on monitoring disease spread. The CDC is using a multi-layered surveillance system to track the pandemic, including an additional component for better monitoring. On August 30, CDC started accepting reports from states on all influenza cases. On August 30, CDC began accepting reports from states of all influenza- and pneumonia-associated hospitalizations and deaths for the 2009-2010 season. This component tracks both laboratory-confirmed cases of influenza and \"syndromic\" reports. Reporting only laboratory-confirmed cases underestimates the burden of illness due to influenza. Syndromic reporting captures some cases of pneumonia that are due to causes other than influenza. CDC notes that tracking each measure provides useful information about trends in the spread of the pandemic and the burdens experienced by the health care system in responding to it. The CDC tracks influenza and pneumonia hospitalizations and deaths for the 2009-2010 season to monitor trends in the pandemic and the burden on the healthcare system. Surveillance mechanisms do not accurately count deaths from the pandemic, so estimates are derived from various sources. CDC estimated between 14 million and 34 million cases of H1N1 infection in the US between April and October 17. Between April and October 17, there were 14-34 million cases of H1N1 infection in the US, with 63,000-153,000 hospitalizations and 2,500-6,000 deaths. CDC reported 35 influenza-associated pediatric deaths in one week, with widespread activity in 46 states. Tamiflu was effective against most flu viruses, and FDA licensed five vaccines against the H1N1 strain. The FDA licensed four vaccines against the H1N1 pandemic flu strain, with a fifth vaccine licensed in November. A nationwide vaccination campaign began in early October, considered the most extensive effort in the US. Vaccination is crucial for preventing influenza, but vaccines need to be matched to circulating strains for good immunity. Currently licensed seasonal flu vaccines in the US are produced using a time-consuming process involving fertilized hen's eggs. The process of producing seasonal flu vaccines involves adapting the virus for mass production in specially raised, fertilized hen's eggs. The adapted virus, known as a \"seed\" virus, is grown in large amounts in the eggs before small amounts of the finished vaccine are produced for clinical trials. If the trials prove the vaccine to be safe and effective, mass production of the vaccine begins in batches. Vaccine development for a typical Northern Hemisphere flu season starts in January or February, with three flu strains selected based on those circulating in the Southern Hemisphere. The vaccine is then produced and becomes available over the next six to nine months, typically from September through December, before the peak of the flu season. The process of producing flu vaccines involves adapting the virus for mass production in hen's eggs. The development of a vaccine for a new flu strain, like H1N1, can take at least four to six months. Efforts have been made to expand domestic capacity for mass-producing flu vaccines and to speed up production using adjuvants. The development of flu vaccines involves adapting the virus for mass production in hen's eggs, with efforts to improve production capacity and speed using adjuvants. Federal officials highlight key decision points in pandemic flu vaccine development, including clinical trials and mass production. The U.S. pandemic flu vaccine strategy involves purchasing, mass-producing, and administering a promising vaccine through a mass-vaccination campaign. A timeline shows decision points and the overlap between production of seasonal flu vaccine and H1N1 pandemic vaccine. HHS issued purchase orders for H1N1 pandemic vaccine based on existing contracts with producers of seasonal flu vaccines. Development and procurement efforts for the H1N1 pandemic vaccine are led by HHS BARDA, in coordination with NIH, FDA, CDC, and other HHS agencies. NIAID coordinates clinical trials to determine vaccine safety, effectiveness, and dosing. Trials on healthy adults showed that the pandemic vaccine was protective with the same dose as seasonal flu vaccines, no booster was needed, and no serious safety concerns were noted. Large-scale production of pandemic vaccines could be done with existing capacity, without the use of adjuvants. Vaccines for H1N1 could be licensed through the usual process for seasonal flu vaccines, without the need for Emergency Use Authorizations. Clinical trials on children, pregnant women, and individuals with HIV are ongoing. NIAID is conducting trials on H1N1 vaccines with adjuvant, which may be useful if the virus mutates. Research on adjuvants aims to improve influenza vaccine production. FDA announced updates on vaccine development on September 16. On September 16, FDA approved H1N1 pandemic flu vaccines from five companies: Sanofi Pasteur Inc., CSL Limited, Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics Limited, MedImmune LLC, and ID Biomedical Corporation of Quebec. The vaccines are either injectable or intranasal, with varying approved uses for different age groups. Healthy adults typically receive one dose, while children aged six months to nine years may need two doses for protective immunity. None of the vaccines are approved for infants under six months. The intranasal vaccine is approved for healthy individuals aged 2 to 49 years. The intranasal vaccine is approved for use in healthy individuals aged 2 to 49 years. The injectable products are available in multi-dose vials with a preservative and single-dose syringes without a preservative. Congress provided up to $7.65 billion in FY2009 for pandemic response, including vaccine purchase and nationwide vaccination campaign costs. Costs for vaccination include vaccine supplies and administration expenses. According to CDC, pandemic flu vaccines and necessary supplies are provided by the federal government at no cost. Providers cannot charge individuals for these costs, but may charge for administration fees if insurance is not available. States are expected to use federal funds for pandemic planning to support free vaccination clinics for the uninsured. The federal government provides pandemic flu vaccines and supplies at no cost, including vaccination for the uninsured at clinics. A \"blended\" public- and private-sector distribution approach is used to provide vaccines to anyone who wants them. CDC maintains the Strategic National Stockpile for unanticipated threats like bioterrorism, providing training and assistance to distribute stockpile materials. The Vaccines for Children program distributes recommended pediatric vaccines. CDC distributes recommended pediatric vaccines for Children program through private providers, financed by Medicaid. A blended approach is used for the pandemic vaccination campaign, utilizing public and private providers. CDC has contracted with McKesson Corporation to distribute vaccines, with limited amounts of the H1N1 pandemic vaccine available in early October. The available amounts were less than expected, causing issues for states and localities planning vaccination clinics. CDC had projected between 45 million and 52 million doses. In August, CDC reported expecting 45-52 million doses of vaccine by mid-October, with weekly availability increasing to 195 million by year-end. However, in mid-October, only 11.4 million doses were available due to production issues. Some states struggled to distribute the vaccine despite high demand. States are required to order vaccine from their allotments for distribution. HHS provides daily updates on vaccine allocation, orders, and shipments. Despite being voluntary, some states have established requirements for the vaccination of health care workers. There is considerable variation among states in the distribution of vaccines, which are allocated based on population. Public health officials recommend vaccination for the H1N1 pandemic. Public health officials recommend that health care workers be vaccinated against influenza to protect themselves and patients. CDC advises seeking the vaccine when supplies are available, especially for pregnant women and those in close contact with infants. The ACIP recommends prioritizing certain groups for the H1N1 pandemic vaccine due to limited supply. These groups include infants under 6 months, healthcare personnel, individuals aged 6 months-24 years, and those aged 25-64 with medical conditions. Pregnant women, caregivers of infants, and healthcare workers with direct patient contact are given top priority. The ACIP recommends prioritizing certain groups for the H1N1 pandemic vaccine due to limited supply. This includes infants under 6 months, healthcare personnel, individuals aged 6 months-24 years, and those aged 25-64 with medical conditions. The subset of priority groups comprises about 42 million persons in the United States. Available vaccine may be injectable or intranasal, with injectable vaccine suitable for most in priority groups. Pregnant women, children under two years, and some individuals should not receive the intranasal vaccine. The H1N1 pandemic vaccine is recommended for prioritized groups including pregnant women, children under two years, individuals with chronic illnesses, and healthcare workers. Final allocation decisions are made at the state and local levels. Clinical trials showed no serious adverse events, but rare events may occur with widespread use. Health officials will monitor for adverse events using the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). The VAERS program, co-sponsored by CDC and FDA, accepts reports on adverse events from various sources. In 1976, a vaccination campaign for the Swine Flu was halted due to a risk of Guillain-Barre Syndrome. The PREP Act was invoked for the H1N1 pandemic vaccine to establish an injury compensation program and waive liability. The June 25 declaration under the PREP Act eliminates liability for the United States and others involved in administering the H1N1 vaccine. It also establishes a compensation program for serious injuries or death resulting from the vaccine. The Covered Countermeasure Process Fund (CCPF) was established to pay claims for injuries resulting from the H1N1 vaccine. Congress authorized emergency funding for pandemic preparedness, including funding for the CCPF. President Obama requested additional funding for the CCPF in 2009. The goal set in 2005 was to establish domestic vaccine production capacity to vaccinate the entire U.S. population within six months of a flu pandemic. Federal officials implemented a multi-pronged strategy to expand production capacity for influenza vaccine within six months of a potential pandemic. Investments were made in both current and new approaches, including a new private facility for cell-based vaccine production. Despite concerns about H5N1 avian flu, the unexpected H1N1 pandemic flu tested the federal strategy, with mixed results from investments made. Investments in expanding influenza vaccine production capacity were made by federal officials within six months of a potential pandemic. The United States has ordered enough H1N1 pandemic vaccine for 250 million doses, but the lag time in egg-based vaccine technology has led to stark effects as the pandemic unfolds in an unimmunized population. Observers suggest peak virus transmission may occur before sufficient vaccine is available, leading to shortages persisting over a month into the vaccination campaign. Some believe more investment or better planning could have mitigated this issue. The decision to not use adjuvants in the pandemic vaccine was made when officials were optimistic about a timely roll-out, but it could have increased vaccine availability. Adjuvant-containing seasonal flu vaccines are not licensed in the US, requiring Emergency Use Authorization, which could have delayed availability and raised safety concerns. Some suggest investing in cell-based vaccine technology could have expedited the response to the H1N1 pandemic. The European Medicines Agency licensed cell-based seasonal influenza vaccine Optaflu in 2007, and a cell-based H1N1 pandemic vaccine Celvapan. Cell-based production offers scalability, allowing for quick production of large quantities of vaccines within weeks. However, it does not significantly shorten the time to first vaccine availability compared to egg-based production. Alternative approaches for flu vaccine production involve technologies that do not rely on egg-based methods, allowing for quicker scalability and production of large quantities of vaccines within weeks. These methods focus on producing only the necessary portions of the virus to generate immunity, such as specific proteins in the virus coat, using recombinant technology. Recombinant technology allows for the insertion of genes for desired virus subunits into microorganisms like yeast or vectors to produce vaccines containing only specific viral proteins. The ultimate goal is a universal influenza vaccine that can protect against all variations of the flu. Current U.S.-licensed flu vaccines are predominantly egg-based, but alternative cell-based methods are being explored for quicker and more scalable production. Recombinant vaccines for hepatitis B and human papillomavirus are licensed in the United States. DNA-based vaccines are not yet licensed for human use in the US or Europe. Various vaccine production methods, including whole virus and cell-based approaches, are also used for veterinary vaccines. The NIH conducts clinical trials on influenza vaccine prototypes using recombinant techniques, ranging from Phase I to Phase III trials. In FY2008, NIH spent $204 million on influenza research, including projects on advanced vaccine production and immunology applicable to vaccine development. Clinical trials sponsored by NIH focused on vaccines against H1N1 pandemic flu, H5N1 avian flu, and other strains for licensing and stockpiling. BARDA in HHS provides federal leadership for emergency medical countermeasures development, including flu vaccines. Advanced development of flu vaccine technology received federal investments from FY2006 emergency supplemental funds for pandemic preparedness. The technology for flu vaccine development received funding from FY2006 emergency supplemental funds administered by BARDA. HHS reports detail the use of these funds, with a focus on expanding vaccine production capacity through contracts with companies and construction of production facilities. The goal was to establish sufficient domestic flu vaccine production capacity. HHS funded Sanofi Pasteur, Medimmune, and Novartis to expand domestic flu vaccine production capacity. BARDA announced RFP for advanced development of recombinant influenza vaccine products. Availability of pandemic flu vaccines estimated at 20-23 weeks post-pandemic onset. Recombinant influenza vaccines may be available 8 to 12 weeks post-pandemic onset, potentially towards the end of the first pandemic wave. Vaccination, antiviral drugs, and community measures can help reduce mortality and morbidity during a severe pandemic. HHS intends for successful applicants to develop approaches applicable to both seasonal and pandemic flu vaccine production. The advantages of using a proven approach in emergencies, such as basing pandemic flu vaccine production on the method used for seasonal flu vaccine, include safety, cost-effectiveness, and wide acceptance. However, switching to a different approach could potentially increase the cost of seasonal flu vaccine initially. New technologies for production may be more expensive at first, which could impact public health efforts to expand vaccine utilization. States have received HHS funds since FY2002 to prepare for public health threats, with requirements starting in FY2004. States have received HHS funds since FY2002 to prepare for public health threats and emergencies, including flu pandemics. Congress provided additional funding in FY2006 and FY2009 for state pandemic planning efforts. Plans were found to be robust in core public health activities but lacking in multi-sector preparedness. In January 2009, HHS and DHS published a report on state pandemic planning, highlighting advanced preparedness in public health activities but challenges in healthcare surge planning and continuity of essential non-health services. The state assessment report highlighted challenges in planning for continuity of non-health services during a pandemic. Federal funding for pandemic preparedness has been limited to HHS grants, leaving states struggling to develop preparedness in non-health sectors. If the pandemic remains mild to moderate, the impact on sectors like transportation and public utilities may be minimal. Despite high marks for mass vaccination planning, some states have faced delays in ordering and distributing available vaccines during the H1N1 outbreak. Legal authority to close schools during outbreaks varies among states, with CDC finding that most jurisdictions allow for school closure during emergencies. State authority for closure may be vested at different levels of government, such as state or local education agencies or departments of health. During the H1N1 pandemic, CDC recommended school closures for up to 14 days in affected communities with confirmed cases. However, on May 5, CDC officials revised their guidance, advising against closures based on individual cases and instead focusing on keeping sick students and employees at home. During the H1N1 pandemic, CDC recommended school closures for up to 14 days in affected communities with confirmed cases. However, on May 5, CDC officials revised their guidance, advising against closures based on individual cases and instead emphasizing keeping sick students and employees at home. State and local officials faced uncertainty about decision-making protocols, with many states found to have inadequate preparedness for planning student dismissal and school closure. Outbreaks in schools subsided over the summer but re-emerged in the fall as students returned to elementary, secondary schools, colleges, and universities. The American College Health Association (ACHA) tracked reports of pandemic flu activity in colleges and universities, showing high levels of nationwide influenza-like illnesses. Congressional committees held hearings on the emergence of the new strain of H1N1 influenza. The Secretary of HHS lacked dedicated funds for public health emergencies like the current flu pandemic, with prior-year appropriations insufficient for a mass-vaccination campaign. The National Strategy for Pandemic Influenza Implementation Plan lacks discussion on costs and financing for 324 action items. The Secretary of HHS can access the Public Health Emergency Fund during a public health emergency, but it currently has no balance. There has been no recent appropriation for the fund, and disaster relief funds are not available for the current flu pandemic. The current flu pandemic has led to a lack of disaster relief funds from FEMA for response efforts. Compensation for harm resulting from the use of medical countermeasures can be provided through a Covered Countermeasure Process Fund, including for injuries or deaths from antiviral drugs and pandemic vaccines. In FY2009, emergency supplemental funding was authorized for pandemic preparedness, including the use of funds for the Covered Countermeasure Process Fund. President Obama requested $2 billion for H1N1 response, with additional funds contingent upon presidential request. The Supplemental Appropriations Act, FY2009 provided $1.9 billion immediately and $5.8 billion upon request documentation. The curr_chunk discusses the allocation of additional funds for public health emergency response, including $1.85 billion to the HHS Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund (PHSSEF) with specific allocations for CDC and state/local public health capacity. The Secretary of HHS has the authority to transfer funds to other accounts and federal agencies. Funds can be used for the Strategic National Stockpile, vaccine production facilities, and the Covered Countermeasure Process Fund. An additional $5.8 billion may be appropriated for the PHSSEF upon presidential request for specific purposes to address emergencies. The curr_chunk discusses the allocation of funds for specific purposes in response to a public health emergency. Funds can be transferred for the Strategic National Stockpile and the Covered Countermeasure Process Fund. Additionally, $50 million is allocated for global efforts to control the outbreak, with provisions for potential use in a flu pandemic. President Obama has requested $4.541 billion of contingent funding for pandemic response activities, leaving a balance of $1.259 billion. Requests include funding for vaccine procurement, immunization planning, FDA regulatory activities, and agency preparedness. Additional funding of $2.716 billion was requested for various departments to support vaccine procurement, antiviral medications, and vaccination campaign preparations. In FY2006, Congress allocated $6.1 billion for pandemic planning in response to Hurricane Katrina and H5N1 avian flu. Annual funding has been provided to CDC, FDA, and HHS for vaccine development, stockpiling, and state assistance. HHS received almost $13.4 billion from FY2004 to FY2009 for flu preparedness. USDA and Interior also received funding for monitoring avian flu in poultry and wild birds. USAID received funds to assist other countries in managing avian flu transmission. Congress is interested in how agencies budget for influenza within their existing activities, but defining these amounts is difficult due to the shift towards flexible public health capacity. Teasing out the nation's investment solely for pandemic flu preparedness is challenging, as pandemic planning efforts are integrated into these flexible capabilities. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has tracked pandemic influenza funding over several fiscal years using comparable criteria. Different agencies have varying methods for accounting influenza spending, making it challenging to differentiate investments for pandemic flu, seasonal flu, avian or swine flu, and general drug and vaccine development. Caution is advised when adding these amounts together as they may not be comparable between agencies. In the George W. Bush Administration, pandemic flu preparedness efforts were coordinated by the Homeland Security Council. Numerous federal documents on flu pandemic preparedness have been published, with a focus on H5N1 avian flu. The H5N1 strain has not efficiently transmitted between people but has high fatality rates from contact with infected poultry. The National Strategy for Pandemic Influenza outlines responsibilities for individuals, industry, and governments. The National Strategy for Pandemic Influenza, Implementation Plan assigns preparedness tasks to various government departments and agencies, with progress measures and timelines. The HHS Pandemic Influenza Plan provides guidance to policymakers and health departments on roles and responsibilities during a pandemic. The HHS Pandemic Influenza Implementation Plan, Part I, November 2006, outlines key roles and responsibilities during a pandemic, emphasizing preparedness efforts in public health and healthcare sectors. The plan includes activities such as disease surveillance, public health interventions, medical response, vaccines, antiviral drugs, and communication strategies. Additionally, the CDC's Interim Pre-pandemic Planning Guidance provides recommendations for social distancing strategies to reduce contact between people, including school closures and work leave policies. The Department of Defense and VA have plans for pandemic influenza, focusing on health protection, essential functions, communication, and support to partners. The DHS guide offers business planners advice on preparedness for critical infrastructure. The DHS guide, published in September 2006, provides guidance for business planners on continuity during a pandemic for critical infrastructure sectors and key resources. States were required to develop specific pandemic flu preparedness plans as a condition for grants from HHS. Additional resources include CRS Reports on public health and emergency preparedness, as well as specific aspects of the pandemic influenza threat. The CRS reports mentioned cover various aspects of pandemic preparedness and response, including mandatory vaccinations, influenza pandemic qualifications under the Stafford Act, supplemental appropriations for overseas operations, farm sector effects of H1N1, U.S. responses to global human cases, the role of the Department of Defense during a flu pandemic, legal issues related to quarantine and isolation, and Project BioShield purposes. The CRS reports mentioned cover pandemic preparedness and response, including mandatory vaccinations, influenza pandemic qualifications under the Stafford Act, farm sector effects of H1N1, legal issues related to quarantine and isolation, and Project BioShield purposes. Employees: Human Resources Management Flexibilities in Emergency Situations, by [author name scrubbed], discusses concerns about a possible human flu pandemic resulting from H5N1 avian influenza and enhanced federal preparedness efforts during 2005 through 2007. It also includes information on the current H1N1 pandemic flu situation and WHO guidance on pandemic influenza preparedness and response. The curr_chunk provides links to various resources for information on the current phase of the flu pandemic alert, including WHO guidance on pandemic influenza preparedness and response, Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) resources, International Health Regulations (2005), government-wide information, Department of Homeland Security (DHS) response to H1N1 flu, CDC information on H1N1 (swine flu), CDC Public Health Law Program on 2009 H1N1 flu legal preparedness, and FDA information on 2009 H1N1 (Swine) Flu Virus. The curr_chunk provides links to various resources for information on the current phase of the flu pandemic alert, including WHO guidance on pandemic influenza preparedness and response, PAHO resources, International Health Regulations (2005), government-wide information, DHS response to H1N1 flu, CDC information on H1N1 (swine flu), CDC Public Health Law Program on 2009 H1N1 flu legal preparedness, and FDA information on 2009 H1N1 (Swine) Flu Virus. The chunk also includes links to H1N1 information from CMS, Department of Education, USDA, USDA nutrition program policies for pandemic flu, Department of Defense Pandemic Influenza Watchboard, and HHS Pandemic Planning Updates. The curr_chunk provides links to resources for information on the H5N1 avian flu threat, including the Public Health Agency of Canada and the Canadian Food Inspection Agency. It also includes information from the Security and Prosperity Partnership of North America, the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy, and the Public Health Law and Policy Program at Arizona State University. The World Health Organization is the coordinating authority for health within the United Nations system and is responsible for monitoring and assessing health trends. An influenza pandemic occurs when a novel flu strain emerges and spreads globally, causing human illnesses. The virus must be genetically novel, pathogenic, and easily transmitted for a pandemic to occur. WHO does not have enforcement powers but provides leadership, research guidance, and technical support to countries. The World Health Organization monitors the spread of influenza and has developed a scale to monitor pandemic risk. It consists of six phases, with the sixth phase representing a full-blown human pandemic. WHO raised the pandemic alert level from Phase 3 to Phase 5 due to the rapid spread of a new flu strain. The World Health Organization raised the pandemic alert level to Phase 5 due to sustained community-level transmission of the new H1N1 virus, signaling an imminent pandemic. On June 11, WHO declared the start of the 2009 influenza pandemic caused by the new strain, with spread no longer traceable to defined chains of transmission. The current pandemic is being closely monitored in real-time, benefiting from investments in pandemic preparedness over the last five years. WHO has urged governments and other entities to develop response plans, although some argue that the current definition of a pandemic does not consider the severity of illness. The definition of a pandemic should consider severity, argued against a Phase 6 designation for H1N1 flu. The 2005 International Health Regulations require nations to notify WHO of public health emergencies and provide information. Regulations include disease control measures like quarantine and border controls. The WHO declared the H1N1 flu outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern, urging timely notification, disease reporting, and risk communication to prevent international disease spread and trade/travel restrictions. Some governments implemented enhanced passenger screening, debated travel bans, but WHO advised against movement restrictions to control influenza. WHO advises against movement restrictions to control influenza, citing lack of evidence of effectiveness and potential harm to public confidence and economies. WHO, FAO, OIE, and WTO state that pork and pork products handled with good hygiene practices will not be a source of infection for influenza A(H1N1). The OIE Terrestrial Animal Health Standards Code does not justify trade measures on the importation of pigs or their products as swine flu is not transmitted through food."
