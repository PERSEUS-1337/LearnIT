    "content": "Tax reform is a key issue in Congress, with a focus on the taxation of U.S. companies' foreign income. Proposals vary from decreasing to increasing taxes on foreign earnings. Business leaders advocate for a territorial tax system to eliminate U.S. taxes on active foreign income. Various proposals, including those by Grubert, Mutti, Dave Camp, and Senator Enzi, have been put forward. The National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform also supports a territorial tax. President Obama and Senators Wyden and Coats have proposed increasing taxes on foreign source income to help finance a corporate income tax rate cut. The current U.S. tax system already resembles a territorial tax in terms of revenue collection, with taxes on foreign subsidiaries deferred until repatriated to the U.S. parent. Unused credits from high-tax countries can shield income from low-tax countries. The current U.S. tax system allows firms to shield income from low-tax countries and defer taxes on foreign subsidiaries until repatriated. The effective tax rate on foreign income is estimated at 3.3%, with some types of income, like royalties, receiving favorable treatment. Economists support a worldwide tax system for efficiency reasons, rather than a territorial tax system. Moving to an explicit territorial tax system raises questions about its impact on income repatriation, investment diversion, profit shifting, transition issues, and revenue consequences. Design choices play a crucial role in determining the effects of a territorial tax. The report outlines the workings of the international tax system, foreign income distribution, and taxes. It also discusses alternative features of a territorial tax and other options that deviate from the territorial or worldwide tax approach. The current U.S. tax system is a hybrid, incorporating elements of both residence-based and source-based taxation. Territorial features like deferral and cross-crediting are introduced, allowing firms to delay taxation on foreign earnings. Complex interactions impact the design and consequences of tax revisions. The U.S. tax system incorporates elements of both residence-based and source-based taxation, allowing for deferral of foreign earnings. Foreign source income falls into four categories, with three not eligible for deferral: profits of foreign subsidiaries, current payment income, and branch income. U.S. multinationals defer taxes on foreign subsidiary profits until repatriated as dividends, with additional tax due and a foreign tax credit allowed. Current payment income, such as royalties and interest, is taxed currently and usually deductible as an expense in the foreign country. Branch income, from operations without a separately incorporated foreign subsidiary, is also taxed currently. Branch gross income and deductions are combined with parent income for tax purposes. Branch income is not eligible for deferral but can be beneficial in certain cases, such as for firms experiencing losses. Subpart F income, under the Internal Revenue Code, includes passive income and certain sales and service income between related parties, which can be shifted to low tax jurisdictions. This income is taxed currently and has been affected by recent check-the-box rules. Subpart F income has been impacted by recent check-the-box rules, making it less effective. Specific exceptions allow for deferral of income from active financing and insurance operations. The extenders, including a look-through rule, have expired after 2011 but may be extended retroactively. Cross-crediting allows taxes paid to one country to offset U.S. tax on income earned in another country. Cross-crediting allows taxes paid in one country to offset U.S. tax on income earned in another country, preventing double taxation. It can also occur within a country with varying tax rates. If the foreign tax credit had no limit, it would result in a worldwide system similar to residence-based taxation. The foreign tax credit allows taxes paid in one country to offset U.S. tax on income earned in another country. The credit is limited to the U.S. tax due on the foreign source income to prevent excessive revenue losses. Unused credits in high-tax countries can offset U.S. tax due in low-tax countries. Cross-crediting allows taxes paid in high-tax countries to offset U.S. tax due in low-tax countries or on income subject to low taxes. With the move to a territorial tax system, cross-crediting would largely disappear, affecting the ability to shield certain income like royalties from U.S. taxes. Various tax rules impact cross-crediting, such as separating income and credits into baskets and restricting the use of excess credits from certain sources like oil and gas extraction. The provision of foreign tax credit splitting, which allowed claiming credits without U.S. tax, was restricted in 2010. Companies in excess credit position have paid more foreign taxes than allowed under the limit rules. The U.S. has an overall limit for cross-crediting income, with 95% in the general basket. This allows companies to offset U.S. taxes on income from low-tax countries. The law contains restrictions on certain types of income, such as oil and gas extraction income, which disallows credits paid in excess of U.S. tax due. This places oil and gas extraction income in a separate basket due to high foreign taxes. The U.S. tax on foreign oil and gas extraction income is subject to restrictions, disallowing excess credits to offset other income taxes. This creates a separate basket for this income. Allocation of overhead and deductions can also contribute to generating excess foreign tax credits. The allocation of foreign source income for the foreign tax credit limit can result in excess credits, even in countries with lower tax rates than the US. Borrowing at the parent level limits firms from avoiding US tax by borrowing in low-tax countries. Foreign subsidiaries may have overhead costs not recognized in income. The elective worldwide interest allocation rule, scheduled for 2021, allows for foreign income cross-crediting. The title passage rule permits foreign income sourcing for export subsidies, crucial for territorial tax considerations. The elimination of foreign tax credits under P.L. 111-226 may impact export income and royalties, potentially leading to higher tax rates. This provision aimed to prevent claiming credits for income not actually taxed. The extent of these activities and their effect on data availability is uncertain. It is important to understand the significance of foreign income sources and their current and potential tax contributions before discussing reform consequences. The section discusses the current sources of foreign income, potential unreported income, tax liability sources, and foregone taxes due to deferral and cross-crediting. Table 1 displays the distribution of foreign income types for firms claiming foreign tax credits in 2007 and 2008. The data set aims to capture most foreign income reported by U.S. multinationals. The data shows that total foreign source net income was $392.5 billion in 2007 and $413.4 billion in 2008. Dividends and Subpart F income are reported separately, with dividends needing to be increased by taxes paid for corporate taxpayers electing a foreign tax credit. Royalties account for about a quarter of foreign source income. In 2007 and 2008, total foreign source net income was $392.5 billion and $413.4 billion respectively. Royalties make up about a quarter of foreign source income. Non-allocable deductions accounted for 36% of foreign source income in 2007 and 33% in 2008. Dividend payments and related tax gross ups are smaller as a share when pre-tax income is considered. The importance of oil and gas extraction income in foreign source income totals is highlighted in Table 1 and Table 2, despite allocation rule imperfections. Including this income in dividends would increase the total to 35% to 40%. Taxes on oil and gas earnings are usually higher than U.S. taxes, leading to separate treatment. Interest income also plays a significant role in foreign source income totals. Deferred income is included in total foreign source income, but the extent of this deferral is not specified. Foreign source income includes deferred income, with estimates suggesting that close to half of it is subject to U.S. tax. Only a quarter of active income from foreign subsidiaries of U.S. firms is currently repatriated. IRS statistics for controlled foreign corporations in 2008 show that total deemed and distributed income was 27% of pre-tax income, with Subpart F income at 12.1% and dividends at 14.7%. Dividends accounted for 18.1% of after-tax income and Subpart F income for 14.3%, totaling 32.4%. These ratios may be slightly understated due to non-U.S. shareholders. The Commerce Department data reports $511 billion and $582 billion of rest of world corporate profits in 2007 and 2008. The ratios for distributions after foreign tax in 2007 were 14.7% for dividends and 12.7% for Subpart F income, totaling 27.4%. In 2008, the ratios were 15.7% for dividends, 12.0% for Subpart F, and 27.8% in total. Deemed taxes were not included in these numbers. The share of pre-tax profits including taxes for 2008 was 19.7% for dividends and 14.7% for Subpart F. Dividends accounted for 23% of pre-tax profits net of Subpart F income. Overall, close to half of foreign source income is reported as taxable income in the United States, but less than a quarter of the income over which firms have discretion, active income of foreign subsidiaries, is subject to U.S. tax. Rates of deferral vary significantly by location, with Canadian subsidiaries distributing 44% of after-tax income. Canadian subsidiaries distributed 44% of after-tax income, with 36% as discretionary payments and 8% as Subpart F income. In Switzerland, 19% was paid out, 10% as dividends, and 9% as Subpart F income. Repatriated income is not random, as firms choose to repatriate income easily shielded by foreign tax credits. The effective U.S. residual tax rate on foreign source income was only 7% in 2007 and 5% in 2008, indicating that royalties were being shielded from tax by excess credits. Royalties totaling $101.9 billion and $106.4 billion should have been subject to a 35% tax rate, resulting in potential taxes of around $32 billion and $33 billion respectively, larger than the total taxes paid. In 2000, evidence from tax returns showed that $12.7 billion of U.S. residual taxes were traced to foreign sources, with royalties, interest, and branch income in the active basket bearing the largest share of taxes. Only three foreign tax credit limit baskets accounted for a significant share: passive, financial services, and the residual general limit basket. The study in 2000 showed that U.S. residual taxes from foreign sources were mainly from royalties, interest, and branch income in the active basket. Taxes on active dividends in 2007 would have resulted in a minimal U.S. tax on total foreign source active income. Selective deferral and cross-crediting eliminated U.S. tax on active income of foreign subsidiaries. Two-thirds of royalties were shielded by tax credits, but current tax collection on royalties may have increased due to lower foreign tax rates and the elimination of foreign tax credit splitting. Table 5 estimates potential foreign taxes for FY2014, including taxes collected, additional taxes from repealing deferral, and additional taxes with a per country foreign tax credit. This aims to create a worldwide system eliminating deferral and cross-crediting. The importance of cross-crediting is highlighted, as moving to a per country foreign tax credit limit affects deferral elimination. A territorial tax could have broader consequences beyond active income, as excess credits shield royalty and export income from U.S. tax. Moving from the current hybrid tax system to a territorial tax could have various consequences, including effects on repatriations, real investment location, profit shifting, transition issues, and revenue. The current system is criticized for discouraging repatriations while collecting little revenue from foreign subsidiaries. Ways and Means Committee's press release argues that lower repatriation rates lead to less investment and fewer jobs in the U.S. The potential effects of moving to a territorial tax system include changes in repatriations, investment, and job creation in the United States. Various approaches, such as taxing a fixed share of profits or exempting a portion, could eliminate the tax effect on repatriations. The impact of increased repatriations on investment and job creation remains uncertain. The estimates suggest that about a third of foreign subsidiaries' earnings were repatriated, with around 23% distributed after taxes. It is unlikely that a significant increase in repatriations would occur, as much of the earnings are typically reinvested abroad. Historical evidence shows that about 60% of income is usually retained for maintaining capital stock and allowing for growth. Historical data indicates that about 60% of nominal income is retained for capital stock maintenance and growth. Repatriation rates have been low, possibly due to a one-time tax exemption in 2005. Data from the late 1990s to 2008 show low repatriation rates, with a significant portion of earnings reinvested abroad. The repatriation rates from 1968-2008 averaged 40%, dropping to 20% from 2000-2008. Factors such as repatriation holidays, growth of high-tech firms, and tax data suggest minimal long-term impact of repatriation tax. If high-tech industries stabilize and no further tax breaks are expected, repatriation rates may increase. The shift to a territorial tax system may not have a significant impact on repatriation rates. Initial evidence shows a modest increase in repatriations, with estimates ranging from 4% to 13% of total earnings. Studies on Japan and the UK suggest an increase of 6% to 20% in repatriations. However, the overall effect is considered to be relatively small. The shift to a territorial tax system may not significantly impact repatriation rates, with estimates ranging from 4% to 13% of total earnings. Theoretical considerations suggest that the repatriation tax should not matter in the long run, as firms will eventually have to repatriate earnings. This theory, known as the \"new view,\" is similar to the idea behind why domestic firms pay dividends to shareholders despite triggering a dividend tax. Eventually, shareholders will want to receive dividends in excess of reinvestment needs, leading to the same present value of tax regardless of timing. The empirical literature on repatriation behavior shows mixed results regarding the impact of taxes on repatriations. Early evidence suggested sensitivity to tax, but later research attributed this to transitory effects. Highly taxed subsidiaries were more likely to repatriate earnings, indicating tax effects, although alternative strategies for cash return to the US reduced the importance of the repatriation tax. Recent studies suggest that differential repatriation rates exist between high and low tax subsidiaries, but they may not be significant. Taxes have a limited effect on repatriations, with payout shares averaging around 40% over time. The push for a repatriation holiday and the accumulation of unrepatriated earnings are likely driven by firms with intangible assets, rapid growth abroad, and potential profit shifting. The push for a repatriation holiday and the accumulation of unrepatriated earnings may be due to firms with intangible assets and potential profit shifting. Repatriations may not lead to additional investment but are likely to be paid out as dividends or used to substitute for borrowing. Job creation is not the primary focus, as the economy tends to create jobs naturally over time. Permanent provisions encouraging capital to move abroad can change the types of jobs and reduce employment in the long run. Permanent provisions that encourage capital to move abroad can change job types and reduce wages, but not overall employment. Evaluating foreign tax regimes focuses on the effect on investment allocation. Taxing investments at the same rate globally maximizes output by investing where the highest pre-tax return is earned. Allowing foreign income to be exempt leads to less productive use of capital, with lower returns compared to investing in the United States. The justification for moving towards a territorial tax system, as opposed to a residence-based system, may be due to political constraints. Grubert and Mutti propose a territorial tax system as an improvement over current rules, which was considered in President Bush's Advisory. Grubert and Mutti proposed incorporating their tax reform ideas into President Bush's Advisory Commission's proposals. Their plan includes exempting active dividends from tax and allocating overhead costs between taxable and tax-exempt income. Eliminating foreign tax credits would increase revenue and raise the overall tax rate on foreign source income. They also suggest that repatriations would not trigger a tax, reducing the cost of tax planning. The argument for a territorial tax system is based on reducing the cost of tax planning to avoid the repatriation tax. Moving to a territorial system should be based on economic efficiency rather than following other countries' policies. European countries have different policies due to their closer proximity and freedom of capital movement within the European Union. The United States has laws to prevent firms from relocating headquarters, influencing decisions on territorial systems and corporate tax rates. The argument that the US should not tax foreign subsidiaries to compete abroad is not valid. Countries trade rather than compete, and taxing foreign and domestic investments at the same rate would benefit the US. Arguments have been made that U.S. firms can change their nationality by moving their headquarters abroad, merging with foreign companies, or incorporating abroad. The anti-inversion rules adopted in 2004 may prevent large-scale shifting of headquarters of existing firms, while mergers and incorporating abroad are influenced by non-tax factors. Legislation could address the issue of little incorporation of true U.S. firms abroad. Higher taxes on returns to capital investments might deter U.S. firms from exploiting intangible assets overseas, but there are alternative methods like licenses, franchises, and contract manufacturing. U.S. innovations could still be produced domestically and exported. The likely effects of altering the international tax system on investment would probably be modest, as most countries have similar tax rates to the United States. The average effective tax rate on foreign subsidiaries of U.S. parents is estimated to be lower due to profit shifting to low tax countries. Overall effective tax rates abroad for foreign subsidiaries of U.S. companies vary. Overall effective tax rates abroad for foreign subsidiaries of U.S. companies vary by industry, with lower rates in industries with intangible assets. Moving to a territorial tax system may not significantly impact capital outflows if firms already avoid U.S. taxes through profit reinvestment or tax planning. However, ending deferral and implementing anti-base erosion provisions could lead to increased investment abroad, especially in lower tax jurisdictions. Moving to a territorial tax system could reduce capital investment abroad by keeping more capital in the United States. However, the overall impact on the U.S. economy and welfare is expected to be minimal. Estimates suggest that cutting the U.S. corporate tax rate by ten percentage points would only slightly increase U.S. output and income. On the other hand, transitioning to a territorial tax system may have negative effects on U.S. output by increasing the return on outbound capital. Despite this, the effects are projected to be smaller in magnitude. A ten percentage point rate reduction would result in a significant loss of corporate revenue. Eliminating various taxes on foreign source income would result in a significant loss of corporate revenue, with estimates ranging from 7.5% to 29%. However, the effects on the U.S. economy are expected to be minimal due to factors such as capital mobility constraints and the size of the domestic economy. The impact of these changes on output and income is projected to be negligible. The corporate tax has a small impact on output and income, accounting for about 2% of GDP. Even a 10 percentage point rate reduction would only be slightly over \u00bd of 1% of GDP. Most gains from international tax reforms would not benefit U.S. income significantly, with profits mostly going to foreign investors. Moving towards a territorial tax system may have modest effects on investments, but the overall impact is likely to be minimal. Moving to a territorial tax system would reduce beneficial treatment of royalties and export income, leading to potential profit shifting into low-tax jurisdictions. Addressing issues with royalties and profit shifting would require anti-abuse provisions to prevent artificial shifting of profits. Profit shifting involves shifting profits into low-tax jurisdictions to avoid U.S. taxes, with evidence showing significant disparities in profit distribution among countries. Estimates suggest profit shifting amounts to billions of dollars, mainly driven by leveraging and shifting profits from intangibles. Low-tax rates are often linked to profit shifting practices. Low-tax rates are associated with manufacturing drugs, electronics, and information industries, leading to profit shifting concerns. Moving to a territorial tax system may exacerbate profit shifting issues. Lobbying for a repatriation holiday in 2004 indicates worries about profit shifting. Evidence suggests significant profit shifting in European countries, benefiting most at the expense of Germany. Germany has lowered their corporate tax rate, potentially due to profit shifting concerns. The move to a territorial tax system could increase profit shifting if companies expect to pay taxes on excess profits with interest when deferred. The empirical evidence on this is mixed, but lobbying for a change in tax policy indicates worries about profit shifting. The lobbying for a repatriation holiday supports the new view that profit shifting might increase insignificantly under a territorial tax system. This change could affect royalties by eliminating protection from excess foreign tax credits, leading to a higher tax on royalties and incentivizing the shift of intangible income to foreign subsidiaries. Other reforms, such as those proposed by President Obama, could also address profit shifting in the current tax system. The current system may be reformed to tax excess earnings from intangibles as subpart F income and disallow some overhead expenses if income is not taxed. Profit shifting occurs due to differential taxes, illustrated by techniques like the double-Irish, Dutch sandwich. The only way to eliminate differential taxes is through the elimination of deferral and a separate tax credit limit basket for royalty income. Moving to a territorial tax system raises concerns about how to handle accumulated unrepatriated earnings. One approach is to consider all earnings as repatriated and subject to taxes, with a grace period for payment. This could pose challenges for firms if earnings are not easily accessible. Typically, a significant portion of retained earnings abroad is reinvested in the company's activities. While a majority of income may be retained abroad, a larger portion of unrepatriated earnings is likely to remain invested overseas permanently. One option for handling accumulated unrepatriated earnings is to treat them the same as newly generated earnings and exempt them. This could provide a windfall benefit to firms that have been holding off repatriating. Another option is to deem all earnings repatriated prior to law changes and apply a lower tax rate. These approaches aim to address concerns about how to tax unrepatriated earnings under a territorial tax system. The 2004 tax holiday provisions allow for a small tax to be paid over time, with firms having the option to elect the holiday and pay remaining dividends at the full tax rate. This voluntary approach balances limiting windfall benefits and revenue loss, while providing firms with terms to pay out accumulated earnings. The shift to a territorial tax system poses challenges such as dealing with accumulated untaxed earnings, foreign tax credits, and loss carryovers. Simplifying administration and compliance is a key argument for the transition. Grubert and Mutti emphasize the costs of tax planning associated with repatriating income. A territorial tax system would simplify repatriation policy for U.S. parents, eliminating tax planning concerns. However, ending deferral or implementing hybrid approaches could also achieve this simplification. While a territorial tax may eliminate repatriation tax planning, it could increase profit shifting incentives. Design issues to combat income shifting can add complexity to the tax code. Transitioning to a territorial system could potentially increase revenue. Transitioning to a territorial tax system could potentially increase revenue by taxing foreign operations more effectively. Taxes on dividends of foreign subsidiaries and branch income are relatively small, totaling about $10 billion or 2% of corporate revenues. Taxes on royalties and export income could also increase with the loss of certain provisions. Transitioning to a territorial tax system could potentially increase revenue significantly. Eliminating deferral and setting a per country foreign tax credit limit could triple the revenue collected on foreign source income, raising $64 billion or about 15% of corporate taxes. Other changes, like eliminating deferral alone, could raise about $18 billion in revenue. President Obama's budget proposals for international taxation could raise $16 billion. Some proposals aim for revenue neutrality by using transitional revenues from taxes on accumulated untaxed earnings. Moving to a territorial tax system involves issues of transition, treatment of current flow through income, and anti-abuse rules. Three proposals are outlined: the Grubert Mutti proposal, the Ways and Means Discussion Draft, and Senator Enzi's bill, S. 2091. The latter two proposals are similar in approach, with the Grubert Mutti proposal serving as a general outline. These proposals aim to raise revenue primarily through increased taxes on foreign source income. The proposal aims to transition to a territorial tax system, raising revenue through increased taxes on royalties and parent company expenses. It includes exempting dividends for active foreign income, treating foreign branches like subsidiaries, taxing royalties and interest paid to U.S. parents, retaining anti-abuse rules for passive income, and disallowing active foreign losses to offset domestic income. Capital gains from productive asset sales would be exempt, and income from U.S. exports would not be taxed. The proposal aims to transition to a territorial tax system, raising revenue through increased taxes on royalties and parent company expenses. It includes exempting dividends for active foreign income, treating foreign branches like subsidiaries, taxing royalties and interest paid to U.S. parents, retaining anti-abuse rules for passive income, and disallowing active foreign losses to offset domestic income. Capital gains from productive asset sales would be exempt, and income from U.S. exports would not be taxed. The proposal does not address the treatment of existing accumulated earnings abroad or profit shifting via intangible assets. It has been estimated to raise revenue of approximately $6.9 billion in 2014. The Discussion Draft released in October 2011 by Ways and Means Chairman Dave Camp outlines a territorial tax approach with options and unsettled issues. The proposal aims to couple the move to a territorial tax with a general tax reform reducing the top corporate rate from 35% to 25%. Specific details of the proposal are contained in a technical draft discussion. The proposal allows a 95% deduction for the foreign source portion of dividends for 10% U.S. corporate shareholders of foreign subsidiaries that are controlled foreign corporations (CFCs). A holding period of one year for stock in foreign corporations is required. 10% corporate shareholders of non-controlled corporations can elect the same treatment as CFCs. Foreign branches are treated the same as subsidiaries, with possible inclusion of partnerships. Anti-abuse provisions are retained. The proposal allows a 95% deduction for foreign dividends for 10% U.S. corporate shareholders of CFCs. Capital gains on stock sales in eligible subsidiaries also get a 95% exclusion. Accumulated untaxed earnings will be taxed with an 85% exclusion. Firms can pay the tax in installments over eight years. Foreign tax credits for active dividends and foreign branch income are disallowed. The proposal eliminates various foreign tax credit provisions, including the allocation of parent interest and the splitting of foreign tax credits. It also repeals a provision regarding the inclusion of investments of deferred income in U.S. property. Additionally, three anti-base-erosion options, two targeting intangible income, are being considered. Obama's budget proposals include three options for taxing foreign income from intangibles. Option A would tax excess earnings on intangibles in low tax jurisdictions, Option B would tax income subject to a foreign tax rate below 10%, and Option C would tax all foreign income from intangibles with a deduction for 40%. Base-erosion provisions would restrict interest deductions based on debt to equity ratios. The draft proposal includes tests for debt to equity ratios and interest expenses, with the smaller excess interest being disallowed. Senator Enzi's bill, similar to the Ways and Means Discussion Draft, includes a 95% dividend exemption and anti-abuse rules. Foreign branches would not be treated as subsidiaries. The Enzi bill includes provisions for taxing accumulated earnings with a 70% exclusion, disallowing foreign tax credits for exempt income, and retaining anti-abuse rules. Foreign base company sales and service income would be eliminated, and capital gains on stock sales would be eligible for exclusion under certain conditions. The Enzi bill includes provisions for taxing accumulated earnings with a 70% exclusion, disallowing foreign tax credits for exempt income, and retaining anti-abuse rules. The bill also includes a version of Option B along with the first part of Option C, subjecting income in countries with tax rates half or less than the U.S. rate to tax. Active business operations would be excepted, except for intangible income of the CFC, which would be considered Subpart F income. Intangible income, such as royalties, would be taxed at a 17.5% rate for domestic corporations and placed in a separate foreign tax credit basket. The bill does not include thin capitalization rules. The bill makes the exception from Subpart F for active financing and active insurance income permanent, applies worldwide interest allocation for foreign tax credit in 2013, and discusses alternative approaches to territorial proposals. The Grubert-Mutti proposal does not trigger tax on repatriation, while other territorial proposals do due to a 5% \"haircut\". The Discussion Draft proposes a 95% exemption for repatriation, with a 5% \"haircut\" triggering tax on repatriation. Firms can opt for a tax-free method by investing in U.S. assets. Concerns have been raised about firms avoiding even a small tax, suggesting the need to tax transactions or 5% of them. One approach to eliminate the repatriation tax trigger is to include 5% of the income. The Discussion Draft proposes a 95% exemption for repatriation, with a 5% \"haircut\" triggering tax on repatriation. One approach to eliminate the repatriation tax trigger is to include 5% of income whether repatriated or not, and make dividends entirely exempt. S. 2091 also has a temporary repatriation trigger with a transition rule allowing firms to repatriate under a 70% exclusion without credits, taxing dividends until accumulated funds are exhausted. The Grubert Mutti proposal lacks provisions for accumulated untaxed earnings and dividends paid out of those earnings. The Discussion Draft aims to be revenue neutral and is more favorable to U.S. multinational firms compared to the Grubert-Mutti proposal. It suggests financing revenue loss through a one-time tax on existing accumulated earnings. Senator Enzi's bill also aims for revenue neutrality. Different proposals vary in increasing tax burden on foreign source income, with base erosion provisions potentially affecting taxes based on the chosen option. The Grubert-Mutti proposal suggests disallowing deductions regardless of dividend payments, resulting in a larger provision compared to the Discussion Draft and S. 2091. Altshuler and Grubert estimate overhead expenses to be 10% of pretax earnings, making the 5% inclusion provision relatively smaller. Interest is also expected to be a significant factor in the tax calculations. The Grubert-Mutti proposal includes a direct allocation rule for parent interest based on asset allocations. Net interest as a share of pretax earnings was 15% in 2006 and 21% in 2007. Gross interest, used for foreign tax credit limit rules, ranged from 34% to 39% of profits plus interest payments. The Discussion Draft and S. 2091 lack allocation rules for addressing profit shifting from intangibles, despite potential impacts on interest payments. Grubert and Mutti's proposal does not include an allocation for research and development expenditures, which could affect base erosion. Without specific guidelines, it is challenging to determine the income share taxed under the Grubert Mutti proposal. Manufacturing in 2006 had about 25% of income taxed, with additional taxes of 8.75% under the Grubert Mutti plan and 0.7% under the Discussion Draft and S. 2091. Allocating interest based on worldwide costs could result in smaller allocations and potential shifting of interest costs to foreign subsidiaries. The Grubert Mutti proposal suggests allocating interest costs to foreign subsidiaries to minimize the tax impact, with potential revenue gains offset by lower tax payments to foreign countries. Specific anti-base erosion measures in the Discussion Draft and S. 2091 may substitute for cost allocation provisions, focusing on profit shifting rather than investment incentives. The treatment of royalties could also be affected, leading to a higher tax burden as excess foreign tax credits disappear. The tax burden may increase as excess foreign tax credits vanish, leading to higher taxes on royalties. This could promote more exports of technology-based products and potentially increase research in low tax countries. S. 2091 proposes taxing royalty income at a 17.5% rate, reducing additional taxes from lost foreign tax credits. Intangibles subject to anti-base erosion rules would be taxed at the full rate of 35%. The impact on investment shifts in the U.S. economy is expected to be minimal. The proposals aim to address profit shifting through various anti-profit shifting regimes, including the full allocation of deductions, interest allocation rules, and a combination of options. Grubert and Mutti suggest allocating deductions to combat artificial profit shifting, with a more comprehensive approach being the allocation of worldwide expenses. This approach could help prevent shifting facilitated through leveraging, although it may only allocate parent company expenses. The Ways and Means Discussion Draft proposes anti-profit shifting measures, including full deduction allocation and interest restrictions. They aim to combat profit shifting through leveraging by limiting interest deductions based on worldwide assets and income. The Enzi bill does not include interest allocation provisions, and a specific base erosion provision outside of interest has not been chosen in the discussion draft. It is unclear how effective the base erosion proposals will be, as both Options A and B rely on being in a low tax country. Options A and B in the Enzi bill focus on low tax countries with a 10% tax rate. Option A phases out U.S. taxation of excess intangibles between 10% and 15%, affecting countries like Ireland with a 12.5% tax rate. Option B does not impact Ireland. These options require identifying intangible income, with Option A incentivizing pushing costs into Controlled Foreign Corporations (CFCs) to decrease U.S. taxation. Option A of the Enzi bill incentivizes moving costs to Controlled Foreign Corporations (CFCs) to decrease U.S. taxation, while Option B could lead to profits being shifted to countries with tax rates higher than 10% but lower than the U.S. 25% level. This could potentially result in a reduction of total U.S. income. Option B is designed as a cliff where once a trigger level is reached, all income is subject to full U.S. taxes. It exempts income derived in the home country but could be exploited by firms to avoid taxes. The drawbacks of Option B could also impact Option A. Lower taxes would apply to profits equal to 150% of costs, potentially leading firms to shift locations to countries with lower tax rates. Option C proposes applying a lower tax rate only to intangibles, avoiding undesirable behavioral changes. Critics mention the complexity of measuring intangible income as a drawback. A minimum tax on all foreign source income could achieve the same goal without encouraging tax avoidance. Option C proposes a 15% minimum tax on income in countries with effective tax rates below 15%, without incentivizing relocation. Option B has provisions defining active operations to avoid tax, but loopholes may exist. The Enzi bill has weaker rules, potentially allowing firms to justify exceptions. Intangible income from any country could trigger U.S. tax under the Discussion Draft. Option C and S. 2091 propose reduced tax rates for royalties, aligning them with intangible income generated within Controlled Foreign Corporations (CFCs) to prevent shifting royalties into tax-exempt CFC income. This could result in a slight tax increase for previously sheltered royalties, but a potential tax cut for others. The Grubert-Mutti proposal suggests exempting dividends regardless of their source to simplify tax planning, offering a windfall benefit. The Grubert and Mutti study proposes a lower tax on accumulated unrepatriated earnings, similar to the Ways and Means Discussion Draft. This draft would tax all earnings with an 85% exclusion, potentially benefiting funds tied up in illiquid investments. Taxes would be offset by foreign tax credits, with most earnings being permanently reinvested. The deemed repatriation provision may not be suitable for all taxpayers, as some critics argue that firms could struggle to measure unrepatriated earnings accurately. S. 2091 proposes a repatriation tax that allows for an elective approach on a CFC by CFC basis, with a smaller 70% exclusion and no foreign tax credits. This rule aims to incentivize firms to repatriate earnings by delaying dividend relief until all accumulated earnings are exhausted. The proposed repatriation tax rule aims to incentivize firms to repatriate earnings, but firms have the option not to repatriate if it is difficult due to lack of funds. Tax treaties may conflict with the new rules, and the treatment of foreign tax credits and losses carried over needs to be addressed. The Grubert-Mutti proposal suggests allowing foreign tax credit carryovers to lapse after the taxation of accumulated earnings. S. 2091 may continue carryovers for entities not covered by the proposal. S. 2091 would continue aspects of the pre-existing system, potentially leading to continued complications in tax administration. The Grubert-Mutti proposal offers a simpler approach with a straightforward anti-abuse provision. Ways and Means Discussion Draft retains a small repatriation tax, which could result in tax planning and complex anti-abuse provisions. Including branch company income under the territorial rules is a key issue addressed in the proposals, Grubert and Mutti, and the Ways and Means Discussion Draft, but not in S. 2091. The inclusion of branches in the territorial tax system aims to prevent firms from using branches over subsidiaries for tax planning purposes. This equalizes the treatment of branch and subsidiary operations, although there are non-tax reasons for operating as a branch. The Discussion Draft raises complications in treating branches as CFCs, including difficulties in measuring income, determining branch existence, and addressing intra-company payments. Suggestions include exempting branch income from tax and addressing specific tax issues. Different proposals have varying approaches to including branches in the territorial tax system. The Ways and Means Discussion Draft and S. 2091 allow 10/50 companies to elect exempt treatment, potentially losing foreign tax credits. Concerns include difficulties in electing inclusion due to Subpart F rules, lack of control over firm information, and challenges in compelling cash dividend payments for tax purposes. The Ways and Means Discussion Draft and S. 2091 propose changes to foreign tax credits for certain companies, potentially impacting their ability to take advantage of elective repatriation. Concerns have been raised about the elimination of foreign tax credits for CFC's, branches, and 10/50 corporations, as well as the implications for individuals still eligible for foreign tax credits. These changes could lead to countries reinstating foreign withholding tax and abrogating treaties. The proposed changes in foreign tax credits could impact companies' ability to utilize elective repatriation. Concerns have been raised about the elimination of foreign tax credits for certain entities, potentially leading to countries reinstating foreign withholding tax. Additionally, there are discussions on the implications of more restrictive interest allocation rules and the possibility of shifting borrowing abroad to deduct interest in other jurisdictions. Considerations include allowing loans from the parent to foreign subsidiaries at the parent's borrowing rate. Some discussions have occurred regarding the treatment of existing anti-abuse rules under Subpart F, with suggestions to modify it to address profit shifting. Grubert and Mutti propose retaining Subpart F but eliminating taxes on dividends and deemed dividends from investments in the United States. The Ways and Means Discussion Draft includes these changes but does not address the 5% inclusion in income. Further considerations on Subpart F are expected. Grubert and Mutti suggest that under a territorial tax, rules like the foreign base company rules would be strengthened. S. 2091 excludes income shifted out of the United States from Subpart F. The Ways and Means Discussion Draft proposes making the look-through rules permanent. Suggestions have been made to address leakage in Subpart F, including check-the-box rules. Tax reform should address leakage in Subpart F, including check-the-box and look-through rules. Concerns exist that eliminating these rules could lead to increased taxes paid to other countries instead of greater U.S. tax collections. Exempting firms may incentivize reducing foreign taxes paid, and broadening Subpart F rules should not undo this incentive. Subpart F income is crucial, as changes could impact U.S. private profits and taxes. The Discussion Draft and S. 2091 propose changes to Subpart F income taxation, aiming for revenue neutrality over the budget horizon. However, there are concerns about potential double taxation and a small permanent revenue loss. The Grubert-Mutti proposal is projected to raise revenue on a permanent basis, but the impact is minimal. Alternatives to a territorial tax are also discussed. Alternatives to a territorial tax aim to address repatriation and profit shifting issues effectively. These alternatives include ending deferral, limiting cross-crediting, reforming the existing system, and implementing a hybrid approach like a minimum tax. These proposals could attract capital back to the United States and improve capital allocation efficiency, although they may require further measures to tackle headquarters shifting. Many of these proposals are discussed in more detail in other reports. Ending deferral could raise $18.4 billion in revenue in FY2014, with a deferral option estimated to raise $11.1 billion. This approach would tax income of foreign subsidiaries, eliminate disincentives to repatriate, and reduce profit shifting opportunities. It would still allow for cross-crediting and be more aligned with efficient resource allocation. The revision to end deferral would require measuring earnings under U.S. law, addressing transition issues similar to territorial tax proposals. Extending treatment to 10/50 corporations with a large U.S. shareholder but not controlled by a group of large U.S. shareholders may pose challenges. However, this change could eliminate Subpart F, increase taxation, discourage profit shifting, and incentivize repatriation. The proposal to end deferral and implement a per country limit on foreign tax credits aims to prevent tax haven income from being shielded. This provision is part of the Wyden and Coats general tax reform plan and includes a repatriation holiday. It would require country-by-country measures of foreign taxes paid and income earned within each country. Measures would need to be enacted to prevent firms from using holding companies to avoid the per country limit. The President has also made proposals addressing international tax issues. The President's proposals on international tax issues in the FY2013 budget outline aim to raise $16.8 billion in FY2014. One proposal disallows interest deductions of parent companies for deferred income, reducing the disincentive to repatriate ($5.9 billion). Another proposal limits foreign tax credits to the same share of total credits as repatriated income, aiming to prevent tax minimization. These complex proposals are detailed in a Treasury Department document. The budget proposal aims to raise $16.8 billion in FY2014 through various international tax measures. One proposal includes limiting foreign tax credits to prevent tax minimization, while another disallows interest deductions for parent companies with deferred income. Additionally, there are provisions to treat excess intangibles profits as U.S. income, clarify rules on intangibles valuation, disallow deductions for U.S. insurance companies purchasing reinsurance from foreign affiliates, and impose stricter limits on interest deductions for U.S. subsidiaries of firms that inverted prior to 2004. The budget proposal aims to raise $16.8 billion in FY2014 through international tax measures, including limiting foreign tax credits to prevent tax minimization. Other provisions include disallowing interest deductions for parent companies with deferred income, treating excess intangibles profits as U.S. income, clarifying rules on intangibles valuation, and imposing stricter limits on interest deductions for U.S. subsidiaries of firms that inverted prior to 2004. Additionally, there are rules related to foreign taxes paid for benefits, gain from partnership interests, and preventing foreign affiliates from avoiding dividend characterization. The Administration's tax reform framework includes provisions such as preventing foreign tax credits from offsetting tax on certain asset acquisitions and disallowing a deduction for moving abroad. It also proposes a minimum tax on foreign source income in low tax countries and a 20% credit for moving operations to the US. The minimum tax provision is not discussed in detail. A minimum tax could be imposed in an effective territorial system to reduce deferral, including various ways such as eliminating deferral for specified tax havens, countries with low tax rates, income from goods imported to the US, and income from goods exported from foreign locations. Formula apportionment is another approach to address income shifting. Formula apportionment is a method used by many states and Canadian provinces to allocate corporate income based on sales, assets, and employment. Some states have shifted to a sales-based system, leading to increased tax revenue. However, challenges arise with intangible assets and international coordination to prevent double taxation. A hybrid approach could be generated by modifying Base Erosion Option B in the Ways and Means Draft Discussion. A proposed hybrid approach suggests simplifying the general minimum tax by eliminating deferral and per country foreign tax credit limits. Income would be taxed at a lower rate to prevent shifting to higher tax jurisdictions. This approach would use U.S. income measurement rules but apply a lower statutory rate, with foreign tax credits allowed on a country by country basis. For example, a 17.5% rate could be applied. The proposed hybrid approach suggests simplifying the general minimum tax by eliminating deferral and per country foreign tax credit limits. Income would be taxed at a lower rate to prevent shifting to higher tax jurisdictions, with a 17.5% rate potentially being applied. This approach would only affect tax havens and low tax jurisdictions, and could involve requiring income to be repatriated but subjecting some share of it to U.S. tax. Foreign tax credit limits could be allowed on an overall basis or country by country. Comments on combining a minimum tax with a territorial system suggest a 20% tax rate, similar to Japan's, is more effective than a 10% rate. This would eliminate repatriation disincentives and reduce profit shifting incentives. Implementing a minimum tax is less likely to shift income to higher tax jurisdictions compared to taxing income at full U.S. rates. Tax havens may raise taxes to capture profits, especially with a minimum tax, but less so with full elimination of deferral. Tax havens attracting foreign firms may resist tax increases and deny credits for increased taxes. Historical proposals have mostly leaned towards a worldwide tax and higher taxation, rather than a territorial tax and lower taxation on foreign income. The deferral of tax on foreign subsidiaries' income dates back to early income tax laws, with deductions for foreign taxes evolving into unlimited credits by 1918. Per country limits on foreign tax credits were introduced in 1921 and eliminated in 1976. Regulations allowing income sourcing to holding companies helped firms achieve overall limits on their own. The per country limit on foreign tax credits was eliminated in 1976, with various proposals for changing the system not yet adopted. President Kennedy and President Carter proposed eliminating deferral, leading to anti-abuse rules taxing passive and easily shifted income. The Reagan Administration proposed a per country limit in 1986, but the legislation expanded the number of baskets instead. In 2004, legislation reduced the baskets to two, including income from financial services in the general basket. Legislative proposals aimed to increase taxation of international income by allocating parent company expenses to deferred income and not allowing it. Similar proposals were included in tax reform legislation by Chairman Rangel in 2007. International tax provisions are discussed in detail in a publication by McClure and Bouma in 1989."
