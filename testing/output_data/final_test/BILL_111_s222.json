    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Community Revitalization Energy Conservation Act\" and includes findings. Congress finds that despite significant gains in energy conservation and efficiency technologies over the past three decades, there is still a need for widespread adoption of these measures. Energy efficiency is crucial for economic well-being, citizen health, climate change mitigation, and national security. Energy inefficiencies contribute to 50% of US energy use, and electricity consumption could be reduced by 70% through efficiency improvements alone. Estimates show that low-income households spend a higher percentage of their earnings on energy compared to the average household. Retrofitting buildings for energy efficiency can create jobs, benefit communities, and reduce energy consumption significantly, contributing to national energy independence and security. Buildings currently account for a large portion of US energy consumption, electricity usage, and carbon emissions. Research, development, and deployment of renewable energy and advanced battery technologies are crucial for the US economy's rebuilding. SEC. 3. The national limitation for qualified energy conservation bonds is increased from $800,000,000 to $3,600,000,000. The amendment applies to obligations issued after the enactment of this Act. SEC. 4. Clarification of qualified conservation purposes for qualified energy conservation bonds. For section 54D(f)(A)(ii) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, capital expenditures for green community programs include reducing energy consumption in buildings and training local workers for green programs. A program described involves State or local governments implementing building improvements with costs repayable over time by property owners or renters. The periodic fee for building improvements includes measures like heating, cooling, lighting, water-saving, and stormwater reduction. The fee is based on energy cost savings and can be assessed on government or private utility bills. SEC. 5. REPORTING REQUIREMENT. The Secretary of the Treasury must provide an annual report to Congress and the Federal Register on projects funded by qualified energy conservation bonds. The report includes details such as issuer information, bond details, issuance costs, reserves, and the principal users of the facilities funded by the bonds. The annual report to Congress and the Federal Register on projects funded by qualified energy conservation bonds must include issuer information, bond details, issuance costs, reserves, and a description of any property to be financed from the proceeds of the issue. SEC. 6. OFFSET.\n\nProhibition on using funds for F-22A Raptor Fighter Aircraft in fiscal year 2009, except for winding up the program. Repeal of multiyear procurement authority for F-22A Raptor Fighter Aircraft as of October 17, 2006."
