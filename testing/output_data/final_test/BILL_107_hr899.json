    "content": "The \"School Safety Hotline Act of 2001\" is the short title of this Act. The Congress finds that in 1999, there were 255,000 violent incidents on school property or related to school activities. There were 58 school-associated violent deaths in the school year July 1, 1997, through June 30, 1998. Despite a decrease in overall violent deaths, the number of multiple victim homicide events has increased. In 1997, 5% of 12th graders reported being purposefully injured at school with a weapon. In the prior 12 months, 14 percent of individuals reported being purposefully injured without a weapon. On average, from 1993 to 1997, there were 131,400 violent crimes against teachers at schools, translating to a rate of 31 violent crimes per 1,000 teachers. Tools should be provided to students, teachers, parents, and administrators to report information to law enforcement. School safety hotlines enable reporting of threats, reducing school violence. To reduce incidents of youth violence, tools should be provided to report information to law enforcement authorities. Section 223(a)(10) of the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974 is amended to include programs for a school violence hotline for reporting suspicious behavior. Section 4113(b)(1) of the Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act of 1994 is amended to include establishing and maintaining a school violence hotline for reporting suspicious, violent, or threatening behavior. Governor's Programs under Section 4114(c) are also amended to include provisions for such hotlines. The Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act of 1994 is amended to include establishing and maintaining a school violence hotline for reporting suspicious, violent, or threatening behavior through a public-private partnership. The Secretary of Education must notify States and State educational agencies within 1 year of the Act's enactment about using administrative funds for a toll-free hotline to report suspicious behavior at schools to law enforcement."
