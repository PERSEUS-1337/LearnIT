    "content": "As the technological needs of a mobile society increase, energy storage technologies are improving to meet the power requirements of smaller devices. This advancement has led to a wider range of applications for power storage in the electric grid and electric vehicles. Energy storage is being explored for its potential benefits to the transmission grid, distribution systems, and retail customers, especially in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Renewable energy sources are gaining focus to mitigate climate change risks, with energy storage seen as a key technology to address the intermittency of wind and solar resources. Energy storage technologies are crucial for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and integrating renewable energy sources into the grid. Congress has been discussing various aspects of energy storage, with over 40 bills introduced in the 116th session. The report will focus on battery systems and their readiness for different storage applications for electric power services. This report discusses the main drivers and challenges for energy storage, as well as potential options for Congress to explore. Electricity is a commodity resource produced just-in-time to meet demand, with limited opportunities for large-scale storage. The electric power system is designed for reliability and to meet maximum load demand. Regional balancing authorities ensure electricity supply is in balance with demand to prevent damage to equipment or system infrastructure. The U.S. grid operates at 60 Hertz, and even a small fluctuation can cause operational issues. Some regions have peak electricity demand in summer due to air-conditioning loads. Some regions have peak electricity demand in winter for heating purposes, leading to underutilization of large generation resources. Energy storage could help reduce the need for costly power projects and support renewable energy systems. Frequency regulation reconciles fluctuations between generation and demand. Energy storage can reduce the need for costly power projects and support renewable energy systems by reconciling fluctuations between generation and demand. Peaking, intermediate, and baseload generation serve different levels of electric power demand, while renewables generation represents variable electric generation primarily from intermittent wind or solar sources. Energy storage can help decrease power generation during peak demand periods. Other ways to reduce electricity generation from central power plants include end-use efficiency and demand response programs. End-use efficiency involves using more efficient equipment and appliances, while demand response allows customers to adjust their consumption in response to price signals. The capacity for storing large amounts of energy on the electric grid is limited, but improvements in energy storage technologies are increasing opportunities for grid storage. Curtailing excess energy may be a cost-effective alternative to expensive energy storage options, especially with higher levels of solar PV penetration. Regulatory regimes are encouraging economic deployment of energy storage, leading to growing applications and opportunities for grid storage. The growing demand for energy storage on the grid offers flexibility in electricity production and usage, especially during peak loads. An arbitrage opportunity exists to store energy during low-demand times and sell it when prices are higher. This system can also store excess renewable energy production to prevent curtailment. However, the efficiency of storage systems in an arbitrage role may be limited by technology. Energy storage systems can be limited in their arbitrage role by technology and the number of participants. Various forms of energy storage include electricity, potential energy, and chemical systems like batteries. These systems replenish energy using electricity generated during low-demand times and are measured in terms of power capacity and energy storage capacity. Popular storage methods include hydropower pumped storage, compressed air energy storage, and battery systems. Energy storage technologies like hydropower pumped storage, compressed air energy storage, and batteries convert potential energy into electricity. These systems store energy using mediums like water or air, which then physically turn turbines connected to generators to produce electricity. Other methods, such as hydrogen gas production, are also being explored for energy storage. Energy storage technologies include hydropower pumped storage, compressed air energy storage, and batteries. These systems convert potential energy into electricity through turbines connected to generators. Hydropower pumped storage involves releasing water from an upper reservoir to a lower reservoir to generate electricity, while compressed air energy storage uses heated and expanded air in a turbine. Batteries can store electricity in large chemical systems or modular battery systems composed of smaller cells. Energy storage technologies include hydropower pumped storage, compressed air energy storage, liquid air energy storage, flywheels, flow batteries, and lead-acid batteries. Compressed air is cooled and stored using off-peak electricity, liquid air is re-gasified for electricity generation, flywheels store kinetic energy, flow batteries use liquid electrolytes, and lead-acid batteries are commonly used. Lead-acid batteries use lead alloy compartments immersed in a sulfuric acid electrolyte to generate electric charge. Lithium ion batteries move lithium ions between electrodes through an electrolyte, with a cathode made of lithium-cobalt oxide and an anode made of carbon. Other battery technologies like Nickel Cadmium, Nickel-metal Hydride, Sodium Sulfur, and Sodium-Nickel Chloride also use different chemical systems for energy storage. Battery storage technologies, such as lithium ion batteries, can help maintain the balance between supply and demand on the electricity system by providing back-up power during outages. The focus of this report is on the use of modular batteries for grid level storage, which can also supply energy to the grid and provide ancillary services for grid stability. The best value for energy storage project developers currently lies in supplying energy to the grid and offering ancillary services. Energy storage technologies can provide energy to the grid and ancillary services, but cannot do both simultaneously. Recharging the storage system influences when and how often it can be accomplished, acting as a load on the grid. The timing of recharging during the day affects the value proposition of storage, with recharging unlikely to be scheduled during peak demand times. The ability to provide multiple services to the grid impacts the economics of the system. Figure 2 illustrates the opportunities for energy storage technologies to offer capacity, energy, and ancillary services to the grid. Energy storage technologies can provide energy for the grid and ancillary services. Larger bulk power energy storage projects can supply electric power over tens of hours, while battery systems and flywheel energy storage are used for uninterruptible power supply in backup applications. Energy storage can also provide power quality services by smoothing out voltage supply or frequency variations. UPS systems may incorporate generation for extended power supply. Energy storage for transmission and distribution systems can help support the grid by deferring T&D upgrade projects, avoiding unnecessary investments, alleviating transmission congestion, and enabling energy shifting for customers. It can also provide power locally during peak demand times and offer power quality services. Energy storage technologies like supercapacitors and superconducting magnetic energy storage (SMES) can be used to store energy for later use or rapid discharge. SMES offers instantaneous energy discharge and infinite recharge cycles but is limited by high costs. Matching the right energy storage technology to the specific application is crucial. Energy storage technologies like supercapacitors and SMES can be used for various applications in electricity markets, with considerations such as duration, rates of charge, and specific services provided. Rechargeable batteries have a physical structure that allows for the flow of electricity to recharge the chemical system. The cathode is the positive terminal, and the anode is the negative terminal, with electrons flowing between them through a conductive electrolyte. Different types of cells can be built for batteries, with variations in construction and ability to dissipate energy. Cylindrical cells have a higher volumetric energy density and are cheaper to manufacture than prismatic cells. They are robust and resilient to mechanical damage, making them suitable for electric vehicles. Evaluating battery performance includes considering specific energy, defined in terms of Watt-hours per kilogram. Specific energy, specific power, and energy density are key characteristics of batteries, determined by their chemistry and packaging. These factors are crucial for different applications, such as achieving range in vehicles or performance targets for engines. For photovoltaic systems, batteries need to have a long lifetime under full discharge conditions. Batteries used in various applications have different requirements. Energy storage projects can be utilized in electricity production applications, providing local solutions to supply shortages and congestion. Placing the right storage technology at key locations can help alleviate issues in the electric power system. Utility-scale battery storage projects in the United States have quadrupled from 214 MW in 2014 to 899 MW in 2019, with expectations to reach 2,500 MW by 2023. These projects can alleviate supply shortages, congestion, and defer the need for new capacity. The largest operating projects provide 40 MW each, with 16 more sites at 20 MW or greater. Grid-connected battery storage is a common solution for electricity production challenges. Grid-connected battery storage projects in the United States require a power management system to protect the battery. Balance of plant costs, including basic infrastructure and on-site electrical systems, are significant. A 2018 study by NREL estimated costs of Li Ion battery storage systems, with a project capacity of 60 MW and a battery price of $209 per kilowatt-hour. Total system costs varied from $380 per kWh. The cost of battery storage systems in the United States varies from $380 to $895 per kilowatt-hour, with the battery cost accounting for 55% in a 4-hour system and 23% in a 0.5-hour system. NREL suggests that as system duration decreases, the proportion of cost attributed to the battery decreases as well. Co-locating solar PV and storage subsystems can lead to cost savings by reducing various expenses. The Energy Information Administration estimates the overnight capital cost of different power plants: natural gas-fired combined cycle ($794 per Kwh), onshore wind ($1,624 per Kwh), solar PV ($1,783 per Kwh), and battery storage project ($1,950 per Kwh). Power outages can occur due to various reasons like weather, equipment failure, accidents, and animal interference. Power outages can be caused by various factors such as weather events, equipment failure, accidents, and animal interference. Longer-lasting outages are often due to weather-related damage to power lines and equipment. The Department of Energy emphasizes the need for resilient systems to minimize the impact of outages on customers. Recent major weather events have highlighted the importance of ensuring short-lived outages that affect the fewest number of customers possible. A recent study in the United States focused on electric reliability and grid investments, finding a correlation between severe weather and longer, more severe power outages. Factors like wind speed, precipitation, and lightning strikes were identified as contributing to power interruptions. Additionally, there was a significant trend in the duration of power interruptions over time, especially during major events. The study in the United States found a correlation between severe weather and longer power outages, with major events contributing to the trend. FERC proposed defining resilience as the ability to withstand disruptive events. Energy storage could help reduce the impact of outages, but the source of electricity to charge the batteries is crucial. Wind and solar power's variability affects storage availability, and the discharge characteristics determine battery usefulness. The power outage duration can vary depending on the event causing it, such as severe weather affecting power lines. Electric vehicles are becoming more popular, with EVs projected to make up a significant portion of vehicle miles traveled by 2050, leading to increased electricity demand for charging. Some utilities are considering electric vehicles as a way to increase electricity demand and explore vehicle-to-grid (V2G) energy storage. EV batteries could be used for grid energy storage and demand response. Utilities see EVs as a distributed energy resource with managed charging and potential grid dispatch capabilities. However, doubts exist about widespread adoption of V2G technology despite the appeal of utilizing the growing lithium-ion battery capacity in EVs. Despite the potential of using electric vehicle batteries for grid energy storage through Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) technology, concerns remain about its commercial viability. One major issue is the impact on the vehicle's batteries, as drawing energy from stationary vehicles could stress the batteries. Questions also arise about who would cover the costs of battery replacements and how vehicle owners would be compensated for participating in V2G programs. Despite the challenges, V2G could drive further electric vehicle adoption and contribute to greenhouse gas reduction in the transportation sector. The transportation sector can reduce GHG emissions through electrification, depending on electricity sources. Projections show a potential increase in battery electric vehicle sales by 2025. Studies suggest a possible transition to EVs by 2050, with a focus on low or zero-carbon fuels. Charging batteries with renewable electricity can help reduce climate change. The team of researchers from Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBL) examined EV charging in California as a case study. They suggested that controlling when EV charging happened could help accomplish California's goals for renewable electricity integration less expensively than its 2010 mandate for deploying grid energy storage. The study discussed California's growing system-wide balancing problems forecast out to 2025, epitomized as the \"California Duck Curve\" issue. Charging EVs in the middle of the day, when renewable solar generation is greatest, was proposed as a solution. EVs charging in the middle of the day could help balance the grid by using excess renewable electricity, known as V1G charging. The technology for one-way charging already exists and could be implemented for around $150 million in California. Implementing a two-way flow of power from EVs, V2G, could further enhance the benefits of EV batteries. By 2025, V1G charging alone could mitigate down-ramping and up-ramping by over 2 GW/h, while a mix of V1G and V2G vehicles could substantially reduce both. The researchers estimated that implementing a proposal could save California billions in stationary storage investment. Concerns arise over the low recycling rate of Li Ion batteries in the US, especially with the expected increase in transportation electrification. Increasing recycling and reuse of Li Ion battery components could be a cost-effective option due to the challenges in obtaining lithium and cobalt. The potential for second-life use of Li Ion battery packs from EVs exists, especially for home energy storage and electric grid applications. Reuse can provide value in markets with demand for stationary energy storage with less frequent battery cycling. Three suitable applications for second-life EV batteries include providing reserve energy capacity, deferring transmission investments, and taking advantage of power-arbitrage opportunities. Second-life batteries can be 30 to 70 percent cheaper than new ones by 2025, making them more cost-effective for grid flexibility and power storage. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission oversees wholesale power sales, transmission, and utility mergers to ensure fair rates for consumers. The Energy Policy Act of 1992 opened wholesale electricity markets to competition. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) oversees wholesale power sales and transmission, ensuring fair rates for consumers. FERC Order No. 888 in 1996 allowed open access to transmission grids for all users, promoting wholesale competition. In 2018, FERC issued Order No. 841 to remove barriers for electric storage resources in RTO/ISO markets. Each RTO/ISO has until December 3, 2019 to implement Order No. 841. FERC issued Order No. 845 in April 2019, changing the definition of \"Generating Facility\" to include electric storage resources. This order also allowed interconnection customers to request lower interconnection service levels than their generating facility capacity. This change could enable electric generators to add storage capacity and sell power to the grid, benefiting renewable generators. FERC recognized the role of High-Performance Storage Systems (HPS) in competitive electricity markets but noted that existing market rules for traditional resources may pose challenges. Order No. 841 by FERC requires regional grid operators to establish a participation model for energy storage resources, ensuring they can provide all services in competitive markets and set wholesale market prices. FERC's Order No. 841 mandates that energy storage resources can participate in wholesale markets as both buyers and sellers, with sales at locational marginal prices. The rule also sets a maximum size limit of 100 kW for participation in RTO/ISO markets. FERC recognized the potential of energy storage resources to provide ancillary services and meet peak demand loads. Energy storage resources offer faster start-up times and higher ramp rates compared to traditional generators, enabling them to provide reserve services without being online. Compliance filings from RTO/ISO stakeholders varied in energy storage participation levels. PJM submitted details of its proposed energy storage resource participation model to FERC. PJM submitted its \"Markets and Operations Proposal\" to FERC, outlining its energy storage resource participation model. The model aims to ensure ESRs can provide various services in line with other resources. PJM identified the need for changes to fully support the ESR participation model required by Order No. 841, including modal operation in energy markets. PJM proposes modal operation for ESRs in energy markets, including Continuous, Charge, and Discharge modes. ESRs can participate in Synchronized Reserve market without energy offer. Cost-Based Offers rules will remain the same for all generation resources. PJM proposes modifications to the Operating Agreement for ESR fuel costs and make-whole payments. They also suggest different categories for ESR charging and exemptions for certain charges related to administrative costs. Additionally, PJM is developing a methodology to differentiate wholesale vs. non-wholesale charges for stored energy. PJM and NYISO address issues related to Energy Storage Resources (ESRs). PJM focuses on ESR metering, accounting, and market settlement, while NYISO outlines existing participation models for electric storage in energy, ancillary services, and capacity markets. NYISO also proposes a new participation model for energy storage resources. NYISO proposed a participation model for energy storage resources as a subset of generators under its tariffs. Storage facilities not qualifying as generators can choose to participate in existing models based on their characteristics. Examples include \"energy limited resources\" and \"limited energy storage resources.\" CAISO supports FERC Order No. 841, stating its rules are already compliant. CAISO supports FERC Order No. 841 but requested clarification on certain areas, such as metering requirements for storage resources and their treatment under dispatch models. FERC was not satisfied with RTO/ISO compliance filings and requested more information, including details on energy storage market participation models. In June 2019, Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee held a hearing on this issue. In June 2019, the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee discussed the need for expanded deployment of grid-scale energy storage in the United States. Dr. George Crabtree highlighted the importance of reducing the cost of lithium-ion battery packs for widespread grid storage use. The Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee discussed the need for expanded deployment of grid-scale energy storage in the United States. New battery materials, concepts, and technology are needed to meet the challenges of long-duration-discharge energy storage. Xcel Energy's long-term carbon strategy depends on the deployment of advanced clean technologies, including grid-scale storage for renewable integration and system benefits like reliable grid operations and frequency control. The need for expanded deployment of grid-scale energy storage in the United States was discussed, with a focus on the challenges and limitations of storage. While storage can provide benefits such as reliable grid operations and voltage support, it faces challenges in solving wide seasonal variations in renewable energy generation and diminishing returns as more storage capacity is added. Additionally, the value of multiple services that storage can bring to the grid is not always additive. Mr. Fowke highlighted the need for further research in energy storage technologies beyond lithium ion batteries, focusing on pumped storage, flow batteries, compressed air energy storage, and other forms of storage. He also emphasized the importance of developing hydrogen and power-to-gas technologies to increase energy storage capacity in the nation. Mr. Andrew Ott discussed the readiness of energy storage resources for grid applications and the potential for competition in the market. Energy storage resources can participate in PJM's capacity market, displacing coal, nuclear, or natural gas units during system emergencies. Battery storage resources can be deemed capacity resources and fully paid if they have the duration capability to be available on call. This approach aligns with FERC's directive to not create undue preferences for energy storage resources but allow their participation based on technical capability. Today, battery duration in PJM and other areas is generally limited, ranging from 15 minutes to one or two hours at their rated capacity. Despite these short durations, batteries are not excluded from participating in the capacity market. They are prorated based on their capability, similar to renewable resources, to recognize their limited duration. This approach treats batteries comparably to other resources in serving as capacity resources, ensuring fairness and consistency with FERC Order. The duration requirements for energy storage capacity resources submitted to FERC are influenced by the success of demand response in the capacity market. Demand response has flattened the load curve, transforming capacity design from serving a one-hour peak demand to a sustained multi-hour peak demand. This shift reflects the modernization of the U.S. electric grid to incorporate new technologies for efficiency and responsiveness. Energy storage is increasingly important for the future efficiency of the electric grid, with potential benefits for customers. It can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions by enabling the integration of renewable energy sources like wind and solar. Congress may consider providing guidance or incentives to promote energy storage and decrease emissions. Energy storage resources can help decrease greenhouse gas emissions and delay the need for traditional power plants. Congress may need to invest in research for longer duration and higher capacity energy storage systems. State governments, local communities, and businesses are looking to increase renewable energy intake with the help of energy storage technologies. The cost of battery storage technologies is decreasing, and efforts to reduce the cost of balance of plant systems in battery storage projects are important. Further electrification of the economy, especially in the transportation sector, may be necessary to reduce emissions and combat climate change. Congress may need to define goals for battery storage technologies, pathways for infrastructure needs, regulatory frameworks, and promote the interoperability of technologies to support transportation electrification goals. Recycling of spent Li-Ion batteries is also a consideration. Efforts to reduce the cost of battery storage technologies are important for the electrification of the transportation sector to reduce emissions. Congress may need to promote more efficient and sustainable modular battery systems to support electrification goals. Research into materials and charging technologies is necessary to improve safety, performance, and cycle efficiency of battery systems. Efforts to reduce battery storage costs are crucial for electrifying the transportation sector and reducing emissions. Over 40 bills in the 116th Congress focus on energy storage, with the Advancing Grid Storage Act of 2019 (H.R. 1743) proposing research, loan, and technical assistance programs for energy storage systems. Objectives include improving energy storage for microgrids, enhancing emergency response infrastructure security, optimizing transmission and distribution system operation, and enhancing power quality. The Promoting Grid Storage Act of 2019 (H.R. 2909) aims to optimize transmission and distribution system operation, improve power quality, and promote the use of energy storage to meet peak energy demand. It includes establishing a technical assistance program and providing grants for eligible entities to identify, evaluate, plan, and design energy storage systems. Prioritized projects would support renewable energy resources, enhance reliability and resiliency, enable microgrids in rural areas, and reduce environmental impacts and greenhouse gas emissions. The DOE would establish a national program for energy storage research and a grant program to provide technical assistance to eligible entities for procuring energy storage systems. Grants would be given for pilot energy storage systems to improve critical infrastructure security and emergency response systems. The Better Energy Storage Act (S. 1602) aims to improve the reliability of the transmission and distribution system, particularly in rural areas, and optimize system operation to defer infrastructure costs. It would authorize a research program for grid-scale energy storage, amending the U.S. Energy Storage Competitiveness Act of 2007. DOE would develop goals, priorities, and cost targets for the program. The Joint Long-Term Storage Act of 2019 (S. 2048) aims to develop cost-effective energy storage systems capable of providing output for 6 hours over 8,000 cycles, operating for 20 years, and storing energy for several months to address seasonal variations in supply and demand. Cost targets will be updated every five years, with not more than five grid-scale projects required to be ready by 2023 for demonstration agreements with the DOE. The Joint Long-Term Storage Act of 2019 aims to develop cost-effective energy storage systems capable of providing output for 6 hours over 8,000 cycles, operating for 20 years, and storing energy for several months to address seasonal variations in supply and demand. The Secretary of Energy would establish a demonstration initiative focused on long-duration energy storage technologies to benefit the resilience of the electricity grid and improve peak load reduction. Large monolithic systems used for energy storage today do not store electricity directly but provide a means of producing electricity through a stored medium like water or air. The largest current system for energy storage on the electric grid is hydropower pumped storage (HPS), representing about 94% of U.S. energy storage capacity. HPS projects convert potential energy from falling water into electricity by moving turbine blades. Hydropower pumped storage (HPS) systems use the flow of water to generate electricity on demand. These projects involve moving water between two reservoirs at different elevations to store energy and generate electricity. When electricity demand is low, excess capacity is used to pump water to the upper reservoir. When demand is high, the stored water is released through a turbine to generate electricity. Most HPS projects are \"open-loop\" systems utilizing water from free-flowing sources. Regulatory Commission (FERC) reports that there are currently 24 operating HPS systems with a total capacity of over 16.5 GW, most authorized over 30 years ago. Newer closed-loop HPS technology utilizes non-free-flowing water sources. FERC has issued licenses for three closed-loop HPS projects since 2014, totaling 2.1 GW capacity. One project with 400 MW capacity is expected to start construction in 2020, providing an estimated 1,300 GWh of annual energy generation. Closed-loop HPS systems do not rely on dammed streams for reservoir locations. To qualify as a closed-loop pumped storage facility for expedited hydropower licensing, the project must have minimal impact on water flows, not harm endangered species, use reservoirs away from natural waterways, and only withdraw water for initial fill and recharge. Compressed Air Energy Storage facilities store compressed air underground and use it to generate electricity when needed. Compressed Air Energy Storage (CAES) plants use pressurized air heated in an expansion turbine to generate power. Two operating plants in Huntorf, Germany (290 MW) and McIntosh, Alabama (110 MW) store air in salt caverns. Huntorf can deliver power for 4 hours, McIntosh for 26 hours. CAES plants lose heat energy during compression and must be heated with natural gas before use. New CAES systems aim to store thermal energy from compression phase to avoid using natural gas. Energy losses during compression and expansion result in a 42% efficiency in converting energy to electricity. CAES plants can utilize lower cost energy from the grid during off-peak hours, including excess wind generation at night. New designs are exploring ways to increase energy conversion efficiency by capturing waste heat from compression and storing it in molten salt for the decompression cycle. The U.S. Department of Energy is exploring adapting CAES technology to porous rock formations for underground storage systems with capacities up to 400 MW. Liquid air energy storage uses liquefied air to create an energy resource, cooling air until it liquefies using off-peak electricity. The process of liquid air energy storage involves using electrical energy to liquefy air, storing it in insulated tanks at low pressure, and then superheating it to drive a turbine for power generation. The energy storage capacity is determined by the size of the tanks, which can hold several GWh of stored energy and be located anywhere needed. Liquid air energy storage allows for flexible tank placement, utilizing off-peak renewable energy to charge the system. Excess cold and heat produced during the liquefaction process can be stored and reused, improving system efficiency. Flywheel energy storage systems consist of a rotating cylinder balanced in a vacuum, providing electricity via magnetically levitated bearings. Flywheels store kinetic energy in a nearly frictionless environment by spinning a cylinder at high speeds. They can quickly charge and discharge large amounts of power, making them useful for applications requiring short bursts of energy. Flywheels are often charged using electricity from the grid and can store energy in the rotating mass. Flywheels store kinetic energy in a frictionless environment and can quickly charge and discharge power. They have fast response times, lifetimes of 20 years, and are sized between 100 kW and 1650 kW. Flywheels are not ideal for large-scale grid support services. Battery systems offer various technologies for electricity storage, including flow batteries that can be modular or monolithic. Flow batteries store electrical charge in liquid electrolyte tanks, with the electrolyte pumped through electrodes to extract electrons. The technology is scalable and reduces fire safety concerns by storing active chemicals separately. Vanadium and zinc bromine are common electrolytes used. New electrolyte chemistries are being explored for flow batteries due to vanadium's increasing price and toxicity. These chemistries aim to maintain high charge cycles and low viscosity for easier pumping between tanks. Flow batteries can be charged with any power source, making them a potential option for storing renewable energy. Redox flow batteries utilize chemical reduction and oxidation reactions. Redox flow batteries store energy in liquid electrolyte solutions through chemical reduction and oxidation reactions. They can be aqueous or nonaqueous systems, with aqueous systems using water as the electrolyte solvent. While aqueous flow batteries are safer, they store less energy per unit volume compared to nonaqueous chemistries. Redox flow batteries offer an economical and flexible means of storing electrical energy at scale, with power ratings ranging from kiloWatts to tens of MW over periods from two to 10 hours, and capable of 10,000 or more charging cycles. Redox flow batteries store energy in liquid electrolyte solutions through chemical reactions. The vanadium redox flow battery concept involves pumping liquids from external tanks into the battery's stack to generate power. The two electrolytes in this battery are identical when fully discharged, simplifying electrolyte management. Modular batteries store electrical energy in chemical form and are used in various everyday applications. Battery energy storage systems consist of standardized individual cells that can be aggregated to serve larger power loads and provide ancillary services for the electric grid. Rechargeable modular battery technologies serve applications from cell phones to electric vehicles and can offer backup power or grid services. Modular battery systems may be suitable for arbitrage opportunities ranging from one to 500 MW with a discharge duration of one hour or greater. Lithium ion batteries store and release energy through intercalation, involving lithium ions moving between electrodes. The most common type has a lithium-cobalt oxide cathode and a carbon anode. Li Ion batteries are used in various applications due to their versatility. Lithium-ion batteries have a high specific energy, storing about 150 Wh/kg. They hold charge well, losing only 5% per month, and have built-in circuitry for safety. However, they can still pose a fire risk due to the presence of fuel, oxygen, and an ignition source. Li Ion batteries do not need deep-discharge cycles but may lose the ability to fully recharge over time. Li Ion battery packs used in EV systems can retain 50% to 70% of their original energy storage capacity at the end of their service life. This allows for a second life in electricity storage applications. However, there is a risk of fire due to the flammable liquid electrolyte. The development of solid-state batteries may address safety concerns and prevent issues like dendrite formation. The construction of Li Ion batteries using cobalt from the Democratic Republic of Congo raises concerns about child labor and unsafe mining conditions in artisanal mines. Despite the collapse of cobalt prices, child labor in Congolese artisanal mines remains a significant issue. The growth in EV adoption could worsen the problem, leading companies to scrutinize their cobalt supply chain. Efforts to source cobalt from regulated mines in the DRC are hindered by the mixing of supplies during the refining process, mainly in China. Some companies are reducing cobalt usage to address concerns about child labor. Recycling Li Ion batteries is crucial due to their toxic elements and valuable components, prompting some countries to pass laws for proper disposal. China and the European Union have regulations for EV battery disposal to ensure recycling. Recycling Li Ion batteries can reduce the need for new cobalt supplies. Reusing EV Li Ion batteries is currently more attractive than recycling. Lithium Iron Phosphate (LFP) is another rechargeable battery chemistry with lower specific energy but longer cycle life than lithium-cobalt oxide cells. Lithium Iron Phosphate (LFP) has a specific energy of about 150 Wh/kg and a longer cycle life than lithium-cobalt oxide. Nickel Cadmium (NiCad) and Nickel-Metal Hydride (NiMH) batteries were widely used before Li Ion batteries, with NiMH replacing NiCad in applications requiring higher power density. NiMH can store about 70 watt-hours per kilogram and does not suffer from memory effect. NiCad retains a charge longer and performs better in cold conditions. Lead-Acid Batteries are one of the oldest forms of energy storage, commonly used in gasoline-powered vehicles. They have six cells with an electromotive force of about 2 volts and can be discharged at a high rate but require over 14 hours to recharge. The battery cells are made of a lead alloy grid with an electrolyte solution of water and sulfuric acid. Lead-acid batteries are commonly used in vehicles, with a wet-cell design containing several cells connected to each other. These batteries can store around 25 watt-hours of electric power per kilogram and are often used as starter batteries to provide power during ignition and store power generated by the electrical system. They can also be designed as deep cycle batteries for longer power duration. Some applications require dual purpose batteries with high starting power and durability. Lead-acid batteries are versatile, providing high starting power for engines and enduring multiple accessory loads. They can be aggregated for back-up power applications, acting as voltage stabilizers. However, they are less energy-efficient than lithium-ion batteries. Industrial batteries offer steady power for longer durations, lasting for years in stationary applications for critical back-up power supply. Industrial batteries are configured to accommodate large power demands and provide back-up power supply. Lead-acid battery components are often recycled at the end of their useful service life, with researchers working to address issues such as sulfation and battery failure. Researchers are exploring lead-acid carbon technologies to improve the performance and recyclability of lead-acid batteries for various applications, including electric grid and transportation. This approach aims to unlock unused potential in these batteries and mitigate issues like sulfation and dissolution. Advanced lead-acid batteries address previous shortcomings through technology changes. Some use solid electrolyte-electrode configurations or capacitor technology. Sodium sulfur batteries operate at high temperatures with a solid ceramic electrolyte. One available set has a one MW capacity providing up to 6 MWh of energy. One battery set currently available has a one MW capacity providing up to 6 MWh of energy from 20 modules each capable of supplying 50 kW. Sodium nickel chloride batteries operate at high temperatures and use a ceramic electrolyte to separate electrodes. The DOE/EPRI report mentions utility systems deploying systems in the size range of 50 kW to 1 MW. New modular battery technologies are being developed for grid-scale storage, aiming to achieve cost-effective and long-lasting performance. Research into permeable membranes may lead to replacements for ceramic separators in NaS batteries. MIT researchers are working on mesh membranes for new grid-scale batteries with sodium and nickel chloride electrodes, potentially enabling inexpensive battery technology for intermittent power. Liquid metal batteries are being developed for grid-scale storage, aiming to enable inexpensive battery technology for intermittent power sources like wind and solar. Ancillary services are used by grid operators to ensure reliability and stability by matching power generation and demand. Services include load following, voltage regulation, system protection, and energy imbalance services. Ancillary services are essential for grid reliability and stability, categorized into flexibility-related, frequency-related, and voltage-related services. Flexibility-related services involve ramping or load following to meet changing demand conditions quickly. Demand for power fluctuates sub-hourly, hourly, daily, and seasonally, requiring power plants to adjust accordingly. Operating reserves are crucial for grid reliability, providing the ability to quickly fill in new energy supply when needed due to unexpected changes in the supply/demand balance. Contingency spinning reserves can respond within ten to fifteen minutes, while non-spinning reserves typically have response times of ten to 30 minutes or more. A reserve margin, which varies by regional regulatory requirements, represents the percentage of installed capacity exceeding the expected peak demand. A reserve margin of 15% indicates excess capacity of 15% of expected peak demand in an electric system. Spinning reserves come from actively generating units that can quickly adjust output. Non-spinning reserves, also known as fast-start resources, can start up quickly to provide energy. Frequency-related services include regulating reserves for stabilizing frequency during emergencies. Technical considerations for storage systems include size range, discharge duration, and minimum cycles per year. Energy storage resources can provide down regulation by charging and absorbing energy from the grid, but the storage operator must pay for that energy. Technical considerations for storage systems include size range (10-40 MW), discharge duration (15-60 minutes), and minimum cycles per year (250-10,000). Voltage-related ancillary services involve injecting or absorbing reactive power to maintain appropriate voltage levels. Reactive power (measured in KVAR) is essential for generating alternating current, along with real power (measured in kW). It must be available locally to transfer electricity across the network and maintain desired voltage levels. Power plants traditionally generate reactive power, but smaller coal-fired plants are being retired. Energy storage systems could replace these plants, with a size range of 1-10 MVAR."
