The Congress recognizes the importance of participation in government and freedom of speech as inalienable rights protected by the First Amendment. Providing communications, information, and opinions to the government is crucial for wise decision-making, public policy, public health, safety, and welfare. Civil lawsuits and counterclaims with significant damages have been and continue to be filed. Millions of dollars in damages are being filed against individuals, organizations, and businesses for exercising their rights to petition or free speech. These lawsuits, known as SLAPPs, are often dismissed as groundless or unconstitutional, causing great expense and harassment to the defendants. It is important for individuals and entities to participate in public concerns and provide information to public entities. SLAPPs are an abuse of the judicial process that waste judicial resources and clog court dockets. Protection against SLAPPs has not been uniform or comprehensive. Protection against SLAPPs has not been uniform or comprehensive, leading to some victims being deprived of entitled relief due to current bankruptcy laws allowing for the discharge of fees, costs, and damages awarded in SLAPP cases. The Act provides immunity for petitioning the government if done without knowledge of falsity or reckless disregard of falsity. It also offers protection for petition and speech activities, with procedural safeguards. Additionally, it allows for a special motion to dismiss. A party may file a special motion to dismiss within 45 days after service of the claim if it arises from an act in furtherance of the constitutional right of petition or free speech. The burden of proof initially lies with the party filing the motion to show the claim relates to petition or free speech. If this burden is met, the responding party must demonstrate the claim's legal sufficiency and factual support for a favorable judgment. Upon filing a special motion to dismiss, discovery proceedings are stayed until the court issues an order on the motion. An expedited hearing will be held, and the court must provide reasons for granting or denying the motion. If granted, dismissal is with prejudice, and the defendant has the right to an immediate appeal from a denial of the motion. Federal removal jurisdiction allows civil actions in State courts to be removed to the district court of the United States if a defendant asserts immunity under the Act or claims arising from constitutional rights. The court must remand any claims not dismissed under a special motion back to the State court. If a special motion to dismiss is not filed within 15 days after removal, the court must remand the action. Additionally, there is a provision for a special motion to quash under Section 7. SEC. 7. SPECIAL MOTION TO QUASH. A person can make a special motion to quash if their personal information is requested in a Federal court case related to free speech or petition rights. The burden of proof shifts to the plaintiff to show the claim is legally valid. SEC. 8. FEES AND COSTS. SEC. 8. FEES AND COSTS.
