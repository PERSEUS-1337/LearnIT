    "content": "DOD RDT&E appropriations are provided annually through the defense appropriations act, with more than 95% of funding allocated in Title IV for Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation. This includes funding for the Army, Navy, Air Force, Defense-wide RDT&E, and specific program elements like night vision technology and cyber operations. The Defense Health Program (DHP) in Title VI supports healthcare for DOD personnel and research on various medical conditions. The Chemical Agents and Munitions Destruction Program in Title VI aims to destroy lethal chemical agents. The National Defense Sealift Fund funds naval reserve procurement and research. The RDT&E funding for the nation's naval reserve fleet and U.S.-flagged merchant fleet is requested in the Navy's Procurement request and appropriated in Title V of the appropriation act. RDT&E funds for Overseas Contingency Operations are requested separately and accounted for separately from regular budget requests. The Joint Improvised-Threat Defeat Fund (JITDF) works to counter improvised threats like IEDs through rapid acquisition and RDT&E. The Trump Administration included these funds in regular budget requests, transitioning them to Defense-wide appropriation accounts. OCO-related requests have included funds for transfer accounts like the Iraqi Freedom Fund and Afghanistan Security Forces Fund. The Defense Department typically makes appropriations to funds like the Freedom Fund, Iraqi Security Forces Fund, Afghanistan Security Forces Fund, and Pakistan Counterinsurgency Capability Fund. Congress authorizes transfers to other accounts, including RDT&E, which are reflected in prior-year funding figures for DOD Title IV. The funding is categorized into seven budget activity codes (6.1 through 6.7) based on the type of work to be performed, as outlined in DOD's Financial Management Regulation. Basic research is a systematic study aimed at increasing fundamental knowledge in various scientific fields related to national security needs, leading to technological progress and advancements in defense-related technologies and military capabilities. Applied research is a systematic study to meet specific needs by expanding knowledge and developing useful materials, devices, and systems. It aims to design, develop, and improve prototypes and processes to address military requirements, translating basic research into solutions for military needs. This effort includes studies, hardware development, programming, and planning to establish the feasibility of proposed solutions to technological challenges. Applied research focuses on developing and evaluating proposed solutions for military needs. It precedes system-specific technology investigations and development. Advanced Technology Development involves creating subsystems, components, and prototypes for field experiments and tests. This includes concept and technology demonstrations to prove technological feasibility. Advanced Technology Development projects demonstrate military utility and cost reduction potential of technology for different military equipment. They involve pre-Milestone B efforts like system concept demonstration and have Technology Readiness Levels of 4, 5, or 6. These projects do not necessarily lead to subsequent development. (TRA) Guidance for projects in this category is to move out of Science and Technology (S&T) into the acquisition process within the Future Years Defense Program (FYDP). Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&P) funds efforts to evaluate integrated technologies and prototype systems for technology transition. System Development and Demonstration (SDD) focuses on proving component and subsystem maturity for major systems. System Development and Demonstration (SDD) programs conduct engineering and manufacturing development tasks to meet requirements before full-rate production. This budget activity involves mature system development, integration, live fire testing, and evaluation of production representative articles. RDT&E Management Support includes management support for research, development, test, and evaluation efforts. The budget activity includes funding for test ranges, military construction, maintenance support of laboratories, operation and maintenance of test aircraft and ships, and studies and analyses in support of the RDT&E program. Costs of laboratory personnel and military construction costs related to major development programs are also covered. Operational System Development focuses on upgrading systems that have been fielded or approved for full rate production. Funding in budget activity codes 6.1-6.3 is known as the science and technology (S&T) budget within DOD RDT&E. The DOD RDT&E budget includes funding for test ranges, military construction, maintenance support of laboratories, and operation of test aircraft and ships. The S&T budget (6.1-6.3) is crucial for developing future military systems, while 6.4, 6.5, and 6.7 funds focus on applying existing knowledge for current needs. Basic research (6.1) in the S&T program is a significant source of federal funds for R&D at universities, with DOD funding a substantial portion in fields like aerospace engineering. The Office of Management and Budget categorizes federal R&D funding into basic research, applied research, development, and facilities and equipment. DOD budget activities 6.6 and 6.7 funding are omitted from federal calculations of research and development funding. The National Science Foundation collects R&D appropriations and performance data from federal agencies, including DOD, through its annual Survey of Federal Funds for Research and Development. DOD uses a crosswalk to categorize its R&D activities into basic research, applied research, and development, with development further divided into advanced technology development and major systems development. DOD categorizes its R&D activities into basic research, applied research, advanced technology development, and major systems development. Figures illustrate DOD RDT&E expenditure trends for FY1996-FY2017, showing funding in current and constant dollars. Other appropriations titles are not included in the taxonomy, which may affect the balance among categories. Total DOD RDT&E funding fluctuated between FY2000 and FY2017, with a 73% increase from FY2000 to FY2007, followed by a 27% decrease from FY2010 to FY2015, and a 13.5% increase from FY2015 to FY2017. In FY2017, Operational System Development accounted for 36.7% of RDT&E, while Science and Technology made up 18.8%. Title IV RDT&E funding in FY2017 was mainly provided by Title IV and OCO appropriations, totaling $73.8 billion out of $76.4 billion. Congressional decisions on defense RDT&E funding are crucial for national security and economic strength. Decisions on DOD RDT&E funding, S&T funding, and basic research play a crucial role in U.S. national security and economic strength. These funding levels are determined through appropriations decisions made during DOD budget formulation and congressional appropriations. Analyzing funding trends can provide strategic insight and guidance for future budget allocations. Each year, Congress makes decisions about funding for DOD RDT&E, influenced by various factors such as military engagements, national security threats, technology capabilities, funding of adversaries, and budget constraints. The question of the appropriate funding level for DOD RDT&E lacks a clear objective answer. The appropriate funding level for DOD RDT&E is a subject of analysis and debate in Congress and DOD. The Defense Science Board proposed using a standard industry benchmark to determine funding levels, suggesting a total DOD research and development funding level of about $35 billion. RDT&E funding for DOD has shown slow growth between FY1996 and FY2017. Between FY1996 and FY2001, RDT&E grew slowly, but between FY2000 and FY2010, it more than doubled in current dollars. However, between FY2010 and FY2015, RDT&E fell by 20.5% before rising again. As a percentage of DOD's total obligational authority, RDT&E generally ranged between 13% and 14% until FY2011 when it dropped to around 11%. By FY2017, it had increased to 12.3%. The challenge with using RDT&E as a share of DOD TOA is that during times of conflict, DOD TOA can increase substantially, potentially causing RDT&E to decline as a share of DOD TOA. Between FY2004 and FY2008, RDT&E grew by 23.4% while DOD TOA grew by 46.8% in support of post-9/11 military operations. Concerns have been raised about funding for defense science and technology, seen as crucial for future defense technology development. The DSB's June 1998 report suggested setting S&T funding at 3.4% of total DOD funding. The DSB's June 1998 report proposed setting DOD S&T funding at 3.4% of total DOD funding, amounting to about $8.4 billion. Congress expressed the need to increase S&T funding by 2% above inflation annually from FY2000 to FY2008, citing concerns about the stability of the defense technology base. The DSB recommended setting DOD S&T funding at 3.4% of total DOD funding, amounting to about $8.4 billion. Congress expressed the need to increase S&T funding by 2% above inflation annually from FY2000 to FY2008 to maintain technological superiority in future weapon systems. In 2009, Congress embraced the DSB's three percent recommendation for DOD S&T funding. The Department of Defense aims to allocate three percent of the budget for the defense science and technology program to ensure the long-term technical superiority of U.S. military forces. This goal is supported by findings from the Defense Science Board report and recommendations for increased S&T funding. Other organizations also suggest a 3% level for S&T funding as a share of total DOD funding. The Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) and the Council on Competitiveness recommended a significant increase in funding for S&T programs to 3% of DOD spending per year. S&T funding peaked at $13.3 billion in FY2006, declined to $11.0 billion in FY2013, and rebounded to $13.4 billion in FY2017. In constant dollars, S&T funding peaked in FY2005 before falling 27.8% through FY2013; between FY2013 and FY2017, S&T funding grew by 14.9%. In the late 1990s, S&T funding declined from 3.0% to 1.7% of DOD TOA, rebounding to 2.2% in FY2017. The DSB proposed increasing S&T funding to 3% of DOD TOA, or 20% of DOD RDT&E, aligning with industry standards. National Security Research recommended that DOD S&T funding should be 20% of DOD RDT&E. S&T's share of DOD RDT&E was around 20% at the time of the DSB report, reaching 21.5% in FY2000 but dropping to 15.2% in FY2011. It recovered to 18.8% in FY2015, then decreased to 17.9% in FY2017. Basic research within the S&T program is highlighted for its importance in advancing technologies and supporting university-based research. Basic research funding is considered vulnerable to budget cuts due to the long time it takes for investments to yield results. In 2004, the Council on Competitiveness and the Coalition for National Security Research recommended that DOD basic research funding should be at least 20% of DOD S&T. DOD basic research funding grew steadily from FY1998 through FY2015, more than doubling in current dollars, then fell somewhat in FY2016 and FY2017. Basic research declined from 14.6% in FY1996 to 11.0% in FY2006, then rose to 18.4% in FY2015, its highest level in 20 years, before falling to 16.4% in FY2017. Congress is concerned about the balance in the RDT&E portfolio between incremental improvements and exploratory funding. The DSB's 1998 report highlighted the importance of funding for both incremental improvements and exploratory research that could lead to revolutionary technologies. Industry typically allocates 1/3 of research funding to potentially revolutionary projects, with the rest focused on evolutionary improvements. DSB recommended that DOD ensure 1/3 of the S&T program elements are devoted to revolutionary technology initiatives, with DARPA and the Services playing a major role in executing these efforts. This recommendation should be applied to the FY2017 S&T budget. The Defense Science Board recommended that 1/3 of the S&T program elements be devoted to revolutionary technology initiatives, with DARPA and the Services playing a major role. This formula would allocate approximately $4.5 billion to revolutionary technology initiatives in the FY2017 S&T budget. DARPA has been the lead DOD agency focused on revolutionary R&D since its establishment in 1958. DARPA funding is used as a surrogate measure of DOD's investments in revolutionary research. DARPA funding has remained steady between $2.5 billion and $3.0 billion since FY2003, accounting for 22-25% of defense S&T funding. The National Academies recommended allocating at least 8% of federal research agency budgets for high-risk, high-payoff research. DARPA's share of DOD RDT&E fell from 6.4% in FY1996 to 3.4% in FY2008. DARPA's share of DOD RDT&E funding fluctuated, dropping to 3.4% in FY2008, then rising to 4.5% in FY2015 before decreasing again to 3.9% in FY2017. The National Academies recommend allocating 8% of federal research budgets for high-risk, high-payoff research, but DARPA's funding falls below this threshold. Various ways of parsing DOD RDT&E investments are discussed in the report, including allocation by performing organization and size of industrial performers. The importance of stability in funding streams for DOD RDT&E is emphasized, along with factors affecting performance such as organizational structures, management, and workforce policies. Congress should consider funding magnitude and composition for DOD RDT&E, as well as other related issues during defense authorization and appropriations."
