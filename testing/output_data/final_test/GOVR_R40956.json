Perpetrators include security forces, rebel groups, militias, and even high-ranking state officials. Sexual violence is used strategically by combatant groups, and even humanitarian workers have been accused of abuse. This issue is not limited to Sub-Saharan Africa and is a significant problem in conflict zones worldwide. Sexual violence is a significant issue in African conflicts, with incidents in countries like CAR, Chad, DRC, Ethiopia, Nigeria, Somalia, and Sudan. Eastern DRC has seen widespread sexual violence by various armed groups. The report focuses on conflicts in Africa with widespread sexual violence, including a detailed case study of DRC. Congressional interest in addressing sexual violence in conflict zones has been demonstrated through legislation and hearings. Congressional interest in addressing sexual violence in conflict zones has encompassed humanitarian, health-related, socio-economic, and security implications. Hearings and legislation have focused on ways to respond to or prevent such violence, with specific attention to African conflict settings. Notable legislation passed during the 111th Congress includes the Lord's Resistance Army Disarmament and Northern Uganda Recovery Act of 2009 and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which regulates \"conflict minerals.\" During the 111th Congress, legislation was introduced to address international violence against women and sexual violence in conflict zones, including references to specific countries like Guinea, Ethiopia, and Sudan. Additional legislation focused on regulating \"conflict minerals\" and addressing gender-based violence. In the 112th Congress, a resolution on international gender-based violence was introduced. In the 112th Congress, H.J.Res. 12 (Jackson Lee) was introduced in the House on international gender-based violence. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act includes a provision on \"conflict minerals\" related to sexual and gender-based violence in the Democratic Republic of Congo. This provision requires U.S.-listed companies to disclose whether their products contain minerals from conflict areas in central Africa. The 111th Congress allocated $15 million in FY2010 Economic Support Fund (ESF) funds to address sexual violence in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and adjoining countries. This strategy aims to combat human rights abuses, armed groups, and conflict minerals in commercial products. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2010 allocated $10 million to address gender-based violence, including fistula repair and victim assistance. Funds from various assistance programs were directed to address sexual and gender-based violence overseas. The Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2009 provided $10 million in Economic Support Funds for programs assisting victims of gender-based violence in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2010 allocated $10 million to address gender-based violence, including fistula repair and victim assistance in the DRC. Appropriators directed the State Department and USAID to report on programs addressing sexual and gender-based violence and to provide a comprehensive strategy and budget to address gender-based violence in the DRC. The Administration briefed Congress on a strategy in early January 2011. Widespread sexual violence has been reported in active conflicts in Africa, notably in eastern DRC and Darfur, Sudan. In DRC, armed groups have committed massive sexual atrocities during internal conflicts over the past two decades. In Darfur, rape has been perpetrated by government and government-allied forces since 2003 amid fighting with rebel groups and militias. Sexual violence was systematically used as a weapon of war and ethnic cleansing during the conflict in Darfur from 2003-2006. During the conflict in Darfur from 2003-2006, sexual violence was used as a weapon of war and ethnic cleansing by the government. Between July 2008 and June 2010, 166 incidents of sexual violence were recorded by UNAMID, with perpetrators mainly being non-state armed groups. Assistance for rape survivors in Darfur was significantly reduced in March 2009. In March 2009, assistance for rape survivors in Darfur was \"largely eliminated\" when Sudan expelled international relief organizations due to an arrest warrant for Sudan's president by the International Criminal Court. Other conflict zones with significant levels of sexual violence include areas in the Central African Republic, Chad, eastern Ethiopia, southern Nigeria, and Somalia. In the Central African Republic, sexual violence is committed by security forces, non-state armed groups, Chadian troops, and other factions. Over 15% of women and girls in CAR's violence-ridden north have been victims. In Chad, rebel groups in the east challenge the government's rule, with security forces accused of sexual violence. In Ethiopia, systematic rape is reported in the government's counterinsurgency campaign against the ONLF since 2007. Reports of sexual violence among refugees in Chad have increased from 295 in 2006 to 860 in 2009. Ethiopian security forces have been accused of raping women detained on suspicion of aiding the ONLF rebel group since 2007. In Nigeria, state security forces in the Niger Delta region have used rape to intimidate the local population in response to attacks on oil installations. Forces allied with the Transitional Federal Government in Somalia have been accused of sexual violence against civilians and displaced populations. Sexual violence has also been reported in northeast DRC, southeast CAR, and southern Sudan by domestic armed groups. In Africa, sexual violence is prevalent in conflict settings and is not only carried out by domestic armed groups but also by the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) in northern Uganda. LRA fighters have raped, mutilated, and abducted civilians for sexual slavery. This violence is often seen as a by-product of internal conflicts involving irregular forces, but it is also strategically used by combatant groups for various purposes such as rewarding victorious troops, social bonding, punishment, and humiliation. Sexual violence in conflict settings is used as a means of humiliating male members of opposing communities, destroying cultures, and ethnic cleansing. It is often portrayed as a \"weapon of war\" and varies significantly between conflicts and groups. In Sierra Leone's civil war, combatants used sexual violence as a tool of political intimidation. In conflict settings, sexual violence often occurs amid a breakdown in social systems and discipline within combatant groups, leading to opportunistic and indiscriminate acts. Combatant groups in African conflict settings lacking effective command structures have been associated with rape. Women in conflict zones, with limited economic resources, are vulnerable to exploitation. The normalization of sexual violence within conflict-affected communities can lead to an increase in sexual assault by civilians. Sexual violence in conflict-affected communities is often encouraged by commanders as a way to placate their troops. Combatants may view rape as justified, similar to looting, for their upkeep. This opportunistic behavior also leads to the abduction of women and children as sexual slaves. Sexual violence is systematically employed for intimidation, humiliation, and political terror. Sexual violence in conflict is used for various purposes such as intimidation, humiliation, political terror, and ethnic cleansing. It has been recognized as a war crime, crime against humanity, or genocide. In conflicts in Africa like DRC, Darfur, and Ethiopia's Ogaden region, sexual violence is used as a tool of war by different parties. For instance, in DRC, both military and non-state combatants use sexual assault to target civilians supporting their opponents. In the Ogaden, the Ethiopian military is accused of raping women who support anti-government insurgents, sometimes as revenge for attacks by opposing forces. Sexual violence in conflict is often used as a form of revenge for armed assaults by opposing forces, particularly in the Niger Delta region of Nigeria. Combatants may target women in rural areas to disrupt food security and nutrition, as women are typically responsible for food gathering. In some African conflicts, sexual violence, including mutilation, is carried out in culturally significant ways to instill fear in civilians. It can also be used as a tool for ethnic cleansing or genocide to terrorize targeted groups, disrupt social structures, and drive people from their land. Sexual violence in conflict is often used as a form of revenge for armed assaults by opposing forces, particularly in the Niger Delta region of Nigeria. In several African conflicts, women are targeted and portrayed as symbolic bearers of their cultural or ethnic identity, and as producers of future generations. Sudanese security forces and pro-government militia have been accused of employing sexual violence as a tactic of ethnic cleansing in Darfur, eastern Chad, and previously in South Sudan. In Rwanda, systematic rape was a feature of the 1994 genocide, fueled by propaganda efforts to paint Tutsi women as enemies of the state. Sexual violence has been interpreted as a step in the process of group destruction in these conflicts. Sexual violence is prevalent in areas of active combat and near camps for internally displaced persons and refugees. Displaced women and girls are vulnerable to human trafficking and assault, especially when foraging for fuel. Countries transitioning from conflict may continue to experience high levels of sexual violence due to shifts in social norms and weakened rule of law. High levels of sexual violence are reported in post-conflict settings in Burundi, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. Sexual violence has also been used by security forces in African states as a tool of political repression, such as in Guinea and Kenya. In Kenya, violence was carried out by government security forces and militias based on ethnic or political affiliation. In Zimbabwe, government-affiliated forces have been accused of orchestrating sexual violence for political intimidation. Survivors of sexual violence face short-term and long-term health, psychological, and social consequences, including STDs, miscarriages, forced pregnancy, and traumatic fistula. Access to treatment is challenging in African conflict settings. In African conflict settings, facilities and staff are often insufficient or hard to reach, leading to social isolation for sexual assault survivors. Family rejections and societal stigma further ostracize victims, who fear reprisals from perpetrators and may face prosecution for reporting assaults. Impunity for abusers reinforces norms of sexual violence. Reports by humanitarian organizations suggest that male victims of sexual violence in African conflicts face challenges such as rape, sexual torture, slavery, humiliation, and forced incest. Societal stigma and legal barriers hinder assistance and treatment for male victims, who are less likely to report abuse than women. African conflicts pose unique challenges in preventing and responding to sexual violence due to factors like the capacity and political will of governments and militaries to prosecute such crimes. African women face challenges in accessing healthcare services, especially in conflict-affected areas where clinics are understaffed and lack necessary supplies for treating victims of sexual violence. Despite these obstacles, women in Africa are not just passive victims but also actively involved in combatant groups, politics, and activism. The legal and societal status of women in many African countries is influenced by factors like poverty, illiteracy, and limited access to education. Accessing healthcare in conflict zones is challenging due to uprooted health structures, logistical difficulties, and insecurity. Women and girls face barriers in seeking care for sexual violence, including stigma and lack of safety in clinics. Medical evidence of rape is rarely collected, and economic insecurity limits access to paid healthcare. Human rights violations are common in African conflicts, with insufficient will to address abuses. Advocates argue that many African countries lack legal frameworks for prosecuting sexual violence, with laws often unfavorable to victims. In some states, rape is not codified as a crime, making it difficult for victims to access justice. For example, Sudan's laws define rape as adultery, hindering justice for victims who cannot prove lack of consent. In many African countries, laws are unfavorable to victims of sexual violence, with rape often not codified as a crime. This hinders justice for victims who cannot prove lack of consent. Additionally, legal immunity for military and security personnel, as well as pro-government militias, further complicates prosecution for sexual violence. Despite some countries passing new legislation addressing sexual violence, prosecutions remain rare even where appropriate laws are in place. In many African countries, there are challenges in law enforcement and judicial capacity, including lack of financial resources, trained personnel, access to legislation, and expertise in handling sexual violence cases. Obtaining medical documentation of rape is difficult due to overstretched healthcare systems. Judicial corruption and political influence are common. Military codes of justice may not address sexual violence adequately. In many cases, military justice systems lack provisions against sexual assault and are not effectively enforced. This can have broader implications beyond the military, as some countries' military courts have jurisdiction over crimes committed by civilians. Additionally, African constitutions often do not grant women equal rights under the law, impacting their ability to inherit property and access legal recourse in cases of divorce or assault. The international community addresses sexual violence in African conflicts through various mechanisms, including financial and logistical assistance from donor countries and U.N. Security Council sessions focusing on women, peace, and security. Despite African countries ratifying human rights treaties, domestic courts often do not consider these agreements in their rulings, reflecting wider societal discrimination against women. The international community, including U.N. agencies and other organizations, actively address sexual violence in African conflicts. The U.N. Security Council has adopted resolutions specifically focused on this issue, such as Resolution 1888, which calls for the appointment of a Special Representative. International courts have also been utilized to prosecute combatants accused of sexual violence in African conflicts. Resolution 1888, following previous resolutions 1325 and 1820, calls for the appointment of a Special Representative by the U.N. Secretary-General to address conflict-related sexual violence. Regular reports are compiled to monitor implementation and address human rights abuses. The U.N. Secretary-General addresses sexual and gender-based violence in African peacekeeping missions, with reports to the U.N. Security Council. The U.N. Human Rights Council supports the Special Rapporteur on Violence Against Women in African conflict settings. 46 African states are parties to the U.N. Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women. The U.N. Secretary-General and Department of Peacekeeping Operations (DPKO) work to enforce standards and oversight to reduce sexual abuse by U.N. peacekeeping troops. International law now prosecutes sexual violence in wartime, evolving with norms against civilian abuse in armed conflict. The 1949 Geneva Conventions classify sexual assault as a war crime, holding combatant groups accountable. Individuals have been prosecuted for sexual violence in African conflicts, facing international tribunals and the International Criminal Court established in 2002. The International Criminal Court has focused on sexual violence in various conflicts in Africa, prosecuting individuals for war crimes and crimes against humanity. The International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda and the Special Court for Sierra Leone have qualified systematic sexual violence as war crimes. Over 60 suspects have been prosecuted for sexual violence during the Rwandan genocide, with the first suspect being a former mayor, Jean Paul Akayesu. The Akayesu prosecution in 1997 at the ICTR was a landmark case that included charges of failing to prevent sexual violence against displaced women. Sexual violence has been a component in most SCSL prosecutions, including cases against AFRC leaders, RUF rebel group, and former Liberian President Charles Taylor. The ICC has also sought to prosecute cases related to sexual violence. The ICC has prosecuted cases of sexual violence in African conflicts, focusing on CAR, the Lord's Resistance Army, Darfur, and eastern DRC. Individuals sought for sexual crimes include Omar al-Bashir, Ahmad Harun, Ali Kushayb, Joseph Kony, and Jean-Pierre Bemba Gombo. The Court asserts jurisdiction over gender-based violence and has procedures for victim and witness treatment. The Obama Administration has emphasized international women's issues as a foreign policy focus, particularly addressing sexual violence as a \"weapon of war.\" Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Ambassador-at-Large for Global Women's Issues, Melanne Verveer, have led public efforts on this issue, including chairing a U.N. Security Council session on women, peace, and security. The ICC has prosecuted individuals for sexual crimes in African conflicts, including former Congolese rebel leader Jean-Pierre Bemba Gombo. In September 2009, Clinton chaired a U.N. Security Council session on women, peace, and security, leading to the unanimous passage of Resolution 1888 on sexual violence in conflict. President Obama highlighted the importance of addressing violence against women and children. The Administration announced plans to develop a \"National Action Plan\" based on Resolution 1325 to protect women and girls in conflict zones. USAID and the Department of State are key players in addressing international sexual and gender-based violence. The Department of State and USAID, along with other bureaus and departments, play key roles in addressing sexual violence in conflict settings. Various bureaus and offices within DOS and USAID are involved in these efforts, along with support from the Department of Defense and Department of Justice. Most U.S. entities do not consistently separate efforts to address sexual violence from broader issues like violence against women, women's empowerment, and refugee protection. The United States maintains programs addressing sexual violence in African conflict zones, providing medical assistance and addressing causal factors. Support is also given to multilateral organizations for victim care, refugee protection, and aid for women and vulnerable populations. The report focuses on U.S. assistance in the DRC as an example of efforts in this area. Programs addressing sexual violence in conflict zones often provide medical and psychological treatment to survivors. USAID has funded hospitals in the DRC specializing in treating sexual violence victims, as well as supported women's health teams in rural Liberia. PRM has also funded programs to provide assistance to sexual violence survivors. PRM has funded programs to provide medical and psychological assistance to sexual violence survivors in Ethiopia, Liberia, and Sudan, as well as supporting the protection of refugees and displaced populations vulnerable to sexual violence. Additionally, DCHA has funded programs aimed at protecting displaced women from sexual violence in conflict or disaster situations. Anti-trafficking programs in African conflict settings have also been a focus, with PRM overseeing a program to assist trafficking victims in an African country. The program provides protection, return, and reintegration assistance to Congolese IDPs trafficked by Ugandan military forces during the civil war in an African country. U.S. foreign police, judicial, and military training programs include components on sexual and gender-based violence, as mandated by congressional directives. Training to prevent sexual and gender-based violence is a core part of U.S.-supported security sector reform efforts in countries like DRC. Violence is a key aspect of U.S.-supported security sector reform efforts, with programs addressing underlying issues contributing to sexual violence rates. This includes policy support for legal protections, economic empowerment initiatives, media training, and capacity-building for legal professionals. For example, a project in Chad funded by DRL aims to improve access to news on gender-based violence and women's rights. USAID's economic growth activities also play a role in addressing these issues. The Women's Justice and Empowerment Initiative (WJEI) is a $55 million State Department program focused on improving legal rights for victims of gender-based violence in conflict-affected populations in Liberia, Rwanda, southern Sudan, Uganda, and the DRC. This initiative aims to increase awareness of gender-based violence response and prevention programs through community media. The program has garnered attention from U.S. policy-makers, including the Obama Administration and Congress, due to the severity of sexual abuse in the DRC. U.S. programs addressing sexual violence in DRC are a significant part of U.S. policy efforts in African conflicts. Sexual violence in DRC is described as the worst in the world, with extreme brutality including forced incest, gang rape, and urogenital mutilation. Survivors often witness the torture and murder of their loved ones, leading to severe psycho-social and health consequences. Sexual violence in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) has devastating consequences, including pregnancy, infertility, sexually transmitted diseases, and genital mutilation among survivors. Rape is highly stigmatized and leads to spousal abandonment, inability to marry, expulsion from the community, and homelessness. UNICEF estimated that \"hundreds of thousands\" of women and girls had been raped in DRC since the mid-1990s, with over 17,500 cases of sexual and gender-based violence reported in 2009. The conflict-ridden east, particularly North and South Kivu, has seen a high prevalence of sexual violence. In North and South Kivu, armed groups and state security forces commit brutal human rights abuses, including sexual violence. The Congolese military, FARDC, has failed to protect civilians in conflict zones, with reports of troops being among the main perpetrators of violence, including sexual assault. Former CNDP combatants integrated into the military have been accused of abuses, along with the Congolese police and intelligence agents. The Congolese police, intelligence agents, and various armed groups, including the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) and FDLR, have been accused of widespread sexual violence in the DRC. Sexual assault is often used as a tactic to terrorize communities or punish them for their perceived affiliations. Individual fighters and groups frequently engage in opportunistic rape of women and girls, sometimes alongside other motives. Sexual violence in the DRC is prevalent, with women, girls, men, and boys being victims. Displaced persons are frequently targeted. The root causes include the eroded status of women, weak state authority, a flawed justice system, and breakdown in community protection mechanisms. Military integration of rebel organizations without proper discipline has also been linked to sexual violence by the military. Troops' poor pay and lack of supplies in conflict areas contribute to looting and abuses. Sexual violence in the DRC is prevalent, with incidents of rape by civilians reportedly increasing in zones of relative stability. In a rebel attack near Walikale in 2010, an estimated 303 women were raped by members of armed groups. The attackers were from the FDLR and Mai Mai-Cheka, and the attack was unusual for its size and number of gang rapes. In a 2010 rebel attack near Walikale, DRC, around 303 women were raped by armed groups, including the FDLR and Mai Mai-Cheka. The victims were assaulted in front of family members to instill fear in society. The incident highlighted the failure of U.N. peacekeepers to protect villagers, with at least 257 more women raped in the same period in North and South Kivu provinces. A Mai Mai-Cheka leader was later arrested in connection with the rapes during a joint military operation. Nine soldiers, including their commanding officer, were convicted of mass rape and looting in connection with the Walikale rapes during a joint operation by the Congolese military and U.N. peacekeepers. The trial, supported by the U.N. peacekeeping mission and NGOs, demonstrated the capacity to prosecute senior military officers for sexual violence-related offenses. The U.S. funded DRC sexual violence prosecutions program and the Open Society Initiative. The State Department praised the Congolese government for swift legal action against military personnel for sexual violence. Impunity is common for sexual crimes in DRC, but the government has taken steps to combat it, including passing laws in 2006 and releasing a gender-based violence strategy in 2009. Prosecutions have led to convictions. The United Nations and the Ministry of Justice in the DRC have made efforts to address sexual violence, including establishing special units within the national police force and adopting a road-map with the support of the United Nations. However, these efforts have been limited and prosecutions remain rare, with minimal sentences and lack of enforcement. There is a lack of will to investigate and prosecute high-level officials for sexual violence. The U.N. peacekeeping mission in DRC, MONUSCO, with over 22,000 personnel, focuses on protecting civilians and monitoring human rights, including prosecuting military personnel for abuses. A Comprehensive Strategy in the Fight Against Sexual Violence in DRC, endorsed by the government and donors, aims to combat impunity, prevent and protect, and reform the security sector. The U.N. peacekeeping mission in DRC focuses on combating impunity, prevention, protection, security sector reform, and a multi-sectoral response for survivors. Peacekeepers have faced criticism for failing to protect civilians and supporting Congolese military units accused of human rights abuses. Calls have been made to cease support for FARDC operations due to ongoing abuses. The U.N. mission announced it would withdraw support for FARDC units accused of killing civilians. Despite efforts to combat sexual exploitation and abuse, investigations show ongoing misconduct by peacekeeping personnel. Troop-contributing countries are responsible for prosecuting their nationals for alleged abuses. Human Rights Watch reported in 2008 that serious allegations of illegal behavior by UN peacekeepers in Congo were being ignored. MONUSCO has implemented measures to prevent abuses, including training, monitoring, and investigations. The US State Department considers the DRC a priority for addressing violence against women. Secretary of State Clinton visited Goma in 2009 to meet with rape survivors and condemn the attacks. In 2009, Secretary of State Clinton announced $17 million in new funding to assist women in North and South Kivu, addressing the issue of sexual violence in Congo. This funding included $7 million for the International Rescue Committee and $10 million from the Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2009. The US government is committed to holding perpetrators of crimes against humanity, including systematic rape, accountable. The US government is committed to holding perpetrators of crimes against humanity, including systematic rape, accountable, and creating a safe environment for women, girls, and civilians in eastern Congo. U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice condemned the attacks despite U.N. peacekeeping patrols in the area and called for enhanced communication with rural communities. In response to reports of rapes along the Angola-DRC border, the State Department called for an investigation and reiterated condemnation of sexual violence in conflict zones worldwide. The Obama Administration submitted a strategy to address sexual violence and gender-based violence in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, focusing on reducing impunity for perpetrators, increasing prevention and protection, improving capacity of security forces, and enhancing access to services for survivors. The U.S. Embassy in Kinshasa established a working group to coordinate efforts and monitor progress towards these objectives. Interagency efforts in mid-2010 identified over $170 million budgeted for programs addressing sexual and gender-based violence in DRC by State Department, USAID, and Defense Department. Programs included governance projects, health assistance, refugee protection, policy support, training efforts, and contributions to multilateral organizations. Funding for specific violence programs was sometimes indistinguishable from broader objectives. In mid-2010, over $170 million was budgeted for programs addressing sexual and gender-based violence in DRC by State Department, USAID, and Defense Department. USAID's programs in DRC have provided care for over 100,000 survivors since 2002. PEPFAR committed $30 million to support gender-based violence prevention in DRC, Mozambique, and Tanzania. AFRICOM has emphasized training in military justice and human rights law since 2009. The Administration allocated funds in 2010 to train and equip a model FARDC light infantry battalion in DRC to reduce sexual and gender-based violence. In the FY2012 budget request, $59.9 million in Economic Support Funds was designated for the prevention and treatment of sexual violence. Additionally, funds were requested for Peacekeeping Operations and police reform efforts, including training in the prevention of sexual violence. The Obama Administration has been praised for addressing sexual violence in African conflicts, with concerns raised about the coordination and effectiveness of U.S. programs. There are also questions about whether post-conflict settings receive enough attention and funding for combating sexual violence. Partner nations' political will and priorities in addressing the issue are also a concern. Some governments refuse to acknowledge rule-of-law shortcomings or the role of state security forces in sexual violence, impacting bilateral assistance programs. Debates over program design highlight the issue's complexity, including justice sector effectiveness, military professionalism, human security, and women's socio-economic status. U.S. efforts in combating sexual violence in African conflicts have shifted towards a security-oriented response in recent years, moving beyond health assistance to survivors. The growing interest in incorporating sexual violence issues into foreign military and police training and promoting women's roles in peace processes has led to debates on policy responses. Some argue for focusing on justice sector or long-term economic development and women's empowerment. Donor interventions may prioritize policy advising for government actors, sparking debates on direct care provision versus long-term institutional support. Some believe sexual violence in conflict zones is linked to wider security trends, advocating for security-focused prevention efforts. Policy efforts to prevent violence should focus on providing security for civilians on the ground. Concerns have been raised about training programs for military and law enforcement personnel, as well as the feasibility of implementing new practices in conflict-affected regions of Africa. Training programs for foreign military and law enforcement personnel in conflict-torn African countries may not effectively address underlying problems such as capacity gaps, insufficient resources, and weak judiciary systems. Evaluating the impact of these programs is challenging, as many agencies focus on the number of individuals trained rather than measuring the overall benefits. The mass rapes in the Walikale region of DRC in 2010 raised concerns about the effectiveness of U.N. peacekeeping missions. Analysts and policy-makers are concerned about the role of U.N. peacekeeping missions in preventing sexual violence in the context of multilateral peacekeeping operations. Advocates urge troop contributors and commanders to prioritize civilian protection, but argue that peacekeeping mandates often lack guidance and resources for effective protection. Critics point out that peacekeeping missions, as multi-national entities with competing interests, may struggle to ensure civilian protection due to lack of trained personnel and necessary assets. In the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), the U.N. peacekeeping mission, MONUSCO, supports Congolese military troops in counter-insurgency operations, despite concerns about the military's involvement in abuses, including sexual assault. Some argue that peacekeepers should stop supporting military operations due to ongoing abuses. Some argue that U.N. peacekeepers should cease support for military operations in the Democratic Republic of Congo due to ongoing abuses, including sexual assault. Limited data exists on sexual violence in African conflicts, raising questions about the effectiveness of programs and the need for better information to inform policy decisions and establish best practices. Budgeting funds for data collection and evaluation efforts is a matter of debate in sexual violence programs. Some critics argue that U.S. policy responses to sexual and gender-based violence lack strategic focus and coordination due to fragmented funding sources and lack of a lead agency. This results in limited collaboration and long-term planning in addressing sexual violence in African conflicts. Some humanitarian advocates suggest that U.S. resources should be directed towards multilateral efforts led by U.N. agencies in Africa for better coordination and expertise. Opponents argue that U.N. agencies may not always align with U.S. priorities and may lack efficiency compared to other implementers."
