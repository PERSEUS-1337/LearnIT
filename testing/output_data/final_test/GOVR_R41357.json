The Constitution provided for the apportionment of House seats based on population estimates, with each state guaranteed at least one Representative. The apportionment of House seats was a key issue for Congress since its inception in 1789. Questions arose about the ideal population per congressional district and the total number of Representatives in the House. The debate focused on how to handle fractional entitlements to Representatives, with states facing the dilemma of whether to be apportioned a whole number or a fraction of representatives. The debate over the apportionment of House seats focused on the ideal population per congressional district and the total number of Representatives in the House. The issue of fractional entitlement to Representatives was a key concern, leading to disparities among states' average congressional district populations. Congress enacted the \"equal proportions\" method in 1941 to address this issue. The \"equal proportions\" method was enacted in 1941 to address disparities in average congressional district populations. The report aims to summarize constitutional and statutory requirements for apportionment, explain the current formula, challenges, and the reasoning for choosing this method over alternatives. The House size is set at 435 by the Apportionment Act of 1941. The Apportionment Act of 1941 sets the House size at 435 and mandates apportionment every 10 years. The President must transmit state population data to Congress for seat allocation. The Census Bureau computes the apportionment results, which are then sent to governors by the Clerk of the House. Simple rounding is used for apportioning the House. Using simple rounding for apportioning the House can lead to issues with states having populations too small to be entitled to at least one seat, as required by the Constitution. The current apportionment method for the House of Representatives satisfies constitutional and statutory requirements, unlike simple rounding methods that may not ensure every state has at least one seat as mandated by the Constitution. The current apportionment method for the House of Representatives involves finding the \"ideal\" district size and adjusting the divisor to ensure 435 seats are allocated. This method uses the geometric mean for rounding instead of traditional rounding techniques. The apportionment method for the House of Representatives adjusts the \"ideal\" district size to ensure 435 seats are allocated. The process involves computing a \"priority\" list of state claims to each seat in the House. Walter F. Willcox, a mathematician, determined the rounding points used in the apportionment method. Walter F. Willcox, a mathematician, determined that rounding points can be used to rank states' claims to seats in the House based on their population. This method allows for easy adjustment of House size without extensive re-computations. The traditional method involves computing the reciprocals of geometric means between consecutive whole numbers to determine the rounding points. The method of using rounding points to rank states' claims to House seats based on population was developed by mathematician Walter F. Willcox. This method simplifies adjusting House size without extensive re-computations. Reciprocals of geometric means between consecutive whole numbers are computed to determine the rounding points, which are then used as multipliers to construct a \"priority list\" for each state. This allows for the allocation of up to 60 seats to each state. The House size is set at 30 Representatives, with the first seat for each state assigned by the Constitution. The remaining seats are apportioned using the equal proportions formula based on 2010 apportionment populations. Priority values are computed and ranked to allocate seats, allowing for adjustments in House size without additional calculations. Based on priority values, California is allocated the fourth seat in the hypothesized chamber, with the highest claim for its second seat. The fifth seat's allocation is then determined based on computed priority values for California, New York, and Florida. California is allocated its third seat in the hypothesized chamber based on priority values. New York is then allocated its second seat, followed by California receiving its fourth seat. Based on priority values, California, New York, and Florida are allocated seats in a hypothetical House with 30 members. California gets 11 seats, New York gets 10, and Florida gets 9. The allocation process is based on each state's priority value calculated from the 2010 Census data. The priority rankings for seat assignments in a House based on the 2010 Census are shown in the Appendix. The equal proportions rule of rounding at the geometric mean results in varying rounding points for different delegation sizes. Table 3 illustrates the rounding points for state delegation sizes up to 60, showing that larger fractions are needed as the delegation size increases to earn additional seats. The equal proportions formula for congressional apportionment has led to criticism that it favors small states over large states. A study by Balinski and Young suggested using the Webster method, also known as major fractions, to eliminate advantages for either small or large states. This recommendation contradicted a report by the National Academy of Sciences from 1929. The National Academy of Sciences (NAS) recommended the method of equal proportions for congressional apportionment in 1929. A bill proposing the Hamilton-Vinton method, which ranks fractional remainders, was introduced in 1981. This method would divide each state's population by the \"ideal\" district size to determine House seats. The method of congressional apportionment involves assigning each state at least one House seat, with remaining states receiving whole numbers and fractions of Representatives. The equal proportions and major fractions methods are compared, with the equal proportions method currently used. The choice between the two methods is a policy decision rather than a mathematical one. The method of congressional apportionment involves assigning each state at least one House seat, with remaining states receiving whole numbers and fractions of Representatives. The choice between the equal proportions and major fractions methods is a policy decision, with arguments for each method's fairness. In the major fractions method, each person's share of their Representative is as equal as possible on an absolute basis. For example, in 2010, North Carolina would have been assigned 14 seats and Rhode Island 1 seat under the major fractions method. The major fractions method of congressional apportionment aims to minimize the absolute difference in representation per million residents between states. In 2010, North Carolina would have received 1.4636 Representatives per million residents, while Rhode Island would have received 0.9476. This method results in a smaller absolute difference in representation compared to the equal proportions method. The major fractions method of congressional apportionment aims to minimize absolute size differences among districts, reflecting the \"one person, one vote\" principle. This method reduces the range between the smallest and largest district sizes more effectively than the method of equal proportions. In 1980, using major fractions would have resulted in a smaller average district size compared to equal proportions. In 1980, shifting from equal proportions to major fractions for congressional apportionment would have reduced the difference between the largest and smallest districts by 6,247 persons. The equal proportions method may favor small states over large states in seat assignments. The House has been reapportioned 21 times since 1790, with the equal proportions method used in five apportionments and the major fractions method in three. Computers can simulate reality using random numbers to test hypothetical situations like the \"Monte Carlo\" method. This is useful when experience is not enough to generalize about systems. Apportioning the House involves variables like size, state population, number of states, and apportionment method. A 1984 exercise by CRS simulated 1,000 apportionments, changing variables like method and state populations based on Census projections. The 1990 population projections were used to test different apportionment methods, with no clear pattern by state size in major fractions apportionment results. Equal proportions favored smaller states, while major fractions seemed unaffected by state size. Switching to major fractions could increase the odds of larger states gaining additional representation, as shown in a simulation model prepared for CRS. Switching from equal proportions to major fractions in apportionment could result in shifts in the number of seats allocated to states. The method of major fractions minimizes differences in representation between congressional districts and does not show a bias towards large or small states. The odds of larger states gaining an additional seat increase with major fractions, with shifts occurring from smaller states to larger states. The equal proportions method is supported by the belief that minimizing proportional differences among districts is crucial. Laurence Schmeckebier argued that relative differences are more important than absolute quantities, making equal proportions the most effective method for apportionment. The method of equal proportions is considered the most equitable for distributing Representatives among states, as it takes into account both average population per district and individual share in a representative. An example using North Carolina and Rhode Island 2010 populations illustrates the argument for proportional differences. Standardizing representation in the House as a number of Representatives per million residents, the equal proportions formula assigned 13 seats to North Carolina and 2 to Rhode Island in 2010. The equal proportions formula assigned 13 seats to North Carolina and 2 to Rhode Island in 2010. If the major fractions method had been used, then 14 seats would have been assigned to North Carolina, and 1 to Rhode Island. North Carolina had 1.4636 Representatives per million persons, while Rhode Island had 0.9476 Representatives per million. The absolute difference between them was 0.5160, with a proportional difference of 54.45%. Using major fractions, North Carolina would have had 1.3590 Representatives per million and Rhode Island 1.8953 Representatives per million, with an absolute difference of 0.5363 and a proportional difference of 39.46%. In 2010, the equal proportions formula assigned 13 seats to North Carolina and 2 to Rhode Island. Using major fractions would have resulted in 14 seats for North Carolina and 1 for Rhode Island. The courts' use of absolute difference measures in state redistricting cases may not be suitable for apportioning seats among states. The differences between redistricting in state legislatures and congressional districting are significant. The \"one person, one vote\" standard may be applied to apportion seats among states, where proportional difference measures could be considered. Equal proportions may meet representational goals, such as avoiding large districts. After the 2010 apportionment, five states with only one Representative have large land areas, representing 27% of the U.S. total land area. Switching from equal proportions to major fractions in apportionment following the 2010 Census may increase the number of states represented by only one member of Congress. The table shows the priority listing used in apportionment, indicating where each state ranked in seat assignments. The priority values beyond seat number 435 indicate which states would have gained additional representations if the House size had been increased."
