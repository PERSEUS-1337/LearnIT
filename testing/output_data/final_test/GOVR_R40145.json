    "content": "EPA regulatory actions to limit greenhouse gas emissions under the Clean Air Act have sparked congressional debate. Members express concerns about economic impacts and lack of direct authorization. The Administration argues that the Clean Air Act mandates action on GHG emissions. The 111th Congress struggled to address climate change, passing H.R. 2454 in 2009. The House passed H.R. 2454 in 2009, a bill addressing energy and climate change issues, including cap-and-trade programs for GHG emissions. The Senate did not act on similar bills, leading to negotiations for a new climate bill that ultimately did not materialize. Talks of a slimmed-down bill focusing on energy and electric utilities also did not come to fruition. The EPA and a bipartisan group of Senators considered addressing sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and mercury emissions from power plants. Regulations were vacated in 2008, creating gaps in EPA and state regulations. New regulations are being developed to address court concerns. Legislation like S. 2995 was introduced but no further action was taken. The Obama Administration's EPA is reconsidering Bush Administration decisions on air quality standards. The EPA proposed stricter national ambient air quality standards for ozone and sulfur dioxide in 2010. The revisions could impact hundreds of counties with ozone monitors. The agency is also reviewing standards for other pollutants like particulates. The EPA is reviewing standards for various pollutants, including particulates, with a revised standard expected by February 2011. The agency's actions to regulate greenhouse gas emissions have been influenced by petitions and litigation. In April 2007, the Supreme Court ruled in Massachusetts v. EPA that the EPA has the authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions as air pollutants under the Clean Air Act. As a result, the EPA finalized an endangerment finding for greenhouse gas emissions from motor vehicles in December 2009 and established emission standards for new cars and light trucks in April 2010. The EPA promulgated GHG emission standards for new cars and light trucks on April 1, 2010, triggering permitting requirements and the imposition of Best Available Control Technology for new major stationary sources of GHGs starting in 2011. President Obama announced an agreement involving auto manufacturers, government agencies, and environmental groups for the implementation of GHG standards for motor vehicles. The EPA and NHTSA are working on joint rulemaking to reduce GHG emissions from new motor vehicles under the Clean Air Act. The objective is to align with California's standards for a 30% reduction in emissions by 2016. The auto industry supports the national agreement to avoid state-by-state standards. EPA has also received petitions to regulate GHGs from other sources. The EPA has received petitions to regulate greenhouse gases (GHGs) from various sources such as coal mines, concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs), aircraft, ships, nonroad engines and equipment, and fuels. Lawsuits are also pushing for GHG regulation from stationary sources like power plants and petroleum refineries. The decision to set GHG standards for new motor vehicles is seen as a precedent for regulating other sources, triggering GHG permit requirements. The adoption of GHG standards for motor vehicles will lead to GHG permit requirements for new stationary sources, such as power plants and manufacturing facilities. This has raised concerns in Congress, leading to the introduction of legislation aimed at preventing the EPA from implementing these requirements. Legislation includes resolutions of disapproval and bills to reevaluate the endangerment finding. Legislation has been introduced to limit EPA's authority on greenhouse gases, including resolutions of disapproval and bills to reevaluate the endangerment finding. Despite receiving attention, the path to enacting these measures is challenging. EPA has delayed requirements for stationary sources of GHGs until 2011 and is focusing on regulating the largest emitters first. The Obama Administration is committed to reducing GHG emissions. The Obama Administration aims to reduce GHG emissions, making legislation limiting EPA's authority on GHGs difficult to pass. One approach discussed was amending the EPA appropriation bill to restrict its authority. Senator Murkowski introduced a potential amendment in 2009 but did not offer it. Congress has various options to address EPA's GHG authority, with opponents likely to continue pushing for limitations. The House passed the American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009, addressing energy and climate change issues. The Senate also reported bills to establish a cap-and-trade system to address greenhouse gas emissions. Opponents may continue to pressure to delay or limit EPA's actions. The Kerry-Boxer bill, S. 1733, aimed to establish a cap-and-trade system to address climate change but faced strong opposition. Republican members boycotted the markup, leading to a lack of support for the bill. Negotiations for a bipartisan alternative involving Senators Kerry, Graham, and Lieberman took place, but the legislation was not introduced. Greenhouse gas emissions were a top priority for the congressional leadership and the Obama Administration in the 111th Congress. The House bill in the 111th Congress aimed to amend the Clean Air Act by establishing a cap-and-trade program to limit greenhouse gas emissions. The program would gradually reduce emissions from covered sources, along with requirements for renewable energy, energy efficiency, carbon capture, and sequestration. EPA would set GHG emission standards for various sources. The House bill in the 111th Congress aimed to establish a cap-and-trade program to limit greenhouse gas emissions, with EPA setting emission standards for various sources. The program distributed emission allowances to different sectors, considered impacts on low-income households, protected industries from import competition, and encouraged the use of offsets. The bill addressed key issues such as the relationship with the Clean Air Act, focus on sectors or the economy as a whole, and the effectiveness of a cap-and-trade system. The Waxman-Markey bill in the 111th Congress aimed to establish an economy-wide cap-and-trade system, addressing key issues such as allowance distribution, price volatility, impacts on industries, role of carbon taxes, and potential preemption of state programs. The Waxman-Markey bill in the 111th Congress proposed an economy-wide cap-and-trade system to reduce GHG emissions in key sectors like electric utilities, cars, and buildings. It aimed to set energy efficiency and renewable energy requirements while amending the Clean Air Act to regulate specific emission sources. The bill did not include a carbon tax and would have preempted state and regional cap-and-trade systems from 2012-2017. The House bill proposed an economy-wide cap-and-trade program to reduce GHG emissions, with decreasing caps for major emission sources over time. Companies could reduce emissions or buy allowances/offsets. The bill proposed a cap-and-trade system to reduce GHG emissions and included standards for specific sources of emissions, such as CO2 removal from new coal-fired power plants. EPA would set performance standards for CO2 removal, regulate geologic sequestration sites, and develop a certification process. The bill proposed setting emissions reduction standards for heavy-duty motor vehicles and engines by 2010, nonroad vehicles by 2012, and existing major sources of GHGs within three years. It also included measures to address black carbon emissions and establish a cap-and-trade program for hydrofluorocarbons. The bill proposed setting emissions reduction standards for heavy-duty motor vehicles and engines by 2010, nonroad vehicles by 2012, and existing major sources of GHGs within three years. It also included measures to address black carbon emissions and establish a cap-and-trade program for hydrofluorocarbons, which have a high global warming potential compared to CO2. The bill aimed to cap HFC production and imports at 90% of baseline levels in 2012, decreasing annually until reaching 15% of the baseline in 2033. The EPA's authority to control GHG emissions was a controversial aspect of the bill, with the Obama Administration emphasizing the use of existing Clean Air Act authority to address GHG emissions. The EPA proposed and finalized an \"endangerment finding\" under the Clean Air Act, allowing for GHG emission standards for motor vehicles. The agency also set GHG emission standards for medium- and heavy-duty trucks and engines. Additionally, there are pending petitions to regulate GHG emissions from various sources like coal mines, CAFOs, ships, non-road engines, aircraft, and fuels, which could lead to further agency action. The EPA faces petitions to set National Ambient Air Quality Standards for specific greenhouse gases and lawsuits to regulate GHGs from stationary sources. Decisions on motor vehicle standards may impact other regulatory actions and pending litigation. Concerns during the Bush Administration led to H.R. 2454, which aimed to restrict EPA's ability to set GHG standards solely based on global climate change effects. The EPA faced challenges regarding regulating greenhouse gases from stationary sources. H.R. 2454 aimed to limit EPA's authority to regulate GHGs based on global climate change effects, including restrictions on various regulatory provisions. EPA has taken steps to limit the applicability of certain provisions, but advocates questioned the necessity of their removal. The Waxman-Markey bill sparked controversy over the treatment of agricultural emissions, excluding them from the emissions cap and allowing them to be used as offsets. Industrial and electric utility sectors were also affected by the bill's provisions. The Waxman-Markey bill allowed for up to 1 billion offset credits annually from domestic sources. Industrial and electric utility emitters could purchase offsets if it was cheaper than controlling their own emissions. Agriculture and forestry could earn significant revenue from reducing GHG emissions, with estimates ranging from $3.7 billion to $7.8 billion annually. The bill's agriculture provisions garnered support from the agricultural community but raised concerns among those advocating for a stricter bill. The bill delegated authority over the offset program to the Department of Agriculture instead of the EPA, allowing for up to 1.5 billion international offset credits annually. Supporters saw it as a cost-effective way to reduce emissions, while opponents viewed it as a giveaway to countries not meeting reduction requirements. In the climate debate, concerns about GHG emissions cap effects on U.S. industry competitiveness include potential carbon leakage. Proposed solutions include supporting domestic industries, imposing duties on imports, and establishing sectoral approaches. H.R. 2454 would have provided free allowances to energy-intensive industries until 2025. The bill H.R. 2454 would have given free allowances to energy-intensive industries until 2025, with rebates phased out over a 10-year period. The President expressed concern over establishing international reserve allowance requirements for imports of energy-intensive goods from countries with less stringent GHG emission reductions. Some states have already initiated programs to reduce GHG emissions. States have clear authority to regulate emissions from various sources of greenhouse gases, such as power plants and buildings. The Waxman-Markey bill would have preserved states' authority to set standards for stationary sources, except for preempting state and regional cap-and-trade programs from 2012 to 2017. The bill would have preserved EPA's authority to grant waivers to California for mobile source GHG standards. The House debated the prospective cost of the bill, with uncertainty about long-term cost projections due to the complexity of predicting the macroeconomic costs of a GHG reduction program over four decades. Opponents and proponents cited estimates of the bill's impact in the House debate. The House debated the costs of a bill related to cap-and-trade proposals. Opponents claimed it could cost families up to $3,100 annually, while EPA estimated it to be $80 to $111 per family per year. The bill would have allowed the use of 2 billion offsets. The House bill related to cap-and-trade proposals would have allowed the use of 2 billion offsets annually. Questions were raised about the availability of offsets and the impact on the federal deficit. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that enacting the legislation would reduce future budget deficits. The bill would have significant effects on various sectors of the economy, creating winners and losers. Cap-and-trade programs have been successful in the past, with the Clean Air Act's acid rain program serving as a notable example. The program imposed emission caps on power plants, leading to significant emission reductions at low cost and high compliance rates. Lobbying efforts from affected industries and regions have been intense, as they try to shape legislation to their advantage. The reduction targets in the implemented trading program were easily met due to an abundant supply of cheap low-sulfur coal. With only about 1,000 entities covered by the program, monitoring and administration were simple and inexpensive. Most regulated entities were given 10 years to achieve compliance, resulting in early reductions generating extra allowances that facilitated the trading system. However, other trading programs like Southern California's RECLAIM saw challenges, such as a 50-fold increase in NOx allowance prices during the 2000-2001 California energy crisis. Utilities were eventually removed from the RECLAIM system and charged a flat fee for excess emissions to ensure continued functioning. The European GHG trading system (EU-ETS) faced challenges with wild swings in short-term allowance prices during its start-up years, making planning difficult. The House bill's GHG cap-and-trade system aimed to address previous system problems by implementing mechanisms to control allowance prices and ensure cost control. The EPA is addressing clean air issues, including emissions from coal-fired power plants, through various mechanisms such as unlimited banking of allowances, strategic auctions, and generous limits on offsets. Coal-fired power plants are major sources of air pollution in the US, but their emissions control requirements vary under the Clean Air Act. Power plants, particularly older ones built before the Clean Air Act of 1970, have limited emission control equipment, leading to significant pollution. Compliance with EPA regulations is complex due to multiple Clean Air Act programs, and the cost of implementing controls could be in the tens of billions of dollars. Utilities have successfully lobbied to limit or delay regulations, resulting in power plants being a major source of sulfur dioxide and mercury emissions in the US. Power plants are major sources of sulfur dioxide, mercury, nitrogen oxides, fine particles, and carbon dioxide emissions in the U.S. New air quality standards require reductions in NOx and SO2 emissions. Mercury pollution has led to fish consumption advisories in 48 states, affecting millions of acres of water bodies. The controversy over New Source Review requirements for power plants has led to calls for comprehensive legislation addressing power plant pollution. This legislation would set national or regional caps on emissions, similar to the acid rain program, and may include carbon dioxide emissions. The Senate and House have considered multi-pollutant bills to address emissions, but none have progressed. EPA announced plans to regulate utility emissions of SO2 and NOx using Clean Air Act authority. The Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR) established cap-and-trade provisions for SO2 and NOx in 28 eastern states and the District of Columbia, with projected emissions reductions by 2015. The Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR) projected significant reductions in SO2 and NOx emissions by 2015, leading to $85-$100 billion in health benefits annually, including the prevention of 17,000 premature deaths. Despite broad support, the rule was challenged in court and vacated on July 11, 2008 due to concerns about its effectiveness in addressing pollution from upwind sources. The court found flaws in the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR), stating that the methodology for establishing emission budgets was unrelated to the contribution of power plants to nonattainment of standards. The court also criticized the choice of 2015 for compliance deadlines and deemed the fuel adjustment factors in the rule arbitrary and capricious. Despite calls for review, the court's decision stood. The court modified its decision on CAIR, allowing it to remain in effect until EPA promulgates a new rule. The court did not specify a timeline for this process but emphasized that EPA must address CAIR's fundamental flaws. The vacatur of CAIR would impact the Bush Administration's clean air approach. EPA projected CAIR to help nonattainment areas meet air quality standards. The EPA requested the court to reconsider its decision on CAIR, which led to a delay in issuing the mandate. There is a consensus among states, electric utilities, and environmental groups that a program like CAIR should be preserved. Without CAIR, eastern states would have gaps in their emission control programs, requiring other regulatory measures to meet air quality standards. The Clean Air Transport Rule (CATR) was proposed by the EPA as a replacement for CAIR on July 6, 2010. CATR would maintain the Phase 1 limits of CAIR, which aimed to help states meet the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) and avoid sanctions. Utilities had already invested in equipment to comply with CAIR, and environmental groups generally supported the approach, although they advocated for a stronger second phase in 2015. The Clean Air Transport Rule (CATR) would maintain CAIR Phase 1 limits and introduce new limits in 2012 and 2014, earlier than CAIR's schedule. Emissions of SO2 and NOx have already decreased significantly under Phase 1. The proposed transport rule aims for further reductions, particularly in SO2 emissions, with a projected decline to 3.8 million tons in 2014. The proposed Clean Air Transport Rule (CATR) would cover 31 states and the District of Columbia, with new limits set for 2012 and 2014. The rule allows unlimited trading of allowances within states but limits interstate trading. EPA proposed a Federal Implementation Plan (FIP) for each state to control emissions from power plants, estimating a cost of $2.8 billion annually in 2014. The EPA expects benefits of $120 billion to $290 billion annually from the Clean Air Transport Rule, with 14,000 to 36,000 fewer premature deaths. Ohio, Pennsylvania, and New York would benefit the most. The agency plans to propose another transport rule in 2011 to address emission reductions needed to meet new air quality standards. Additional transport rules might be expected with revisions of the PM 2.5 standard in 2011. Air pollution control agencies, represented by the National Association of Clean Air Agencies (NACAA), argue that further reductions in NOx emissions are necessary to meet new ozone standards. The Phase 1 cap for NOx is 45% below baseline, with an additional 7% reduction in Phase 2. EPA modeling shows that a significant number of coal-fired electric generating units lack the best available NOx control technology. If states fail to meet the new ozone NAAQS, pressure will mount on EPA to strengthen regulations, potentially leading to legal challenges. Several multi-pollutant bills over the past decade aimed to address emissions from power plants through a cap-and-trade system, including controls on SO2, NOx, mercury, and CO2. Senators Carper and Alexander introduced S. 2995 in 2010 to address issues from the CAIR decision and set standards for power plant mercury emissions. The bill proposed establishing a cap-and-trade system. The bill introduced by Senators Carper and Alexander in 2010 aims to set stricter standards for power plant emissions, including cap-and-trade systems for SO2 and NOx. The proposed caps for SO2 and NOx are more stringent than previous regulations, with the potential for further reductions in the future. Additionally, the bill would cover more states and establish a NOx cap for the first time in the rest of the lower 48 states. The 2010 bill introduced by Senators Carper and Alexander aims to set stricter standards for power plant emissions, including cap-and-trade systems for SO2 and NOx. There was general support for S. 2995 at a Senate hearing on March 4, 2010, but concerns were raised about the reductions not being sufficient to bring Eastern states into attainment of the ozone NAAQS. The regulation of mercury emissions from coal-fired power plants has a complex legislative and regulatory history dating back to the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments. EPA was required to determine the regulation of mercury under Section 112 of the Clean Air Act. EPA concluded in a December 2000 regulatory finding that regulation of mercury emissions was necessary. In December 2000, EPA determined that regulating mercury emissions from power plants was necessary. This led to the establishment of the Clean Air Mercury Rule (CAMR), a national cap-and-trade system for power plant emissions of mercury. The final cap aimed for a 70% reduction in emissions by 2018, with an intermediate cap set for 2010. EPA reversed its decision to promulgate MACT standards and opted for the cap-and-trade system instead. The Clean Air Mercury Rule (CAMR) aimed for a 70% reduction in power plant emissions by 2018, with an intermediate cap set for 2010. Utilities could control pollutants or buy excess allowances. Early reductions could be banked for later use, leading to delays in full compliance until after 2025. EPA projected emissions to be 24.3 tons by 2020, less than a 50% reduction. The CAMR rule, aiming for a 70% reduction in power plant emissions by 2018, was challenged and vacated by the D.C. Circuit due to the EPA's failure to proceed with MACT regulations for electric generating units (EGUs) listed as a source of hazardous air pollutants. Delisting the EGU source category would have required proving no adverse health or environmental effects, a difficult task given their significant contribution to mercury emissions. The court found EPA's approach to controlling mercury emissions unlawful, criticizing the agency for not complying with statutory criteria. Critics also opposed the cap-and-trade system, arguing it would not address \"hot spots\" with high mercury concentrations. Many argued for stricter mercury regulations than the cap-and-trade system proposed by EPA. States have implemented requirements stricter than the federal program, with some demanding 80% to 90% mercury reductions by 2010. The D.C. Circuit's ruling stated that EPA must impose MACT standards on individual plants if it does not delist the power plant category, preventing the establishment of a cap-and-trade program for mercury emissions. The agency could have appealed the court's decision but instead petitioned for certiorari to the Supreme Court under the Bush Administration in 2008. The Obama Administration withdrew the petition for certiorari to the Supreme Court in February 2009 and announced plans to proceed with developing MACT standards. Proposed standards are expected by March 2011, with final standards to be promulgated in November of that year. New coal-fired electric generating units and modifications of existing units will need permits under the \"MACT hammer\" provision until new regulations are established. The Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) identified 32 new coal-fired power plants that must adopt MACT mercury controls. The debate over power plant emissions regulation includes concerns about EPA's enforcement of existing regulations like New Source Review (NSR). EPA has taken legal action against utilities for NSR violations, with the Bush and Obama Administrations settling many lawsuits. The Bush Administration proposed changes to NSR regulations that critics argued would weaken or eliminate the review process. The controversy over NSR regulations stems from EPA's use to require best available pollution controls on existing sources undergoing modifications. Industry often avoids NSR by claiming changes are routine maintenance. EPA and DOJ have filed suits against electric utilities and industries for NSR violations since late 1999. Since late 1999, EPA and the Department of Justice have taken legal action against numerous large sources of pollution for violating New Source Review regulations. Utilities and petroleum refiners have settled with the EPA, agreeing to spend $10 billion on pollution controls and reducing emissions by 1.65 million tons annually. Refiners have also settled potential NSR violation charges by paying fines and eliminating 337,000 tons of pollution. The Clinton Administration has taken legal action against companies for violating New Source Review regulations, resulting in settlements totaling $10 billion for pollution controls. Ohio Edison and Duke Energy were found to have violated the Clean Air Act, with Ohio Edison agreeing to spend $1.1 billion on controls to reduce pollution by 212,000 tons annually. Duke Energy lost an appeal to the Supreme Court regarding EPA's consideration of emissions rates in NSR enforcement. The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that a company did not need to undergo NSR and install stricter pollution controls because the maximum hourly emissions rate did not increase, even though annual emissions did. The Supreme Court overturned this decision, stating that an increase in actual annual emissions was the measure for requiring a permit. The Bush Administration made changes to NSR regulations to make enforcement less likely, including defining routine maintenance to exempt industrial facilities from NSR. The EPA's attempt to change NSR regulations by exempting industrial facilities from installing new emission controls based on cost was struck down by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. Further proposed changes to NSR regulations have not been fully implemented. The EPA's attempt to change NSR regulations by exempting industrial facilities from installing new emission controls based on cost was struck down by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. Under the October 2005 proposal, power plants could have modified existing facilities without triggering NSR, provided that the facility's \"maximum hourly emissions achievable\" after the changes were no greater than the same measure at any point during the past five years. The new rule would have effectively allowed increases in annual emissions without an NSR permit, if a modification led to an increase in the hours of operation of a facility. The agency's proposal stated that this change would establish a uniform national emissions test, in conformance with the Fourth Circuit's decision in the Duke Energy case. The NSR program has faced challenges with the Fourth Circuit decision being overturned by the Supreme Court and the CAIR reduction requirements being vacated by the D.C. Circuit. The National Academy of Sciences conducted a review of the NSR program in response to Congress's direction. The interim report in January 2005 highlighted the stringency of NSR emission limits for new sources. The final report in July 2006 was ambivalent but noted that over 60% of coal-fired electricity generation capacity is affected by NSR regulations. More than 60% of coal-fired electricity generation capacity in the US lacks controls for SO2 and NOx emissions required under NSR. Older facilities are more likely to be affected by NSR rule changes. A report by the National Academy of Public Administration recommended ending grandfathering of major air emission sources and installing control equipment for all major sources without NSR permits since 1977. The NAPA panel recommended enforcing NSR rules for existing facilities and considering multi-pollutant legislation to address air quality issues. Despite improvements since the Clean Air Act, clean air goals are still not met in many areas. Legislation on emissions from utilities competes with climate change cap-and-trade laws. The EPA has tightened standards for air pollution due to scientific understanding of health effects, with ozone and fine particles being the most widespread problems. Millions of people live in areas not meeting air quality standards, leading to premature deaths and lost work days. Recent research links ozone pollution to premature mortality as well. EPA is reviewing health effects of other pollutants, indicating they are more serious than previously thought. The EPA has tightened air pollution standards due to health concerns, with reviews showing more serious effects than previously thought. Strengthening the sulfur dioxide standard could prevent thousands of premature deaths annually. Recent efforts include revising standards for ozone, PM, lead, NO2, and SO2, with some standards being challenged in court. EPA is also reviewing carbon monoxide and other pollutants for potential revisions. Court challenges have played a key role in prompting reviews of the NAAQS for carbon monoxide and other pollutants. EPA is required to review the standards every five years, with citizen suits addressing any failures to do so. Judicial review has led to the remand of standards for particulate matter and ozone, prompting further revisions by EPA in 2010 and 2011. In 2010 and 2011, EPA's revised standards were remanded because the agency did not follow the advice of its independent science advisors, CASAC. While not required by statute to follow CASAC's recommendations, the failure to do so raises questions about the Administrator's decision being judged arbitrary and capricious in a judicial review. CASAC made detailed objections to the Administrator's final decisions in the recent revisions of both the ozone and PM standards. CASAC raised objections to the Administrator's final decisions on ozone and PM standards, highlighting failures to meet statutory and procedural requirements. This led to questions about strengthening CASAC's role in the review process or limiting the Administrator's authority. EPA found the monitoring network inadequate for determining compliance with standards, with some networks dismantled before reviews, impacting lead and sulfur dioxide assessments. Monitoring for PM and NO2 was also insufficient for measuring exposure levels. The EPA and states need to expand and refocus monitoring networks to identify areas with poor air quality that do not meet new standards. The impact of revised NAAQS standards will lead to billions of dollars in pollution control expenditures, but the changes will be gradual. NAAQS do not directly limit emissions but set levels of ambient pollution for public health and welfare protection. The promulgation of National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) initiates a process where states and the EPA identify nonattainment areas and implement plans to improve air quality. States have three years to submit State Implementation Plans (SIPs) to bring nonattainment areas into compliance with the standards. More stringent NAAQS may result in stronger federal emission controls in addition to state and local regulations. The implementation of National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) may require stronger federal emission controls in addition to state and local regulations, as some pollutants have impacts across state lines and may require measures beyond individual state boundaries to attain the standards. Congress has granted EPA the authority to enhance emission standards, but may still review the implementation of that authority."
