    "content": "The Hazardous Waste Electronic Manifest Establishment Act, also known as the Hazardous Waste Electronic Manifest System, introduces definitions for terms like Board and Fund, and outlines the entities covered under the Act. The Hazardous Waste Electronic Manifest System defines terms like system, user, and entities covered under the Act, including generators, transporters, and facility operators. The Hazardous Waste Electronic Manifest System will establish an electronic manifest format for users, with the Administrator setting regulations for paper submissions. User fees may be imposed to cover system costs, including processing data from paper manifests. The Hazardous Waste Electronic Manifest System will collect fees in advance to cover system-related services and deposit them in the Fund. The fee structure will be determined by the Administrator in consultation with IT vendors to recover the full cost of providing services. The Hazardous Waste Electronic Manifest System will collect fees to cover various costs such as materials, contracting, IT, project management, and personnel expenses. The Administrator, in consultation with the Board, can adjust the fee amount as needed. The Hazardous Waste Electronic Manifest System will collect fees to cover system-related costs, including upgrades, while minimizing unused amounts in the Fund. An exception allows for fees to accumulate up to $2,000,000 in the Fund during the initial 3-year period of operation. Adjustments to service fees will be made as needed. The service fee may be reduced once initial development costs are recovered by the Administrator. Adjustments will also be made periodically based on annual accounting reports showing disparities between funds collected and expenditures for system-related services. Fees collected under this section are only available for use as specified in appropriations Acts. A revolving fund called the 'Hazardous Waste Electronic Manifest System Fund' is established in the Treasury, with funds deposited from subsection (c)(2)(B). The Secretary of the Treasury can transfer funds from this Fund to the Administrator for system development, operation, maintenance, and upgrades, subject to appropriations Acts. The Administrator can use fees collected for the system without fiscal year limitation. Oversight is required to ensure funds are used for system goals. The Administrator must submit accounting reports every 2 fiscal years to relevant committees. The Administrator must report fees collected and disbursed from the Fund to relevant committees every 2 fiscal years. The Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990 and the Government Management Reform Act of 1994, along with their amendments, are important legislative acts that the Administrator must adhere to. The Fund's actual expenditures must be accounted for in the report, with auditing conducted as per relevant sections of the United States Code to ensure financial transparency and accountability. The Inspector General of the Environmental Protection Agency will audit the fees, fee structure, system usage, and success of the waste tracking system. The Inspector General will conduct an annual audit and submit a report to the Administrator describing findings and recommendations. The Administrator may enter into information technology contracts with contractors for system-related services, with a contract term not exceeding 10 years. Contracts should be performance-based, identify objective outcomes, and include performance standards to measure achievement and evaluate success. The contractor's success under the contract is evaluated based on achieving goals, including developing a hazardous waste electronic manifest system that meets user needs, attracts user participation, reduces administrative burden, and provides waste receipt data for biennial reports. Payment structure for contracts awarded under this system is also specified. The contract awarded under this subsection includes a payment structure specifying the service fee and fixed-share ratio for reimbursement of system-related costs. The Administrator can cancel or terminate the contract if sufficient funds are not available in the following fiscal year. Amounts payable upon cancellation or termination can be negotiated. The contract awarded under this subsection includes a payment structure specifying the service fee and fixed-share ratio for reimbursement of system-related costs. The event of cancellation or termination of a contract shall be negotiated with the contractor at the time of award. Regardless of the contract, the system shall be owned by the Federal Government. A Hazardous Waste Electronic Manifest System Advisory Board will be established within 3 years, composed of 9 members appointed by the Administrator. The Hazardous Waste Electronic Manifest System Advisory Board will consist of 8 members appointed by the Administrator, with expertise in information technology, experience in using the manifest system, and State representatives. The Board will meet annually to evaluate the system and provide recommendations to the Administrator. Regulations for the system must be promulgated within 1 year of enactment. After consulting with the Secretary of Transportation, the Administrator will issue regulations for the transition from paper to electronic manifests, including requirements for submitting paper manifest copies for data processing. The regulations will ensure that electronic manifests provide the same information as paper manifests. The regulations for transitioning from paper to electronic manifests ensure that electronic manifests provide legal accountability for tracking and maintaining information. The person certifies information in the manifest accurately described and acknowledges receipt of the manifest. The regulations require state access to electronic manifests, publicly available information, and paper printouts. Regulations will take effect in each state as specified. The Administrator will enforce regulations unless the state program is fully authorized. Compliance is required in states where waste is generated. The designated facility receiving waste must complete the facility portion of the hazardous waste manifest, sign and date the facility certification, and submit a final copy for data processing. $2,000,000 is authorized for start-up activities from 2013 to 2015, offset by user fees. Conforming Amendment to the Solid Waste Disposal Act includes adding a new item to the table of contents for subtitle C. Sec. 3024 establishes the Hazardous Waste Electronic Manifest System."
