    "content": "The \"Genetically Engineered Food Right-to-Know Act\" is the short title of this legislation. It includes findings related to genetically engineered foods. Congress finds that in 1999, a significant portion of crops in the United States were genetically engineered, resulting in material changes to the foods. The health and environmental effects of genetically engineered foods are still unknown, and individuals have the right to know if their food contains genetically engineered material, similar to the labeling requirements for artificial colors, flavors, preservatives, and sweeteners. Requiring labeling of genetically engineered food would increase consumer knowledge and control over consumption. Genetically engineered material can be detected in food at levels as low as 0.1 percent. Labeling for genetically engineered material is required under the amendments to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act now requires labeling for products containing genetically engineered materials. The label must include the notice \"GENETICALLY ENGINEERED\" and disclose if the product contains or was produced with genetically engineered materials. The notice required for food labeling must be clearly legible and conspicuous. This requirement does not apply to food served in restaurants, medical food, or food grown on trees planted before the Genetically Engineered Food Right-to-Know Act. The Genetically Engineered Food Right-to-Know Act defines genetically engineered material as derived from a genetically engineered organism, regardless of detectable alterations. Genetically engineered organism refers to organisms altered at the molecular or cellular level through techniques not possible under natural conditions. The Genetically Engineered Food Right-to-Know Act defines genetically engineered material as derived from an organism altered at the molecular or cellular level through techniques not possible under natural conditions, including deletion, doubling, introduction of a foreign gene, and changes in gene positions. Organisms produced with genetically engineered material involve altered molecular or cellular characteristics. The Genetically Engineered Food Right-to-Know Act defines genetically engineered material as derived from an organism altered at the molecular or cellular level through techniques not possible under natural conditions. The act also specifies that no person shall be subject to penalties for a violation related to genetically engineered material in food. The Genetically Engineered Food Right-to-Know Act exempts recipients from penalties for misbranded food if they provide a guaranty that the food does not contain genetically engineered material. The penalties for misbranded food apply regardless of how the recipient uses the food, and no one can avoid responsibility for violations by entering into agreements. The terms 'genetically engineered material' and 'produced with a genetically engineered material' are defined in the paragraph. The amendment to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act addresses false guaranty and unintended contamination of food, specifically focusing on violations involving misbranded food within the meaning of section 403(t). Agricultural producers are exempt from penalties if the violation occurs due to food that is grown without genetically engineered material. The amendment to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act addresses penalties for violations involving misbranded food with genetically engineered material. Agricultural producers are exempt if contamination is unintentional and not due to negligence. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act imposes civil penalties of up to $1,000 for violations related to misbranded food with genetically engineered material. The penalties are subject to specific provisions outlined in subsection (g). SEC. 4. GRANTS FOR RESEARCH ON GENETICALLY ENGINEERED FOOD. This section amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to include grants for research on genetically engineered food. The Secretary may grant funds for research on public health and environmental risks of genetically engineered materials in food, including allergenicity, toxicity, cross-pollination, and ecosystem impacts. $5,000,000 is authorized for fiscal year 2001 for this purpose. $5,000,000 authorized for fiscal year 2001 for research on public health and environmental risks of genetically engineered materials in food. Appropriated funds shall remain available without fiscal year limitation. Definitions of genetically engineered material and produced with a genetically engineered material are provided. SEC. 5. CONFORMING AMENDMENTS. Section 1(n) of Public Law 90-201 is amended to include genetically engineered materials without proper labeling or subject to false guaranty, under the terms of section 303(d) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Section 4(h) of Public Law 85-172 is amended to include genetically engineered materials without proper labeling under section 403(t) of the Act. The text discusses the penalties and remedies for products that violate section 403(t) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The Act and its amendments will become effective 180 days after enactment."
