    "content": "The House and Senate restaurant systems have been serving Members of Congress, employees, constituents, and visitors since the early 1800s. These facilities help facilitate the legislative work of Congress by meeting dining needs during unpredictable workdays. The House restaurants have been operated by a private vendor since 1994, with oversight from the House. The House restaurants are operated by a private vendor overseen by the House. The Committee on House Administration delegates oversight to the Chief Administrative Officer. Sodexo Government Services became the new food service provider in 2015 under a four-year contract with potential extensions. A survey of food service needs was conducted in 2013 to inform the vendor selection process. The CAO issued an RFP for vendors to run House restaurants with no financial responsibility for the House. The selected contractor would pay a monthly commission based on gross receipts. Changes included allowing catered events in the Members' dining room during late votes and implementing three-tier pricing strategies. The CAO issued an RFP for vendors to run House restaurants with no financial responsibility for the House. The selected contractor would pay a monthly commission based on gross receipts and implement three-tier pricing strategies (value, standard, and premium) for all areas except vending. Price increases were prohibited for the first two years, and vendors had to introduce two branded eatery concepts. Catering requirements were detailed, including executing events with short notice and conducting annual focus groups for customer satisfaction. The panel evaluating vendor proposals included individuals from outside the CAO's office and a staff member from a Member office. Sodexo, the new vendor for House dining services, began its responsibilities on August 7, 2015. They introduced renovations and changes, including SoGo Cards for staff payments. Currently, Sodexo operates 10 dining areas, carryouts, catering services, and vending machines in the House of Representatives and House office buildings. The House cafeterias offer SoGo Cards for staff payments, which can be reloaded online and offer a reward program. All major credit and debit cards are accepted, along with Apple Pay and Google Pay. Pop-up lunch options in the O'Neill House Office Building lobby feature local restaurant foods. Sodexo made changes to House dining operations, including replacing a la carte service with a buffet in the Members' dining room. The House cafeterias offer SoGo Cards for staff payments and accept major credit cards. Sodexo made changes to House dining operations, including introducing an online preordering system and replacing some eateries with popular branded restaurant concepts. Concerns about food quality, high prices, and poor service were expressed during the House of Representatives FY2018 budget hearing. A quality assurance surveillance team was created to appraise contractor performance, leading to improvements in food quality and changes in restaurant management personnel. Several branded restaurant concepts have been introduced to the House dining facilities, with pop-up restaurants featured weekly in the Longworth cafeteria. A food service survey in 2018 showed a desire for cafeteria and branded food options, leading to the addition of more branded concepts. New additions include Dunkin' Donuts/Baskin Robbins, Subway, &pizza, Au Bon Pain, and Steak 'n Shake in various House office buildings. The House introduced branded restaurant concepts in 2019, including &pizza in Rayburn, Au Bon Pain in Cannon, and Steak 'n Shake in Rayburn. The CAO was directed to explore a \"branded option concept\" for the Members' dining room. Senate food services have been provided by a private contractor since 2008, with Restaurant Associates selected under a new seven-year contract. Under a new seven-year contract signed in 2015, Restaurant Associates, part of Compass Group, provides Senate restaurant services. A 2016 Department of Labor investigation revealed wage-related infractions that could lead to contract renegotiations before 2022. Additional food vendors may be subcontracted for some services, such as kosher meals provided by Bubbie's Gourmet in 2012. Cups & Company, a local family-owned coffee shop and cafe, operates independently in the Russell Senate Office Building. The Senate Restaurant System includes 12 dining areas and carryouts, along with additional vending areas. The Senate Restaurant System, operated by Restaurant Associates, provides dining areas and catering services. Issues affecting the restaurants are unique to each chamber, but some challenges are common to both. Current issues facing congressional restaurants are similar to past challenges. The House and Senate restaurants have historically faced financial challenges due to operating practices reflecting Congress' needs over profitability. Despite more dining options in Capitol Hill, the congressional dining facilities remain convenient for Members, staff, and visitors. Operating hours are a key factor in the restaurants' operations. The House and Senate restaurants face financial challenges due to operating hours and labor costs. Congressional management and legislative measures have impacted their finances. Some dining establishments are more profitable than others. The House and Senate restaurant system faces financial challenges due to various factors such as operating hours, labor costs, and different types of establishments. The financial situation is complex and obtaining a complete picture of the system's finances has always been difficult due to the involvement of multiple actors and private contractors with limited public disclosure requirements. The House and Senate restaurants face financial challenges with incomplete reports on finances. Commission-based fees are received from food service providers, but detailed financial records are not publicly accessible. Price increases have been used to improve finances, but sometimes revenue doesn't fully offset expenses. Contract agreements with vendors can limit price adjustments, making it difficult to compensate for increased costs. In the transition to Sodexo in the House during 2015, prices on many menu items increased due to vendor contract limitations. Future price increases are now capped at three percent annually based on the Producer Price Index subset. Complaints about restaurant prices have persisted over the years. Prices have been a persistent issue in the House restaurant system, with a 2013 study showing that customers, especially staff and visitors, are price-conscious. Customers may opt for off-site dining if Capitol complex options are not seen as good value. The House and Senate restaurants must meet customer standards for food quality, nutrition, and variety. Vendors like Sodexo, selected for the House restaurants, prioritize quick dining options. The CAO prioritizes quick dining options in restaurants, along with food quality, nutrition, and customer service. Two branded restaurant concepts are required based on customer preferences. Restaurant Associates emphasizes sustainability and social responsibility on the Senate dining website, offering organic, locally sourced, and sustainable food options. Upgrades and renovations are needed in dining facilities to maintain food quality, safety, and customer satisfaction, especially during transitions to new vendors. Large-scale renovations are sometimes necessary to improve and maintain Capitol, House, and Senate facilities, with closures impacting House and Senate restaurant services. Cafeteria closures may require additional resources or reliance on prepackaged food items. In January 2016, the Longworth Cafeteria was temporarily closed due to employees feeling ill from possible exposure to lead paint dust during kitchen renovations. The Cannon Renewal Project led to the closure of the Cannon Caf\u00e9 in December 2014, replaced by a convenience store, Cannon Twelve. The Longworth Cafeteria underwent renovations between July and November 2016, operating under limited hours. Congressional office space reorganization due to renovations may shift demand for cafeterias. Congress uses private vendors to manage House and Senate restaurants, raising questions about their involvement in daily operations. The House and Senate have used private vendors to manage their restaurants, with debates over financial benefits and food service quality. Advocates for private management argue that professional contractors are better equipped to handle the complexities of modern restaurant systems. Private management of House and Senate restaurants has been a topic of debate. Advocates believe professional contractors are better equipped to handle restaurant complexities, while some argue that Congress understands the unique needs of these systems. Concerns include oversight challenges if financial records are not available for review, and differences in personnel and procurement guidelines. Employee wages and benefits were issues during the 114th Congress, with new contracts for House and Senate restaurants in effect by 2015. In August 2015, a new contract for Senate restaurants took effect in December 2015, sparking advocacy for higher wages and union representation for employees. Concerns about House restaurant employee wages were raised during the search for a new vendor in 2015, with Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz proposing an amendment for a livable wage requirement. The CAO noted the importance of fair compensation for House service providers. Sodexo, the new House vendor, voluntarily followed the D.C. Displaced Workers Protection Act and recognized the restaurant employees' union. Provisions in the collective bargaining agreement with Sodexo for House restaurant employees remain similar to those under the previous vendor, including pay scale, leave benefits, health insurance, and union pension. Starting wages range from $10.15 to $19.00 an hour, with scheduled increases. Sodexo also offers a 401(k) plan with matching contributions. Concerns have been raised about wages and benefits for Senate restaurant employees. Several protests and advocacy efforts took place in late 2014 and throughout 2015 regarding pay and union representation for Senate restaurant employees. Workers called for a minimum hourly wage of $15 and some sought to form a union. Senators showed support for the employees' concerns by signing a letter to the Senate Rules and Administration Committee. Several Senators advocated for higher wages and benefits for federal contractors, urging them to provide healthcare and other benefits. They also supported restaurant employees by signing letters to the Rules and Administration Committee and the CEO of Compass Group, encouraging union recognition if desired by the majority of employees. Some Senators and congressional staffers participated in protests and advocacy efforts for restaurant workers. Senate restaurant employees advocated for higher wages and benefits to live above the poverty line. A new contract with Restaurant Associates in January 2016 included pay increases, raising the average hourly wage to $14.50. The Department of Labor found back wages owed to 674 employees in July 2016. The Department of Labor found that Senate restaurant workers were improperly classified into lower paying job categories and required to work without compensation before their scheduled start times, leading to underestimated overtime pay. Some Senators are calling to terminate the Senate's contract with Restaurant Associates. The error was attributed to \"administrative technicalities,\" and Restaurant Associates claimed to have paid the workers in full. Good Jobs Nation filed a complaint with DOL on behalf of the employees, alleging job misclassification after a new contract with Restaurant Associates in December 2015. The Service Contract Act of 1965 set minimum wages for Senate restaurant workers, but some were misclassified into lower-paying positions. The AOC identified the issue in 2016, leading to back pay for affected employees. Despite efforts to include pay raises in the new contract, some workers received little to no increase due to title changes. The AOC discovered misclassifications of Senate restaurant workers in 2016, leading to back pay for affected employees. A subsequent GAO review confirmed AOC's oversight compliance. Restaurant Associates agreed to back pay, retain a compliance monitor, and take proactive steps for future compliance. The House and Senate food services operate similarly to large institutional cafeterias, providing breakfast, lunch, and snacks during regular workday hours. They aim to offer convenient service, competitive prices, and menu items that customers enjoy. The Members' dining rooms provide a unique ambiance not typically found in workplace eateries. The dining operations have implemented measures such as appointing a compliance manager and supervisors, and creating a confidential hotline for reporting issues. The House and Senate dining rooms provide a unique ambiance for Members of Congress and staff to meet in a formal setting. The dining operations must account for the unpredictable schedule of Congress, which can affect food services by reducing customers during recesses and increasing demand when Congress is in session. This fluctuation in business can lead to higher costs, temporary layoffs, or reduced hours for employees. Food service providers in the House and Senate must handle high volumes of customers with various needs, including last-minute requests and changes to the congressional schedule. Private contractors operate the restaurants, but oversight is shared with the House and Senate. Issues are addressed by contractors, House Administration Committee, Senate Rules and Administration Committee, or other congressional support offices to meet the needs of Members and staff relying on congressional dining. Entities in the House and Senate work to meet the needs of Members and staff who depend on congressional dining services for their daily work."
