    "content": "The Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE) within the Department of Energy (DOE) invests in high-risk research in energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies. EERE manages grant programs for state governments and oversees the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) in Golden, CO, which focuses on efficiency and renewables research. In FY2015, EERE provided significantly more funding to NREL than to other national labs. EERE is divided into four sector offices: sustainable transportation, renewable power, energy. The Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE) is divided into four sector offices: sustainable transportation, renewable power, energy efficiency, and corporate management. The Sustainable Transportation R&D includes three program offices focusing on electric vehicles, biomass resources, and hydrogen/fuel cells. The Renewable Power R&D consists of four program offices focusing on solar energy, wind energy, and geothermal energy. The Geothermal Energy office explores technology for power generation from geological resources. Water Power technologies include hydropower development strategies and hardware for wave, currents, and tidal energy resources. Energy Efficiency R&D consists of three program offices: Advanced Manufacturing, Building Technologies, and Federal Energy Management Program. Corporate Management includes Program Management, Strategic Programs, and Facilities. The Facilities and Infrastructure program under EERE focuses on developing and maintaining facilities at NREL to support clean energy goals. EERE's vision is to promote clean, affordable, and secure energy while its mission is to lead the transition to a global clean energy economy. Strategic goals include accelerating sustainable transportation technologies, increasing renewable power generation, improving energy efficiency, growing the clean energy manufacturing industry, and integrating clean energy into reliable systems. The Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE) program focuses on strategic goals such as accelerating sustainable transportation technologies, increasing renewable power generation, improving energy efficiency, growing the clean energy manufacturing industry, and integrating clean energy into reliable systems. President Obama has emphasized the importance of energy efficiency and renewable energy for jobs, economic growth, and U.S. manufacturing competitiveness. The EERE strategic planning process follows a three-phase innovation model to address research, development, and market barriers. President Obama has set goals for doubling generation from wind, solar, and geothermal sources by 2020, increasing energy productivity by 2030, making buildings more efficient, attaining 80% clean energy power generation by 2035, reducing oil imports by half by 2020, and cutting greenhouse gases by 17% below 2005 levels by 2020. The President's strategy for sustainable economic growth focuses on economic growth, job creation, energy security, and curbing global climate change. The 2015 Economic Report of the President highlights the importance of U.S. leadership in international negotiations for setting carbon reduction goals. The report emphasizes the need for research and early deployment projects to bring down the market price of renewable energy technologies. The Administration supports a broad range of actions, from funding new energy technologies to regulating carbon emissions under the Clean Air Act. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has issued the Clean Power Plan (CPP) to reduce carbon emissions from power plants, with states required to submit implementation plans by 2016 or 2018. Renewable energy is a key strategy to meet CPP targets, potentially boosting demand for EERE technologies and promoting renewables capacity, energy storage, grid integration, and energy-efficient equipment. The federal government provided R&D support for fossil energy, nuclear power, renewable energy, and energy efficiency technologies from FY1948 to FY1977. Funding for these technologies peaked in FY1979, then dropped until the late 1990s. Since then, funding has gradually increased, with a spike in FY2009 due to the Recovery Act. EERE funding for renewables and energy efficiency R&D has been increasing since 2005. Since 2005, the Energy and Water Development appropriations bill has funded DOE programs, including those by the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE). EERE administers R&D programs with specific goals and objectives, often in partnership with private sector firms. Despite DOE's annual requests for increased funding, Congress has typically provided less than requested levels for EERE programs. For FY2015, DOE requested $2.3 billion for EERE, a $416 million increase from FY2014. The House approved $1.8 billion for EERE, while the Senate Committee recommended $2.1 billion. The enacted FY2015 measure provided $1.9 billion for EERE. The FY2016 budget request for EERE was about $2.7 billion, a 42% increase from FY2015. The Administration sought a revenue offset by proposing to repeal $4 billion in fossil fuel tax incentives to balance the requested increase for DOE. The DOE requested the largest increases for manufacturing and vehicles, with significant increases for other programs and a new local grants program. The requested increase for manufacturing would support Clean Energy Manufacturing Initiatives, while the increase for vehicles would mainly support the EV Everywhere Grand Challenge. Additionally, sizable increases were sought for EERE R&D programs, including Solar and SunShot Initiative. The requested increase in funding for DOE programs would have mainly supported the SunShot Initiative goal for utility solar plants to reach 6 cents/kilowatt hour by 2020. The increase would have also supported emerging technologies in buildings, geothermal production cost goals, new technology and wildlife impact mitigation in wind energy, pilot biorefinery projects and algae productivity in bioenergy, and grant programs for weatherization and state energy initiatives. The House Committee on Appropriations recommended a $1.652 billion budget for the Energy and Water Development Appropriations Bill, 2016, with a $20 million increase for a competitive grant program promoting best practices. The Senate Committee on Appropriations later recommended $1.933 billion for EERE, including a $20 million program for competitive grants. Congress adopted two omnibus continuing resolutions for final FY2016 appropriations. The final FY2016 appropriations bill, H.R. 2029, included nearly $2.1 billion for EERE programs. Congress went through various steps in the appropriations process, with the E&W bill eventually being incorporated into H.R. 2029 after negotiations. Several EERE programs received significant funding increases for FY2016. Several EERE programs received a significant funding increase for FY2016, with the largest dollar and percentage increase in the energy efficiency sector. Table 4 shows that the largest EERE increases are for manufacturing and vehicles, while Wind Energy is the only program slated to be cut. The FY2016 request also aimed to continue crosscutting programs that coordinate across the Department to address national energy, environmental, and national security challenges effectively and efficiently. The EERE programs received a significant funding increase for FY2016, with a focus on energy efficiency. Four new broad initiatives were introduced, including Supercritical Carbon Dioxide for power production, Subsurface Engineering for accessing underground resources, Energy-Water Nexus for improving energy-water systems, and Cybersecurity for protecting DOE facilities from cyber threats. The federal government is focusing on improving cybersecurity for industrial subsectors like electric power, oil, and natural gas. This includes initiatives such as the Grid Modernization Initiative and the EV Everywhere Grand Challenge to address electric grid integration barriers and promote affordable plug-in electric vehicles. The DOE is leading initiatives like the SunShot Grand Challenge, Clean Energy Manufacturing Initiative, and Wide Bandgap Semiconductors for Clean Energy to advance solar power, clean energy manufacturing, and semiconductor technology for high-power-conversion electronics. The DOE is focusing on developing high-power-conversion electronics using Wide Bandgap Semiconductors, which have the potential to be more compact, energy efficient, and operate at higher temperatures and voltages. This technology could be used in electric vehicle drivetrains, solar inverters, motors, transformers, and other clean energy applications. The DOE's FY2016 request groups program offices under themes like Sustainable Transportation and Renewable Electricity Generation. The DOE's Energy Efficiency and Renewable Electricity Generation programs aim to reduce petroleum use, greenhouse gas emissions, and air pollutants. The program supports research and development of hydrogen and fuel cell technologies to overcome deployment barriers. The fuel cell program targets cost and durability goals. The DOE's fuel cell program aims to achieve a cost below $40 per kilowatt and a durability of 5,000 hours by 2020. The target for hydrogen produced from renewable resources is to lower the cost below $4.00 per gasoline gallon-equivalent by 2020. Funding for hydrogen fuel R&D and fuel cell R&D in FY2016 saw a small increase, with efforts to expand vehicle applications and address challenges to hydrogen infrastructure. The DOE's program received $101 million in FY2016 for R&D to foster a domestic bioenergy industry producing renewable biofuels, bioproducts, and biopower. The program aims to reduce oil dependence, greenhouse gas emissions, and stimulate economic development. Challenges include oil price fluctuations and feedstock collection barriers, with a focus on converting biomass to solid pellets or bio-oil for easier transport. Goals now include developing biofuels to meet Renewable Fuel Standard production targets. The DOE's program aims to support non-food drop-in biofuels to reach a wholesale finished-fuel cost under $3 per gge by 2017 and $3/gge for algae-based fuels by 2020. For FY2016, DOE requested $246 million for Bioenergy programs, with increases in funding for biorefinery pilot projects and feedstock yield improvements. The House committee proposed a $7 million increase for the Feedstocks subprogram to improve algal biomass conversion to biofuel oil. They recommended cutting $60 million below the FY2015 level and no funding for the drop-in biofuels project. The Senate report suggested level funding with FY2015, including $45 million for drop-in biofuels and $30 million for algae biofuels. DOE was directed to assess existing facilities for bio-based product production. The enacted law provided $225 million for biofuels and algae biofuels projects. The EV program aims to achieve EV affordability and convenience by 2022 through advanced battery technology and reducing vehicle materials weight. Other goals include cutting national oil use by 16% by 2020 and increasing fuel economy to 62 mpg for cars. The DOE requested $444 million for the Vehicle Technologies program to support the EV Everywhere initiative. The increase of $164 million would focus on advanced batteries, materials technology, and outreach and deployment for alternative fuel vehicles. The House committee proposed a $28 million increase for Alternative Fuel Vehicle Community Partner projects and a $17 million increase for fuels and lubricants, including projects for Plug-in EV vehicle-grid integration and Supertruck II. The Senate recommended a $12 million increase and included $20 million for the SuperTruck II program. P.L. 114-113 provided $310 million, with a requested increase to $337 million to support the SunShot Initiative goal. The FY2016 funding increase for the SunShot Initiative aims to achieve a cost of solar power of 6 cents/kwh by 2020. It includes funding for solar photovoltaic R&D, reducing non-hardware costs, developing innovative solar energy manufacturing technologies, and increasing U.S. competitiveness. The increase would mainly support four subprograms: Systems Integration, Photovoltaic R&D, Balance of Systems, and Manufacturing Innovations. The House committee proposed a cut in funding for Manufacturing Innovations, with no funding for the SUNPATH III program. The Senate recommended an increase in funding. P.L. 114-113 provided an increase of $9 million. The Wind Program aims to achieve cost reduction goals for land-based and offshore windfarms. The Department of Energy (DOE) aims to reduce wind energy costs to 17 cents/kwh by 2020 and meet 20% of electricity demand by 2030. DOE requested a $146 million budget, with increases for technology development and addressing market barriers. The House committee proposed a $17 million cut in funding. The House committee proposed a $17 million cut in funding for offshore wind development technologies, while the Senate recommended a larger cut of $61 million. The program aims to lower exploration risks and reduce power production costs for geothermal equipment. The Hydrothermal subprogram targets developing 30 gigawatts of new resources, mainly in the western United States, using sensing and drilling technologies. The Enhanced Geothermal Systems subprogram focuses on developing blind resource areas. The MIT study suggested a usable geothermal resource at a depth of six miles nationwide. The goal is to develop 100 gw of this resource. The EGS subprogram focuses on adapting specialized technology similar to fracking but may face greater technical barriers. DOE requested $96 million, with $24 million for the Hydrothermal subprogram and $13 million for the EGS subprogram. There is debate over the fracking aspect of EGS. The EGS subprogram focuses on adapting specialized technology similar to fracking but may face greater technical barriers. Concerns include earthquakes, leakages, and spills. DOE's responses include a seismicity protocol and best management practices. Funding for water power technologies, including hydropower and marine resources, has increased to $71 million. The marine and hydrokinetic (MHK) power industry is still developing a clear technology theme and commercial strategy. With over 50% of the population living near coastlines, MHK technologies have potential to provide renewable electricity to coastal areas. DOE requested $67 million for water power technologies, including hydropower and MHK, in 2013. The DOE requested a $6 million increase for the Hydropower subprogram in FY2016. The focus for non-powered dams is on modular powertrains and site engineering designs, while for undeveloped streams, it is on innovation in structural materials and construction methods. The Water Power Program supports the Energy-Water Nexus crosscut to transition to more resilient energy and coupled energy-water systems. The House committee proposed a $22 million cut, directing DOE to allocate funding to MHK based on assessments and stakeholder input. The Senate recommended a $4 million increase, and P.L. 114-113 provided $70 million, a $9 million increase. The DOE requested a $264 million budget for FY2016, an increase of $92 million from FY2015.
