    "content": "After the financial crisis, Congress passed the Dodd-Frank Act to reform the financial system. Some believe it protects consumers and promotes stability, while others argue it burdens lenders and restricts access to loans, especially mortgages. Critics are concerned about the Ability-to-Repay and Qualified Mortgage rule. Supporters of expanded portfolio lending proposals argue that the Small Creditor Portfolio QM compliance option should be broadened to benefit small creditors. They suggest making it easier for lenders to comply by keeping loans in their portfolio. Critics believe existing protections in the rule are essential to prevent past failures from reoccurring. The ATR rule, established under Title XIV of the Dodd-Frank Act, requires lenders to ensure borrowers have the ability to repay a mortgage loan. Lenders must verify income, credit history, debts, and other criteria. Non-compliance can lead to legal consequences. Compliance with the ATR rule can be achieved through two methods outlined by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Under the ATR rule, lenders must ensure borrowers can repay a mortgage loan. This can be done through the General ATR Option or the more prescriptive QM rule, which reduces legal liability for lenders. The QM rule reduces legal liability for lenders in residential mortgage lending activities by providing additional legal protections. Lenders can comply with the ATR rule through the General ATR Option, but without the same legal protections as QM loans. Concerns exist that few mortgages will be originated that do not meet QM standards due to these protections, despite other means of ATR compliance. QM categories have underwriting and product-feature requirements to ensure minimum standards and borrower protections. The ATR requirement in mortgage lending aims to address market failures that led to the housing bubble by ensuring borrowers can repay loans. Lenders can choose the General ATR Option with fewer restrictions, but without the same legal protections as QM loans. Market failures include lenders and borrowers not considering societal costs and borrowers struggling to understand mortgage terms. The Dodd-Frank Act and the final rule aim to address market failures in mortgage lending by implementing minimum underwriting requirements and new liability for originators. These measures encourage lenders to consider additional costs and make informed underwriting decisions to ensure borrowers can repay the loan. The CFPB's rule on mortgage lending requires lenders to carefully underwrite loans to determine the borrower's ability to repay. Lenders face a tradeoff between meeting minimum underwriting standards for reduced legal risk or opting for a potentially less thorough underwriting process with higher liability. The Dodd-Frank Act introduced minimum underwriting standards for mortgage lending to address market failures that contributed to the financial crisis. Some argue that the Qualified Mortgage rule has restricted credit availability and imposed burdens on lenders. For more details on the Ability-to-Repay rule and Qualified Mortgage compliance options, refer to CRS Report R43081. The CFPB has the authority to regulate qualified mortgages, including the Small Creditor Portfolio QM, to ensure access to responsible and affordable mortgage credit for consumers. Criteria must be met to qualify for the Small Creditor Portfolio QM status. The Small Creditor Portfolio QM requires loans to be held by a small creditor, meet underwriting requirements, and have less prescriptive criteria compared to the Standard QM. Borrowers must have a DTI ratio below 43% for Standard QM, while lenders must consider and verify DTI for Small Creditor Portfolio QM. The Small Creditor Portfolio QM provides relief from the DTI threshold for small creditors, allowing them to offer loans with higher DTI ratios if the borrower is creditworthy. While it has less prescriptive underwriting requirements than the Standard QM, lenders must still follow other underwriting and product-feature requirements. The Small Creditor Portfolio QM requires the lender to hold the loan in portfolio and limits this option to small creditors. The CFPB established the Small Creditor Portfolio QM for small creditors, allowing them to offer loans with higher DTI ratios if the borrower is creditworthy. The lender must hold the loan in portfolio, and some argue for a less burdensome approach. Some in Congress propose establishing an additional portfolio QM option with relaxed eligibility criteria for three major categories. Three legislative proposals are analyzed: 1. S. 1484, the Financial Regulatory Improvement Act of 2015, reported by the Senate Banking Committee. 2. S. 1491/H.R. 2642, the Community Lender Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act of 2015, seen as an alternative to S. 1484. 3. H.R. 1210, the Portfolio Lending and Mortgage Access Act, passed by the House. Table 1 summarizes legislative proposals compared to Small Creditor Portfolio QM. Small creditor must retain mortgage for 3 years for QM status. Exceptions apply if sold to another small creditor. The CFPB argues that keeping the mortgage in portfolio gives creditors added incentive to assess the borrower's ability to repay, aligning consumers' and creditors' interests. This approach retains default risk and encourages thorough underwriting, unlike the \"originate-to-distribute\" model. The CFPB emphasizes that holding the loan in portfolio incentivizes thorough underwriting to assess the borrower's ability to repay. This aligns consumers' and creditors' interests, ensuring a focus on liquid sources of repayment during underwriting. The lender considers the value of the house during underwriting as it serves as collateral in a mortgage. Collateral-dependent lending allows the lender to profit from fees and recoup the principal through home sale if the borrower defaults. The ATR rule addresses this issue by requiring lenders to consider. The ATR rule mandates lenders to assess borrower's ability to repay regardless of house value. Liquid sources of repayment are emphasized for compliance. Small Creditor Portfolio QM requires lenders to retain mortgage for three years. Portfolio QM requires a small lender to retain the mortgage for three years to maintain QM status, with exceptions. Selling the loan before three years to a non-small creditor results in loss of QM status. Keeping the loan for over three years ensures QM status. The CFPB cites prevention of evasion as a reason for the three-year requirement. This timeframe aligns with the statute of limitations for claims on ability-to-repay violations. The CFPB requires small lenders to retain mortgages for three years to maintain QM status under the ability-to-repay rules. Borrowers can use the ATR rule as a defense against foreclosure at any point, but must initiate a claim within the first three years. Litigation risk is a tool to address market failures and encourage lenders to consider costs when extending credit. The proposals differ in whether the mortgage retains its QM status if transferred. The Small Creditor Portfolio QM allows a mortgage to be transferred and retain QM status, while other proposals require the mortgage to stay in the originator's portfolio to maintain QM status. These differences can impact borrower's cost of credit and lender's underwriting incentives. The Small Creditor Portfolio QM allows mortgage transfer to retain QM status, impacting borrower's cost of credit and lender's underwriting incentives. If a mortgage cannot be transferred without losing QM status, a liquidity premium may be charged to account for the lack of liquidity and associated risks. The Small Creditor Portfolio QM allows mortgage transfer to retain QM status, impacting borrower's cost of credit and lender's underwriting incentives. The restriction on transferring to small creditors may increase the liquidity premium for the Small Creditor Portfolio QM compared to S. 1484. However, after three years, the mortgage in the Small Creditor Portfolio QM does not need to be kept in portfolio to retain QM status, making it more liquid. Stringent portfolio requirements may make the mortgage more illiquid and result in a higher rate for the borrower. Relaxing portfolio requirements could reduce the liquidity premium but also reduce the lender's incentive to thoroughly underwrite the mortgage. Transferring the mortgage without losing its QM status may have implications. Transferring a mortgage without losing its QM status may weaken the originator's incentive for thorough underwriting. However, legal contracts could allow the new mortgage holder to transfer risk back to the originator under certain conditions, maintaining the originator's liability risk. This added liability risk could incentivize thorough borrower assessment even after mortgage transfer. The legislative proposals may lead to an evolution in the market regarding portfolio requirements for mortgages. Empirical research has shown conflicting results on the default likelihood of loans held in portfolio versus securitized loans. Some studies suggest that portfolio-held loans are less likely to default. One study found that prime mortgages securitized in private-label securities (PLS) were more likely to default than those retained in a lender's portfolio. Mortgages securitized by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were less likely to default than portfolio loans. Subprime loans securitized in PLS were less likely to default than portfolio loans, attributed to early defaults and risky loans overrepresented in lender portfolios. The results suggest lenders engage in adverse selection by securitizing less risky loans. During the pre-crisis period of 2004-2006, lenders chose to securitize low-default-risk and high-prepayment-risk loans in the prime mortgage market. This strategy was profitable as prepayment risk was a bigger concern than default risk during that time. In the prime mortgage market, lenders kept higher-default-rate mortgages due to regulatory capital requirements, leading to regulatory arbitrage. In the subprime market, no significant difference was found in default and prepayment risks between portfolio and securitized loans. Small lenders were more likely to sell higher default risk loans than larger lenders during certain years. Small lenders are more likely to sell higher default risk loans than larger lenders due to private information about borrowers and less diversified borrower base. Studies show mixed results on default rates for loans retained in portfolio, influenced by time period, loan type, and lender size. Retained risk is emphasized to encourage lenders to originate lower default risk loans. The empirical research presents conflicting evidence on the importance of retained risk in encouraging lenders to originate lower default risk mortgages. A less prescriptive portfolio QM option could impact lenders' business models in funding mortgages, with some being more willing to retain mortgages they originate. This could disadvantage mortgage bankers who do not hold mortgages in portfolio, such as those engaged in correspondent lending. A correspondent lender originates mortgages but sells them to investors based on prior agreements, without holding them in their portfolio. They may face higher funding costs if the mortgage does not receive QM status. An expanded portfolio QM could encourage lenders to hold more mortgages in their portfolios, potentially concentrating risk in the banking system and conflicting with regulators' goal of diversified asset portfolios. Holding mortgages in portfolio aligns lender and borrower incentives but also carries associated risks. When a bank holds a mortgage in portfolio, it bears the risks associated with default rates and interest rate changes. The requirement to retain QM status by holding mortgages could limit a lender's ability to sell certain loans during downturns, impacting safety and soundness. This could also affect the bank's regulatory capital levels and ability to manage interest rate risk. Holding mortgages in portfolio may lead to a change in asset prices during market downturns. The CFPB consulted with banking regulators on safety and soundness concerns regarding holding mortgages in portfolio. To address potential issues, the CFPB allowed mortgages to retain QM status even if sold, to prevent distressed banks from selling higher quality non-mortgage assets during financial distress. The CFPB allows mortgages to retain QM status if sold to revive troubled lenders. S. 1484 and H.R. 1210 have similar provisions, with S. 1484 also requiring periodic review of mortgage portfolios for systemically important banks. Small creditors can qualify for QM status if they meet specific criteria. Portfolio QM option is limited to small lenders. The CFPB allows small lenders to have a Portfolio QM option for non-conforming mortgage credit, especially in rural areas. Small creditors may be burdened by litigation risk from ability-to-repay rules, potentially reducing mortgage lending. Small lenders have incentives and ability to ensure consumer repayment. The CFPB established the government-sponsored enterprise (GSE) QM option for mortgages that do not meet the Standard QM criteria. Mortgages eligible for GSE purchase must adhere to specific standards set by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, allowing for broader underwriting criteria compared to the Standard QM. This enables more mortgages to qualify for QM status. The CFPB introduced the Small Creditor Portfolio QM as an additional compliance option for small lenders who provide non-conforming credit. Larger lenders typically deal with conforming mortgages that already qualify for QM status under the GSE QM, making the Small Creditor Portfolio QM a necessary complement for smaller lenders. Small creditors are more willing to assess consumers and properties individually and hold non-conforming loans on their balance sheets. The CFPB found that a significant portion of non-conforming loans are originated by creditors with assets less than $2 billion, indicating that smaller lenders play a significant role in this market. The CFPB argues that small creditors, who are more likely to operate in rural areas, are crucial for providing credit access in those communities. Failure to create a compliance option for small creditors could result in restricted credit access in rural areas. The CFPB emphasizes the importance of ensuring credit access in rural areas by providing compliance options for small creditors. This is crucial as small creditors are more likely to operate in rural areas and failure to create compliance options could restrict credit access in these communities. Small creditors are believed to thoroughly evaluate a borrower's ability to repay due to their unique qualities and incentives. The impact of the Small Creditor Portfolio QM option on credit availability in rural areas is uncertain, as the QM rule offers a separate compliance option for rural lenders. The CFPB argues that small lenders have strong incentives and abilities to make accurate assessments of consumers' ability to repay, citing factors like size and risk exposure. The CFPB argues that small creditors, due to their size and risk exposure, have a greater incentive to only originate mortgages that consumers can repay. Small lenders may also use a relationship-based lending model for a more accurate assessment of borrowers. Relationship-based lending involves lenders developing close familiarity with their customer bases to capture unique, infrequent, and localized lending risks. This model relies on qualitative information from personal relationships between creditors and consumers, emphasizing extended relationships and offering various services beyond just mortgages. It contrasts with transactional banking models used by larger lenders that rely more on automation. The CFPB supports relationship-based lending over automated underwriting used by larger lenders, as it allows for better assessment of ability to repay by considering local knowledge and nonstandard data. Studies show that lenders using soft information have lower default rates, but there is a risk of bias. Small lenders' community ties provide added incentive for responsible lending. Small lenders' community ties provide added incentive for responsible lending by allowing them to have specialized knowledge of the community, a comprehensive understanding of their customers' financial circumstances, and a focus on maintaining long-standing relationships. This enables small lenders to better assess a borrower's creditworthiness and internalize reputational risk. The legislative proposals aim to expand lender eligibility for a portfolio QM, with different degrees of restrictions for lenders based on size and origination requirements. The CFPB argues that limiting the portfolio QM to small lenders is important due to their ability to accurately evaluate a borrower's creditworthiness. The legislative proposals aim to expand lender eligibility for a portfolio QM, with different degrees of restrictions for lenders based on size and origination requirements. The proposals emphasize accurate assessment of ability to repay, with discussions on policy issues related to lender restrictions. Figure 1 shows the number of banks by asset size, indicating a decrease in small banks over time. Despite the decrease, small banks still make up the majority of institutions. The CFPB's lender restrictions for small banks are stricter than legislative proposals, using an asset limit and origination threshold to define eligibility. The origination threshold aims to support relationship-based business models, while the asset limit prevents large lenders with low origination levels from participating. These restrictions impact which lenders can participate, with the CFPB estimating that most creditors with less than $500 million in assets would qualify. S. 1491 would expand the definition of small lenders to include those with up to $10 billion in assets, with unclear criteria for eligibility. H.R. 1210 and S. 1484 have no asset or origination threshold, allowing many additional lenders to participate if enacted. The CFPB's rule implementing the Small Creditor Portfolio QM explained why it limited eligibility to smaller lenders. The CFPB argues that as lenders increase in size and reach, they are less likely to engage in relationship lending or use local knowledge in underwriting. Compliance functions become more manageable as institutions add staff and branches. The CFPB expanded the origination threshold for portfolio QM to 2,000 mortgages per year. Larger banks may support eliminating size restrictions for portfolio QM. Performance of mortgages by lenders of different sizes is a factor in assessing eligibility for a portfolio QM option. The performance of mortgages originated by lenders of different sizes, particularly community banks, has been better compared to larger banks. Community banks showed responsible lending practices with lower serious delinquency rates, outperforming even prime loans. This is supported by research from the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas. The delinquency rates of mortgages held by banks of different sizes diverged after the housing bubble burst. Larger banks had higher delinquency rates compared to smaller banks. However, past crises show that small institutions are also prone to significant mistakes leading to failure. Transferring a mortgage to a different lender's portfolio may result in a lower liquidity premium. Transferring a mortgage to a different lender's portfolio may lower liquidity premium and rates for borrowers, but could reduce incentives for thorough underwriting. Allowing large banks to purchase mortgages could inject liquidity into the market, but may lead to loss of underwriting incentives associated with smaller lenders. S. 1484 and H.R. 1210 propose allowing large banks to purchase mortgages not originated by them, with the mortgage receiving QM status if held in portfolio. The proposed bills, H.R. 1210 and S. 1491, address the issue of large banks being able to receive QM status for mortgages held in their portfolio. However, there are concerns about whether large banks would actually provide support to the mortgage market during a downturn. Data shows that the banking system reduced the total amount of mortgages held in portfolio, with the largest banks also shrinking their mortgage portfolios. The CFPB's Small Creditor Portfolio QM has similar product-feature requirements as the Standard QM but with less prescriptive underwriting standards. Unlike the Standard QM, the Small Creditor Portfolio QM does not have a numeric debt-to-income threshold, allowing small lenders more flexibility in assessing borrowers' DTI ratios. This change aims to support small lenders in offering portfolio loans without a strict DTI limit. The CFPB removes the DTI limit for portfolio loans offered by small lenders, arguing that unique factors provide added incentives for accurate borrower credit assessment. While DTI consideration remains important, less prescriptive underwriting standards aim to reduce burden on small creditors and increase credit availability. Legislative proposals vary in setting underwriting requirements for portfolio QM options, with H.R. 1210 having the fewest and S. 1491 being the most prescriptive. H.R. 1210 has the fewest requirements, S. 1491 has the most prescriptive requirements. H.R. 1210 and S. 1484 limit CFPB's ability to add loan criteria, while S. 1491 allows additional criteria for portfolio QM status. Consumer lawsuits can be based on lender non-compliance with ATR rule, success depends on loan criteria stringency and lender documentation ease. The stringency of loan criteria and ease of lender documentation play a crucial role in determining the success of consumer lawsuits based on lender non-compliance with the ATR rule. More prescriptive standards may make it easier for borrowers to win suits but could deter lenders from extending credit. This tradeoff highlights the balance between consumer protection and access to credit. The CFPB has standards for borrowers with atypical financial situations, but some argue that Appendix Q is too complex, leading lenders to be hesitant in extending credit to these borrowers. Supporters of expanded portfolio QM options argue for less prescriptive standards and easier documentation criteria to increase credit availability for atypical borrowers. They believe lenders should have discretion in setting underwriting and product-feature standards to extend loans to more borrowers. H.R. 1210 provides the most discretion, while S. 1491 leans towards more prescriptive standards. The proposed expanded portfolio QM options aim to increase credit availability by allowing lenders more discretion in setting underwriting standards. The effect on credit availability would depend on the specific proposal implemented, with uncertainties on the significant impact it would have. The proposed expanded portfolio QM options aim to increase credit availability by allowing lenders more discretion in setting underwriting standards. However, a recent Government Accountability Office (GAO) report suggests that the impact may not be significant initially, as many loans already met QM criteria before the regulations were implemented. Additionally, a Federal Reserve study found that while some market outcomes were affected by the new rules, the estimated effects were small. Some argue that the prescriptive criteria of QM are hindering lenders from lending to creditworthy borrowers. An expanded portfolio QM option could increase credit availability by offering lenders more flexibility, but its longer-term effects are uncertain. Market participants anticipate loosening mortgage credit conditions over time, but the impact of QM restrictions remains unclear. The Temporary GSE QM category, with less strict criteria, is set to expire in 2021, potentially limiting credit for marginally creditworthy borrowers. An expanded portfolio QM option with less prescriptive underwriting standards could reduce regulatory burden for lenders, potentially impacting credit availability for borrowers on the margins of creditworthiness. This option may offer lenders more flexibility compared to the current strict criteria under the CFPB's Appendix Q. The CFPB and Congress agree that aligning borrower and lender incentives is important for prudent lending and consumer protection. The Small Creditor Portfolio QM allows for less prescriptive underwriting criteria for small creditors, based on the alignment of incentives. The Small Creditor Portfolio QM aims to align borrower and lender incentives by imposing certain restrictions and criteria on lenders to ensure consumer protection. However, these restrictions may limit credit availability and burden lenders. Legislative proposals vary in their approach to expanding the portfolio QM option, with S. 1491 being the most similar to the Small Creditor Portfolio QM. The expanded QM options proposed in H.R. 1210 and S. 1484 aim to provide more flexibility for lenders, with H.R. 1210 having the least prescriptive criteria and S. 1484 requiring more documentation of a borrower's financial status. Policymakers must consider if borrower and lender incentives align adequately to protect consumers and ensure prudent underwriting when the lender holds the mortgage in portfolio. The expanded QM options proposed in H.R. 1210 and S. 1484 aim to provide more flexibility for lenders, with varying levels of documentation required for a borrower's financial status. Policymakers need to consider if borrower and lender incentives align to ensure prudent underwriting when mortgages are held in portfolio. Questions regarding the size of lenders eligible for portfolio QM, the types of mortgages included, and the necessity of prescribed underwriting procedures are important for evaluating the legislation."
