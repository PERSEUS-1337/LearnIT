    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Campaign Advertising and Disclosure Act of 1993\". The Congress recognizes the need for candidates to purchase advertising spots at the lowest unit charge before elections. Changes in the method of selling advertising spots have impacted the enforcement of this requirement since the Communications Act of 1934 was amended in 1972. The interpretation and enforcement of the lowest unit charge provision in the Communications Act of 1934 need clarification and simplification. Broadcasters and operators of television systems should treat political candidates equally in granting discounts for advertising time. Enhancing disclosure requirements of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 will increase candidate accountability and help citizens make informed judgments about political advertising sources. The curr_chunk emphasizes the importance of effectively identifying the source and credibility of political advertising. SEC. 3. USE OF BROADCASTING STATIONS BY CANDIDATES FOR PUBLIC OFFICE. Section 315 of the Communications Act of 1934 is amended to restrict licensees from preempting the use of broadcasting stations by legally qualified candidates for public office who have purchased airtime. The Communications Act of 1934 is amended to prevent broadcasting stations from preempting candidate advertising spots due to circumstances beyond their control. SEC. 4. POLITICAL ADVERTISING REQUIREMENTS. Section 318 of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 is amended by striking the period at the end of paragraph 3 and inserting a semicolon, and by adding the following requirements for authorized communication by a candidate through broadcasting stations or community antenna television systems. During the communication, the candidate's voice shall state approval of the ad with their name and the office sought. The statement required by sub-paragraph (A) shall be spoken clearly without rushing, disguising, or de-emphasizing particular words. In the case of a communication made through a television broadcasting station or community antenna television system, the background photography during the entire time the statement required by subparagraph (A) is made shall consist of an unobscured full-face picture of the candidate, occupying no less than 40 percent of the television safe screen area, against a neutral background. Section 318 of the Federal Communications Act. Section 318 of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 is amended to include a new subsection defining the term \"community antenna television system\" as used in the Act. SEC. 4. POLITICAL ADVERTISING REQUIREMENTS. Section 318 of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 is amended to include new requirements for authorized political communications through broadcasting stations or television systems. These communications must include a statement in the candidate's voice at the end for at least 6 seconds, stating approval, candidacy, and payment details. The amended Section 318 of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 requires authorized political communications on television to include a statement in the candidate's voice stating approval, candidacy, and payment details. This statement must be spoken clearly without rushing or disguising words, and visually displayed on screen with specific information. The amended Section 318 of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 mandates that authorized political TV communications must include a statement in the candidate's voice approving, declaring candidacy, and disclosing payment details. The statement should be clearly spoken and visually displayed on screen with specific information. The amended Section 318 of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 requires political TV communications to include a statement at the end of the communication stating \"PAID FOR BY ____________, AND NOT AUTHORIZED BY ANY CANDIDATE. FOR MORE INFORMATION ON THE SPONSOR OF THIS PAID POLITICAL ANNOUNCEMENT, CONTACT ____________\". This statement must be aurally stated for at least 6 seconds and filled with specific details. The amended Section 318 of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 requires political TV communications to include a statement at the end of the communication stating the sponsor's name and contact information. This statement must be spoken clearly and displayed visually on the screen. The amended Section 318 of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 now includes a requirement for political TV communications to include a statement at the end with the sponsor's name and contact information. This applies to community antenna television systems as defined in the Communications Act of 1934."
