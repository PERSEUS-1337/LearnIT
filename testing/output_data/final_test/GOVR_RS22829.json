    "content": "Georgia joined NATO's Partnership for Peace (PFP) program in 1994 and aspired to eventual NATO membership. After the \"rose revolution\" in late 2003, Georgia prioritized integration with Western institutions like NATO and the EU. Candidate Mikheil Saakashvili pledged to work towards NATO membership during the 2003 presidential election campaign. Georgia sent troops to assist NATO forces in Kosovo, hosted PFP military training exercises, and pledged troops for the ISAF in Afghanistan. In late 2004, Georgia concluded an Individual Partnership Action Plan (IPAP) with NATO. In late 2004, Georgia concluded an IPAP with NATO, committing to domestic and defense reforms. The national security concept was approved in late 2005, aligning with the IPAP reforms. NATO viewed Georgia positively in meeting reform priorities during 2005-2006. Georgia's NATO membership preparations include democratization, market economy development, and military professionalism. Criteria also include resolving internal conflicts and international disputes. In September 2006, NATO offered Georgia an \"Intensified Dialogue\" to assist in its aspirations for Alliance membership. In November 2007, concerns were raised about Georgia's democratization after the government imposed emergency rule and closed media outlets. NATO Secretary General criticized these actions as not in line with Euro-Atlantic values. President Saakashvili resigned and sought re-election after facing domestic and international criticism for his government's non-responsiveness to citizens' concerns. Following his re-election in 2008, NATO welcomed the election results as reflecting the free choice of voters and pledged to deepen dialogue with Georgia to meet Euro-Atlantic standards. Despite economic progress with a 10% GDP growth in 2007, lingering poverty contributed to civil unrest in late 2007. The Saakashvili government made progress in combating corruption, but poverty still contributed to civil unrest in late 2007. Economic growth continued in 2008, but was impacted by the Russia-Georgia conflict. The Georgian military focused on re-equipping with Western-made weapons to enhance interoperability with NATO forces. The review highlighted Georgia's efforts to address military capability deficiencies, including intelligence, air and maritime defense, joint force interoperability, special forces, and combat service support. Reforms included integrating interior ministry troops into the armed forces and transitioning to a joint command staff. The Strategic Defense Review suggested Georgia could contribute to NATO with mountain combat training. Civil-military relations improved with the appointment of a civilian defense minister and increased coordination between security-related ministries. The defense budget is transparent and scrutinized by the Committee on Defense and Security. In January 2008, NATO assessed positively Georgia's progress on expanded IPAP goals covering 2007-2008. Georgia formally requested NATO to participate in a MAP at a summit in Bucharest in April 2008, but was not offered one. NATO pledged eventual membership for Georgia, which some argued emboldened Russia. NATO's failure to offer Georgia a MAP emboldened Russia's aggressiveness in the 2008 invasion. Saakashvili believed Russia aimed to crush Georgia's independence and NATO aspirations. NATO condemned Russia's actions and formed a NATO-Georgia Commission to address Georgia's needs post-conflict. Russia suspended most cooperation with NATO in response to NATO's condemnation of Russia's military actions against Georgia. The inaugural meeting of the NATO-Georgia Commission reaffirmed NATO's commitment to Georgia's sovereignty and condemned Russia's recognition of Abkhazia and South Ossetia's independence. NATO ambassadors emphasized continued assistance to Georgia in implementing reform programs. NATO Secretary-General indicated challenges in resuming cooperation with Russia. In response to Russia's military actions against Georgia, NATO suspended cooperation with Russia. NATO reaffirmed its commitment to Georgia's sovereignty and condemned Russia's recognition of Abkhazia and South Ossetia's independence. NATO discussed Georgia's rebuilding needs and the implications of Russia's actions for Euro-Atlantic security. Russian President Medvedev accused NATO of provoking the conflict. Cooperation in monitoring Georgian airspace was discussed at a NATO-Georgia Commission meeting. At a NATO foreign ministerial meeting, offering a MAP to Georgia was sidestepped in favor of increased assistance for eventual NATO membership. Georgia is moving towards NATO membership with assurance of further assistance in implementing reforms. NATO foreign ministers are closely monitoring Georgia's democratic progress and called for a review of security documents. They urged reforms in military personnel management, defense budget transparency, and interoperability with NATO forces. NATO will increase staffing at its liaison office in Tbilisi. Recovery assistance to Georgia and Russia's construction were discussed at a NATO-Georgia commission meeting. At a NATO meeting, discussions were held regarding recovery assistance to Georgia and Russia's construction of military bases in breakaway regions. Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer expressed disagreement with Russia's actions in South Ossetia and Abkhazia, emphasizing the need to use the NATO-Russia Council to address these disagreements. The Alliance agreed to reopen NATO-Russia Council talks to press Russia to abide by ceasefire accords with Georgia and rescind its recognition and basing arrangements in Abkhazia and South Ossetia. The foreign minister argued against the renewal of NATO-Russia Council meetings due to unchanged Russian behavior but Lithuania would support them to address Georgia's territorial integrity. Georgia was aligning its defense planning cycle with NATO's Annual National Program, focusing on upgrading communications, air force, air defense, military intelligence, and education, and continuing military cooperation with the United States. Georgia is aligning its defense planning with NATO's Annual National Program, focusing on upgrading communications, air force, air defense, military intelligence, and education. Military reforms include addressing problems of command, planning, and budgeting, reflecting experience gained during Russia's aggression. The defense plan will emphasize territorial defense and changes in assistance from NATO allies. Other reforms include improving living conditions, pay, and social benefits, and transitioning to voluntary conscription after 2009. Georgia has made improvements in its military, including increasing the retention rate for officers and specialists trained by NATO and Western countries. They announced plans to add a fifth brigade, increase the total number of troops, and build a new military base to enhance integration into NATO. The military budget for 2008 was $1.1 billion, but due to the Russia-Georgia conflict and economic crisis, it was reduced to $680 million. Some criticized the increases in troops and spending as not in line with NATO guidelines. Georgia reduced its defense budget to $680 million and armed forces personnel. Saakashvili pledged additional democratization efforts for NATO membership. Economic decline post-Russia-Georgia conflict was partially offset by international aid. Plans to send 400 troops to support ISAF were adjusted to around 100 post-conflict. Georgia offered to assist with equipment shipments after Kyrgyzstan's U.S. airbase closure announcement. Defense Minister Sikharulidze mentioned facilitating trans-shipments in February 2009. Georgia reaffirmed its commitment to facilitate trans-shipments of materiel to Afghanistan within the framework of cooperation with NATO in February 2009. The majority of Georgians support NATO membership, with 77% of citizens voting in favor of joining NATO in a plebiscite held during the January 2008 presidential election. Opposition parties also back Georgia's eventual accession to NATO, despite some concerns raised by individuals like Irina Sarishvili about potential Russian retaliation. Labor Party leader Shalva Natelashvili has called for Georgia to declare itself a non-aligned state, while there are differing opinions within Georgia on the impact of the August conflict on its progress towards NATO membership. Georgian military analyst Irakli Sesiashvili believes that the U.S.-Georgia Charter signed in January 2009 has significantly improved Georgia's prospects for NATO membership. On February 3, 2009, Defense Minister Sikharulidze expressed optimism about Georgia's NATO prospects, stating that Georgia will continue its integration into NATO. President Saakashvili, on February 18, voiced frustration with the slow NATO accession process, emphasizing that EU membership is more important. Concerns have been raised about the difficulty of achieving interoperable forces with NATO since the Russia-Georgia conflict, as some European countries are hesitant to supply NATO-caliber weapons to Georgia. The think-tank argues that Russia opposed NATO involvement in the Russia-Georgia conflict. NATO condemned Russia's actions, leading Moscow to end hostilities without deposing Saakashvili. The conflict has slowed Georgia's and Ukraine's integration with NATO, raising doubts about Georgia's armed forces, leadership trustworthiness, and security guarantees. The former Bush Administration supported Georgia's NATO aspirations. The former Bush Administration supported Georgia's NATO aspirations, pushing for a Membership Action Plan (MAP) for Georgia at NATO meetings in 2006 and 2008. However, the US eventually agreed to a pledge for eventual NATO membership for Georgia, opting for Annual National Programs instead of a MAP to assist in meeting NATO requirements. The United States supported Georgia's NATO aspirations by opting for Annual National Programs instead of a Membership Action Plan (MAP) to assist in meeting NATO requirements. The US emphasized a continuing security relationship with Georgia, involving training and military reform, within the framework of NATO allies. Defense Secretary Gates endorsed exploring improved NATO ties with Russia while urging a compromise on MAP decisions. Secretary of State Clinton emphasized the United States' commitment to Georgia and Ukraine moving towards NATO membership and working with them to prevent Russian intimidation or aggression. She also noted the benefits of renewing dialogue in the NATO-Russia Council but stressed the need for a cautious approach due to the Obama Administration's incomplete policy review towards Russia. Ongoing U.S. support for Georgia's sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity is reflected in the U.S.-Georgia Charter on Strategic Partnership, signed in January 2009. The charter emphasizes the importance of a strong, independent, sovereign, unified, and democratic Georgia. This commitment is similar to agreements with Ukraine and the Baltic states, aimed at advancing their NATO membership. The U.S. and Georgia also intend to enhance security cooperation, as stated in the charter. The U.S.-Georgia Charter on Strategic Partnership, signed in January 2009, aims to expand defense and security cooperation to promote peace and stability. The cooperation also aims to strengthen Georgia's candidacy for NATO membership through increased interoperability and coordination with NATO. The charter does not provide security guarantees to Georgia, and U.S.-Georgian defense cooperation programs are still being developed. The U.S.-Georgia Charter on Strategic Partnership, signed in January 2009, aims to reaffirm the United States' high strategic interest in Georgia's fate. Some critics suggest re-evaluating U.S. support for Georgia, arguing that policymakers have been captivated by Saakashvili's personality and overlooked his bellicosity. They propose encouraging reconciliation and considering options other than reintegration of regions into Georgia. Many in Congress support Georgia's NATO aspirations, with legislation endorsing NATO enlargement and urging NATO to extend a Membership Action Plan (MAP) for Georgia. Congressional support was further demonstrated through resolutions stressing Georgia's NATO aspirations and calling for free and fair elections. Additionally, there were calls for NATO to enter into a MAP with Georgia and Ukraine, with similar legislation approved by both the Senate and the House. On February 19, 2008, a group of six Members led by Senator Joseph Lieberman urged Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice to support a Membership Action Plan (MAP) for Georgia and Ukraine. The House approved H.Res. 1166 on May 7, 2008, endorsing NATO's pledge for eventual membership for Georgia and calling for a MAP to be offered to Georgia by the end of the year."
