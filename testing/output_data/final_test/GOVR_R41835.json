    "content": "State revenues declined during the recent economic recession, leading to spending cuts in public programs and for public employees. The recession also increased Medicaid enrollment, resulting in higher state spending on benefits. With declining tax revenue and balanced budget requirements, states face tough decisions on where to allocate limited funds. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 included a temporary increase in FMAP rates to help states maintain their Medicaid programs. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 provided temporary Assistance Percentage (FMAP) rates to help states maintain their Medicaid programs. States had to adhere to Maintenance of Effort (MOE) requirements to receive federal matching funds. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act extended and expanded the MOE provisions to ensure eligibility standards for Medicaid and CHIP. Under the ACA MOE, states must maintain Medicaid and CHIP programs with the same eligibility standards until 2014. Failure to comply would result in the loss of federal matching funds. Medicaid-eligible adults may access subsidized coverage through state exchanges starting in 2014. The MOE requirement for Medicaid and CHIP-eligible children extends through September 30, 2019. States cannot cut Medicaid costs by restricting eligibility due to MOE requirements. States have focused on cost containment strategies for Medicaid by reducing provider rates, changing benefit packages, and limiting benefits. With the phase-out of enhanced federal funding in 2011, states seek congressional relief from MOE requirements to restrict eligibility and control Medicaid expenditures. Recent legislative activity aims to repeal these requirements. Medicaid is a means-tested program that provides medical services to over 68 million eligible individuals. It is a joint federal-state program with total spending of $406 billion in FY2010, with the federal government covering $274 billion and states covering $132 billion. States must meet requirements to receive federal funding for their Medicaid programs. The Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) provides health coverage to uninsured, low-income children in families above Medicaid eligibility thresholds. It was established in 1997 and reauthorized in 2009. In FY2010, there were 7.7 million children and 347,143 adults enrolled in CHIP, with an estimated annual cost of $11.4 billion shared between the federal and state governments. CHIP, like Medicaid, is funded jointly by the federal government and states and is considered mandatory spending. The Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) operates as a capped entitlement to states, with all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and territories participating. During the recent recession, Congress provided additional funding, including a temporary increase in the Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP) rate. This temporary FMAP increase was later extended and runs for 11 quarters. The temporary FMAP increase, running for 11 quarters from FY2009 to FY2011, is subject to MOE requirements. Failure to comply with MOE means losing the increase in federal Medicaid matching funds. States can reinstate eligibility standards to receive the temporary FMAP increase. Under the Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act (CHIPRA) of 2009, states had to move childless adults out of CHIP by December 31, 2009, and could enroll them in Medicaid with a waiver. Some states reversed eligibility restrictions due to ARRA requirements. Four initially ineligible states were cleared to receive the FMAP increase. Under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, states can now receive increased federal financing for Medicaid and CHIP. Starting in 2014, states must expand Medicaid eligibility to individuals under 65 with income up to 133% of the federal poverty level. Idaho, Michigan, and New Mexico are expected to benefit from this provision. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) requires states to maintain current Medicaid and CHIP eligibility levels, with provisions to ensure coverage for eligible individuals until the implementation of state health insurance exchanges in 2014. States must adhere to ACA's Medicaid Maintenance of Effort (MOE) provisions, including maintaining eligibility standards and procedures. The MOE for Medicaid-eligible children up to age 19 continues until September 30, 2019. Failure to comply with ACA MOE requirements would have consequences. The ACA requires states to maintain current Medicaid and CHIP eligibility levels until 2014. Failure to comply with the MOE requirements would result in a loss of federal Medicaid matching funds. States can be exempt from the MOE requirement if they have a budget deficit. This provision does not prevent states from making other Medicaid cuts. Arizona had. Arizona initially planned to reduce Medicaid eligibility but later decided not to due to concerns about violating the ACA's Maintenance of Effort (MOE) requirements. The Secretary of HHS clarified that Arizona was not required to renew its waiver demonstration beyond its expiration date. Governor Brownback of Kansas also requested approval to block grant the state's Medicaid program. Governor Brownback of Kansas requested approval to block grant the state's Medicaid program and seek a waiver of the Maintenance of Effort requirements from the Secretary of HHS. No formal waiver proposal submission detailing the proposal is publicly available yet. Two states, Maine and Hawaii, have certified budget shortfalls under their Section 1115 waiver programs, the first step in scaling back eligibility requirements. The state of Maine has CMS approval to scale back its eligibility requirements, while Hawaii is seeking approval to reduce coverage for childless adults. The CHIP-specific MOE provision mandates states to maintain income eligibility standards until September 30, 2019. States cannot implement more restrictive eligibility standards than those in place as of March 23, 2010. Arizona can expand income eligibility levels but cannot implement more restrictive standards than those in place before the Affordable Care Act. The state froze its CHIP program enrollment before the ACA was enacted, with approval from HHS. Prior to the Affordable Care Act, Arizona froze enrollment in its CHIP program. Some states are considering dropping out of Medicaid or reducing eligibility to save money. There is a proposed bill to repeal MOE requirements for Medicaid and CHIP. The proposed bill, H.R. 1683, aims to repeal MOE requirements for Medicaid and CHIP, with estimated federal deficit reduction of $2.1 billion over 2012-2021. CBO projects a decline in federal Medicaid spending by $1.5 billion over five years and a $8.8 billion decrease in CHIP spending over 10 years. These savings would be offset by increased enrollment in employer-sponsored plans and exchange subsidies. H.R. 1683 aims to repeal MOE requirements for Medicaid and CHIP, leading to a reduction in enrollment. CBO estimates that in 2013, about 400,000 individuals would be affected, with 300,000 becoming uninsured and 100,000 enrolling in employer-based coverage. In 2016, CHIP enrollment would decline by 1.7 million individuals, while employer-based insurance would increase by 700,000, resulting in approximately 300,000 individuals becoming uninsured."
