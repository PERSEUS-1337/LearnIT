    "content": "Federal agencies in the executive branch are divided into two categories: executive agencies and independent agencies. Executive agencies are under direct presidential control, while independent agencies have structural characteristics that limit presidential control. Common indicia of independence for independent agencies include for-cause removal protection, multi-member board structure, exemption from OMB legislative clearance, exemption from presidential review of rulemaking, and direct budget submissions to Congress. Independent agencies have characteristics that limit presidential control, such as for-cause removal protection. The President can only remove the head of an independent agency for misconduct, unlike executive agencies where the head serves at the pleasure of the President. The Supreme Court has upheld restrictions on the President's authority to remove officers in independent agencies. The head of an independent agency serves a fixed term and can only be removed for \"inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.\" This removal protection gives the agency more flexibility in decision-making as the President cannot remove the head simply due to policy disagreements. The Supreme Court has ruled that some officers have \"for cause\" removal protection even if the statute is silent on removal procedures. In Wiener v. United States, the Court ruled that the War Claims Commission (WCC) members cannot be removed at will by the President due to their fixed term and quasi-judicial role, similar to other entities with for cause removal protection. Lower courts have applied similar reasoning to SEC, FEC, and NCUA Board members. The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) Board members enjoy for cause removal protection, a notable characteristic of independent agencies. The Supreme Court has set limits on removal protections to ensure the faithful execution of laws. A double layer of for cause protection is deemed unconstitutional. Independent agencies may be directed by a multi-member board or commission. The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) Board members have for-cause removal protection, a key feature of independent agencies. Independent agencies may be led by a multi-member board to prevent one administrator from having too much influence. Congress may also impose restrictions on the composition of the board to ensure diverse views are considered in policy decisions. Independent agencies are structured to ensure each party has a voice in decision-making, with staggered officer terms to prevent simultaneous vacancies. Some agencies, like the Social Security Administration and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, are led by a single administrator. Agencies must submit legislative proposals to the Office of Management and Budget for review, known as \"legislative clearance,\" to align with the President's priorities. The administration requires agencies to submit draft bills consistent with the President's policy objectives. Some agencies may be exempt from OMB legislative clearance. Some agencies may be exempt from OMB legislative clearance, allowing them to express their own views on policies without the President's input. Independent agencies are also exempt from centralized review. Independent agencies are exempt from centralized review of agency rulemaking under Executive Order 12866, which requires agencies to submit significant regulations to OIRA for approval. OIRA's role is to ensure regulatory actions align with applicable law, the President's priorities, and the principles of the Executive order. One of OIRA's functions is to ensure regulations align with the Administration's policy priorities, but independent agencies are exempt from centralized review under Executive Order 12866. This exemption allows independent agencies to choose whether to have their rules reviewed by OIRA, potentially insulating them from presidential influence. Independent agencies have the option to submit regulatory plans to OIRA, outlining significant actions expected in the fiscal year. Budget requests are typically sent to OMB, which may be modified by the President before submission to Congress. This process may not reflect the agencies' original proposals but the President's priorities. Congress has prohibited OMB and the President from revising budget requests of certain agencies, allowing agencies like the Social Security Administration to submit their budgets directly to Congress without revision. This practice, known as concurrent budget submission, gives agencies the opportunity to appeal directly to Congress for their budget priorities while still allowing OMB to review and revise the proposal before inclusion in the President's budget. The OMB reviews and revises agency budget proposals before inclusion in the President's budget. Some agencies have independent litigating authority, providing insulation from presidential influence. The DOJ typically conducts litigation for federal agencies, but some agencies have varying degrees of independence in litigation. For example, the Executive Director of the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board can represent the Board in civil litigation. Some federal agencies have independent litigating authority, allowing them to represent themselves in civil litigation, excluding cases before the Supreme Court. The NCUA can litigate independently only for specific cases, such as seeking to dissolve a federal credit union. The FTC may represent itself before the Supreme Court under certain circumstances, without relying on the President for legal representation. Legislative and judicial agencies, like the GAO and the Architect of the Capitol, assist Congress in its legislative role and do not execute laws. Judicial agencies, such as the Administrative Office of the United States Courts, issue sentencing guidelines but do not regulate public conduct. These agencies are defined by their functions related to the historical mission of their respective branches. The Administrative Procedure Act (APA) defines \"agency\" for federal courts, setting default procedures for rulemaking and adjudications. The APA is crucial in administrative law, providing standards for judicial review. Other statutes reference the APA's definition of \"agency,\" such as the Negotiated Rulemaking Act and the Regulatory Flexibility Act. The APA defines \"agency\" for federal courts, encompassing all executive branch agencies except Congress and the judiciary, as well as courts martial and military authorities in war or occupied territory. The APA defines \"agency\" for federal courts, encompassing all executive branch agencies except Congress and the judiciary, as well as courts martial and military authorities in war or occupied territory. The term \"authority\" of the federal government is broadly interpreted to include various agencies like the DOJ, which consists of subunits like the DEA, FBI, and Bureau of Prisons. The definition of \"authority\" is not clearly defined, but courts have applied a broad reading to include both executive and independent agencies under the APA. The APA defines \"agency\" broadly for federal courts, encompassing executive and independent agencies with substantial independent authority. The key test is whether the entity has the authority to act with government sanction. Even entities with purely advisory functions, like nongovernmental consultants, may not qualify as agencies if they lack binding decision-making power. The determination of whether an entity qualifies as an agency is largely a question of fact due to the wide variety of organizational structures in the government. The APA defines \"agency\" broadly for federal courts, encompassing executive and independent agencies with substantial independent authority. The key test is whether the entity has the authority to act with government sanction. An agency must have the power to exercise government authority to qualify. Entities like the President-elect's transition staff or the National Academy of Sciences may not qualify as agencies under the APA because they do not have the necessary authority. State-level agencies and private firms providing services to federal agencies are also excluded as they do not exercise federal government power. Congress may establish entities explicitly not considered \"agencies\" with federal government power, such as the Legal Services Corporation. Entities that exercise government authority and are subject to constitutional constraints may not be considered agencies under the APA. For example, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board is subject to the Constitution's Appointments Clause but is not a government agency for statutory purposes. Congress can direct entities not subject to the APA to comply with its provisions, such as the United States Sentencing Commission in the judicial branch. Some entities that appear independent of the federal government can still fall within its jurisdiction. Some entities that seem independent of the federal government can still be considered agencies under the APA if they perform governmental functions. The Federal Reserve Banks and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, despite some independence, must comply with the APA in certain situations. The key factor is whether an entity exercises federal government authority. The President is a major exception as the Supreme Court has ruled that the President is not an agency under the APA. The Supreme Court ruled that the President is not considered an \"agency\" under the APA, citing respect for the separation of powers. However, entities within the Executive Office of the President can qualify as agencies under the APA, such as the OMB. The Executive Office of the President can qualify as an agency under the APA, with various management and administrative functions. The Freedom of Information Act defines an agency broadly, covering all authorities of the US Government in the executive branch. FOIA requires agencies to provide access to certain records unless exempted. The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) applies to the Executive Office of the President and independent regulatory agencies, but not to Congress, the courts, or government of US territories. Congress aimed to expand the definition of agency in the APA to include government corporations, government-controlled corporations, and functional entities in the Executive Office of the President. However, corporations that receive federal funds but are not chartered or controlled by the government are not covered by FOIA. The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) applies to government entities chartered or controlled by the government, such as the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. Records at \"government owned contractor operated\" (GOCO) entities can be subject to FOIA if controlled by an agency. The definition of agency has limits, excluding the President's immediate personal staff. In Kissinger v. Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, the Supreme Court ruled that Henry Kissinger's telephone records as an assistant to the President were not agency records under FOIA. Entities within the Executive Office of the President that have the power to issue formal commands are considered agencies subject to FOIA. However, certain entities, even if established by Congress, may not be considered agencies under FOIA if the government does not exercise sufficient control over their establishment. For example, the American National Red Cross, despite having governors appointed by the President and operating under a congressional charter, is not subject to FOIA. The Federal Records Act (FRA) defines \"federal agency\" as any executive agency or any entity subject to federal financial reporting and audit requirements. The FRA aims to ensure efficient management of federal agency records, which are eventually sent to the Archives. The Federal Records Act (FRA) defines \"federal agency\" broadly to include executive agencies, entities in the legislative and judicial branches, and lower federal courts. It covers not only executive agencies but also entities subject to federal financial reporting and audit requirements. The FRA aims to ensure efficient management of federal agency records, which are eventually sent to the Archives. The Presidential Records Act applies to units advising the President without independent authority. Statutes define \"agency\" by 5 U.S.C. Section 105, excluding judicial branch agencies. Executive agencies are defined as Executive departments, Government corporations, and independent establishments. This definition excludes entities like the Atomic Energy Commission and the Postal Service. Section 103 defines a government corporation as a corporation owned or controlled by the government of the United States. Examples include the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation and the Federal Prison Industry. Section 104 defines an \"independent establishment\" as an establishment in the executive branch that is not part of an Executive department, military department, or Government corporation. Some courts have interpreted Section 104 to mean that if an entity is within an \"Executive department,\" then certain statutes regulating the civil service may not be enforceable against the immediate \"agency\" employing a claimant. For example, one court ruled that under 5 U.S.C. Section 7114(a)(2), the relevant defendant was not the Defense Logistics Agency, but the Department of Defense as a whole. Similarly, under the Federal Labor-Management Relations Act, another court ruled on the appropriate application of the law. The Paperwork Reduction Act was enacted by Congress to reduce the paperwork burden for individuals and businesses resulting from the collection of information by or for the federal government. It requires agencies to get approval from OIRA before requesting information from 10 or more nonfederal persons. The Act defines terms like \"agency\" and \"independent regulatory agency,\" which are referenced in other statutes and executive orders. The term \"agency\" is broadly defined to include various establishments in the executive branch of the Government. The Paperwork Reduction Act defines terms like \"agency\" and \"independent regulatory agency\" broadly, encompassing government-controlled establishments in the executive branch but excluding specific entities like the Government Accountability Office and Federal Election Commission. The scope of the definition appears to be limited to the executive branch. The Paperwork Reduction Act broadly defines terms like \"agency\" and \"independent regulatory agency\" within the executive branch. Executive Order 12866 sets guidelines for agencies to follow in the rulemaking process, referencing the definition of \"agency\" from the Paperwork Reduction Act. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit ruled that the U.S. Postal Service is not considered an agency under the Paperwork Reduction Act. President Clinton's Executive Order 12866 aims to streamline the regulatory process. Executive Order 12866 defines \"agency\" by referencing the definition in the Paperwork Reduction Act, excluding independent regulatory agencies. Some provisions, like submitting regulations for publication, apply to both types of agencies. The Order does not allow for judicial review of actions taken under it, leading to a lack of judicial decisions on the scope of the term \"agency\" in this context."
