Qualified business refers to a sole proprietorship, partnership, or corporation with at least 40% of total gross income derived from active conduct. The credit for the taxable year is derived from the active conduct of transporting persons or property for hire, and in the case of a partnership or corporation where all equity interests are held by one individual.
