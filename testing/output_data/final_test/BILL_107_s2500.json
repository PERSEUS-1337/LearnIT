    "content": "SECTION 1. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE. Congress finds that the September 11, 2001, attack on the World Trade Center was the greatest act of terrorism against the US. The Federal Government responded quickly to aid in the rebuilding of New York City. The NYC public schools community, including over a million students and staff, was severely impacted by the events. Many students and staff lost family members. The NYCPS faculty and staff reacted promptly to the crisis. The NYCPS faculty and staff showed extraordinary calm, grace, and bravery in evacuating all children safely without any injuries. The Chancellor and school officials worked tirelessly to resume classes and restore a safe, supportive environment after the 9/11 attacks. After the 9/11 attacks, the closure of bridges and tunnels to Manhattan affected over 50,000 students from other boroughs attending school in Manhattan, leading to travel disruptions and lost instructional time. Extended classroom instruction is necessary for these students to prevent a decline in performance on standardized tests. Failure to adequately prepare students may impact their performance on State assessments. The New York City Board of Education study found significant mental health effects on schoolchildren post-9/11, impacting students citywide. Inadequate preparation for exams may lead to grade repetition and strain school resources. Schoolchildren in grades 4 through 12 are experiencing trauma-related disorders following the 9/11 attack, including major depression, post-traumatic stress, agoraphobia, separation anxiety, acting out, general anxiety, and panic anxiety. The NYCPS system requires additional resources for mental health and trauma counseling to support affected students. The NYCPS system incurred significant costs from the terrorist attack, including cleanup, repair, loss of textbooks, and transportation revenue losses. Federal agencies have not provided adequate resources to address these costs. The Federal Government has assisted other school systems after traumatic events and needs to partner with NYCPS to ensure similar support. The purpose of this Act is to ensure that the Federal Emergency Management Agency provides necessary resources to the New York City public school system to meet expenses from the September 11 terrorist attack and prevent financial losses from affecting the system's ability to provide education. The Act aims to prevent financial losses from hindering the New York City public school system's ability to provide a high-quality education to all students. SEC. 2. USE OF FUNDS. From the 2002 FEMA appropriations, $161,000,000 can be used to compensate the NYC Board of Education for expenses related to providing services to students affected by the 9/11 terrorist attack, including additional classroom instruction and mental health counseling. The government allocated funds for various support services for students affected by the 9/11 terrorist attack, including mental health counseling, grief support, facility repairs, textbook reimbursement, and student relocation. Reimbursement for student transportation to temporary school facilities, including bus service costs, loss of perishable food stock, and revenue lost from food services."
