    "content": "There are over 60 offices of inspectors general (OIGs) in executive and legislative branch agencies, along with special inspectors general (SIGs) responsible for audits and investigations. They derive their authorities from the Inspector General Act of 1978. Congress has established SIGs like SIGIR, SIGAR, and SIGTARP, granting them similar authorities as federal establishment IGs appointed by the President. The Inspector General Act of 1978 established two types of IGs: federal establishment IGs appointed by the President and designated federal entity (DFE) IGs appointed by agency heads. IGs have independence, authority, and resources to combat fraud, waste, and abuse. They operate under the \"general supervision\" of the agency head and have statutory purposes including conducting audits, investigations, and providing policy recommendations for agency programs. The Inspector General Act of 1978 established two types of IGs: federal establishment IGs appointed by the President and designated federal entity (DFE) IGs appointed by agency heads. IGs have independence, authority, and resources to combat fraud, waste, and abuse. They must keep the agency head and Congress informed about problems with agency programs through reports and testimony. IGs have access to agency information, subpoena power, and independent law enforcement authority to report suspected violations of federal law promptly. The Inspector General Act of 1978 established federal establishment IGs appointed by the President to combat fraud, waste, and abuse. IGs have independence, authority, and resources to report violations of federal law to the Attorney General. Currently, there are 30 establishment IGs appointed by the President across various departments and agencies. The Inspector General Act of 1978 established federal IGs appointed by the President to combat fraud, waste, and abuse. Currently, there are 30 establishment IGs across various departments and agencies, including the Environmental Protection Agency, General Services Administration, NASA, Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and others. Additionally, IGs may be established in commissions created under 40 U.S.C. \u00a7 15301. The Federal Housing Finance Agency now includes 29 DFE IGs appointed by agency heads in various agencies such as Amtrak, Federal Reserve, FCC, and others. The IG Act of 1978 established inspectors general (IGs) in executive branch agencies and other entities, including the legislative branch, special IGs, and IGs for the CIA and ODNI. The IG Act Amendments of 1988 expanded the number of presidentially appointed establishment IGs and created DFE IGs. The key differences between establishment IGs and DFE IGs include the appointing authority, budgeting process, and compliance with independence requirements. The budget process for DFE IGs is part of the parent entity's budget process, as stated in a 1992 OMB guidance memorandum. Entity heads must consider the impact of budget decisions on the IG's ability to fulfill its statutory responsibilities. The Reform Act introduced additional safeguards for IG budgets. The Reform Act introduced safeguards for IG budgets, including reporting the IG's initial budget estimate to the establishment or DFE head for inclusion in the President's budget submission. Differences exist between establishment IGs and DFE IGs in terms of selection processes and budget considerations. DFE IGs are exempt from certain sections of the IG Act that mandate the selection and employment of officers and employees in establishment IG offices according to civil service laws. DFE IGs must be appointed by the agency head in accordance with applicable laws and regulations, and they are responsible for hiring employees for their offices following relevant laws and regulations. The Reform Act specifies differences in legal counsel usage between establishment and DFE IGs. Establishment IGs must receive legal advice from an attorney hired under civil service laws, while DFE IGs have three options for obtaining counsel. The Reform Act established pay differences between establishment and DFE IGs, with establishment IGs receiving increased pay linked to the Executive Schedule, while DFE IGs are classified based on senior level executives' pay but with limitations on pay increases. The Reform Act established pay differences between establishment and DFE IGs, with establishment IGs receiving increased pay linked to the Executive Schedule. DFE IGs are classified based on senior level executives' pay with limitations on pay increases. The Reform Act required DFE IGs to be appointed based on skills in auditing or relevant areas, regardless of political affiliation, integrity, and demonstrated ability in various fields. Additionally, the CIGIE must submit recommendations for nominees to various IG positions. The Reform Act granted law enforcement authority to DFE IGs, including the ability to carry firearms and make arrests without warrants. It also addressed the protection and removal of establishment IGs, requiring notification to Congress 30 days before any removal or transfer. The Reform Act granted law enforcement authority to DFE IGs, including the ability to carry firearms and make arrests without warrants. Previously, DFE heads had to notify Congress in writing 30 days before removing or transferring an IG. Proposed changes in select bills in the 111th Congress aim to establish new OIGs or affect existing ones, such as elevating five DFE IGs in entities addressing financial issues. H.R. 885 aims to elevate certain Inspectors General (IGs) in designated federal entities to presidentially appointed, Senate-confirmed positions. The IGs currently serving in these entities could continue until new appointments are made. The legislation ensures that changes do not impact existing pay structures for IGs and other employees. H.R. 885 aims to elevate five designated federal entity Inspectors General to presidentially appointed positions, granting them the authority to subpoena testimony and documents from agency employees, contractors, grantees, and regulated entities. H.R. 885 would elevate five federal entity Inspectors General to presidentially appointed positions, granting them subpoena authority and requiring agency heads to address deficiencies identified in reports. The discussion draft of H.R. 3126 and H.R. 3962 propose the creation of Inspector General positions for the Consumer Financial Protection Agency (CFPA) and the Health Choices Administration (HCA) respectively. These IGs would have authority to address deficiencies and conduct audits, evaluations, and investigations. The Inspector General for the Health Choices Administration (HCA) would have the authority to conduct audits, evaluations, and investigations related to fraud, abuse, and misconduct in health benefits plans participating in the Health Insurance Exchange. They would also have access to relevant records, including claims paid by these plans. This authority would not limit the duties of the HHS IG. The HCA and IG would not limit the HHS IG's oversight of fraud and abuse in connection with payments under the public health insurance option. Elevating DFE IGs to PAS positions is within Congress's discretion as provided for in the Constitution. Congress may create PAS positions for advice and consent. This section discusses potential considerations. The section discusses potential considerations for converting DFE IGs into PAS positions, including options for Congress to take such as adding a sunset provision for evaluation. CRS does not take a stance on the most desirable option, highlighting both positive and negative effects of converting these positions. The PAS process for appointing IGs has both advantages and disadvantages. Advantages include increased ethical and political scrutiny, greater credibility for appointees, and indirect Senate influence. Disadvantages may include deterring qualified candidates due to politicization and extensive paperwork requirements. The establishment of additional PAS positions for IGs may increase Senate workload and consume resources. Senate confirmation may enhance IG credibility and accountability to Congress. Specific commitments for future testimony during confirmation hearings could streamline the process. During the confirmation process, the PAS may increase congressional involvement in the organization and activities of the DFE. Confirmation hearings for the IG could be used for oversight of the DFE. The IG appointee's relationships with Senators and congressional staff may have limited practical effect due to reporting requirements. Maintaining the status quo for IGs provides the President with greater flexibility in managing staff. The potential conversion of IG positions to presidential appointments may increase indirect congressional control, potentially undermining presidential authority. However, IGs already have statutory responsibilities and specified qualifications, which may limit the impact on presidential power. The President may gain more control over the appointment of DFE IGs under the status quo, but independent agencies like the Federal Reserve, CFTC, NCUA, and SEC are insulated from complete Executive Branch control due to multi-member boards with staggered terms. The President may have more control over the appointment of DFE IGs if they are converted to PAS positions, potentially allowing for greater influence over agency heads and posing questions of intrusion on IG independence. The President's control over the appointment of DFE IGs may increase if they are converted to PAS positions. This could lead to greater influence over agency heads and potential questions about IG independence. The Senate confirmation process for presidential appointees may face complications, such as holds on nominations, giving the Senate leverage in negotiations with the Executive Branch. The appointment process may be lengthy, resulting in longer vacancies. The GAO has issued reports on IG structural changes, including the conversion of DFE IGs to presidential appointments. The GAO recommended converting DFE IGs from agency head appointments to presidential appointments to enhance independence, efficiency, and effectiveness. There was disagreement among DFE and establishment IGs on the impact of conversion, with presidentially appointed IGs seeing benefits and DFE IGs expressing concerns. GAO called for dialogue among Congress, the IG community, and affected agencies on specific conversions. The GAO recommended converting DFE IGs to presidential appointments to improve independence, efficiency, and effectiveness. GAO's testimony highlighted that changing the appointment process for IGs could enhance their independence."
