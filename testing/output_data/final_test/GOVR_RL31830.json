    "content": "The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) authorizes federal funding for the education of children with disabilities, requiring the provision of a free appropriate public education (FAPE) and detailed due process provisions. IDEA was enacted in 1975 in response to the need to educate children with disabilities. It has been amended multiple times, most recently in 1997. Congress is currently reviewing IDEA, with H.R. 1350 passing the House in 2003. The House Subcommittee on Education Reform and the full Committee on Education and the Workforce marked up H.R. 1350 in April 2003. The bill was favorably reported by the Committee with a vote of 29 to 19. The Senate also reviewed the bill, with S. 1248 being reported out of committee in June 2003. Several issues, including mandatory full funding and parental choice provisions, were not included in the final version of H.R. 1350. The definitions in current law remained largely unchanged by the bill. The definitions in current law were largely unchanged by H.R. 1350, with a notable amendment to the definition of FAPE. The amendment added a provision to ensure educational benefit for children with disabilities accessing the general curriculum. The amendment in H.R. 1350 aims to align IDEA with the requirements for highly qualified teachers under the No Child Left Behind Act. It also includes a new definition of \"highly qualified\" and discusses the definitions of children with disabilities. An amendment passed on the House floor emphasizes the importance of diagnosing disabilities for students under IDEA. H.R. 1350 aims to align IDEA with requirements for highly qualified teachers under the No Child Left Behind Act. It includes a new definition of \"highly qualified\" and discusses the definitions of children with disabilities. The bill would require GAO studies on various IDEA issues, including a review of state variations in definitions and evaluation processes for providing services to children with specific conditions. Minimal changes would be made to IDEA state and substate grant formulas, simplifying language and eliminating outdated provisions. H.R. 1350 would limit the number of children with disabilities counted for determining state grants to 13.5% of all children aged 3 to 17. This change aims to prevent states from over-identifying children with disabilities to increase their grants. The bill specifies authorized amounts for Part B appropriations, except for the preschool program under section 619. The authorized amounts for Part B appropriations increase annually from FY2004 to FY2010, reaching $25.2 billion authorized. After FY2010, authorizations would return to \"such sums\" for FY2011 and subsequent fiscal years, maintaining the permanent authorization of Part B grants to states. H.R. 1350 would also make changes in provisions governing state reserves for administration and other state-level activities. H.R. 1350 would make changes in provisions governing state reserves for administration and other state-level activities, potentially overriding current law on state set-asides. States can currently retain about 10% of their state grants for administration, but this percentage may change in the future. H.R. 1350 would set the maximum amount states can retain for state-level activities at the FY2003 level if their grant is equal to or greater than that year. The bill also increases the state minimum for administration to $750,000 and allows states to use up to 40% of the reserved funds for assisting in educating children with low incidence, high cost disabilities. The Supreme Court case Cedar Rapids Community School District v. Garret F. addressed the issue of providing extensive services to a child with disabilities at school. The court ruled that the school must provide these services as long as they are not medical services requiring a physician. Current law specifies uses for reserves for state-level activities related to children with disabilities. H.R. 1350 would expand permitted uses of funds for these activities. H.R. 1350 aims to expand permitted uses of funds for state-level activities related to children with disabilities, including implementing voluntary binding arbitration and developing a prereferral educational support system. The bill would also require states to distribute the remaining funds to local educational agencies, with changes to the language of section 612(a) of IDEA. The House report discusses a change in language regarding oversight standards in H.R. 1350, aimed at ensuring compliance with the Act for children with disabilities. The change allows states to reasonably demonstrate their policies and procedures to the Secretary, without implying a lack of need for effective implementation. The modification is intended to focus the Secretary on ensuring effective policies and procedures are in place. H.R. 1350 aims to align state eligibility requirements with the No Child Left Behind Act, specifically focusing on special education teacher qualifications in core academic subjects. It also adjusts state personnel standards and performance goals to meet NCLBA requirements. The state eligibility sections of IDEA address children with disabilities in private schools, including provisions for when they are unilaterally placed by parents or public agencies. States must allocate a proportionate amount of IDEA funds for children unilaterally placed in private schools. Special education services can be provided on the premises of private schools. Currently, IDEA mandates that public agencies cover the costs for children with disabilities placed in private schools. Reimbursement may be required if FAPE was not provided in a timely manner. Limitations on reimbursement exist in certain situations, with exceptions to notice requirements. H.R. 1350 maintains the requirement for states to allocate IDEA funds for children in private schools. The bill clarifies that a proportionate amount must be used for direct services for children with disabilities placed by their parents in private schools. Exceptions to notice requirements exist for situations such as illiteracy, harm to the child, or lack of notice from the school. The House bill H.R. 1350 includes provisions for child find, consultation, and reimbursement for private school placement for children with disabilities. It ensures timely completion of child find process for children in private schools and requires consultation with private school officials. H.R. 1350 would address concerns regarding consultation and reimbursement for private school placement for children with disabilities. It allows the private school official to complain to the Secretary of Education if dissatisfied with the state's decision. The bill also includes exceptions to the notice requirement to prevent reduction or denial of reimbursement in certain situations. Additionally, reimbursement may not be reduced for failure to provide notice if the parent is illiterate or compliance would result in serious emotional harm. H.R. 1350 would make changes to local educational agency eligibility, allowing funds to be used for high-cost special education services. It also maintains financial requirements such as supplementing special education funding and the maintenance of effort requirement. LEAs can count up to 20% of the increase in funding. H.R. 1350 allows LEAs to use increased IDEA funds for ESEA programs and modifies state oversight. It adds permitted uses of funds and requires SEAs to prohibit LEAs unable to provide free appropriate public education. H.R. 1350 aligns IDEA with the No Child Left Behind Act by allowing funds for additional expenses in schools identified for improvement. It also permits LEAs to use funds for high-cost special education services, technology, and prereferral services for students needing academic and behavioral support. H.R. 1350 aligns IDEA with the No Child Left Behind Act by allowing funds for additional expenses in schools identified for improvement. It permits LEAs to provide educational and behavioral support for students needing academic assistance, including literacy instruction, and professional development for teachers. The bill also amends provisions related to evaluations, assessments, and Individualized Education Plans (IEP), including determining specific learning disabilities without using a discrepancy between achievement and intellectual ability. H.R. 1350 expands LEA flexibility under IDEA by allowing initial evaluations without parental consent. If parents do not consent or respond, LEAs are not required to provide special education services or hold IEP meetings. The bill aims to reduce paperwork for teachers and schools. The House bill H.R. 1350 aims to reduce paperwork requirements for teachers and schools by discontinuing the need for benchmarks and short term objectives in IEPs starting in 2005-2006. It also allows for flexibility in IEP team meetings, including excusing members, not reconvening the team, offering multi-year IEPs, and using alternative meeting methods like videoconferences. H.R. 1350 aims to reduce litigation and restore trust between parents and school systems by making significant changes to procedural safeguards for children with disabilities. This includes adding a statute of limitations for complaints and altering the substance of prior written notices provided by the LEA. H.R. 1350 aims to change procedural safeguards for children with disabilities by removing certain requirements in current law and altering the content and timing of providing procedural safeguards notices to parents. H.R. 1350 proposes changes to procedural safeguards for children with disabilities, including adding provisions for voluntary binding arbitration and resolution sessions. It would require procedures for mediation to be available for disputes prior to filing a complaint and for voluntary binding arbitration when a hearing is requested. The voluntary binding arbitration is to be voluntarily and knowingly agreed to in writing by the parties and conducted by a qualified, impartial arbitrator. The process is in lieu of a due process hearing and is final unless there is fraud or misconduct. The arbitration is scheduled timely and held at a convenient location. In cases involving the identification, evaluation, and educational placement of children with disabilities, parents have the right to an impartial due process hearing with the right to appeal. Parties have the right to legal counsel, present evidence, confront witnesses, and receive written findings. The decision from the hearing is final but can be appealed in court, with the possibility of attorneys' fees being awarded to the prevailing party. H.R. 1350 proposes significant changes to IDEA due process procedures, including the addition of a \"resolution session\" before a due process hearing. This session allows the parents of a child with a disability to discuss their complaint with the LEA in an attempt to resolve it. The hearing can be requested by either the parents or the LEA and will be conducted by the SEA. H.R. 1350 introduces a \"resolution session\" before a due process hearing for IDEA complaints. If the LEA does not resolve the complaint within 30 days, the hearing will occur. The resolution session does not provide procedural safeguards like the right to counsel or cross-examine witnesses. Parents cannot raise new issues at the due process hearing that were not in the original complaint. The amendment in the full Committee markup changes how attorneys' fees are determined, shifting the responsibility to the Governor or appropriate state official instead of the court. Attorneys' fees for prevailing parties in IDEA cases are based on community rates without bonuses or multipliers, with specific prohibitions and restrictions on fee amounts. The amendment in the full Committee markup changes how attorneys' fees are determined in IDEA cases, shifting responsibility to the Governor or state official. Fees may not be awarded for services after a settlement offer to parents, and are not awarded for IEP team meetings unless convened due to administrative or judicial action. Attorneys' fees can be reduced if the parent unreasonably prolongs resolution or fees exceed community rates. The amendment in H.R. 1350 changes how attorneys' fees are determined in IDEA cases, with rates based on the Governor's determination for services provided. No bonus or multiplier can be used in fee calculations, and fees may be reduced if they exceed community rates or if the parent did not provide appropriate information in the due process complaint. H.R. 1350 amends the determination of attorneys' fees in IDEA cases, with rates set by the Governor and made public annually. It also introduces changes in disciplinary procedures for children with disabilities who violate rules, allowing for suspension or placement in alternative education settings. H.R. 1350 introduces changes in disciplinary procedures for children with disabilities, allowing for suspension or placement in an interim alternative education setting for up to forty-five days in cases involving weapons or drugs. A manifestation determination review is conducted to assess the link between the child's disability and misbehavior, with the possibility of long-term disciplinary action if behavior is not disability-related. School personnel can order a change in placement for a child violating student conduct rules. H.R. 1350 allows for the temporary placement of a child with a disability in an alternative educational setting for up to 45 school days for violating student conduct rules. This placement can be extended if required by state law for safety reasons. The bill removes the requirement for a manifestation determination review and allows for consideration of unique circumstances on a case-by-case basis. H.R. 1350 proposes changes to disciplinary procedures for children with disabilities, including removing the provision allowing application of procedures for children without disabilities. It also includes provisions for professional development for school administrators and data reporting requirements on children with disabilities subject to suspensions or expulsions. The proposed amendments to H.R. 1350 include collecting data on disciplinary actions based on race, ethnicity, and disability category, as well as emphasizing the importance of safe and drug-free schools for children with disabilities. Additionally, there is a provision stating that students with behavioral problems should be evaluated for disabilities by a certified professional before disciplinary actions are taken. H.R. 1350 proposes changes to section 616, including new monitoring and enforcement provisions for states failing to comply with Part B funding requirements. The Secretary of Education would be required to monitor implementation using focused monitoring to improve educational outcomes for all children. The bill proposes focused monitoring to improve educational outcomes for children with disabilities, with the Secretary monitoring state indicators such as academic achievement and graduation rates. If a state is not making satisfactory progress, actions including technical assistance and withholding of funds may be taken. H.R. 1350 proposes withholding funds for state-level activities if a state is not in compliance with IDEA provisions. It also includes provisions for corrective action plans, special conditions on grants, and further enforcement actions for non-compliance. Additionally, the bill introduces amendments to sections 616 and 617, including a pilot program on paperwork and waivers for paperwork requirements by the Secretary of Education. H.R. 1350 allows the Secretary of Education to grant waivers for paperwork requirements to up to ten states for a maximum of four years. The bill also mandates the publication of model forms for IEPs and procedural safeguards notices. Additionally, it makes minor changes to services for preschool children and infants with disabilities. H.R. 1350 includes children with disabilities ages 3 to 5 in the definition of infants or toddlers with disabilities and modifies the exception for serving them in \"natural environments.\" It also revises Part D, which authorizes national activities, by re-arranging language and adding new findings. H.R. 1350 modifies and continues provisions of Part D, focusing on professional development activities with grants. It also authorizes grants for Community Parent Resource Centers to support parents of children with disabilities. H.R. 1350 would establish a National Center for Special Education Research to improve services for children with disabilities. It also includes provisions for the General Accounting Office to review paperwork requirements, differences in identifying children with disabilities, and explore distance learning for professional development in special education. Technological approaches for delivering professional development programs for special education personnel, a study of limited English proficient students under IDEA, and a study of state costs for complying with IDEA requirements."
