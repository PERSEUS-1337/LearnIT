    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature in California acknowledges the increasing mental health needs among public college students, with one in four students having a diagnosable mental illness. The lack of mental health services on campuses impacts students' academic success and social development. The effects of untreated mental health needs among college students can lead to dropping out, homelessness, and suicide. Suicide is a significant cause of death among college students, with one in 10 students considering it. Investing in student mental health services can result in a return of $6 to $11 for every dollar spent. At least 51 percent of the Prevention and Early Intervention Fund in California is designated for individuals 25 years old or younger. The Mental Health Services Act aims to promote partnerships between counties and college campuses to address the mental health needs of students. The College Mental Health Services Program Act establishes funding for a grant program to support mental health services on college campuses. The commission will create a grant program with county behavioral health departments to improve mental health services in public colleges and universities. Guidelines and a request for application will be developed, outlining eligibility standards and required program components. This program aims to address the needs of students that cannot be met through existing funds. The grant program aims to improve mental health services in public colleges and universities by funding matching components, establishing direct linkages for students to community-based mental health services, addressing direct services, and participating in evidence-based programs. Preferred components include serving underserved populations and establishing linkages for students to access reimbursable mental health services. The campus's ability to address racial disparities in mental health access, fund stigma reduction activities, provide education on early identification and intervention, screen students for mental health needs, and partner with county behavioral health departments to meet complex mental health needs based on insurance status. The campus must have a partnership with local safety net providers for primary and mental health care, regardless of student insurance status. Grant program goals, reporting standards, timelines, and deadlines are outlined. Colleges collaborate with county behavioral health departments for grant applications. The commission approves grant programs meeting guidelines and awards funding. Grants may be awarded to community college districts, CSU or UC campuses, or groups of campuses. Funding is based on student population, capped at $5 million per campus. Grants are awarded based on a dollar-for-dollar match of funds or another determined match. Matching funds can include various sources. Grants are awarded competitively based on meeting application standards. Allocations must be spent over one to three years. Administrative costs for approved programs are limited to 5% of the grant amount. Funding cannot replace existing mental health service funds. The commission offers technical assistance for equitable distribution of grants. Community colleges, CSU campuses, and UC campuses receiving grants must annually report on grant fund usage, evaluation data, program information, and sustainability plans. Reports must be submitted electronically to the Chancellor's offices and UC Office of the President. The commission will contract with a research institute to evaluate the program and develop an evaluation plan. Final research design and proposal must be submitted to the Joint Legislative Budget Committee before executing the contract. The commission will submit an evaluation to the Legislature annually, starting February 1, 2019, assessing the program's impact and providing recommendations. The report will include financial accounting, evaluation data, program information, and plans for sustainability beyond grant funding. The commission will provide a financial accounting of administrative expenditures. This part will be in effect until January 1, 2022, unless extended or deleted by a later statute."
