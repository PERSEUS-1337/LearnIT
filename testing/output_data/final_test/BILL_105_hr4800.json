Each year, 51,000 people die from traumatic brain injuries and 4,500,000 people live with lifelong disabilities as a result. Additionally, approximately 10,000 people sustain spinal cord injuries annually, with 200,000 living with severe disabilities. Establishing a nationwide registry system will help identify those affected by these injuries, understand their impact, and improve access to necessary services. The Public Health Service Act is amended to include a National Program for Traumatic Brain Injury and Spinal Cord Injury Registries. This program aims to establish registries to track and understand the impact of these injuries, improve access to services, and help those affected. The Secretary may grant funds to operate traumatic brain injury and spinal cord injury registries, collect data on demographic and clinical aspects, and conduct applied research to support registry development. The Secretary may grant funds for traumatic brain injury and spinal cord injury registries to collect data on severity, treatments, outcomes, impairments, limitations, and other relevant elements determined appropriate. Eligibility for grants requires an approved application submitted to the Secretary. Each applicant must submit an application with specified information and assurances to use funds for approved purposes. They must establish fiscal control procedures and comply with review requirements. Additionally, applicants must establish registries before receiving Federal funds for traumatic brain injury and spinal cord injury data collection. The establishment of a registry for traumatic brain injury and spinal cord injury data collection must comply with standards, provide periodic reports, and be authorized under State law. Regulations must ensure timely and complete reporting to the statewide registry by hospitals and facilities. The statewide registry for traumatic brain injury and spinal cord injury requires reporting by healthcare practitioners and facilities to ensure comprehensive data collection. The statewide traumatic brain injury and spinal cord injury registry allows access to records of healthcare facilities and providers to identify cases and characteristics of injuries and treatments. The statewide traumatic brain injury and spinal cord injury registry requires reporting of case data in a specific format and with established standards. Applicants for applied research must conduct research to support registry activities. Assurances for confidentiality of registry data are also required. Assurances for confidentiality of registry data include providing means for disclosure of data to researchers for prevention and research purposes, as well as authorization for studies utilizing registry data. The curr_chunk discusses evaluations of diagnostic, rehabilitative, and preventative services for traumatic brain and spinal cord injuries, as well as the protection of individuals providing case reports to the statewide registry. The curr_chunk focuses on access to traumatic brain injury and spinal cord injury case information in the statewide registry, emphasizing individual privacy and confidentiality. The Secretary may provide technical assistance to States in establishing and operating statewide registries for traumatic brain and spinal cord injuries, including help with legislation and data systems. $10,000,000 is authorized for fiscal year 1999, with additional funding for 2000-2004. The definitions of spinal cord injury and traumatic brain injury are clarified in this section, excluding certain causes such as congenital disorders or tumors. The Secretary has the authority to revise these definitions as needed."
