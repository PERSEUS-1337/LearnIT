    "content": "The \"Medicare Common Access Card Act of 2017\" may be cited as the official title. A new section, 1866F, is added to Part E of title XVIII of the Social Security Act, establishing the Medicare Smart Card Pilot Program. The Secretary will establish a pilot program to demonstrate the feasibility of using smart card technology for Medicare beneficiaries within 36 months of the enactment of the section. Smart card technology is defined as a fraud- and tamper-resistant card with an embedded integrated circuit chip for secure authentication of beneficiary identity at the point of service. The pilot program will use smart card technology for Medicare beneficiaries to authenticate their identity at the point of service through a combination of the smart card and a personal identification number. Card reader technology will enable suppliers and providers to authenticate the beneficiary's identity, with authentication reflected in the claims adjudication process. The program will run for 3 years with the selection of the area determined in consultation with the Secretary. The Secretary will select geographic areas and supplier/provider types for the pilot program in consultation with the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services to mitigate fraud, waste, and abuse risks. The Secretary will limit the pilot program to 2,000 suppliers and providers and may exempt those without card reader technology, sufficient internet access, or low volume. The Secretary will issue beneficiary smart cards to Medicare beneficiaries in pilot program areas with low claim volume. The smart cards will contain information from Medicare cards used outside the pilot program. The pilot program provides Medicare beneficiaries and providers with information on privacy protections. Beneficiaries with smart cards can receive care from non-participating providers. Non-participating providers can still submit claims for services provided. The pilot program for Medicare beneficiaries includes services without smart card technology. A private sector contractor will implement the program with privacy protections in place to comply with Federal laws. The pilot program for Medicare beneficiaries requires mandatory participation from providers and suppliers in selected geographic areas. Payment under this program is contingent on participation, and definitions for 'supplier' and 'provider' are provided. The term 'Medicare beneficiary' refers to an individual enrolled in original Medicare fee-for-service program, while 'Medicare claim' is a claim for services under this title. The Secretary is required to submit reports to Congress, including an initial design report within 2 years of enactment. The Secretary must submit reports to Congress, including a plan for implementing the pilot program, an initial implementation report, an interim performance report after 2 years, and a final performance report 18 months after the pilot program completion. The Secretary will provide reports to Congress on the pilot program's performance and recommendations for expanding it. $150,000,000 will be transferred for the program from the Supplemental Medical Insurance Trust Fund."
