    "content": "The \"New Jersey Marine Ecosystem Protection Act of 1996\" aims to preserve and restore marine wildlife in the New York Bight by closing the Mud Dump Site and ending the disposal of contaminated dredged material in that area. After September 1, 1997, no one can dump dredged material at the Mud Dump Site unless it is for remediation purposes. Only Category I and Category II dredged material can be dumped at the site after the enactment of the Act. After September 1, 1997, dumping dredged material at the Mud Dump Site is only allowed for remediation purposes. Dumping requires certification and a finding from the Secretary of the Army, ensuring no increase in ocean bottom elevation beyond 65 feet below the surface. The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, in collaboration with the Secretary of Commerce and the Secretary of the Army, will develop a remediation and restoration plan for the Mud Dump Site and surrounding areas. The site will be designated as the Historic Area Remediation Site for disposal of contaminated material. The Historic Area Remediation Site, managed under part 228 of title 40, Code of Federal Regulations, must reduce impacts to acceptable levels and be remediated with uncontaminated dredged material meeting Category I standards. The Secretary of the Army and the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency will modify the Environmental Assessment.
