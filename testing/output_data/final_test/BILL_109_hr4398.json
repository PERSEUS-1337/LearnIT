In 1998, a lawsuit was filed against the USDA for discrimination against African-American farmers, leading to a civil rights settlement in 1999. The settlement between African-American farmers and the USDA in 1999 led to a five-year consent decree. However, delays in processing discrimination claims resulted in many farmers losing their right to file claims by July 14, 2000. The Subcommittee received testimony alleging serious violations of the right to notice regarding the consent decree for discrimination claims against the USDA.

Only 140 out of 10,745 timely requests for reconsideration have been approved.
