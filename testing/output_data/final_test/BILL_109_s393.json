    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Credit Card Minimum Payment Warning Act of 2005\" and includes enhanced consumer disclosures regarding minimum payments. The Truth in Lending Act is amended to include a new requirement for credit card billing statements. It mandates a minimum payment warning on the front page, informing consumers about the increased interest and extended repayment time if only minimum payments are made. The Truth in Lending Act now requires credit card billing statements to include a warning about the consequences of only making minimum payments. This warning includes the total cost to the consumer, a breakdown of costs in interest and principal, the monthly payment needed to pay off the balance in 36 months, and a toll-free number for credit counseling services. When making disclosures under the Truth in Lending Act, creditors must apply the interest rate in effect on the disclosure date. If the rate is temporary and subject to change based on a contractual provision or index, the creditor must use the initial rate until it expires, then switch to the adjusted rate specified in the contract. If an index is used, its value on the disclosure date is applied. The index on the disclosure date is used in the formula application. SEC. 3.
