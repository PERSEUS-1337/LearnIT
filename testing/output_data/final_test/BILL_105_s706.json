    "content": "The \"School Security Improvement Act of 1997\" may be cited as the short title for this Act. Congress recognizes the importance of safety and discipline in public schools, especially for students with disabilities who should be subject to the same disciplinary measures as students without disabilities if their misconduct is not related to their disability. Students with disabilities should be subject to the same disciplinary measures as students without disabilities if their misconduct is not related to their disability, which may include a cessation of educational services. The purposes of this Act are to allow educational entities to use fair disciplinary measures for all students, including those with disabilities, and to mandate including disciplinary actions in the educational records of students, transferring this information when students move between schools. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act now requires educational records to include disciplinary measures for students with disabilities, specifically for out-of-school suspensions over 10 days or expulsions. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act mandates that educational records must include disciplinary measures for students with disabilities, such as out-of-school suspensions over 10 days or expulsions. The act also requires schools to transmit this information when transferring a student to another school. The statement in the educational record may include details of the child's behavior, disciplinary measures taken, and other relevant information for the safety of the child and those involved. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act requires educational records to include disciplinary measures for students with disabilities. This includes using disciplinary measures when a child's behavior is not related to their disability. SEC. 615A states the use of disciplinary measures when a child's behavior is not a manifestation of their disability. A State educational agency, local educational agency, or intermediate educational unit can use long-term disciplinary measures for a child with a disability if the behavior is not related to their disability and the same measures apply to children with and without disabilities. The child must still receive educational services unless specified otherwise. The child must continue to receive educational services unless their behavior was not related to their disability and the educational entity's policy is to stop services for such behavior. This section does not limit the rights of children with disabilities under section 615. A long-term disciplinary measure is defined as an action lasting more than 10 school days. Additionally, there is an alternative educational placement for threatening behavior outlined in the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. The Disabilities Education Act is amended to include behavior posing a threat to safety in schools. The term 'child without a disability' is defined as a student not classified as disabled in elementary or secondary school. The Senate finds that Congress has not fulfilled its funding commitment for the State grant program under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, which was originally set at 40 percent of the national average per-pupil expenditure but has only been funded at 7 percent. It is recommended that Congress should provide funding at the 40 percent level as initially intended."
