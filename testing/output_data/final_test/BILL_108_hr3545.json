    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Southern Sea Otter Recovery and Research Act\". The Congress finds that southern sea otters were hunted to near extinction in the past, are now listed as a threatened species, and have significant importance to California and the Nation. Recent studies show that high mortality rates, especially in adult otters, are hindering population recovery. The major threats to the southern sea otter include degraded marine ecosystems, infectious diseases, contaminants, food limitations, and oil spills. Enacting provisions from the United States Fish and Wildlife Service could lead to delisting the otter under the Endangered Species Act. Research is crucial for otter population recovery and restoring coastal ecosystems. The Southern Sea Otter Recovery Program is outlined in Section 3. The Secretary of the Interior will implement a recovery program for southern sea otter populations in California, including monitoring demographics, protecting populations, addressing human-related threats, assessing otter health, and educating the public. The Secretary will annually report on the status of southern sea otter populations and develop a Health Assessment Plan in consultation with the Southern Sea Otter Recovery Implementation Team. Tissue samples will be collected and analyzed, then submitted to the Secretary of Commerce for inclusion in the National Marine Mammal Tissue Bank. Progress on the Health Assessment Plan will be reviewed. The Southern Sea Otter Health Assessment Plan, developed annually in consultation with the Southern Sea Otter Recovery Implementation Team, includes mechanisms to assess the immunology, virology, toxicology, parasitology, endocrinology, and nutritional status of sea otters. It also identifies centers of expertise and resources for plan implementation, with a focus on promoting ecosystem sustainability in collaboration with fisheries management agencies. The Southern Sea Otter Research Program is established under Section 4. The Secretary of the Interior will award competitive grants for research on southern sea otters, focusing on demographics, contaminant sequestration, diseases, parasites, and food limitations. Grant proposals must be recommended by an Advisory Board. The Secretary must submit grant proposals to the Southern Sea Otter Recovery Implementation Team and can only award grants recommended by the Team. SEC. 5. SOUTHERN SEA OTTER RECOVERY IMPLEMENTATION TEAM. The Secretary of the Interior will establish the Southern Sea Otter Recovery Implementation Team to make recommendations on program administration, research goals, stakeholder engagement, and funding for scientific research. The Team will consist of no more than 13 members with balanced representation. The Secretary, in consultation with the Marine Mammal Commission, appoints members of the Team from various backgrounds including Federal, State, and local agencies, marine user groups, conservation organizations, sea otter rescue groups, and scientific/educational organizations. The Team elects a chairman for a 3-year term. The Team elects a chairman for a 3-year term, with a limit of 2 terms. Members with conflicts of interest in proposal development cannot participate in grant reviews. The Secretary can provide staff and assistance as needed. The Team can establish subsidiary bodies and adopt internal regulations for administration. The Team conducts open public meetings at least once a year, with the chairman able to call for additional meetings. Meetings must be publicly noticed, and minutes must be kept with a summary of attendees and topics discussed. SEC. 6. SCIENTIFIC ADVISORY COMMITTEE. The Secretary will establish the Southern Sea Otter Recovery Scientific Advisory Committee to evaluate and recommend funding for research proposals related to southern sea otter recovery. The Advisory Committee will consist of no more than 11 members with a doctorate or equivalent. The Secretary will appoint members of the Southern Sea Otter Recovery Scientific Advisory Committee, including representatives from various agencies, marine user groups, conservation organizations, sea otter rescue groups, and scientific/educational organizations. The term for committee members is 3 years. The Advisory Committee members serve 3-year terms. Initial appointments include 3 members for 1 year and 3 members for 2 years. Members with conflicts of interest cannot participate in grant reviews for proposals they developed. Authorization of Appropriations: $5,000,000 authorized annually for fiscal years 2004-2009 for the Secretary of the Interior to implement the Act, with $2,000,000 allocated for grants under section 4. Administrative expenses capped at 6% or $80,000 per fiscal year for section 6 implementation."
