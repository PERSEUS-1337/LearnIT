    "content": "The \"Partial Hospitalization Services Integrity Act of 1999\" limits the provision of services to locations other than skilled nursing facilities or residential treatment facilities. The amendments apply to services furnished after the enactment of the Act. Additionally, qualifications for community mental health centers are outlined. The amendment to the Social Security Act specifies requirements for entities providing mental health services, including meeting licensing requirements and additional conditions set by the Secretary to ensure health and safety. The amendment to the Public Health Service Act clarifies criteria for community mental health centers, including determining the clinical appropriateness of admissions to psychiatric hospitals by licensed professionals. The amendment clarifies criteria for community mental health centers providing services under the Medicare program. The Secretary must establish guidelines for partial hospitalization services within 180 days of the Act's enactment, using a negotiated rulemaking process. Additionally, the periodicity of reviewing plans for these services will be refined. The amendment to the Social Security Act allows for reasonable rate determination for partial hospitalization services. The effective date applies to new plans established after the enactment of the Act. Providers of these services must undergo recertification. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will ensure recertification of community mental health centers providing partial hospitalization services under title XVIII of the Social Security Act. The first recertification must be done within one year of the Act's enactment. Additionally, civil monetary penalties will be imposed for false certification of eligibility for hospice care or partial hospitalization services. Section 1128A(b)(3) of the Social Security Act is amended to include hospice care and partial hospitalization services. The effective date for these amendments is specified. Additionally, a demonstration for cost-effective wrap-around mental health services is introduced. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will implement a demonstration project under part B of title XVIII of the Social Security Act for community mental health centers to offer wrap around mental health services. This includes comprehensive outpatient mental health services provided based on an individualized treatment plan developed by a mental health professional in consultation with the family. The term \"mental health professional\" refers to licensed individuals who provide coordinated therapeutic interventions, including medical, psychotherapy, occupational therapy, and social work services to individuals through a comprehensive health and social services delivery system. The Social Security Act allows certain healthcare practitioners to design and execute treatment plans without supervision. Community mental health centers serving specific populations are selected for participation in projects. Community mental health centers in three States, one serving rural populations, receive capitated payments for wrap-around mental health services. The Secretary evaluates the project's impact on beneficiaries' health and potential savings to the Medicare program. The Secretary evaluates the impact of capitated payments on mental health services and inpatient utilization, submitting a report to Congress with findings and recommendations. The project involves community mental health centers providing partial hospitalization services with payment on a capitated basis for a three-year period. Funding will be transferred from the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund for the costs of the demonstration project."
