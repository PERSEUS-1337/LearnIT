    "content": "Under U.S. law, international agreements can be entered into through treaties or executive agreements. The executive branch holds primary responsibility for these agreements, but Congress also plays a crucial role. Treaties require Senate approval by a two-thirds majority to become law, while congressional-executive agreements can be authorized by Congress. Implementing legislation is often needed for treaties and executive agreements to take effect domestically. Some executive agreements do not need congressional approval, but adherence may still rely on congressional funding or authorization. Under U.S. law, international agreements can be entered into through treaties or executive agreements. Treaties require Senate approval by a two-thirds majority, while executive agreements are made by the executive branch without Senate involvement. The Senate can condition its consent on certain reservations, declarations, and understandings, which may limit U.S. obligations under the agreement. Most international agreements the U.S. enters into are executive agreements, not treaties. Executive agreements in the U.S. can be categorized into three types: congressional-executive agreements, executive agreements made pursuant to an earlier treaty, and sole executive agreements. These agreements do not require Senate approval and are considered valid international compacts under Supreme Court jurisprudence. The reliance on executive agreements has increased significantly since World War II. The reliance on executive agreements in the U.S. has grown significantly since World War II, with the number of international agreements entered as executive agreements far surpassing those entered as treaties. Scholars have rejected the idea that certain agreements must be entered as treaties requiring Senate approval. Adjudication of executive agreements is rare due to difficulties in demonstrating standing to challenge an agreement. In 2001, the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals deemed the question of whether NAFTA required Senate approval as a nonjusticiable political issue. No executive agreement has been invalidated by the courts for being in contravention. As a matter of historical practice, some agreements are treated as treaties while others are considered executive agreements. Congressional-executive agreements involve both houses of Congress in the authorization process, with a statute passed by a majority of both houses. These agreements cover various topics like postal conventions, trade, and military assistance. Examples include NAFTA and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). Congressional-executive agreements can take different forms, such as legislation authorizing the executive to negotiate with other countries or a statute incorporating agreement terms into U.S. law. The legitimacy of agreements made pursuant to treaties is well established, though controversy may arise. The President's power to enter agreements required by a treaty is clear, but the Senate may condition treaty approval. The President's power to enter agreements required by a treaty is clear, but the Senate may condition treaty approval. Sole executive agreements rely on neither treaty nor congressional authority for their legal basis, and may be based on the President's constitutional authority in foreign affairs. The Litvinov Assignment is an example of a sole executive agreement. If the President enters into an executive agreement in an area where he has exclusive constitutional authority, it is legally permissible regardless of Congress's opinion. The President's power to enter agreements required by a treaty is clear, but the Senate may condition treaty approval. Sole executive agreements rely on the President's constitutional authority in foreign affairs. If Congress opposes an agreement and the President's authority is unclear, a court may consider Congress's position in determining enforceability. If Congress is silent or implicitly approves, a court may view the agreement as valid. Sole executive agreements do not require congressional approval to become binding. Sole executive agreements do not need congressional approval to become binding under international law. However, if they conflict with existing federal law, the earlier law takes precedence. Congress can still limit the agreement's effect through subsequent legislation if it has constitutional authority. In the security context, Congress can enact measures to restrict sole executive agreements involving military commitments. Congress has the authority to declare war, raise armies, maintain a navy, and make laws for the military. They can also call forth the militia for various purposes and make necessary laws to execute their powers. Additionally, Congress has virtual plenary power over military affairs. Congress has virtual plenary power over military affairs, including appropriations. The Appropriations Clause states that no money can be spent without congressional authorization. Congress can specify terms for fund use as long as they are not unconstitutional. Not all agreements with foreign parties are legally binding; some are political commitments or gentlemen's agreements. The executive can enter nonlegal agreements, known as \"gentlemen's agreements,\" with foreign states, which carry moral and political weight. These agreements do not require congressional authorization and are not subject to the same constitutional constraints as legally binding international agreements. An example is the 1975 Helsinki Accords, signed by 35 nations during the Cold War, covering various provisions such as human rights and peaceful dispute resolution. The State Department recognizes that nonlegal agreements may be governed by another legal system based on clear evidence in the negotiating history. The form and specificity of provisions are factors in determining the nature of an agreement. The Senate may prefer international commitments as treaties to avoid erosion of treaty power, while the House may favor congressional-executive agreements for greater involvement. Congressional action may be necessary in some cases. The executive's preference for the form of an international agreement, whether a treaty or executive agreement, may be influenced by factors such as the agreement's prospects for approval by the Senate or both houses of Congress. State Department regulations outline criteria for determining the form of an agreement, with congressional preference being one of several factors considered. Congressional preference is a key factor in determining the form of an international agreement, along with other considerations such as national impact, effect on state laws, need for congressional legislation, past U.S. practice, formality desired, duration, and international norms. In 1978, the Senate passed a resolution advising the President to consult with the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations before submitting an international agreement as a treaty. The State Department later modified the Circular 175 procedure to include consultation with congressional leaders and committees on significant international agreements. Congressional consultation on international agreements is to be held \"as appropriate.\" The consultation process for international agreements is discussed further in the report. Security agreements entered by the United States can be treaties or executive agreements, with the possibility of future arrangements being different. Congress may also limit sole executive agreements through statutory enactment. The United States is party to seven collective defense agreements, obligating members to assist in defense in case of an attack. These agreements were ratified between 1947 and 1960 and can be limited in the future through statutory enactment. The United States has defense treaties with several countries, including provisions to ensure that military actions are carried out in accordance with constitutional processes. Congress has also approved security commitments for former territories and Freely Associated States, obligating the US to defend them from attacks. The United States has security commitments with former territories and Freely Associated States, pledging defense from attacks or threats. These commitments differ from other international defense arrangements by focusing on newly sovereign entities previously under US control. Unlike \"security commitments,\" which require immediate action in case of an armed attack, \"security arrangements\" generally involve consultation in the event of a security threat. The United States has security commitments with former territories and Freely Associated States, pledging defense from attacks or threats. These commitments differ from other international defense arrangements by focusing on newly sovereign entities previously under US control. Most legally binding \"security arrangements\" listed in the President's report constitute sole executive agreements, including agreements with Israel, Egypt, Pakistan, and Liberia. The question of what constitutes a \"security commitment\" has long been a subject of dialogue and dispute by the executive and legislative branches. The United States has various defense agreements that involve military affairs, such as military basing agreements, access and pre-positioning agreements, Status of Forces Agreements (SOFAs), and burden-sharing agreements. These agreements allow the US to build facilities, station forces, and conduct military activities in host countries, define the legal status of US forces, and share defense responsibilities with host countries. The United States has defense agreements with host countries, including burden-sharing agreements, arms transfers, military training, and joint exercises. These agreements are typically not treaties but can be executive agreements or congressional-executive agreements. They do not directly authorize significant military operations in defense of the host country. The United States has defense agreements with host countries, including burden-sharing agreements, arms transfers, military training, and joint exercises. These agreements are typically not treaties but can be executive agreements or congressional-executive agreements. They do not directly authorize significant military operations in defense of the host country. However, agreements like the one with Iraq in 2008 allowed for U.S. forces to engage in military operations within the country. The United States has defense agreements with host countries, providing the right to intervene when the security of the other country is threatened. These agreements differ from collective defense agreements and the authority to intervene under the United Nations Charter. In the early 20th century, the U.S. entered legal agreements with Latin American countries granting the right to intervene. In the early 20th century, the United States entered legal agreements with Latin American countries granting the right to intervene for defense or to maintain domestic peace. This included treaties with Cuba, Haiti, and Panama, giving the US the authority to intervene when deemed necessary. In the early 20th century, the United States signed treaties with Latin American countries allowing military intervention for defense or to maintain peace. This included agreements with Panama and the Dominican Republic, granting the US the right to use armed forces for the protection of the Panama Canal and financial rehabilitation of the Dominican Republic. President Theodore Roosevelt also implemented temporary executive agreements when the Senate did not approve treaties for military involvement. In 1907, a significant security agreement faced opposition for being an unconstitutional usurpation of the Senate's treaty power. President Roosevelt made executive agreements in 1941 to station troops in Iceland and Greenland before the US entered World War II. Some security arrangements may not be legally binding but hold political significance. Security arrangements, while not legally binding, can carry political or moral weight. U.S. commitments to assist foreign states in security matters have become more common post-World War II. These commitments can take various forms, such as unilateral pledges or joint declarations. Non-treaty arrangements authorizing U.S. military intervention often do not involve a legally binding, permanent agreement, allowing the host country discretion over the extent and duration of U.S. presence. The United States made a commitment to aid Thailand in resisting Communist aggression in 1962, leading to the deployment of armed forces. The dispute over the executive's authority to engage in military operations without congressional approval has been ongoing, highlighted by the Senate passing the National Commitments Resolution in 1969. The National Commitments Resolution of 1969 addressed concerns over the executive branch making foreign commitments without congressional approval, defining a \"national commitment\" as the use of armed forces on foreign territory or promising assistance to a foreign country. The resolution aimed to restore balance in matters of foreign relations and criticized the practice of \"commitment by accretion.\" The National Commitments Resolution of 1969 aimed to address concerns over the executive branch making foreign commitments without congressional approval. It criticized the practice of \"commitment by accretion,\" where binding commitments arise from a series of executive declarations. Congress has not enacted legislation to bar significant military commitments without its approval, relying instead on oversight through its appropriations power. The oversight authority of Congress over non-binding arrangements is through its appropriations power, which allows it to limit or condition actions taken by the United States. Bilateral security agreements with Afghanistan, Germany, Japan, South Korea, the Philippines, and Iraq are discussed in detail. After the September 11, 2001 attacks, the US initiated Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan to combat Al Qaeda and remove the Taliban regime. Various security agreements were then made with the new Afghan government, including an economic grants agreement in 2002 under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961. The agreement allows for defense articles, services, and training from the U.S. government to Afghanistan. U.S. personnel in Afghanistan have immunity from criminal prosecution by Afghan authorities. The agreement between the U.S. and Afghanistan grants immunity to U.S. personnel from prosecution by Afghan authorities. The Afghan government cannot surrender U.S. personnel without U.S. consent. The agreement remains in force under the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan. It does not provide immunity for contract personnel and does not explicitly authorize military operations within Afghanistan. The U.S. and Afghanistan agreement grants immunity to U.S. personnel from Afghan prosecution. Military operations in Afghanistan are ongoing under the authorization of Congress since 2001, with the U.N. Security Council supporting the response to the September 11, 2001, attacks. The International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) is deployed in Afghanistan with a mandate to work closely with Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF). The U.N. has not explicitly authorized Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF), but Security Council resolutions acknowledge its legitimacy. In 2004, the U.S. and Afghanistan signed an acquisition and cross-servicing agreement for logistic support. The Secretary of Defense can enter into an Acquisition and Cross-Servicing Agreement (ACSA) with NATO countries, UN organizations, or other regional international organizations. If the agreement is with a non-NATO country, approval must be sought from relevant Senate and House committees. The US has been entering into such agreements since 2003. Since 2003, the US has made accommodation agreements with Afghanistan for land use, including detaining captured enemy forces at Bagram Airfield. A new detention facility in Parwan was completed in 2010, but transfer to Afghan control was delayed due to a growing prisoner population. In March 2012, an agreement was reached for the transfer of the Parwan detention facility to Afghan control. The memorandum outlines the handover of control of Parwan detainees from U.S. forces to Afghanistan, with Afghan forces responsible for holding captured individuals. A separate agreement in April 2012 addressed special operations on Afghan soil, stating that Afghan forces would lead with U.S. support. Obama and Karzai signed the Enduring Strategic Partnership Agreement on May 2, 2012. The Enduring Strategic Partnership Agreement between the United States and Afghanistan is a legally binding agreement focusing on promoting shared democratic values, security, social and economic development, and strengthening Afghan institutions and governance. It remains in force until the end of 2024, with provisions for negotiating a new Bilateral Security Agreement. The Strategic Partnership Agreement between the United States and Afghanistan allows U.S. forces continued access to Afghan facilities through 2014 and beyond. The agreement does not permit permanent military bases in Afghanistan or a threat to its neighbors. The future presence and operations of U.S. forces will be addressed in the Bilateral Security Agreement. In 2007, a Declaration of Principles was signed between the U.S. and post-Saddam Iraq for long-term cooperation and friendship. The Declaration between Iraq and the United States announced negotiations for a long-term security agreement, sparking congressional interest. Concerns were alleviated when two separate agreements were signed in 2008, which did not include a long-term security commitment by the United States. The Security Agreement between the United States and Iraq called for the withdrawal of U.S. forces within three years. The Strategic Framework Agreement remains in force, covering various cooperative fields including security, economic, and cultural matters. The Security Agreement between the United States and Iraq outlined defense and security cooperation, stating that U.S. forces were in Iraq at the government's request. It included provisions for the withdrawal of all U.S. forces by December 31, 2011, and prohibited the use of Iraqi territory for attacks on other countries or the establishment of permanent military bases. The Security Agreement between the United States and Iraq established rules and procedures for U.S. forces in Iraq, including civil and criminal jurisdiction, carrying weapons, wearing uniforms, entry and exit, taxes, customs, and claims. It also addressed combat operations by U.S. forces. The agreements came into force on January 1, 2009, without Senate approval or statutory authorization. The Security Agreement between the United States and Iraq established rules for U.S. forces in Iraq, including civil and criminal jurisdiction, combat operations, and other procedures. There is controversy over whether the agreement required congressional authorization, given that Congress had already authorized military operations in Iraq. The Security Agreement between the United States and Iraq established rules for U.S. forces in Iraq, including civil and criminal jurisdiction, combat operations, and other procedures. It arguably authorized the President to enter short-term agreements with Iraq to facilitate operations. In 1951, the U.S. and Germany entered an agreement related to the Mutual Security Act of 1951, promoting international peace and security. The Mutual Security Act of 1951 aims to maintain security and promote US foreign policy by providing military, economic, and technical assistance to friendly countries. In 1955, the US and Germany entered into a mutual defense assistance agreement to foster international peace and security. Germany guarantees not to use military assistance for any offensive actions, in line with the defensive nature of the North Atlantic Treaty and with the consent of the United States. The mutual defense assistance agreements between the United States and Germany, as well as between the United States and Japan, were based on the defensive nature of the North Atlantic Treaty. These agreements referenced various acts and treaties related to defense assistance and were amended over the years to strengthen the relationship between the countries. The United States and Japan have a mutual defense assistance agreement that allows for the provision of equipment, materials, and services to each other and other agreed-upon governments. This agreement is subject to relevant acts and treaties, including the Mutual Defense Assistance Act of 1949 and the Mutual Security Act of 1951. In 1960, they entered into the Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security, which was amended in 1990. The treaty emphasizes continuous self-help and mutual aid to maintain and develop their defense capabilities. Article V of the Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security Between the United States of America and Japan states that both countries recognize the danger of an armed attack in territories under Japan's administration and will act accordingly to meet the common danger. Article VI grants the United States the use of facilities in Japan to contribute to Japan's security and international peace in the Far East, with the status of U.S. Armed Forces governed by a separate agreement. This led to the signing of a Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA) in 1960. The SOFA between the United States and Japan, signed in 1960, addresses the use of facilities by the U.S. Armed Forces in Japan. It has been modified four times. In 1948, the U.S. and South Korea entered an agreement related to the transfer of authority and withdrawal of U.S. forces. Another agreement followed for interim military and security matters. The agreement between the U.S. and South Korea in 1948 outlined the responsibilities of the Commanding General to organize, train, and equip the Security forces of Korea. It also specified that the Commanding General would retain authority over security forces until withdrawal, as mandated by a UN resolution. Additionally, the agreement granted exclusive jurisdiction to the Commanding General over personnel under his command during the transition period. The agreement between the U.S. and South Korea in 1948 outlined the responsibilities of the Commanding General to organize, train, and equip the Security forces of Korea. It specified that individuals apprehended by law enforcement agencies of South Korea shall be turned over to the Commanding General's custody. A mutual defense assistance agreement in 1950 references the Military Defense Act of 1949 for military assistance provision between the two countries. The United States and South Korea have a mutual security agreement dating back to 1952, which includes military, economic, and technical assistance to strengthen mutual security. In 1954, they also entered into a mutual defense treaty to settle disputes peacefully and act together in case of external armed attacks. The United States and South Korea have a mutual security agreement dating back to 1952, including military, economic, and technical assistance. Article IV of the treaty grants the US the right to deploy forces in South Korea. In 1966, a SOFA was established between the two countries, later amended in 2001. In 1947, the US and the Philippines entered into a military assistance agreement for training and development of armed forces, with an advisory group created for assistance. The United States and the Philippines entered into a mutual defense treaty in 1951, declaring their unity and determination to defend against external attacks. In 1993, a Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA) was established between the two countries, with subsequent extensions in 1994 and 1995. The agreement included commitments for accounting procedures for resources provided by the US to the Philippines. The United States and the Philippines entered into a mutual defense treaty in 1951. In 1993, a Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA) was established between the two countries, with subsequent extensions in 1994 and 1995. An agreement regarding the treatment of U.S. Armed Forces visiting the Philippines was made in 1998. Congress has oversight over international security agreements entered by the United States, including notification requirements for treaties. Before a treaty may become binding U.S. law, the President must submit it to the Senate for its advice and consent. The executive must inform Congress when seeking to conclude an executive agreement that requires congressional authorization and/or implementing legislation. Congressional notification is necessary in many circumstances, but it has historically been challenging for Congress to stay informed about international agreements or pledges made by the executive. The Case-Zablocki Act of 1972 was enacted in response to concerns about secret agreements made by the executive without informing Congress. It requires all executive agreements to be transmitted to Congress within 60 days of their entry into force to ensure congressional oversight. The Case-Zablocki Act of 1972 requires the President to transmit international agreements to Congress within 60 days of their entry into force. If immediate public disclosure is deemed prejudicial to national security, the agreement can be sent to specific committees instead. The Act was amended in 2004 to include reporting requirements for agreements that have not yet entered into force. The Secretary of State must annually report to Congress on agreements not published in official compilations. The Case-Zablocki Act of 1972 requires the President to transmit international agreements to Congress within 60 days of their entry into force. The Act does not define what constitutes \"international agreements\" but aims to transmit all significant agreements. The State Department has criteria for determining if an arrangement is a legally binding \"international agreement\" requiring congressional notification. The Case-Zablocki Act of 1972 mandates the President to transmit international agreements to Congress within 60 days of their entry into force. The Act aims to transmit all significant agreements, with criteria set by the State Department to determine if an arrangement is a legally binding \"international agreement\" requiring congressional notification. The State Department's Circular 175 procedure involves notifying Congress of developments in the negotiation of \"significant\" international agreements and consulting with appropriate congressional leaders and committees. Congress has enacted legislation, such as the Case-Zablocki Act and Section 1457 of the National Defense Authorization Act for FY1991, to ensure it is informed about U.S. security arrangements with other nations. The President is required to submit an annual report to specified congressional committees regarding these security arrangements by February 1 each year. The Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives requires reports on security arrangements with other nations, including both legally binding and non-binding commitments. Reports must assess the need to continue, modify, or discontinue these arrangements in light of changing international security situations. While reports were submitted in 1991 and 1992, no subsequent reports have been issued. The Federal Reports Elimination and Sunset Act of 1995 terminated many reporting requirements, including this one. The Sunset Act terminated many reporting requirements, but Section 1457 of the FY1991 National Defense Authorization Act was not affected. Congress has amended this section twice, indicating it is still in effect. State Department regulations may provide oversight for security agreements through consultation with Congress. Circular 175 aims to ensure timely consultation with congressional leaders on international agreements. State Department regulations involve congressional consultation on international agreements, especially when determining if it should be a treaty or executive agreement. Consultations with congressional leaders and committees are held if the issue is deemed serious. Efforts are made to identify such questions early on. Congressional oversight in the agreement-making context involves Senate approval of treaties with a two-thirds majority vote. The Senate can condition its consent on reservations, declarations, and understandings that may limit or define U.S. obligations under the treaty. Efforts are made to identify questions early for consultations to avoid last-minute considerations. In the agreement-making context, Senate approval of treaties involves a two-thirds majority vote and can include conditions that limit U.S. obligations. Congressional authorization is required for congressional-executive agreements, which may have conditional approval and additional statutory requirements imposed by Congress. Sole executive agreements do not need congressional approval to become binding, but Congress can limit their effect through subsequent legislative action. Congress may exercise oversight over international agreements through legislation implementing their requirements. Some treaties and executive agreements are considered self-executing, while others require implementing legislation for enforcement. This ensures compliance with international agreements as U.S. agencies lack authority otherwise. Executive agreements may not be self-executing for several reasons: implementing legislation is constitutionally required, the Senate or Congress may require legislation for the agreement to take effect, or the agreement may specify that it needs implementing legislation. Until such legislation is passed, existing domestic laws prevail. However, the U.S. still incurs international obligations upon ratifying a treaty or entering into an executive agreement. Congress usually allocates funds for fulfilling these obligations. After an international agreement has taken effect, Congress may oversee executive implementation by requiring information submission, enacting new legislation, limiting appropriations, or conditioning funding on specific implementation methods."
