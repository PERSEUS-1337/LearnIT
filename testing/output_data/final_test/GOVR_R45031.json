It provides insights on how taxes, government programs, medical expenses, and work-related costs impact a family's economic well-being. The SPM differs from the official measure and offers a more detailed view of poverty in the United States. The poverty threshold was developed in the 1960s by Mollie Orshansky, based on food costs and family budget share. It was set at three times the cost of the Economy Food Plan, adjusted for inflation. An individual is considered poor if their pre-tax income falls below this threshold. The poverty threshold, developed in the 1960s by Mollie Orshansky, is set at three times the cost of the Economy Food Plan, adjusted for inflation. An individual is counted as poor if their pre-tax income falls below this threshold. The Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM) addresses limitations of the official poverty measure by comparing resources against a measure of need to establish poverty thresholds valued in dollars. The Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM) establishes poverty thresholds based on expenditures for food, clothing, shelter, and utilities, as well as additional expenses. It measures disposable income, including noncash benefits, available to families. The SPM is a research measure that is regularly updated and does not replace official poverty statistics or eligibility criteria for anti-poverty programs. Poverty status is determined by comparing financial resources against these thresholds, which vary by family size and composition. The Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM) establishes poverty thresholds based on expenses for food, clothing, shelter, and utilities, as well as additional costs. It measures disposable income, including noncash benefits, available to families. The SPM differs from the official measure in its geographically adjusted definition of need based on housing costs. The Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM) uses different thresholds based on housing status (homeowners with a mortgage, homeowners without a mortgage, or renters) to reflect varying housing costs. It considers a wider range of financial resources than the official poverty measure, including income and other resources shared among family members based on their relationships. The Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM) uses different thresholds based on housing status to reflect varying housing costs and considers a wider range of financial resources shared among family members. The SPM is intended to be periodically revised with improved data sources, unlike the official poverty measure which remains consistent over time. The official poverty measure has faced criticism for not adjusting thresholds to reflect geographic variations. The official poverty thresholds do not account for geographic cost variations and are based on money income before taxes. This creates a disconnect between specified needs and available resources. The official measure only captures the effects of certain government programs that provide money income benefits before taxes. The official poverty thresholds do not consider noncash benefits like SNAP and housing subsidies, or the needs of unmarried partners and foster children. The official poverty measure does not accurately reflect the purchasing power needed to remain at the poverty line compared to previous decades. Scholars have been trying to address this issue by developing approaches to adjust for geographic variations in costs, but it has proven to be difficult. Numerous approaches have been developed to adjust poverty thresholds geographically, but earlier methods were limited due to a lack of small-area price data. Research into issues like valuing noncash benefits has also been challenging. Alternative poverty measures have been created over the years, including adjusting income definitions to account for taxes and noncash benefits. The Census Bureau included poverty estimates based on variations of the Consumer Price Index in their reports. A panel from the National Academy of Sciences developed recommendations for an improved poverty measure in response to a congressional request. The NAS report was published in 1995. Since the NAS report in 1995, the Census Bureau has been using alternative poverty measures based on different methodologies. The NAS-based measures adjusted income thresholds, considered work-related and medical expenses, and used current data sources. In 2009, the Office of Management and Budget established an Interagency Technical Working Group for a Supplemental Poverty Measure, after numerous experimental poverty measures had been developed. The Interagency Technical Working Group (ITWG) developed the Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM) to consolidate research on poverty measurement. The SPM differs from the official measure in how need, economic resources, and family units are defined. The SPM's methodology and data sources are expected to be refined further. The poverty thresholds are compared with family economic resources based on household relationships, measured through surveys like the CPS ASEC. The SPM poverty estimates rely on data from the CPS ASEC, which is also used for official poverty estimates at the national level. The CPS ASEC is used to estimate SPM poverty, considering limitations and advantages of other surveys. The poverty line is based on family spending data, with the official measure using food spending patterns from the 1960s. The SPM includes costs of food, clothing, shelter, and utilities in its calculations. The SPM uses the costs of food, clothing, shelter, and utilities (FCSU) from the Consumer Expenditure Survey. The panel considered these items as universal needs and allowed for additional miscellaneous items at 20% of the FCSU cost. The dollar amount for computing thresholds is based on an average among consumer units. The SPM uses different poverty thresholds based on homeownership or rental status, reflecting varying housing costs among groups. Housing costs make up a significant portion of the thresholds, with homeowners without mortgages at the lower end and renters/homeowners with mortgages at the upper end of the range. The SPM uses different poverty thresholds based on homeownership or rental status, reflecting varying housing costs among groups. Homeowners without mortgages tend to be older but have lower incomes than homeowners with mortgages. Homeowners with mortgages are younger, have higher incomes, and are more likely to be raising children. Renters have lower income than homeowners but tend to be younger and more likely to be raising children than homeowners without mortgages. The housing costs data is obtained from the Consumer Expenditure Survey, but geographic adjustments are made using the American Community Survey's information on median rental costs. The SPM uses the American Community Survey's data on median rental costs to compute indices by state for metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas. These indices are then used to adjust the SPM thresholds geographically for housing costs, taking into account family size and composition. The equivalence scale adjusts thresholds based on family size in the official measure. In contrast, the SPM uses mathematical formulas to compute scale factors for adjusting thresholds by family size. Scale factors reflect costs incurred by family size increase. The SPM adjusts threshold amounts differently over time compared to the official measure. The SPM adjusts threshold amounts based on families' expenditures on FCSU from the Consumer Expenditure Survey, while the official measure adjusts thresholds annually for inflation using the CPI-U. This approach differs in how inflation is factored in and only considers spending on FCSU, not overall inflation. The SPM thresholds are based on FCSU spending, adjusting for changes in family income. They are set at the 33rd percentile of FCSU spending for two-child families, ensuring that most families spend more on FCSU than the thresholds. This method differs from adjusting for inflation using the CPI-U annually. The SPM methodology is intended to be updated periodically to improve the measure and incorporate new data sources. Unlike the official poverty measure, the SPM considers a wider array of resources, including taxes and expenses. The official measure uses money income before taxes as its definition of resources, which is inconsistent with the poverty thresholds as they were conceptually defined. The poverty thresholds were constructed to represent the total amount of money families had available to spend, while the SPM defines resources available to a family consistently with the needs specified in the thresholds. The SPM considers a wider array of resources, including taxes and expenses, and includes a bit extra for miscellaneous expenses. The Census Bureau's report on the SPM discusses various income sources, including government cash benefits and in-kind benefits like SNAP, which are included in the SPM's resource definition. The SPM includes SNAP and WIC in its resource definition. CPS ASEC asks about SNAP benefits received, prorated to family units. WIC benefits are assumed for 12 months, potentially overestimating their value. The Census Bureau uses information from the USDA and CPS ASEC to determine benefit amounts received, including subsidized school lunches and housing in the SPM resource definition. The costs of school lunches are estimated, potentially overestimating their value. The SPM includes subsidized housing and home energy assistance in its resource definition. Market rent value is estimated and subtracted from the amount paid by the tenant to calculate housing subsidy. Housing subsidies can free up resources for other goods. Utility costs are included in the SPM thresholds, and home energy assistance is part of the resource definition. The SPM includes home energy assistance in its resource definition, but reporting exact amounts can be challenging when payments are made directly to landlords or energy providers. The CPS ASEC does not ask about taxes paid, so the Census Bureau estimates taxes to compute after-tax income. Income and demographic data are used to estimate families' filing statuses and deductions. The SPM adjusts income by subtracting work-related expenses, based on IRS data and median weekly work expenses. These expenses, excluding child care, are multiplied by the number of weeks worked for each family member. Work expenses, especially commuting costs, vary by location and family. The NAS panel developing recommendations for an improved poverty measure noted the challenge of accurately reflecting work-related expenses across families and geographic areas. Research is ongoing to improve the measure of these expenses. If child care is necessary for a family member to work, the additional resources brought in do not fully represent the earnings as child care costs must be subtracted from the available money for purchasing needs identified in the SPM thresholds. When computing resources for the SPM, child care expenses and work-related expenses are capped at the income of the lower-earning parent. Respondents report health insurance premiums and out-of-pocket medical costs, which are subtracted from income to determine available resources for meeting SPM-defined needs. Poverty measurement scholars have debated the approach to accounting for medical costs in relation to poverty for decades. The debate around accounting for medical costs in relation to poverty revolves around the impact of poor health on economic behavior and well-being. While poor health can affect income and spending habits, the causes of health issues are not always monetary. Choices regarding health insurance also heavily influence healthcare spending. This raises questions about whether healthcare costs should be included in poverty measures or considered separately as indicators of well-being. The Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM) does not include health expenses in the poverty threshold to account for varying medical needs. It subtracts out-of-pocket health expenses from resources, excluding insurance coverage. Child support paid to another household is subtracted from income to avoid double-counting. The Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM) adjusts for varying medical needs by excluding health expenses from the poverty threshold. It also subtracts child support paid to another household to prevent double-counting in income calculations. The SPM includes child support received and subtracts child support paid, capturing shared needs and resources among nonrelatives that the official poverty measure does not account for. The Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM) adjusts for varying medical needs by excluding health expenses from the poverty threshold and subtracts child support paid to prevent double-counting. It defines family units differently from the official measure, including foster children and cohabiting couples to more accurately reflect shared resources and expenses within households. The Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM) includes all foster children under age 22 in resource units to reflect demographic trends and align with the Consumer Expenditure Survey. Excluded from SPM tabulations are members of the Armed Forces in barracks, the incarcerated population, nursing home residents, institutionalized persons, and the homeless. The SPM is not meant to replace the official poverty measure but supplements it for analyzing the low-income population. The Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM) provides visibility into the effects of taxes, tax credits, noncash transfer programs, and expenses on poverty. It highlights demographic differences among the poor but has limitations. The official poverty measure only includes cash government benefits, excluding noncash benefits like medical, food, and housing assistance. Means-tested benefits in noncash forms or through the tax code now make up most of the federal government's low-income assistance spending. The federal government's low-income assistance spending has shifted towards noncash benefits and tax credits, with refundable tax credits, food assistance, and housing totaling $228.3 billion in FY2015. The Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM) considers these benefits, impacting the number of people identified as poor. The Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM) considers various income sources like Social Security, SSI, TANF, Unemployment Insurance, child support, and Workers' Compensation. These sources impact the estimated number of people in poverty, with Social Security having the most significant effect. Social Security has the biggest impact on keeping people out of poverty according to the Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM), with 26.1 million individuals in 2016. It benefits various age groups, including 17.1 million individuals aged 65 and older, 7.5 million aged 18 to 64, and 1.5 million children under 18. Other income sources included in the SPM do not have as significant an impact on poverty as Social Security. The Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM) shows that Social Security has the most impact on keeping people out of poverty, benefiting various age groups. Other components like MOOP, refundable tax credits, work expenses, FICA, and SNAP also play a role in affecting the estimated poor population. The SPM identifies a different profile of the poor population compared to the official poverty measure, with fewer children identified as poor due to government assistance programs. Assistance programs like WIC, TANF, and ACTC target families with children. Working-age adults in poverty have work expenses, offset by EITC. Aged individuals may be below poverty due to MOOP, but lower housing expenses help mitigate poverty rates. Census Bureau's report provides further details. The Census Bureau's report, The Supplemental Poverty Measure: 2016, shows that poverty thresholds vary geographically under the SPM. In the Northeast and West, poverty rates tend to be higher due to higher thresholds, while in the Midwest and South, rates are lower. Regional patterns emerge, with SPM thresholds in New York City being considerably higher than in the Binghamton metro area. California and Alabama illustrate the most significant differences in thresholds between western and southern states. The 2016 poverty thresholds for California and Alabama show extreme differences, with the highest threshold in California's San Jose-Sunnyvale-Santa Clara metro area and the lowest in nonmetropolitan Alabama. The Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM) considers regional income variations, noncash benefits, and deductions like MOOP or work expenses, impacting poverty rates. SPM data, based on surveys, should be interpreted with caution due to its sampling nature. The Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM) data estimates are based on a sample of the population with margins of error. Means-tested transfers and non-transfer income are underreported in the CPS ASEC. Models are used to estimate values of taxes and noncash benefits, but the estimates may not be perfect. For example, benefits from the EITC and child tax credit are understated in the SPM, impacting poverty measurement. In-kind food and housing benefits are included in measuring resources for the SPM. In measuring resources for the Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM), in-kind benefits like food and housing are considered, but they are not as flexible as money income. While the thresholds are based on spending patterns, not all families have the same needs. In-kind benefits are worth less than their face value because they can only be used for specific needs, unlike money income. Housing benefits are capped in the SPM method because they can only fulfill housing needs. The Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM) considers in-kind benefits like housing and food, but they are less flexible than money income. Housing benefits are capped at the SPM poverty threshold minus rent paid by the tenant. SNAP benefits are counted at face value, while medical expenses are subtracted from family resources. This treatment of medical expenses does not consider all economic effects of subsidized medical care. The Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM) considers in-kind benefits like housing and food, but they are less flexible than money income. Medical expenses are subtracted from family resources in the SPM, impacting how families with different health care needs are treated. This treatment of medical expenses does not consider all economic effects of subsidized medical care, as some major noncash benefits programs are not explicitly taken into account in determining SPM poverty status. Tax credits are given as a lump sum based on previous year income, but the SPM imputes taxes in the year they are earned. Both the SPM and official poverty measure assess resources in a full calendar year, but economic status can change throughout the year due to job loss. The tax credit may or may not provide relief during a poverty spell, depending on timing and expenses. Longitudinal datasets like the Survey of Income and Program Participation reveal the duration of poverty spells, but have smaller sample sizes than the CPS ASEC. There is debate on whether the SPM is a relative or absolute poverty measure, with relative measures tied to income distribution percentiles and absolute measures using fixed dollar cutoffs adjusted for inflation. Relative poverty measures track changes in income distribution over time and identify the economically worst-off group, but may not reflect a specific level of well-being. Poverty can increase even when incomes rise if the income distribution widens. Absolute poverty measures set a fixed income amount representing a level of economic well-being, adjusted for inflation. They are consistent in showing the number of people below a certain resource level and are more sensitive than relative measures in detecting those unable to reach this level of economic well-being. The Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM) includes aspects of both relative and absolute measures in its computation, using the 33rd percentile of expenditures on basic goods. The thresholds are based on expenditures, not overall income, and can fluctuate due to changes in prices. This makes it challenging to determine if the SPM is closer to a relative or absolute measure of poverty. The Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM) considers both relative and absolute measures in its calculation, using the 33rd percentile of basic goods expenditures. It raises questions about the accuracy of describing poverty and involves value judgments in defining \"poverty.\" The SPM description in the report helps readers assess poverty levels independently. The SPM thresholds, based on CE data for FCSU, are geographically adjusted and vary by housing tenure and family composition. Tables illustrate poverty thresholds for a two-adult two-child family in both the SPM and official measure. Table A-1 shows SPM poverty thresholds for a two-adult two-child family by housing tenure, highlighting geographic cost variation. In contrast, Table A-2 displays SPM thresholds by family composition without geographic adjustment, while Table A-3 presents official poverty thresholds for comparison."
