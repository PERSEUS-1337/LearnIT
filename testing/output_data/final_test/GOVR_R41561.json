    "content": "Since 2009, the EPA has proposed and implemented regulations under pollution control statutes directed by Congress. The agency is addressing new pollution problems and conducting periodic reviews of standards. Some regulations, like those for greenhouse gas emissions, represent a new approach. The EPA implemented new regulations under pollution control statutes since 2009, including addressing greenhouse gas emissions as air pollutants. These actions were driven by legal requirements, court decisions, and advancements in technology and science, leading to controversy. The EPA's actions in implementing new regulations under pollution control statutes since 2009 have sparked controversy. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, National Petrochemical & Refiners Association, and National Mining Association criticized the agency's regulations as overreaching and potentially harmful to the economy. Democrats and Republicans in Congress have also expressed concerns through bipartisan letters, statements at hearings, and introduced legislation to delay the regulations. The EPA's actions in implementing new regulations under pollution control statutes since 2009 have sparked controversy, with criticism from various industry associations and bipartisan concerns expressed in Congress through letters, statements, and legislation to limit EPA's activities. Committees have conducted oversight of the agency's actions, with efforts to restrain regulatory efforts accelerating in the 114th Congress. Notable opposition includes arguments for riders to the FY2016 appropriations bill and criticism of the EPA's final rule defining \"waters of the United States\" under the Clean Water Act. The EPA's aggressive actions have faced criticism from industry associations and Congress, with efforts to limit its regulatory activities. Former EPA Administrators defended the agency's pace of regulatory work, stating that it has actually finalized or proposed fewer Clean Air Act rules compared to previous administrations. Administrator Gina McCarthy also defended EPA's actions in congressional testimony. From July 2013 to January 2017, the EPA defended its actions and initiatives, highlighting the economic benefits of cutting pollution. Fuel efficiency standards have boosted the auto industry, creating jobs and increasing exports. Environmental technologies have generated over 1.5 million jobs and $44 billion in exports. Despite criticism, the EPA has successfully reduced air pollution by 70% while tripling the GDP. The EPA faced criticism for delays in issuing regulatory standards, with concerns about political influence affecting decision-making. Industry groups, while often critical of EPA regulations, also complained about the lack of action in certain areas. In 2014, the American Petroleum Institute and American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers expressed frustration over overdue regulations on renewable fuels. The EPA faced criticism for delays in issuing regulatory standards, with concerns about political influence affecting decision-making. Industry groups complained about the lack of action in certain areas, citing an egregious pattern of non-compliance. This report provides a factual basis for evaluating EPA's regulatory actions. The report identifies major regulatory actions by EPA from January 2009 to late 2016, using data from Semiannual Regulatory Agendas and OMB. It lists economically significant rules proposed, promulgated, or under development, providing details on each action's name, purpose, status, and significance. The report highlights major regulatory actions by EPA from January 2009 to late 2016, focusing on economically significant rules proposed, promulgated, or under development. It provides details on estimated costs and benefits, implementation timeline, and contact information for further inquiries. The list is not exhaustive but aims to identify the most significant and controversial regulations during the Obama Administration. Many major rules under the Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act were promulgated and subsequently vacated or remanded by courts during the Obama Administration. Rules affecting electric power plants, such as the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule and Utility MACT/MATS rule, were among those affected. Additionally, EPA's regulation of power plant cooling water intake structures was governed by a 1995 consent decree. Other actions, like reconsideration of the ozone air quality standard, delayed the implementation of Bush Administration rules. Many proposed rules lingered for years without being finalized or were substantially altered before promulgation. Many major rules under the Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act were promulgated and subsequently vacated or remanded by courts during the Obama Administration. Rules affecting electric power plants were among those affected. EPA often requested extensions of time to analyze comments or reevaluate technical information, leading to delays in promulgation. Court challenges frequently delayed implementation of EPA regulatory actions for years. Many EPA regulatory actions face court challenges, leading to delays in implementation. Rules are often reconsidered or changed after promulgation, with states needing to adopt them before actual implementation. Federal standards for stationary sources are typically implemented through permits issued by state and local authorities. The road to EPA regulation is often delayed due to various reasons, including court challenges and legislative proposals. Permits issued by state and local authorities typically include compliance schedules for installation of required control equipment. Existing facilities usually have several years to comply with new standards. In the 114th Congress, critics of EPA actions sought to alter the agency's course through various approaches, including riders on appropriations bills, stand-alone legislation, resolutions of disapproval under the Congressional Review Act, and amendments to environmental statutes. Congressional oversight of EPA actions has been robust during this period. In the 114th Congress, Republican majorities in both the House and Senate accelerated oversight activities to limit EPA's regulatory activities. Several bills were passed to halt or redirect EPA rules, but joint resolutions disapproving EPA rules were vetoed by the President. Calls for broad regulatory reforms, such as reinforcing economic considerations in decision-making, were also made. Many bills were introduced to increase Congress's role in regulatory decisions. In the 114th Congress, Republican majorities sought to limit EPA's regulatory activities through various bills and oversight activities. Some proposals aimed at broad regulatory reforms, including requiring agencies to adopt cost-effective rules and establishing mechanisms to review and repeal outdated regulations. Specific bills targeted EPA, such as H.R. 1029 / S. 543, which focused on altering qualifications for the Science Advisory Board. In the 114th Congress, Republican majorities sought to limit EPA's regulatory activities through various bills and oversight activities. Specific bills targeted EPA, such as S. 543, which would alter qualifications for membership of the Science Advisory Board and revise public participation procedures. Another bill, S. 544, would bar EPA from proposing rules based on non-transparent or non-reproducible science. Supporters claim these bills aim to restore transparency, while opponents argue they limit scientific advice and impede EPA's ability to protect public health and the environment. The Obama Administration opposed these bills. The Obama Administration faced criticism for potential overreach in EPA regulations, with legal challenges and accusations from critics in Congress and outside. Challenges to specific regulations, such as the \"waters of the United States\" rule, claimed overreach beyond what Congress and the courts allowed. Despite some resolved issues, concerns about EPA's regulatory efforts persist. The EPA faced criticism for potential overreach in regulations, with challenges to controversial proposals. Final rules were often less stringent than proposed, with some exceptions like the Clean Power Plan. The EPA revised rules based on industry data and gave more time for compliance in some cases. Despite modifications, concerns about regulatory efforts persist. The pace of new proposed and final regulations by the EPA has varied over the years, with some rules being challenged in court. Despite modifications and challenges, the courts have mostly upheld EPA decisions. 2015 was a contentious year with major rules on greenhouse gas emissions and water discharges from power plants being promulgated. The final version of the report provides an overview of major environmental regulations and regulatory issues during the Obama Administration, including rules on greenhouse gas emissions and water discharges from power plants. The 115th Congress and the new Administration may revisit some of these issues in the future. EPA has ongoing statutory responsibilities beyond the Obama Administration's term. During the Obama Administration, EPA had nondiscretionary statutory duties to review and revise environmental standards regularly, such as air quality and renewable fuels standards. Other statutes also required periodic review and revision of regulations, like the Solid Waste Disposal Act and the Safe Drinking Water Act. The Water Act and Clean Water Act mandate EPA to review drinking water and sludge management regulations regularly. EPA has identified 130 rules in various stages of development, with some expected to be economically significant. Major EPA rules under the Obama Administration are categorized under Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, Solid Waste (RCRA), and Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA). The Clean Air Act rules discussed in this report are divided into five subsections: Climate Change, Ambient Air Quality Standards, Electric Generating Units, Boilers and Incinerators, and Other Clean Air Act Rules. The Greenhouse Gas Reporting Rule, mandated by Congress in EPA's FY2008 appropriation, requires certain sources to report their emissions of greenhouse gases annually. The rule imposes minimal cost per facility. The Greenhouse Gas Reporting Rule, mandated by Congress in EPA's FY2008 appropriation, requires reporting of emissions of greenhouse gases. The original reporting deadline was extended to September 30, 2011, with the first data released on January 11, 2012. EPA is focusing on regulating emissions from sources that are required to report. EPA issued findings on December 15, 2009, that six greenhouse gases endanger public health and welfare. The EPA issued findings in December 2009 that six greenhouse gases endanger public health and welfare. This led to the finalization of greenhouse gas emission standards for cars and trucks in May 2010, triggering permit requirements for stationary sources of GHGs starting January 2011. The U.S. Court of Appeals upheld these regulations in June 2012 despite industry and state challenges. On May 7, 2010, EPA and NHTSA established GHG emission standards and CAFE standards for new cars and light trucks, including SUVs, minivans, and most pickup trucks. NHTSA was mandated by the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 to set CAFE standards for new cars and light trucks to achieve a combined average fuel economy of 35 mpg by 2020. EPA also issued vehicle greenhouse gas standards in response to the Supreme Court's directives in Massachusetts v. EPA. The EPA regulations required a reduction in emissions to 250 grams of CO2 per mile by 2016, adding $1,100 to the cost of an average vehicle but expected to be paid back through fuel savings. The new standards were phased in starting in 2012, with estimated additional lifetime costs of $52 billion and benefits of $240 billion. The rule was upheld by the D.C. Circuit in the Coalition for Responsible Regulation decision. Contact Rick Lattanzio for more information. The EPA and NHTSA jointly established Greenhouse Gas Emission Standards for light duty motor vehicles for model years 2017-2025. The standards aim to reduce GHG emissions by 50% and increase fuel economy to nearly 50 miles per gallon by 2025. The estimated cost per vehicle to comply with the standards is $1,800, with lifetime fuel savings of $5,700 to $7,400. EPA committed to a Midterm Evaluation in 2022-2025 to decide whether to retain, make less stringent, or make more stringent standards. The EPA is evaluating whether to retain, make less stringent, or make more stringent Greenhouse Gas Emission Standards for light duty motor vehicles. Factors being considered include powertrain technology, vehicle electrification, and consumer acceptance of fuel efficient technologies. Auto manufacturers have concerns about lack of harmonization between EPA, NHTSA, and California standards. Contact Rick Lattanzio for more information. On June 3, 2010, the EPA implemented the Greenhouse Gas Tailoring Rule to determine which stationary sources needed Clean Air Act permits for GHG emissions. The rule aimed to address the challenge of regulating carbon dioxide emissions under the statutory threshold, which would have resulted in millions of sources needing permits. The EPA implemented the Greenhouse Gas Tailoring Rule on June 3, 2010, to determine which stationary sources needed Clean Air Act permits for GHG emissions. The rule set higher annual thresholds to limit which facilities were required to obtain permits for their GHG emissions. The Supreme Court overturned the Tailoring Rule on June 23, 2014, agreeing that EPA could require permits for GHG emissions. The Supreme Court overturned the Greenhouse Gas Tailoring Rule on June 23, 2014. EPA can require permits for GHG emissions from sources treated as major sources due to conventional pollutants, but not solely based on GHG emissions. The ruling has little practical effect as most affected sources already needed permits. EPA and NHTSA established GHG emission standards for medium- and heavy-duty vehicles on September 15, 2011. The EPA and NHTSA established GHG emission standards for medium- and heavy-duty trucks, requiring a reduction in GHG emissions of 17% for diesel trucks and 12% for gasoline-powered trucks by 2018. The cost increase for affected vehicles is estimated at $8.1 billion, with projected benefits of $57 billion over the trucks' lifetimes, including $50 billion in fuel savings. The Phase 2 standards for medium- and heavy-duty trucks, established in October 2016, will lower CO2 emissions by approximately 1.1 billion metric tons, save vehicle owners fuel costs of about $170 billion, and reduce oil consumption. Contact Rick Lattanzio for more information. The EPA projects the total cost of the rule for model year 2018-2029 trucks at $29-$31 billion. The standards will increase the cost of a long-haul tractor-trailer by up to $13,500 in model year 2027, but the buyer would recoup the investment in fuel-efficient technology in less than two years through fuel savings. Fuel consumption of 2027 model tractor-trailers will decline by 34% as a result of the rule. EPA and NHTSA worked with stakeholders and the California Air Resources Board to ensure manufacturers can continue to build a single national fleet. For more information, contact Rick Lattanzio. The EPA agreed to propose New Source Performance Standards for power plant greenhouse gas emissions by July 26, 2011, but faced delays in meeting the deadline. Despite receiving nearly 2.7 million comments on the proposed rule, the final standards were not promulgated by the statutory deadline of April 13, 2013. The EPA was directed to re-propose New Source Performance Standards for power plant greenhouse gas emissions by September 20, 2013. The final rule, covering new, reconstructed, and modified units, was published on October 23, 2015. GHG emission standards for new units were set at achievable levels for natural gas units, while coal-fired units would need to use CCS technology to capture emissions. The EPA's final rule, published in October 2015, set GHG emission standards for new power plant units. Coal-fired units would need to use CCS technology to capture emissions, but the rule acknowledged that new coal-fired units were unlikely to be constructed between 2015 and 2020 due to low natural gas prices and existing generation capacity. Modified and reconstructed units would have less stringent emission standards, based on past performance or best available technology, and would not be subject to CCS requirements. The EPA's final rule in October 2015 set GHG emission standards for new power plant units, with coal-fired units requiring CCS technology. However, new coal-fired units were unlikely to be built between 2015 and 2020 due to low natural gas prices. Modified and reconstructed units would have less stringent emission standards and would not need CCS technology. EPA anticipates few covered units triggering reconstruction or modification provisions through 2025, resulting in negligible costs or benefits. The Clean Power Plan plays a crucial role in setting emissions standards for existing sources under Section 111 of the Clean Air Act. The EPA's Clean Power Plan sets state-specific goals for CO2 emissions from fossil-fueled power plants based on three building blocks: improved efficiency at coal-fired plants, substitution of natural gas for coal, and zero-emission power generation. The plan includes interim and final emission rate goals for different time periods. EPA estimates the cost of the rule. The Clean Power Plan sets emission and emission-rate targets for different time periods, including the years 2030 and beyond. EPA estimates the cost of the rule at $5.1 billion to $8.4 billion annually in 2030, with benefits of $32 billion to $54 billion. Legal challenges were filed, and the Supreme Court stayed the rule in February 2016. The Clean Power Plan sets emission standards for existing power plants, with each state required to submit an implementation plan to EPA. If a state refuses to submit a plan, EPA's options are limited due to the Tenth Amendment. EPA proposed a template for Federal Implementation Plans for states that do not submit their own plans under the Clean Power Plan. Model emissions trading rules were also provided. Additionally, EPA finalized methane emission standards for new and modified sources in the oil and gas industry on June 3, 2016. The EPA proposed new controls under the Clean Air Act to regulate methane emissions from the oil and gas production sector. This rule is part of the President's Climate Action Plan to reduce methane emissions by 40%-45% from 2012 levels by 2025. The EPA proposed new controls under the Clean Air Act to regulate methane emissions from the oil and gas production sector. Methane is a potent greenhouse gas with emissions coming from oil production and natural gas activities. The proposed standards aim to reduce methane emissions by 510,000 short tons in 2025, equivalent to reducing 11 million metric tons of carbon dioxide. EPA estimated the rule will have costs of $530 million and climate benefits of $690 million in 2025. In 2025, EPA estimated the costs and climate benefits of the rule to be $530 million and $690 million respectively. The rule will reduce emissions of VOCs and hazardous air pollutants, with benefits that were not quantified. EPA issued a finding that greenhouse gas emissions from commercial aircraft contribute to climate change, with U.S. aircraft responsible for 11% of GHG emissions in the transportation sector and 29% globally. GHG emission standards for commercial aircraft are now a precondition under the Clean Air Act. For more information, contact Rick Lattanzio. In February 2016, ICAO established international CO2 standards for aircraft, effective from 2020, with EPA and FAA from the US involved in the process. ICAO also agreed on an emissions offset system for aviation. EPA's endangerment finding supports the adoption of domestic aircraft CO2 standards in line with the Clean Air Act and ICAO agreement. The emissions offset system is voluntary for the next decade and has US industry support. For more details, contact Jane. On October 1, 2015, EPA finalized a revision of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for ozone, which is the most widespread pollutant with harmful effects on health and the environment. EPA was under a court order to sign a final rule by that date, as NAAQS are crucial for defining clean air and regulating air pollution. The NAAQS for ozone, finalized in 2015, set standards to protect health and the environment by regulating air quality. These standards do not limit emissions directly but lead to the identification of nonattainment areas where pollution reduction plans are developed. The NAAQS established primary and secondary standards of 70 parts per billion for ozone concentrations in ambient air, based on a review of 2,300 scientific studies. EPA identified 241 counties that would violate the NAAQS if recent data were used to determine attainment. The EPA finalized NAAQS for ozone in 2015 to regulate air quality and protect health. The standards identified 241 counties violating the NAAQS based on recent data. Nonattainment areas will be designated using data from 2014-2016. A revised standard may impact fewer counties than projected. The EPA estimates implementing the proposal would cost $1.4 billion annually in 2025, with health benefits ranging from $2.9 billion to $5.9 billion annually. The EPA proposed a revision of the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) for ozone in 2010, with estimated costs ranging from $2.9 billion to $5.9 billion annually by 2025. Industry sources have expressed concerns about the potential high costs of emission controls, making it one of the most expensive rules in EPA history. The EPA proposed a revision of the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) for ozone in 2010, with estimated costs ranging from $2.9 billion to $5.9 billion annually by 2025. The reconsidered ozone NAAQS was among the most controversial standards due to its wide reach and potential cost, affecting at least 515 counties. The EPA estimated costs of implementing the reconsidered ozone NAAQS would range from $19 billion to $25 billion annually in 2020, with benefits of roughly the same amount. The White House requested the withdrawal of the draft ozone standards in 2011 to update a review of the science, leading to the 2015 revision of the standards. EPA considers particulate matter (PM) a serious air pollutant responsible for premature deaths annually. The EPA sets standards for fine particulates (PM 2.5) and larger, coarse particles (PM 10) affecting industrial and urban areas. In 2013, EPA reviewed the PM standards in response to a court decision, leaving the standards for coarse particles and 24-hour exposures to PM 2.5 unchanged. The EPA revised the standard for annual exposures to PM 2.5 from 15 to 12 micrograms per cubic meter, with estimated annual compliance costs ranging from $53 million to $350 million. The more stringent NAAQS is projected to bring annual benefits of $4.0 billion to $9.1 billion. In the 112th Congress, focus was on larger, coarse particles (PM 10) despite no proposed changes by the EPA. In the 112th Congress, there was a focus on larger, coarse particles (PM 10) despite no proposed changes by the EPA. Legislation was passed to prevent EPA from tightening standards for PM 10 and to limit EPA's authority to regulate dust in rural areas. The EPA did not intend to change the PM 10 standard, and the final revision made no change. EPA completed reviews for sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, and carbon monoxide, with only the sulfur dioxide (SO2) NAAQS considered economically significant. The more stringent SO2 NAAQS was estimated to cost $1.5 billion annually with significant benefits. The more stringent SO2 NAAQS is estimated to cost $1.5 billion annually, with benefits 9-24 times that amount. Under the Clean Air Act's \"good neighbor\" provisions, states must prohibit emissions that contribute to nonattainment of air quality standards by downwind states. EPA issued the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule to address this issue after the Clean Air Interstate Rule was remanded in 2008. The EPA issued the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR) in 2011 to replace the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR) after it was remanded by the Court of Appeals in 2008. CSAPR applies to 28 states and allows intrastate allowance trading but limits interstate trading. The annual compliance cost was estimated at $800 million in 2014, with benefits estimated at $120 billion to $280 billion annually, including the avoidance of 13,000 to 34,000 premature deaths. Numerous parties petitioned the D.C. Circuit for review of CSAPR, leading to a stay in its implementation. The Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR) was vacated by the court in 2012 and remanded to the EPA. The Supreme Court overturned the decision in 2014, leading to the implementation of the rule in two phases, with the first phase in 2015 and the second in 2017. Due to earlier requirements and the shift to natural gas-fired units, electric generators had already achieved most of the necessary pollution reductions by 2012. On October 26, 2016, EPA updated the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR) to address \"good neighbor\" provisions of the Clean Air Act by limiting emissions from coal-fired power plants in 28 states. The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals remanded CSAPR in 2015, leading to modifications in the ozone-season NOx emission budgets. The updated Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR) sets new requirements for 22 states to limit NOx pollution contributing to nonattainment of the 2008 ambient ozone standard in downwind states. The rule will take effect in May 2017, with an estimated annual cost of $68 million and benefits of $880 million. EPA expects requirements to be met quickly and at low cost through optimization of existing pollution control technology and other changes in the power sector, lowering NOx emissions by 20% in 2017. In 2017, reductions in NOx emissions were seen in Pennsylvania, Indiana, West Virginia, Ohio, Alabama, and Kentucky under the updated Cross-State Air Pollution Rule. The Utility MACT rule established MACT standards for existing coal- and oil-fired electric generating units in 2012. EPA stated that 56% of units could meet the standards using existing pollution control equipment. The Utility MACT rule established MACT standards for existing coal- and oil-fired electric generating units in 2012. 56% of units could meet the standards using existing pollution control equipment, while the remaining 44% would need to install technology to reduce mercury and acid gas emissions by 90%, costing $9.6 billion annually. EPA revised the mercury limit for new facilities in response to industry petitions in 2013. The rule is estimated to prevent up to 11,000 premature deaths annually, with benefits ranging from $37 billion to $90 billion, mainly from reducing particulate emissions. The Supreme Court remanded the Utility MACT rule to the D.C. Circuit for further consideration after petitioners argued that EPA failed to conduct a cost-benefit analysis. The majority of affected power plants had already complied with the rule before the Court's decision, and EPA prepared a supplemental finding in response to the Court's decision. The EPA prepared a supplemental finding in response to the Supreme Court's decision on the Utility MACT rule. The MATS rule remains in effect while the circuit court reviews EPA's actions. Contact Jim McCarthy or Alexandra Wyatt for more information. EPA proposed Maximum Achievable Control Technology standards for boilers in 2010, with a final rule issued in 2011 after receiving extensive comments and new information from industry. The EPA initiated a reconsideration after being denied an extension for promulgating final standards, leading to changes in emission standards and compliance deadlines for boilers in January 2013. The D.C. Circuit vacated EPA's previous MACT rule for industrial boilers in 2007, citing exclusion of certain boilers from stricter emissions requirements. The EPA implemented more stringent standards in January 2013 for industrial boilers, affecting about 14,000 boilers with annual costs estimated at $1.2 billion and benefits of $25 billion to $67 billion annually, including the avoidance of 3,100 to 7,900 premature deaths. Additionally, \"area source\" standards were set for 183,000 smaller boilers, requiring only periodic tune-ups to comply with regulations, with an estimated net cost of $490 million annually and partial benefits ranging from $210 million to $520 million annually. McCarthy ([phone number scrubbed], [email address scrubbed]). 21. Commercial and Industrial Solid Waste Incinerator (CISWI) Standards. Standards for emissions from commercial and industrial solid waste incinerators were promulgated and reconsidered alongside boiler MACT and area source boiler rules. The rules expanded the number of facilities subject to CISWI standards, with annual costs of $271 million and benefits of $380 million-$1 billion. Contact Jim McCarthy for more information. 22. Tier 3 Emissions Standards for Passenger Cars and Light Trucks and Gasoline Standards. EPA implemented Tier 3 emissions standards for passenger cars and light trucks in February 2011. In February 2011, EPA began scoping new emissions standards for passenger cars and light trucks, known as \"Tier 3\" standards. These standards aim to reduce conventional pollutants and lower sulfur content in fuel to improve air quality and catalytic converter performance. The EPA released final emission standards for new residential wood heaters on February 3, 2015, which would lower allowable sulfur levels and require reductions in vehicle emissions. The rules will be phased in starting in 2017, with estimated annual costs of $1.1 billion to $1.5 billion and benefits ranging from $7 billion to $19 billion. The EPA released final emission standards for new residential wood heaters on February 3, 2015, to reduce pollution from wood stoves and pellet stoves. The regulations aim to address the significant contribution of wood heaters to air pollution, with new standards for various types of wood heaters. The rule, published in March 2015, targets fine particle emissions from wood heaters, which account for a significant portion of air toxics cancer risks and respiratory effects. The standards will only apply to new heaters, with a five-year grace period for industry compliance. The EPA released final emission standards for new residential wood heaters in 2015 to reduce pollution. The rule aims to eliminate 360 to 810 premature deaths annually and reduce respiratory illness, with benefits estimated at $3.4 billion to $7.6 billion per year. Industry supports the standards but expresses concerns about costs leading to continued use of polluting equipment. The industry supports the EPA's emission standards for new residential wood heaters but expresses concerns about costs leading to the continued use of polluting equipment. The process for certifying compliance and the short testing period for available units are also issues of concern. Contact Jim McCarthy for more information. The Clean Air Act's ethanol waiver limits oxygen in gasoline, requiring an EPA waiver for increased ethanol content. EPA may issue a waiver if the fuel or additive does not harm emission control devices. On March 6, 2009, Growth Energy applied to EPA for a waiver to increase ethanol content in gasoline from 10% to 15%. This would allow more ethanol use in fuel, potentially helping meet renewable fuel requirements. EPA granted a partial waiver for E15 use in newer vehicles in 2010. EPA expanded the waiver for E15 use to include MY2001-MY2006 vehicles, but denied it for older vehicles, heavy-duty vehicles, motorcycles, and nonroad applications. Concerns remain about E15's impact on equipment not designed for its use, and other factors like infrastructure and regulations still need to be addressed. A legal challenge by vehicle and engine manufacturers was dismissed due to lack of injury. On June 23, 2011, EPA issued final rules, including new labeling requirements, to prevent the accidental use of E15 in vehicles and engines not approved for its use. Expansion of E15 supply has been slow, with E15 sold at approximately 100 stations, mostly in the Midwest. Eight auto companies approve the use of E15 in all vehicle models for MY2017.

The Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) mandates increasing amounts of renewable fuel in the nation's transportation fuel supply annually. The total renewable fuel volume includes conventional biofuel and advanced biofuel. EPA administers the RFS and sets annual standards, with the 2017 standards falling below statutory requirements. EPA set the conventional biofuel mandate at 15.0 billion gallons and the advanced biofuel mandate at 4.28 billion gallons for 2017. EPA used the cellulosic biofuel waiver authority to reduce the total renewable fuel standards for 2017 due to real-world constraints. The RFS has faced difficulties in implementation and was established during a time of expected gasoline consumption growth. The Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) was established during a period of anticipated gasoline consumption growth, allowing for increased blending of biofuels. However, challenges such as slower-than-expected advanced biofuel production and economic downturns have led to uncertainties in RFS implementation. One key concern is the \"reset\" provision, which allows the EPA Administrator to adjust RFS volumes based on certain conditions. The lack of cellulosic biofuel production has led to the need for adjustments in the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS). EPA has reduced annual cellulosic biofuel requirements due to challenges in production. Proposed legislation aims to modify the RFS, including changes to yearly cellulosic biofuel mandates. Oil and Natural Gas Air Pollution Standards were revised by EPA in 2012 under the Clean Air Act, updating rules for VOCs and SO2. The agency is required to review these standards every eight years. EPA also had to review hazardous air pollutant standards for oil and gas production by 2007. Contact [author name scrubbed] for more information. The 2012 rules updated oil and natural gas air pollution standards under the Clean Air Act, addressing emissions from natural gas wells using hydraulic fracturing. Companies are required to capture natural gas and VOCs that escape during well preparation. The rules impact production, processing, transmission, and storage, with estimated annual industry savings of $11-19 million. Some states already had similar measures in place, and about half of fracked natural gas wells met the standards at the time. EPA had to review hazardous air pollutant standards for oil and gas production by 2007. In 2013, EPA updated storage tank rules for fracked natural gas wells, providing more time for compliance and alternative emissions limits. Industry groups have filed lawsuits challenging the standards. EPA also promulgated NSPS and MACT standards for cement manufacturing, requiring significant reductions in emissions. For more information, contact Rick Lattanzio. The EPA implemented new emission standards for the cement manufacturing industry in 2010, resulting in significant reductions in particulate matter, mercury, and acid gas emissions. Compliance with the standards was estimated to cost the industry $350 million annually, but the benefits were projected to be worth $6.7 billion to $18 billion annually, including the avoidance of premature deaths in people with heart disease. The standards faced legal challenges and were remanded to the EPA for reconsideration in 2011. The EPA implemented new emission standards for the cement manufacturing industry in 2010, resulting in significant reductions in emissions. The court did not stay implementation of the 2010 standards, but EPA proposed changes in 2012 to give the industry additional time to comply. The changes were estimated to reduce industry costs by $52 million annually. Further regulation for this industry, the third-highest stationary U.S. source of carbon dioxide emissions, was under consideration but has not taken place. The EPA set standards for stationary internal combustion engines in 2010, affecting engines like emergency power generators and electric power generators used in various industries. The rules, known as the RICE rules, apply to engines meeting specific criteria and are estimated to impact over 1.2 million engines. Owners were required to install pollution control equipment based on the type of engine. Contact Jim McCarthy for more information. The EPA issued rules in 2010 for stationary internal combustion engines, impacting over 1.2 million engines. Owners had to install pollution control equipment or follow specific standards. The health benefits were estimated at $1.45 billion to $3.5 billion annually. Amendments in 2013 reduced costs to $487 million, with the most controversial allowing backup generators to operate for up to 100 hours per year without emission limits. In 2015, they were required to use low-sulfur fuel. The court found EPA acted arbitrarily in allowing backup generators to operate without emission controls for up to 100 hours per year. EPA also implemented emission standards for new marine engines and established Emission Control Areas (ECAs) for ocean-going ships. Contact Jim McCarthy for more information. The EPA implemented emission standards for new marine engines and established Emission Control Areas (ECAs) for ocean-going ships under the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL). The cost of these initiatives was estimated at over $3 billion annually by 2030, with cleaner fuel requirements being the main expense. The benefits of these requirements were projected to exceed costs by more than 30 to 1. The ECAs and new standards were supported by industry and environmental groups, and were extended to cover the U.S. Caribbean in 2014. In 2012, controversy arose over the low-sulfur fuel requirement for ships in Alaskan waters, leading to a lawsuit by the state of Alaska which was dismissed by a Federal District Court in 2013. On September 12, 2012, EPA amended standards for flares and process heaters at petroleum refineries, estimating $460 million in capital costs but $79 million in industry savings annually. The rules aim to reduce emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides, with projected benefits of $240 million to $580 million per year. EPA also promulgated National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAPs) for brick and clay product manufacturers in 2003. In 2003, EPA established standards for brick and clay ceramics, which were later vacated by the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals in 2007. After a lawsuit by the Sierra Club, EPA agreed to replace the vacated rule with new standards by November 2014 and finalized them on September 24, 2015. The finalized standards aimed to reduce emissions of mercury, particulate matter, acid gases, dioxins, and furans, with estimated annual costs of $25 million and cobenefits three to eight times the cost. Concerns remain about the cost and achievability of the standards from industry groups and environmental organizations. The EPA and state air pollution officials are concerned about EPA setting standards under an alternative to the Maximum Achievable Control Technology requirement. Industry and environmental groups have filed petitions for review of the standards with the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. Contact Jim McCarthy for more information. EPA and other federal agencies have been working on actions to reduce the environmental and health impacts of mountaintop removal mining in Appalachia since 2009. The Obama Administration's actions on mountaintop removal mining in Appalachia have sparked controversy. The EPA's efforts to improve regulation and strengthen environmental reviews of permit requirements have angered the coal industry and pleased environmental groups. The Administration's focus on mountaintop mining has led to additional scrutiny of permits and more stringent requirements, with some advocating for tougher restrictions or a total ban on the practice. The Army Corps of Engineers is also issuing nationwide permits related to coal mining operations. The Army Corps of Engineers is expected to reissue nationwide permits for coal mining operations before the existing permits expire in March 2017. Additionally, the Obama Administration has revised SMCRA regulations to minimize adverse impacts of coal mining on natural resources by limiting mining in or through streams. The Obama Administration has revised SMCRA regulations to minimize adverse impacts of coal mining on natural resources by limiting mining in or through streams. The updated rules, developed since 2009, aim to reflect current science, technology, and modern mining practices. The revised rule will apply nationwide and has drawn controversy and criticism from mining industry groups and environmental groups. Some states argue that the rule undermines state authority and that OSM failed to consult adequately during its development. Legislation in the 114th Congress proposed to prevent OSM from releasing the rule pending a study by the National Research Council on economic and scientific data in the rule. Controversy also arose from EPA's 2011 veto of a CWA permit for a surface coal mining project in West Virginia, which was later overturned by a federal court. Legislation to restrict EPA's veto authority has been introduced on several occasions, including in the 114th Congress. The EPA issued a Clean Water Act general permit for pesticide applications in response to a court decision. The permit covers activities like mosquito control and aquatic weed management, affecting 365,000 applicators annually. Operators must minimize pesticide discharges to waters. The Clean Water Act general permit for pesticide applications requires operators to minimize pesticide discharges to waters and prepare plans to document their pest management practices. Legislation has been introduced in Congress to exempt aerial pesticide application activities from clean water permit requirements. Florida's water quality standards under the Clean Water Act require the adoption of criteria to protect designated uses and an antidegradation statement. EPA mandated numeric criteria for nutrients in 2009 due to severe water quality impairment from various sources. In 2009, EPA mandated numeric nutrient water quality standards for Florida under a consent decree with environmental litigants. The \"inland waters rule\" was promulgated in December 2010, but did not go into effect due to criticism. The rule did not directly impose requirements on regulated entities or sources of nutrient pollution. EPA delayed the rule's effective date to allow for review and development of implementation strategies by local governments, businesses, and the state of Florida. The need to reduce nutrients in Florida's waters is undisputed, but EPA's 2010 rule has been controversial. In response to EPA's 2010 rule to reduce nutrients in Florida's waters, there have been disputes over data, costs of compliance, and administrative flexibility. EPA prefers Florida to implement its own numeric nutrient water quality criteria, and in 2012 the state submitted revised standards. EPA indicated approval of the standards, leading to the initiation of administrative action to repeal the 2010 federal rule. The deadline for issuing the second phase of standards was extended to allow the state to develop its own standards. In 2013, EPA and the state reached an agreement on steps to address the issue. In 2013, EPA and Florida reached an agreement for the state to determine numeric limits on nutrient pollution in waterways. Florida pledged to set criteria for waterways, and EPA approved the state's plan. The U.S. District Court amended the consent decree in 2014, lifting the requirement for EPA to issue numeric standards. In September 2014, EPA finalized a rule withdrawing overlapping federally promulgated water quality standards in Florida to address nutrient pollution. Environmental groups criticized EPA's approval of Florida's standards, but their legal challenge was rejected by the federal district court in January 2014. EPA developed a Total Maximum Daily Limit (TMDL) plan for the Chesapeake Bay to restore nutrient-impaired waters due to jurisdictions failing to meet water quality goals. Contact [author name scrubbed] for more information. The Chesapeake Bay watershed failed to meet water quality goals, triggering Clean Water Act requirements for a TMDL plan. The TMDL sets pollutant limits for the bay, with jurisdictions developing specific WIPs to meet these limits. EPA issued the TMDL in 2010, applying to all impaired waters in the bay watershed. Jurisdictions are now developing WIPs with controls and best management practices. The TMDL plan for the Chesapeake Bay watershed sets pollutant limits, with jurisdictions developing specific WIPs to reduce pollution. The plan has faced controversy, with a federal court upholding it in 2013 against a lawsuit by the American Farm Bureau Federation. In 2012, EPA also implemented regulations to limit water pollution from aircraft and airport deicing operations. The final rule aims to limit runoff of deicing fluid to reduce pollutants in streams, preventing fish kills and contamination of water sources. EPA estimates a reduction of 16.4 million pounds of pollutants annually at a cost of $3.5 million, applying to 198 existing airports. Construction Site Effluent Limitations Guidelines were established by the EPA in 2009 under the Clean Water Act to control pollution from stormwater runoff at construction sites. The rule requires erosion and sediment control practices for sites disturbing one or more acres of land, with enforceable numeric limits for sites disturbing 10 acres or more. EPA issued the rule in response to a 2004 lawsuit and a federal court order in 2006. For more information, contact [author name scrubbed] at [phone number scrubbed] or [email address scrubbed]. In 2009, the EPA established Construction Site Effluent Limitations Guidelines under the Clean Water Act to control pollution from stormwater runoff at construction sites. The rule affects about 82,000 firms nationwide involved in various construction activities. EPA issued effluent guidelines for 56 industries, which are implemented in discharge permits. In response to industry challenges, EPA conducted a rulemaking to correct a numeric effluent limitation in 2010. The effectiveness of the numeric turbidity limit was stayed in November 2010, while other parts of the rule remain in effect. In 2014, EPA finalized modifications to the 2009 Construction Site Effluent Limitations Guidelines, including the withdrawal of numeric turbidity effluent limitations. Effluent limits in the 2014 rule focus on erosion management and soil stabilization during construction. EPA may consider new rulemaking in the future if more data on numeric discharge standards become available. EPA has also been exploring options to strengthen stormwater management regulations to address water quality impairments. EPA considered strengthening stormwater regulations by establishing post-construction requirements for stormwater discharges from new development and redevelopment. The agency missed the 2013 deadline to propose a rule, and in March 2014, EPA was expected to issue a final rule by December 2014. In March 2014, EPA deferred action on the stormwater rule and will provide incentives for cities to address stormwater runoff. The Revised Cooling Water Intake Rule addresses water withdrawals by power producers and manufacturers, posing challenges for aquatic resources. The EPA promulgated a CWA rule in 2014 to protect fish from entrainment by cooling water intake structures at existing power plants and industrial facilities. The rule applies to approximately 1,065 plants and was controversial, with industry fearing costly technology requirements. EPA favored a less costly, flexible regulatory option in the final rule, declining to mandate closed-cycle cooling universally. The EPA declined to mandate closed-cycle cooling as a uniform requirement and provided flexible compliance options in the final rule. Legal challenges have been filed by industry and environmental groups. The EPA establishes effluent limitations guidelines under the Clean Water Act to reduce pollutant discharges from industries. EPA found existing regulations do not adequately address pollutants being discharged. The EPA revised effluent limitations for the steam electric industry in 2015 to address pollutants like metals, nutrients, and total dissolved solids. The new rule applies to 1,079 power plants nationwide, with an estimated annual compliance cost of $340 million. Compliance is expected for 133 plants, as many have already implemented required processes. The rule aims to reduce pollutant discharges by 385 million pounds annually. The EPA's 2015 rule aims to reduce pollutant discharges by 385 million pounds annually and decrease water use by 57 billion gallons per year. Industry and environmental groups have raised concerns about compliance deadlines and have challenged the rule in federal court. EPA also issued regulations for oil spill prevention control and countermeasure plans in 1973. The EPA issued regulations for oil spill prevention control and countermeasure (SPCC) plans in 1973, focusing on oil spill prevention with requirements like secondary containment. Changes and clarifications were proposed after the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, with compliance deadlines extended and amendments made to the 2002 rule. Compliance dates were extended for farms to May 10, 2013, with various amendments made by different administrations. The EPA extended the compliance date for farms to May 10, 2013, under the SPCC requirements for petroleum-based and nonpetroleum-based oils. Milk storage units were exempted from SPCC requirements in a final rule issued on April 18, 2011, due to industry standards for sanitation and regulation by other agencies. The final rule exempts milk storage units from SPCC requirements and clarifies that they are not included in a facility's overall oil storage volume. For more information, contact Jonathan Ramseur. Congress has historically debated federal vs. state authority over waterways, with the CWA of 1972 expanding federal jurisdiction to prevent pollution, not just maintain navigability. The Clean Water Act of 1972 expanded federal jurisdiction to prevent pollution in \"waters of the United States,\" including wetlands. The term is crucial in various aspects of the law, such as permit programs and enforcement, and has been a central question in CWA law and policy for almost 40 years. Controversies arose after Supreme Court rulings in 2001 and 2006 on defining \"waters of the United States\" for regulatory purposes. The Clean Water Act of 1972 expanded federal jurisdiction to prevent pollution in \"waters of the United States,\" including wetlands. Controversies arose after Supreme Court rulings in 2001 and 2006 on defining the regulatory scope of the CWA more narrowly, creating uncertainty about the appropriate scope of protected waters. To resolve uncertainties, EPA and the Army Corps of Engineers finalized regulations in 2015 to define \"waters of the United States,\" aiming to clarify CWA jurisdiction while reflecting scientific expertise. Industries and agriculture groups raised objections to the rule, fearing its broad application. Many states and environmental agencies support a rule to clarify the scope of CWA jurisdiction, but there is no state consensus on the Corps-EPA proposed rule. Legal challenges were filed by over 30 states and industries seeking to invalidate the final rule. Environmental groups defend efforts to protect U.S. waters but argue for stronger final rule. A federal court imposed a nationwide stay in October 2015 on the rule, which became effective in August 2015. In October 2015, there were ongoing developments regarding a rule on coal combustion residuals (CCR) from coal-fired power plants. Congressional interest in the rule was strong, with hearings held and bills introduced to halt or redirect it. A resolution of disapproval (S.J.Res. 22) was passed by the Senate and House, but President Obama vetoed it in January 2016. The Senate failed to override the veto on January 21. Coal-fired power plants accounted for 33% of U.S. electric power in 2015, generating approximately 117 million tons of CCR. On December 22, 2008, a breach in a surface impoundment pond at the Tennessee Valley Authority's Kingston, TN, plant released 1.1 billion gallons of coal ash slurry, causing extensive damage. EPA determined that CCR disposal in unlined landfills and surface impoundments poses significant risks to human health and the environment. In response, EPA issued a final rule on April 17, 2015, to regulate solid waste disposal units receiving CCR under Subtitle D of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. The regulations under Subtitle D of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) were established on October 19, 2015, to set national standards for landfills and surface impoundments receiving CCR. The Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation Act (WIIN Act) amended Subtitle D on December 16, 2016, expanding EPA's authority to enforce these standards. EPA estimated annual regulatory costs at $587 million and benefits at $289 million under Subtitle D. Subtitle D established national standards for landfills and surface impoundments receiving CCR. The estimated annual benefits were $289 million, but do not include all benefits. Additional costs or benefits may arise depending on the rule's impact on coal ash recycling. EPA finalized regulations in February 2011 to clarify when certain materials burned as fuel would be considered a \"solid waste.\" The definition of solid waste is crucial for implementing emission standards for boilers and solid waste incinerators. For more information, contact [author name scrubbed]. The 2007 D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals decision vacated EPA's emission standards for boilers and solid waste incinerators, along with the definition of terms in the \"CISWI Definitions Rule.\" The court ruled that any unit burning solid waste material, regardless of energy recovery, must be regulated as a solid waste incineration unit. The 2011 final rule addresses these issues and restricts the types of nonhazardous secondary materials that can be burned in boilers. EPA anticipates changes for boiler operators. The final rule clarifies that the definition of solid waste would not affect current used oil recycling regulations and excludes scrap tires used in combustion units managed under tire collection programs. EPA states that this regulatory action would not directly invoke any costs or benefits, which would be related to the Boiler MACT and CISWI Standards. On February 7, 2013, EPA amended the 2011 rule to clarify specific elements of the regulations related to the Boiler MACT and CISWI Standards. The amendments were jointly promulgated with EPA's reconsideration of the CISWI proposed rule. Additionally, on June 19, 2015, the EPA Administrator signed final regulations revising the agency's 1988 Underground Storage Tank (UST) technical regulations and state program approval regulations. The final regulations address amendments to Subtitle I made in the Energy Policy Act of 2005 and update UST leak prevention and detection technologies and requirements. The final revisions to UST technical regulations include secondary containment requirements for new and replaced tanks and piping, training requirements for UST owners and operators, new operation and maintenance requirements, new release prevention and detection technologies, requirements for compatibility with biofuel blends, and updated codes of practice. The regulations also revise state program approval requirements and phase out past deferrals for certain types of tanks. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPAct) amended the SWDA to require states receiving federal funding under Subtitle I to meet specific requirements, including operator training and secondary containment. The final rule expands on EPAct by applying these requirements in Indian country and states not receiving Subtitle I funds. EPA aims to standardize UST requirements nationwide and in Indian country, with additional requirements beyond those in the law. For instance, EPA mandates secondary containment for new or replaced tanks in all states. The final rule by EPA requires secondary containment for new or replaced tanks in all locations, including those near water systems or potable wells. Updates to the 1988 UST rules allow owners to demonstrate compatibility with fuel containing more than 10% ethanol or 20% biodiesel.

Lead: Renovation, Repair, and Painting (RRP) Rule Amendments address federal requirements to protect children from lead-based paint hazards during renovation and remodeling. In 2008, EPA implemented the Lead Renovation, Repair, and Painting (RRP) rule under the Toxic Substances Control Act. There have been disagreements over certain provisions of the rule, leading to challenges from trade associations and environmental organizations. In 2009, EPA reached a settlement agreement with the petitioners. EPA implemented the Lead Renovation, Repair, and Painting (RRP) rule in 2008. In response to a settlement agreement with environmental organizations, EPA made two amendments to the rule, eliminating the \"opt-out\" provision and allowing certified renovators to collect paint samples for analysis. EPA continues to consider further rulemaking. The EPA is reviewing the RRP rule and considering potential requirements for public and commercial buildings. Legislation has been proposed to amend TSCA and limit the application of the RRP rule. Contact Jerry Yen for more information."
