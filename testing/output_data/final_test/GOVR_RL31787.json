    "content": "The U.S. Strategic Command considers information operations a core military competency, focusing on electromagnetic energy, cyber operations, and psychological operations. The Department of Defense now views cyberspace as a domain for warfare, defining it as a global network of information technology infrastructures. This aligns with the 2008 National Military Strategy for Cyberspace Operations. Cyberspace operations are defined as the use of cyber capabilities to achieve military objectives. It is a component of Information Operations and includes activities to operate and defend the Global Information Grid. Each service has organizations responsible for Information Operations and Electronic Warfare. The U.S. Army IO Proponent develops requirements for IO doctrine and training, while the Army Intelligence and Electronic Warfare Directorate provides testing services for Electronic Warfare. The Air Force has established the 24th Air Force to handle cyberwarfare, electronic warfare, and protection of critical infrastructure networks. The DOD sees information as a weapon and target in warfare, with Psychological Operations playing a key role in influencing decision-making and deterring aggression. Information operations (IO) are crucial for undermining terrorist organizations and can have effects beyond the intended target audience. In today's conflict environment, IO impacts all parties involved and noncombatant groups, with new technologies raising national security policy issues. The importance of electronic warfare (EW) and information operations (IO) has increased due to new communication technologies and the growth of the Internet. Insurgents use electronic devices to carry out attacks and influence public opinion through video broadcasts. The Department of Defense is working on countering these actions to prevent potential accusations of war crimes. The report discusses current adversary threats in the information environment, DOD capabilities for military information operations, federal cybersecurity efforts, and policy issues. Adversaries use the electromagnetic spectrum for kinetic attacks, disrupting access, influencing targets, and stealing data. Current threats include challenges to US military dominance in the electromagnetic spectrum and terrorist groups using wireless electronics for attacks. Terrorist groups and peer competitors are challenging US military dominance in the electromagnetic spectrum. They use wireless electronics for attacks and electronic warfare to deny access to crucial equipment. Electronic media plays a significant role in influencing populations, with many preferring foreign satellite news stations over government-run broadcasts. Observers note that many Arabs prefer foreign satellite news stations like Al-Jazeera and Al-Arabiya over U.S. sponsored news broadcasts, believing the latter to be biased. The Iraqi Governing Council's decision to restrict coverage by Al-Jazeera and Al-Arabiya in 2004 led to suspicions of information manipulation by the Coalition Provisional Authority. Additionally, terrorist groups are utilizing the Internet to challenge traditional media outlets and disseminate their messages effectively. Terrorist groups use Internet specialists to enhance their messaging. Al-Qaeda utilizes a Global Islamic Media Unit for outreach. Cyber threats against US information systems are a growing concern for national security. Attacks on government systems increased by 40% in 2008. In 1999, cyberattacks known as \"Moonlight Maze\" targeted DOD's NIPRnet, originating from Russia. In 2003, \"Titan Rain\" cyberespionage attacks, suspected to be from China, targeted DOD systems and contractors, compromising sensitive military data. In 2006, a cyberattack on the U.S. Naval War College led to the campus being disconnected from the Internet. A similar attack on the Pentagon in 2007 resulted in part of the unclassified network being temporarily disconnected. The Global Information Grid, the main network for the U.S. military, faces over three million daily scans by potential intruders. Lt. General Charles Croom warns that cyber attackers have the capability to disrupt American military operations. Potential adversaries like China, Russia, Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, and terrorist groups are developing capabilities to attack U.S. networks. China has already downloaded significant data from the NIPRNet. The Chinese military is enhancing its information operations capabilities to weaken enemy command and control systems. Estonia experienced a cyberattack in 2007. In 2007, Estonia faced a cyberattack after moving a Soviet-era war memorial, leading to riots and DDOS attacks on government websites. The attacks disrupted basic services due to the country's heavy reliance on information technology. The cyberattacks on Estonia in 2007 disrupted basic services and were initially blamed on the Russian government. NATO sent experts to help protect government systems, but later analysis suggested the attacks were not coordinated and originated from various sources worldwide. The DDOS attack code was shared in Russian chat rooms, where the memorial's relocation sparked emotional discussions. The cyber attacks on Estonia in 2007 targeted government agencies but did not aim at critical infrastructure or make extortion demands. Analysts found no Russian government connection to the attacks. In contrast, the cyber attacks on Georgia coincided with a kinetic attack by Russian forces and targeted major internet service providers using a vulnerability in web database software. The attacks originated from online Russian hacking forums distributing lists of Georgian internet sites as targets. The cyber attacks on Georgia involved targeting major internet service providers using web database software vulnerabilities. The Georgian government blocked internet traffic from Russian users, but instructions on bypassing the block appeared online. There is suspicion of Russian involvement in the attacks. In Kyrgyzstan, denial of service attacks on internet providers caused the country to go offline. The cyber attacks on Kyrgyzstan caused the country to go offline, with possible motives including Russia's displeasure with a U.S. air base and the opposition party. The uncertainty in identifying attackers may impact decisions on retaliation, highlighting the trend of cyberattacks for political manipulation. The international community faces challenges in determining conduct in cyberspace as a new battlefield. The rules of engagement for information operations in response to cyber attacks are based on the law of Armed Conflict, with responses scaled in proportion to the attack. Protection against cyber attacks is a new task for the military, with offensive tools and capabilities used for retaliatory strikes highly classified. The military's response to cyber attacks involves incorporating predictive, active, and pre-emptive measures to prevent or minimize attacks. Accurate attribution is crucial for deciding on retaliatory actions. Majority of cyber attacks against DOD and U.S. civilian agencies are suspected to originate in China, primarily for cyberespionage purposes. The unauthorized access to sensitive industrial technology and DOD operations involves attempts to implant malicious code for future use. Defining the legality of a response to cyber behavior requires clear categories of activity, actors, and jurisdictions. Labeling cyberattacks as cybercrime or cyberterrorism is problematic due to difficulties in determining the attacker's identity, intent, and political motivations. Various definitions exist for cyberterrorism, which may involve factors beyond just a cyberattack. Various definitions exist for the term \"cyberterrorism,\" with experts defining it as politically motivated hacking operations intended to cause harm, intimidate, or coerce governments or people for political or social objectives. Cyberterrorism can also involve physical attacks that target critical infrastructures without directly using a keyboard. Cyberterrorism involves politically motivated hacking operations to cause harm or intimidate governments or people. Cybercrime, enabled by computers, includes theft of intellectual property and attacks to disrupt processing. There have been no reported acts of cyberterrorism to date. Cybercrime encompasses various malicious activities, including cyberattacks aimed at causing harm or committing theft, such as identity theft. These crimes are often financially motivated and can involve the use of malicious software to gather personal information from unsuspecting users. The FBI estimates that identity theft costs American businesses and consumers $50 billion annually. Identity theft involves cybercriminals gathering personal information from victims' computers, including sensitive details like name, address, social security number, and more. This stolen data is sold online, enabling the creation of false identity documents using basic equipment like a digital camera and printer. Inadequate computer security practices within organizations also contribute to identity theft, with millions of credit card numbers being accessed by hackers in 2005. Stolen credit card numbers and bank account information are being sold online, leading to fraudulent charges on statements. Names and personal information of over 1,500 NNSA employees were stolen in a network intrusion. The breach went undetected for a year. Services exist to change billing addresses for theft victims. In 2005, services were offered to change billing addresses for theft victims using stolen PINs or passwords. Stolen credit card numbers were sold online for as low as $1 in 2007, while a complete identity sold for $14 to $18. 35 states have data security laws for identity theft protection, but federal and state laws need harmonization for better uniform protections. Identity theft remains a problem in government systems. Identity theft remains a persistent issue in government systems, with incidents such as the intrusion on monster.com in 2007 affecting 1.3 million users. The Federal Aviation Administration and the Air Force also faced data breaches in February 2009, highlighting concerns about information security and the need for better protective measures. The Air Force shut down internet access at Maxwell Air Force Base, Alabama due to a security breach. General Shwartz emphasized the importance of information assurance. The Army also reported a breach of a database containing personal information of 1,600 soldiers participating in Operation Tribute to Freedom. Cyberespionage involves unauthorized probing, viewing, copying, and exfiltration of data files. Deliberate network intrusions for industrial or military espionage qualify as cyberespionage. Technology has outpaced policy in labeling actions in cyberspace, with industrial cyberespionage now seen as part of global economic competition. Monitoring potential adversary countries' computerized functions may be essential for national defense. U.S. counterintelligence officials have noted around 140 incidents related to cyberespionage. The United States faces cyberespionage threats from numerous foreign intelligence organizations, with around 140 attempting to hack into government and company systems. This type of espionage allows for the electronic extraction of large amounts of information, reducing the need for traditional spying methods. The Internet provides new, cost-effective opportunities for espionage, with reports of the US using its Echelon electronic spy network for industrial espionage. Echelon, established in 1971, is operated by Britain and includes listening posts in Canada. Echelon is a global spy system capable of intercepting wireless communications worldwide. Former CIA director James Woolsey justified US industrial espionage based on bribery by European companies. European parliament officials expressed outrage at the justification. Cyberespionage tools are sold by criminals, posing a risk to US national security. Calls for stronger government agency computer security practices have been made. Security experts are calling for stronger government agency computer security practices, warning that malicious actors in cyberspace do not distinguish between military and civilian targets. A 2005 IBM report revealed over 237 million security attacks globally, with government agencies being the primary target, followed by manufacturing, financial services, and healthcare sectors. In 2005, over 237 million security attacks globally were reported, with government agencies being the primary target. The attacks were mainly directed at government agencies and industries in the United States, New Zealand, and China. There are linkages between terrorist groups and criminals that allow terror networks to expand internationally through leveraging computer resources, money laundering activities, or transit routes operated by criminals. The proportion of cybercrime directly or indirectly attributed to terrorists is difficult to determine. Groups of terrorists are active in countries with large communication networks and skilled IT workforce. London police believe terrorists obtained explosives for 2005 bombings from criminal groups in Eastern Europe. A trial in the UK linked Islamic terrorist groups to cybercrime. Three British residents used the internet to incite murder and purchased items for jihadists using stolen credit card information. The trio used stolen credit cards to make fraudulent charges totaling over $3.5 million, including purchasing prepaid cell phones, airline tickets, and registering internet web domains. They also laundered money through online gambling websites. Cybercriminals have alliances with drug traffickers to support terrorist groups, with drug traffickers using encryption for internet messaging and hiring computer specialists to evade law enforcement. Cybercriminals have alliances with drug traffickers to support terrorist groups, using encryption for messaging and hiring computer specialists to evade law enforcement. Major narcotics markets in Western Europe and North America serve the trafficking needs of criminal and terrorist groups. DEA officials reported terrorist organizations' involvement in drug trafficking, with evidence of cooperation between different groups in drug and arms trafficking. DEA officials argue that the war on drugs and terrorism are linked, with terrorist groups using drug trafficking to finance operations and weaken enemies. The poppy crop in Afghanistan supplies over 90% of the world's heroin, supporting a $3.1 billion drug trade used to fund terrorist groups. U.S. intelligence reports in 2007 indicate that \"al Qaeda in Afghanistan\" has regained strength and may pose a threat to Western countries. Drug traffickers hire computer specialists to use technologies that make Internet messages hard to decipher, allowing terrorist organizations to operate internationally with less chance of detection. Many specialists come from former Soviet Union and Indian subcontinent. Some may be misled about employers' political objectives, while others provide assistance due to lack of legitimate employment. Links between hackers and terrorists are hard to confirm, and membership in skilled hacker groups is exclusive. Membership in highly skilled hacker groups is exclusive, with members sharing sophisticated tools and operating covertly. Some groups have political or profit motives, selling computer services on the black market. Information on computer vulnerabilities is available for sale online. Hackers can purchase remote-controlled bots for $150 to $500 and information on computer vulnerabilities for $1,000 to $5,000. Advanced cyberattacks may require 2 to 4 years of preparation, while coordinated attacks may need 6 to 10 years. This extensive planning is similar to the hallmark of previous physical terrorist attacks by Al Qaeda. The Center for the Study of Terrorism and Irregular Warfare at the Naval Postgraduate School reported that severe cyberattacks in the future may be used by terrorist groups to supplement traditional physical attacks. Al Qaeda is not focused on cyberattacks, preferring those that cause human casualties. Post-industrial societies are more likely to experience cyberterrorism from terrorist groups. Al Qaeda has improved organizational secrecy through technology, using the Internet extensively for planning operations. Members have used Internet chat software and new telephone services to communicate with terrorist cells. Khalid Shaikh Mohammed and Ramzi Yousef utilized technology for communication and bomb detonation plans. Terrorist groups may consider cyberattacks as a way to lower the risk of detection for their operations, but some experts believe that the psychological impact would be lower than a conventional bombing attack. Concerns exist that unless a cyberattack results in physical damage or bloodshed, it will not be taken as seriously as other forms of terrorist attacks. Some experts fear that a chemical terrorist attack on critical infrastructures like the nation's electric grid or SCADA utilities delivery systems, through kinetic or cyber means, may be more likely. Cybercrime is a major international challenge, with varying attitudes on what constitutes criminal computer wrongdoing. The Convention on Cybercrime, adopted in 2001 by the Council of Europe, is the primary international treaty dealing with breaches of law over the internet or other information networks. The Convention on Cybercrime requires countries to update their laws against hacking, copyright infringements, fraud, child pornography, and other cyber crimes. The United States signed the Convention but did not sign a separate protocol that criminalizes xenophobia and racism on the Internet, citing constitutional issues related to free speech. The Department of Justice stated that it would be unconstitutional for the U.S. to sign the additional protocol due to First Amendment concerns. The United States signed the Convention on Cybercrime but did not sign a separate protocol criminalizing xenophobia and racism online due to First Amendment concerns. The U.S. Senate ratified the Convention in 2006 without the need for new legislation. Legal analysts believe U.S. negotiators successfully removed objectionable provisions, aligning the Convention with existing U.S. laws. The Department of Defense acknowledges the cyber attack threat but states it is less likely than physical attacks. The Homeland Security Presidential Directive 7 required the Department of Homeland Security to protect the nation's critical infrastructure from cyber attacks. Despite numerous reports highlighting the urgent need to improve cybersecurity, there is a lack of national urgency to address the issue. Despite the Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002 (FISMA), cybersecurity remains a low priority at some federal agencies. A 2007 report by the Government Accountability Office highlighted increased cybersecurity risks for infrastructure control systems due to internet interconnections and lack of coordination in improving computer security across federal agencies and the private sector. Some argue that remote systems controlling critical infrastructure are vulnerable to cybercrime as businesses focus on strengthening security for headquarters. Decision-makers may underestimate the threat of cybercrime, despite past reports urging urgent action to improve cybersecurity. The apparent need for action is reduced as future risks are discounted, and the costs of inaction are not felt in the present. The Air Force's new mission statement in 2008 includes operating in the cyber domain, with a focus on defending against malicious activity on the Internet. IT vendors, researchers, and purchasers must prioritize cybersecurity to address current vulnerabilities and future risks. The Air Force's new mission now includes defending against malicious activity on the Internet and across the electromagnetic spectrum to protect national security. Plans for a new Air Force Cyber Command were discussed in a cyberwarfare-themed summit in November 2006, with a focus on expanding U.S. capabilities to shut down enemy electronic networks and assess cyberwarfare requirements for defense. Homeland security will also be a significant responsibility of the Cyber Command. The Air Force Cyber Command's new responsibility includes protecting telecommunications systems, utilities, and transportation. AFCYBER Commander Maj. Gen. William T. Lord's team is considering the educational and technical skills needed for staff. Instead of creating a new major command, the Air Force will establish a component-Numbered Air Force, the 24th Air Force, led by a 2-star general, focusing on cyberspace warfighting operations in support of NORTHCOM and STRATCOM missions. The Air Force Cyber Command's new responsibility includes protecting telecommunications systems, utilities, and transportation. A provisional team will assist in transitioning work to the Air Force Space Command, which will operate on an equal footing with other Numbered Air Force headquarters. Future command relationships are still being decided, with the possibility of a stand-alone combatant command for cyberspace. The U.S. Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) controls military information operations, space command, strategic warning, intelligence assessments, global operations planning, and Computer Network Operations (CNO). It delegates daily defense activities to the National Security Agency and oversees Joint Functional Component Commands (JFCCs) for various strategic functions. JFCC-Network Warfare (JFCC-NW) and JFCC-Space & Global Strike (JFCC-SGS) are responsible for DOD cyber security. The Joint Task Force-Global Network Operations (JTF-GNO) and the Joint Information Operations Warfare Center (JIOWC) are directly responsible for defense against cyber attacks. JIOWC assists combatant commands with information operations including operations security, psychological operations, military deception, and electronic warfare. The President's Comprehensive National Cyber-security Initiative emphasizes cyber education and training as critical. Deputy Secretary of Defense Gordan England highlighted the need for qualified Electronic Warfare operators as U.S. military systems become more computerized and networked. Deputy Secretary of Defense Gordan England emphasized the declining number of scientists and engineers in the U.S. as a long-term threat, particularly in cyber networks. The DOD conducts a Cyber Defense Exercise annually, where military academy teams practice hacking and defending test networks. Efforts are being made to integrate cyber warfare into Joint Professional Military Education curriculum, but the classified nature of cyberspace doctrine poses a challenge. The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) Cyber Operations Branch offers a 10-week summer program in cyber security for university students, aiming to attract skilled IT professionals. The program, held in Rome, NY, includes 40-60 student applicants from military academies, NSF Cyber Corps Fellows, and civilian college students. The theme for 2006 was \"Cybercraft,\" focusing on dominance in cyberspace. The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) Cyber Operations Branch offers a 10-week summer program in cyber security for university students in Rome, NY. The program aims to attract skilled IT professionals and includes 40-60 student applicants from military academies, NSF Cyber Corps Fellows, and civilian college students. The program focuses on dominance in cyberspace and covers legal and policy issues, cryptography, computer network defense and attack, steganography, and analysis of malicious code. ACE students also participate in internships at the Air Force Research Laboratory or with local industry partners, officer development activities, and faculty from Syracuse University, West Point, and Norwich University. The ACE program is recognized by DHS and NSF as an official internship program for the Federal Cyber Service Scholarship for Service (SFS) program. The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) Cyber Operations Branch offers a summer program in cyber security for university students in Rome, NY. Graduates are required to work for a federal agency for two years. Syracuse University developed a cyber security course for high schools in New York State. Currently, Syracuse University offers introductory cyber security courses in multiple high schools. High school students who complete the courses can receive college credits in computer science and engineering. DOD officials emphasize the importance of protecting U.S. commerce on the Internet. The DOD contracts with Carnegie Mellon's Software Engineering Institute to operate CERT-CC and DHS operates US-CERT to monitor cyber threats and provide guidance for recovery after an attack. The Defense Information Systems Agency oversees the military's Global Information Grid (GiG) for net-centric operations. The Joint Staff J-6 is working on \"GiG 2.0,\" an initiative to improve security and interoperability among DoD service infrastructures. The federal government has enacted FISMA to coordinate information security standards, and the National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace was published in 2003. The National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace, published in 2003, aims to improve computer security for U.S. critical infrastructure by federal agencies. The OMB mandates all U.S. Government networks to handle IPv6 traffic for enhanced security. IPv6 offers more address flexibility and built-in network security features. Federal agencies support IPv6 interoperability but full operational transition remains a future goal. The National Cyber Security Division (NCSD) oversees a Cyber Security Tracking, Analysis and Response Center (CSTARC) for analyzing cyberspace threats, issuing alerts, improving information sharing, and aiding in recovery efforts. A new Cyber Warning and Information Network (CWIN) operates in 50 locations as an early warning system for cyberattacks, designed to be reliable and survivable without dependency on the Internet or public switched network (PSN). The NCSD also created the National Cyber Alert System (NCAS) in January 2004. The National Cyber Security Division (NCSD) created the National Cyber Alert System (NCAS) in January 2004 to distribute information on emerging cyber threats. President George W. Bush launched the Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative (CNCI) in 2008 to coordinate cyber defense efforts across the government. The Obama administration is conducting a 60-day cybersecurity review prompted by the Director of National Intelligence, led by Melissa Hathaway. DHS is the lead agency for Federal Government cybersecurity, coordinating efforts through the National Cyber Security Center. Some officials suggest NSA should oversee government cybersecurity, citing its technological talent and capabilities. Critics raise concerns about NSA's civil allegations. Critics raise concerns about NSA's civil liberties violations with internet monitoring programs and the erosion of public trust if NSA is in charge of all cyber activities. They also point out that the private sector may be hesitant to cooperate with NSA, as most of the US infrastructure is privately owned. Additionally, criticisms include inadequate funding for DHS's cyber programs and a lack of leadership authority. The director of the NCSC resigned over concerns that NSA was dominating cybersecurity efforts, and experts testifying before a House Subcommittee echoed these sentiments. Several areas for possible congressional consideration in reforming the national security structure to meet today's challenges include determining appropriate responses to cyberattacks, improving the security of commercial software products, increasing security education and awareness, and coordinating efforts between private industry and government to protect against cyberattacks. Congress may need to harmonize laws on data breach notifications and business obligations. Considerations for responding to cyberattacks by terrorist groups using botnets from third-party countries like China. Concerns about the effects and attribution of cyberweapons used by the United States, and the potential for encouraging other extremists or rogue nations to launch cyberattacks. The potential consequences of the United States using cyberweapons against terrorist groups, including the risk of encouraging other extremists or rogue nations to launch cyberattacks. Concerns about the attribution of cyberweapons and the possibility of these weapons being used against U.S. allies or civilian computer systems. The vulnerability of commercial electronics and communications equipment used in U.S. weapons systems to cyberattacks. The curr_chunk discusses the threat posed by computer security vulnerabilities in commercial software systems to military forces and national security. It questions how the computer industry can be incentivized to create less vulnerable commercial off-the-shelf products. Suggestions include requiring software procured for federal agencies to be certified under the \"Common Criteria\" testing program. However, industry observers raise concerns about the lengthy certification process impacting innovation and competitiveness. The National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace may rely on voluntary action from private firms and home users to enhance cybersecurity. The discussion revolves around the need for possible regulation to ensure best security practices in cyberspace. Former cybersecurity advisers Howard Schmidt and Richard Clarke have differing views on whether market forces or government intervention should drive cybersecurity improvements. Some experts argue that proper training for systems administrators is crucial for enhancing computer security. The need for training systems administrators to improve computer security is emphasized, along with the debate on whether software vendors should create more secure products. Government and private sector commitment to best management practices is seen as crucial to reducing cybercrime threats. Numerous government reports and surveys highlight the importance of cybersecurity measures. The 2004 survey by the National Cyber Security Alliance and AOL revealed that most home PC users lack adequate protection against hackers and updated antivirus software. There is a need for computer security training for all users to stay informed about evolving threats and proper security procedures. Improving information sharing between the government, local governments, and the private sector is essential for effective cybersecurity. The private sector faces challenges in obtaining classified threat information from the government to protect against cyberattacks. The government faces challenges in obtaining specific information from private industry about successful cyber intrusions. Cooperation with other nations is crucial to better protect against cyberattacks, but legal and political conflicts can complicate the pursuit of hackers. The United States participates in the Council of Europe's Convention on Cybercrime to combat cybercrime internationally. H.R. 1525, the Internet Spyware Prevention Act, proposes penalties for computer crimes. The Department of Homeland Security Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 established an Office of Cybersecurity and Communications to oversee cybersecurity and protect communications from attacks. The Assistant Secretary for Cybersecurity and Communications is responsible for identifying threats, conducting risk assessments, and developing plans for critical information infrastructure in the event of a cyber attack. The bill H.R. 3237 aims to modernize the Nation's electricity transmission system with smart grid technology. It passed the House on May 9, 2007, and was referred to the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs on May 11, 2007. The bill H.R. 3237 aims to modernize the Nation's electricity transmission system with smart grid technology, including cybersecurity protection. The Grid Modernization Commission would oversee the adoption of Smart Grid standards and practices. This bill became law on July 30, 2008. The National Defense Authorization Act for 2008 required the Secretary of Defense to conduct a review of legal authorities and policies for effective cyberspace operations within 180 days of enactment. The report also included an assessment of DOD's cyberspace organization, strategy, and programs, as well as recommendations to improve coordination with law enforcement and intelligence communities. The National Defense Authorization Act for 2008 mandated a review of legal authorities and policies for cyberspace operations. Recommendations included coordination with law enforcement, intelligence communities, and international allies, as well as the establishment of a joint organization for cyberspace operations. The DOD Roles and Missions Review report highlighted cyberspace as a key focus area for potential combat operations. Concerns were raised about the legality of provocative actions such as intrusive cyber intelligence gathering by the U.S. military. Intrusions by U.S. military computers for intelligence gathering may lead to strong responses from targeted countries or extremist groups. Questions arise about the legality of civilian cyberattacks and the justification for military cyberattacks that affect civilian infrastructure. Concerns also exist about identifying innocent foreign computer systems from potential attackers. Success in future conflicts may depend on perception control through global media manipulation. The DOD is concerned about the influence of global media on military missions and the use of PSYOP to manipulate public opinion. There are questions about the legality of engaging in PSYOP that may affect domestic audiences. Current doctrine emphasizes achieving information superiority, but there are concerns that PSYOP messages intended for foreign audiences are being consumed by the U.S. The Roadmap document highlights that PSYOP messages intended for foreign audiences can be consumed by the U.S. domestic audience through global media. DOD may not have control over who views these messages once they are re-broadcast. Information is a valuable resource created from observed data and instructions for analysis. Technology enhances the value of information by enabling shared awareness, better command, control, and intelligence synchronization. The current DOD term for military information warfare is \"Information Operations\" (IO). DOD information operations are actions taken during times of crisis or conflict to affect adversary information and defend one's own information systems. The focus of IO is on disrupting or influencing an adversary's decision-making processes through various methods such as transmitting viruses, overheating computer circuitry, and broadcasting false signals. Computer Network Defense (CND) is crucial for protecting U.S. forces against Information Operations (IO) attacks. This includes information assurance (IA) to ensure computer and information security. The Department of Defense (DOD) emphasizes dominating the electromagnetic spectrum for computer network attack and electronic warfare, as networks are becoming the operational center of gravity for warfighting. The U.S. military must be prepared to \"fight the net.\" The recently declassified document mentions the need for new strategies in Psychological Operations to counter adversaries' use of the Internet and global media. DOD identifies five core capabilities for information operations, including Psychological Operations, Military Deception, Operations Security, Computer Network Operations, and Electronic Warfare. These capabilities are integrated to achieve desired effects. During Operation Iraqi Freedom, PSYOP utilized various communication methods to influence Iraqi leaders. Al Jazeera, a news network in Qatar, competes with U.S. PSYOP by reaching millions in the Middle East. Terrorist groups also use the Internet for messaging. The U.S. must develop coordinated strategies to compete in global media wars. The U.S. must develop a coordinated strategic communications strategy to counter competitive civilian news media like Al Jazeera to prevent losing ground in global media wars. DOD emphasizes improving and focusing PSYOP against potential adversary decision making in advance of conflicts, based on audience knowledge, and rapid dissemination to targeted audiences. While military PSYOP products are intended for foreign audiences, the global media may pick up and replay some messages to the U.S. domestic audience. Military Deception (MILDEC) involves presenting false information to mislead enemy decision makers, while Operational Security (OPSEC) identifies critical information to protect friendly operations. An example of MILDEC was the use of decoy systems during Operation Iraqi Freedom to divert enemy defenses. During military operations, U.S. forces were advised to remove sensitive information from public websites to prevent adversaries from exploiting vulnerabilities. Computer Network Operations (CNO) involve attacking enemy networks, defending military systems, and gathering intelligence through computer code. The Joint Information Operations Warfare Command (JIOWC) and the Joint Functional Component Command for Network Warfare (JFCCNW) handle the evolving mission of Computer Network Attack, with their capabilities remaining classified. Despite this, many believe that cyber attacks have been launched by the U.S. military. The organization can launch cyber attacks, destroy networks, steal data, and penetrate enemy computers. Personnel from various agencies and allied nations are involved. The Joint Task Force for Global Network Operations (JTF-GNO) is under the Defense Information Security Agency (DISA) but will move to the National Security Agency. Defensive measures (CND) protect information, computers, and networks from unauthorized activity. The Defense Department is concerned about the lack of policy and legal analysis in Cyber Network Defense (CND) to guide appropriate responses to intrusions or attacks on DOD networks. A legal review is recommended to determine the threshold for defining an attack and to clarify the appropriate aggressive actions that can be taken in self-defense. The legal review should determine if U.S. forces can retaliate using third party computer hosts. DOD recommends separate legal regimes for domestic and foreign sources of computer attacks on critical infrastructure. CNE, an area of IO, involves intelligence collection through network tools to gather information on system vulnerabilities. CNE involves intelligence collection through network tools for data exfiltration, while CNA disrupts or destroys information in computers and networks using a data stream as a weapon. During Operation Iraqi Freedom, U.S. forces did not execute computer network attacks against Iraqi systems. During Operation Iraqi Freedom, U.S. forces did not carry out planned cyber attacks against Iraqi systems due to global network interconnections and concerns about collateral damage to European financial networks. Top-level approval for certain missions was delayed, hindering the achievement of war objectives. In January 2003, White House officials sought input on guidelines for cyber-warfare limited to military targets in Iraq. The Bush Administration announced national-level guidance in February 2003 for launching computer network attacks against foreign adversaries, clarifying when such attacks would be justified. National Security Presidential Directive 16 outlines the circumstances and authority for launching disabling computer attacks. The Electronic Warfare Division of the Army Asymmetric Warfare Office is responsible for directing high power electromagnetic energy to deceive or attack the enemy. This involves using directed energy weapons to disrupt electrical circuitry and control the entire electromagnetic spectrum to disrupt communication systems, sensors, and weapons. The Electronic Warfare Division of the Army Asymmetric Warfare Office is responsible for directing high power electromagnetic energy to deceive or attack the enemy by disrupting communication systems, sensors, and weapons. This includes methods such as navigation warfare, controlling adversary radio systems, placing false images onto radar systems, blocking directed energy weapons, and misdirecting unmanned aerial vehicles or robots operated by adversaries. Military IO testing has examined the capability to secretly enter an enemy computer network and manipulate radar systems to show false images, as well as using non-kinetic weapons to disable enemy computer circuitry with directed electromagnetic energy. Non-lethal electromagnetic weapons, like the Active Denial System (ADS), can be mounted on vehicles to disable enemy missiles or for crowd control by inducing a burning sensation on the skin without causing injury. The ADS is designed to protect innocent individuals, minimize fatalities, and limit collateral damage. The Active Denial System (ADS) is a non-lethal electromagnetic weapon designed to protect innocent individuals, minimize fatalities, and limit collateral damage. Approximately $40 million has been spent on this technology over the past ten years. Military officials requested ADS devices to be deployed to Iraq to assist Marines in guarding posts, countering insurgent snipers, and protecting convoys. Deployment to Iraq was delayed due to concerns of political fallout, with initial deployment slated for no sooner than 2010. The ADS system would be the first operationally deployed directed-energy weapon for counter-personnel missions."
