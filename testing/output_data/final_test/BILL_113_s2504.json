    "content": "The Act titled \"Heroin and Prescription Opioid Abuse Prevention, Education, and Enforcement Act of 2014\" is cited in Section 1. Section 2 contains findings related to the Act. The Controlled Substances Act recognizes the medical importance of controlled substances and the need to address pain as a national health issue. Prescription opioids can be diverted or abused when not needed for legitimate medical purposes. Approximately 4 out of 5 new heroin users report becoming addicted to prescription opioids before trying heroin. Heroin attaches to the same brain receptors as prescription opioids, contributing to its increased use due to low cost and high purity. The number of new heroin users has been rising, with the average age of first use being 22.1 years in 2011. The average age at first use among heroin abusers between 12 and 49 years was 25.5 years in 2009. Heroin use rose 79 percent nationwide between 2007 and 2012, leading to a significant increase in deaths from heroin overdose. The number of deaths involving heroin increased by 110 percent from 2006 to 2011, with a rise from 3,036 to 4,397 deaths from 2010 to 2011. The Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Program is crucial in combating prescription opioid abuse and heroin use epidemics and should be reauthorized and fully funded. SEC. 3. DEVELOPMENT OF BEST PRESCRIBING PRACTICES. The Pain Management Best Practices Inter-Agency Task Force, established within 120 days of the Act, includes representatives from various agencies and the Institute of Medicine, as well as the Director of the National Institutes of Health and healthcare prescribers. The Pain Management Best Practices Inter-Agency Task Force includes physicians, pharmacists, pain and addiction experts, and representatives from pain management organizations, mental health treatment community, and pain advocacy groups. The task force is responsible for developing best practices for pain management and prescription pain medication prescribing practices within 180 days, considering existing research and recommendations from relevant conferences. The Pain Management Best Practices Inter-Agency Task Force is working on developing improved pain management strategies, soliciting public comments, amending practices as needed, and disseminating information to relevant parties. The task force does not have rulemaking authority and will submit a report to Congress within 270 days. The Pain Management Best Practices Inter-Agency Task Force is focusing on disseminating best practices, conducting a feasibility study on linking these practices to registrations under the Controlled Substances Act, and providing recommendations to improve prescribing practices at Veterans Health Administration facilities. The Harold Rogers Prescription Drug Monitoring Program is authorized to receive $9,000,000 annually from 2015 to 2019. A report on its effectiveness in reducing prescription drug abuse must be submitted by the Comptroller General of the United States by October 1, 2016. Additionally, the Byrne Justice Assistance Grant Program is being reauthorized. SEC. 5 amends the Byrne Justice Assistance Grant Program to be reauthorized from 2015 through 2019. SEC. 6 pertains to the Office of National Drug Control Policy. The Director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy will update the Prescription Drug Abuse Prevention Plan within 180 days to address the increase in heroin use. They will also consider GAO recommendations for enhancing interagency coordination in the revised plan. SEC. 7. AWARENESS CAMPAIGNS. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will promote education on the risks of prescription opioid abuse. The Office of National Drug Control Policy will establish a national drug awareness campaign emphasizing the connection between prescription opioid abuse and heroin use. Funds for the national drug awareness campaign may come from the Office of National Drug Control Policy's appropriations."
