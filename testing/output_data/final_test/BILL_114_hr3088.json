    "content": "The \"Leveraging and Energizing America's Apprenticeship Programs Act\" or the \"LEAP Act\" provides a tax credit for employees participating in qualified apprenticeship programs under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The \"LEAP Act\" offers a tax credit under section 38 for apprenticeship employees exceeding the applicable level during the taxable year. The credit amount is $1,500 for apprentices under 25 years and $1,000 for those over 25 years. The apprenticeship credit is limited to 2 taxable years for apprenticeship employees in recognized apprenticeable occupations. The employee must be under an apprentice agreement registered with the Office of Apprenticeship or a State apprenticeship agency. For the apprenticeship credit, the applicable apprenticeship level is determined based on the average number of apprenticeship employees for the 3 preceding taxable years. This applies to employees in recognized apprenticeable occupations under registered apprentice agreements. The applicable apprenticeship level for the credit is determined based on the average number of apprenticeship employees in the 3 preceding taxable years. If an employer had no apprenticeship employees in the 3 years before the credit year, the level is zero. The credit amount is reduced by other specified credits for each employee. Rules similar to section 51 apply. The tax code is amended to include an apprenticeship credit as part of the general business credit. This credit is determined based on the average number of apprenticeship employees in the 3 preceding years. The credit amount is reduced by other specified credits for each employee. Employees participating in qualified apprenticeship programs will be affected by the amendments made in this section, applicable to individuals starting apprenticeship programs after the enactment of this Act. The Director of the Office of Management and Budget will work with Federal departments to reduce printing costs, establish guidelines for employee printing, and ensure essential documents remain available for populations with limited Internet access. The Federal Government requires the name of the issuing agency, total number of copies printed, cost of production, and publishing entity to be listed prominently in all public documents."
