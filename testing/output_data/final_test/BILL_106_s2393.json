During fiscal years 1997 and 1998, 140 million people entered the US on international flights. Customs personnel searched 102,000 passengers, with 95% pat-downs, 4% strip searches, and 1% x-ray exams. African-American women were nearly 3 times as likely as African-American men to be strip-searched, even though they were only half as likely to be found carrying contraband. African-American men and women were nearly 9 times as likely, and Hispanic men and women were nearly 4 times as likely, as white American men and women to be x-rayed, even though they were no more likely to be found carrying contraband. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, \"Customs Service personnel\" refers to employees of the United States Customs Service responsible for inspecting people entering the US. An \"intrusive nonroutine search\" includes actions like removing clothing to find hidden items or using a medical x-ray to detect items within the body. The curr_chunk discusses various types of searches conducted by Customs Service personnel, including body scans, body cavity searches, laxative requirements, monitored bowel movements, surgical procedures, and pat down searches. The curr_chunk defines \"profiling\" as identifying individuals for inspection, search, interview, or examination based on race, religion, gender, national origin, or sexual orientation. Customs Service personnel are prohibited from profiling travelers based on race, religion, gender, national origin, or sexual orientation, except when specific information links a traveler to illegal activity. Additionally, there are other requirements related to searches. Customs Service personnel must document reasons before conducting pat down or intrusive nonroutine searches, except when suspecting a weapon. The Commissioner of Customs mandates periodic training for personnel on passenger identification, detention, and search procedures, emphasizing the prohibition of profiling. Training includes reviewing search reasons, results, and criteria effectiveness. The Commissioner of Customs conducts an annual study on detentions and searches by Customs Service personnel, including the number of searches, demographics of travelers searched, types of searches, and results. A report is submitted to Congress by March 31 each year. Authorization of appropriations is also included. Authorization of appropriations is granted for fiscal year 2001 and beyond to carry out the Act, with funds remaining available until expended."
