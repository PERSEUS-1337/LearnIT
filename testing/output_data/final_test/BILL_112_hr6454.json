The Department of Energy High-End Computing Act of 2012 defines key terms such as co-design, Department of Energy, exascale, and high-end computing system. Co-design involves joint development of algorithms and technology to maximize high-end computing system use. The Department of Energy High-End Computing Act of 2012 defines key terms such as institution of higher education, National Laboratory, and Secretary of Energy. The Department of Energy High-End Computing Act of 2012 establishes the Department of Energy High-End Computing Research and Development Program. The Department of Energy High-End Computing Act of 2012 establishes a coordinated program across the Department to develop exascale computing systems. This includes research on computer technologies for power reduction, gains in parallelism, and advancements in processors, memory, storage, bandwidth, and reliability. The Department of Energy is working on developing exascale computing systems through National Laboratory-industry partnerships. The program aims to conduct research, development, and engineering of prototype exascale systems to address Department target applications and scientific problems. The Department of Energy is developing exascale computing systems through partnerships with National Laboratories and industry. The program includes providing access to researchers in various sectors and conducting outreach programs to increase readiness for domestic industries. The Secretary is required to submit reports to Congress on an integrated strategy and program management plan. The Department of Energy is working on developing exascale computing systems in partnership with National Laboratories and industry. The Secretary is mandated to submit reports to Congress detailing an integrated strategy, program management plan, target dates for exascale platforms, milestones, functional requirements, roles, responsibilities, acquisition strategy, and resources needed for achieving exascale system capability. Status reports on milestones and costs are to be provided annually. The Department of Energy High-End Computing Revitalization Act of 2004 authorizes appropriations of $110,000,000 for fiscal year 2013, $195,000,000 for fiscal year 2014, and $260,000,000 for fiscal year 2015."
