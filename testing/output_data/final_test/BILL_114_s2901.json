    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Advancing U.S.-India Defense Cooperation Act\" and aims to enhance defense and security cooperation with India. The Act, titled \"Advancing U.S.-India Defense Cooperation Act,\" aims to strengthen defense and security cooperation between the United States and India. Congress recognizes the mutual security threats faced by both countries and highlights the strategic partnership rooted in shared democratic values, economic cooperation, and regional stability. The U.S.-India Defense Technology and Trade Initiative (DTTI) was initiated in 2012 to enhance defense cooperation, culminating in an executive agreement signed on June 3, 2015. The executive agreement titled \"Framework for the U.S.-India Defense Relationship\" renewed and updated the previous defense framework agreement between the United States and India. It aims to improve defense cooperation, align systems, increase armed forces interaction, technology flow, investment, co-development, co-production, and defense trade. The United States-India defense partnership is crucial for regional and international stability. Advancing the goals of the Framework for the U.S.-India Defense Relationship and the DTTI can enhance U.S. national security interests. The President's commitment to strengthening defense cooperation with India is a priority for U.S. interests in South Asia and the Indo-Pacific regions. The President should formalize India's status as a major partner and designate an official with defense acquisition and technology experience to ensure the success of the Framework. The U.S. aims to enhance defense cooperation with India by facilitating technology transfer, strengthening existing initiatives like the DTTI, resolving trade and security issues, and collaborating on security verification mechanisms. The U.S. aims to enhance defense cooperation with India by promoting efficient review of defense sales, pursuing military transactions, and supporting alignment of export control regimes. The President is encouraged to coordinate with India on developing military contingency plans for mutual security interests. The President is required to assess India's military capabilities for mutual operations with the US annually. This assessment will inform the review of defense exports under the Arms Export Control Act and should be classified. Additionally, the Arms Export Control Act governs foreign military sales and export status. The Arms Export Control Act is amended to include India in various sections, expanding cooperation with the US."
