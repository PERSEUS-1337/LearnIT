    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 19911 of the Business and Professions Code is amended to state that individuals under 21 years of age are not eligible for a work permit in gambling establishments. Those between 18 and 21 years old can work in non-dealer positions both on and off the gaming floor. Persons under 21 years of age are not allowed in licensed gambling establishments, except for designated dining areas, restrooms, supervised entertainment rooms, and pathways to these areas. If they need to pass through the gaming floor, they must be accompanied by someone over 21 or a gambling establishment employee over 21. In accordance with Section 19911, individuals under 21 are prohibited from loitering in gaming areas. Section 17539.1 of the Business and Professions Code is amended to prohibit unfair acts in contests or sweepstakes, including failure to disclose contestant information. Failure to disclose contestant information includes not providing the actual number and percentage of contestants correctly solving each puzzle, misrepresenting odds of winning, misrepresenting rules, and not disclosing maximum number of puzzles, maximum cost to participate, and future puzzle difficulty. The curr_chunk provides details about the termination date of a contest, tiebreaker procedures, rules and regulations, prize disclosure, and distribution. It also mentions the prohibition of misrepresenting the number of participants or falsely claiming a selected winner. The curr_chunk prohibits misrepresenting contest winnings, not disclosing prize values, and falsely implying advantages with the word \"lucky.\" The curr_chunk prohibits using methods to simulate gambling in a business establishment that offers sweepstakes with cash prizes. The term \"business establishment\" refers to a business with a financial interest in the sweepstakes. This does not apply to game promotions or sweepstakes conducted by for-profit entities as an advertising tool. The curr_chunk states that activities related to sweepstakes should be incidental to legitimate sales of consumer products or services and should not be used for ongoing gambling or gaming purposes. (13) Failing to obtain consent before using individuals' names for promotional purposes in mailings to third parties.\n(14) Using or distributing simulated checks or currency without clearly marking them as non-negotiable.\n(15) Misrepresenting tie breaker puzzles as requiring payment for entry, when in fact payments are optional except for postage and handling fees. Contestants can enter a contest phase for free, with postage and handling fees not exceeding $1.50. This option must be clearly disclosed and offered alongside the opportunity to play for an extra prize. The section defines \"sweepstakes\" as a distribution of value by chance, not unlawful under certain laws. It excludes advertising plans complying with Section 17537.1 and does not legalize any unlawful activities under other laws. The section excludes certain lawful games and technologies used by licensed gambling enterprises or the California State Lottery."
