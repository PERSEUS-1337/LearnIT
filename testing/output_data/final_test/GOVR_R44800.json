    "content": "In 1956, Congress authorized the Interstate Highway System, leading to an increase in fatal accidents. However, laws enacted since then have reduced the fatality rate by 80%. By 2016, the U.S. recorded 1.15 fatalities per 100 million vehicle miles traveled. Improved technologies, safer highways, and education have all contributed to this decline in fatalities. Congress has played a significant role in improving highway safety. The federal government has played a significant role in improving highway safety by imposing and enforcing safety standards for motor vehicles. In the early 1900s, national regulation was not considered appropriate, with state and private-sector standards in place. The Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) provided vehicle safety rules, which states often used to set their own standards for brakes, headlamps, and windshields. In the 1960s, rising highway deaths led to new interest in vehicle safety, resulting in the passing of three safety bills by Congress, including a seat belt regulation. Influential publications like Ralph Nader's book and a National Academy of Sciences report further pushed for federal regulation. This culminated in the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966. The National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966 mandated highway safety programs in each state and set safety standards for motor vehicles. The act also established the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) to enforce these regulations. The NHTSA issues safety standards for motor vehicles, including regulations for windshield wipers, hood latches, tires, brakes, seat belts, and airbags. The process of proposing and finalizing a safety regulation can take years, following the Administrative Procedure Act of 1946. Manufacturers must certify that their vehicles comply with these standards, but NHTSA does not verify this in advance. Certification of a vehicle must be shown by a label permanently fixed to the vehicle. Manufacturers are responsible for testing their vehicles and face recalls and penalties if they do not meet NHTSA's safety standards. NHTSA tests new models to ensure compliance and can order recalls if necessary. NHTSA also assists states with traffic safety issues and maintains a database on motor vehicle crashes. The NHTSA study estimated that safety technologies mandated by FMVSS saved 613,501 lives between 1960 and 2012. It evaluated 31 motor vehicle technologies, including seat belts, airbags, and electronic stability control, which reduced the risk of fatality by 56% in 2012 compared to 1960. Seat belts were found to have saved the most lives, with their effectiveness increasing after the installation of combined lap and shoulder belts in 1974. The study highlighted the importance of additional measures to federal vehicle safety regulation, such as seat belt laws in states. It noted that the full benefits of new safety standards may take years to be realized due to slow turnover of the vehicle fleet and the time it takes to develop and implement standards. Only 22% of light vehicles on the road were equipped with electronic stability control in 2012, despite it being required by FMVSS. The NHTSA study in 2012 evaluated vehicle safety improvements, including electronic stability control required by FMVSS in new vehicles from 2012. It estimated over 1,362 lives could be saved annually with widespread adoption of the technology. The study also assessed crashworthiness and crash avoidance performance of passenger cars and light vehicles, focusing on vehicle design and manufacturer-initiated improvements. Unlike previous reports, it did not specify sources of safety technology advancements. The NHTSA report from 2000 to 2008 showed a decrease in crash likelihood and an increase in the likelihood of escaping a crash uninjured. Vehicle improvements during this time prevented 700,000 crashes, mitigated injuries of 1 million occupants, and saved 2,000 lives in 2008 alone. NHTSA investigates vehicle defects and reviews complaints from various sources for potential recalls. When NHTSA denies defect investigation petitions, it publicizes reasons in the Federal Register. If further review is needed, NHTSA may recommend a recall or determine no defect. Manufacturers may initiate recalls for confirmed safety defects, or NHTSA can initiate one. Manufacturers also conduct internal investigations and may issue recalls for non-compliance with safety standards before accidents occur. The motor vehicle safety program requires manufacturers to notify and fix defects without charge. In 2016, 92 recalls were influenced by NHTSA findings, while 947 were based on a manufacturer's own discovery of defects. The number of recall actions has been increasing, with stricter laws and high-visibility cases contributing to the rise. In 2014 and 2015, General Motors recalled 2.2 million vehicles due to faulty ignition switches, leading to 15 deaths. NHTSA imposed a $35 million civil penalty on GM, while the Department of Justice fined them $900 million in criminal penalties. Additionally, 19 manufacturers recalled 42 million vehicles because of defective Takata airbags, linked to 16 deaths globally. Takata was fined $200 million by NHTSA. In response to the GM ignition switch recall, NHTSA fined Takata $200 million, with $70 million due in cash and an additional $130 million payment if commitments are not met or further violations occur. The Department of Justice fined Takata $1 billion, including a $25 million criminal fine, $125 million for victim compensation, and $850 million for automaker reimbursement. NHTSA evaluated its procedures and communications with General Motors, aiming to improve defect investigation systems based on lessons learned. Mark Rosekind, the then-NHTSA Administrator, highlighted the significance of the ignition switch recall in NHTSA's history. The GM ignition switch case was significant in NHTSA's history due to the manufacturer's efforts to conceal a deadly defect. Path Forward identified five shortcomings in the recall and NHTSA procedures, including GM withholding critical information and NHTSA not holding GM accountable. Proposed process improvements aim to increase auto industry accountability. The auto industry is making process improvements to increase accountability and knowledge of emerging technologies. Trends in manufacturing efficiency, such as using fewer vehicle platforms, may lead to widespread recalls due to defective parts. For example, the Takata airbags were used by multiple automakers, resulting in a large-scale recall. The largest recall on record in the United States was caused by stricter Federal Reporting Requirements and Stiffer Penalties implemented after the Ford Explorer and Firestone tires recall in 2000. The Transportation Recall Enhancement, Accountability, and Documentation Act established an Early Warning Reporting System for vehicle manufacturers to report defects, injuries, and deaths, leading to increased defect reporting and recalls. The TREAD Act increased penalties for safety violations and criminal penalties for misleading NHTSA. Despite EWRS regulations, some manufacturers did not follow them, leading to additional penalties. NHTSA's ODI is responsible for identifying safety issues and recalls. Inadequate data, analysis, and training at NHTSA have been identified as factors that could have led to smaller recalls if issues were identified earlier. The DOT OIG made recommendations in 2015 to improve NHTSA's procedures for collecting and analyzing safety data. The DOT OIG report highlighted weaknesses in ODI's training and supervision of pre-investigation staff, hindering NHTSA's ability to prevent crashes effectively. Despite some progress, five recommendations remain open, including improving early warning reporting data and consumer complaints. The 2015 surface transportation bill tied NHTSA's funding increase to DOT certification of inspector general's recommendations. The Obama Administration requested additional funding for NHTSA to address issues like Takata recalls and Fiat Chrysler's recall performance. NHTSA must manage these tasks with limited resources, including a defects investigation budget that is 23 percent lower than a decade ago. The President's budget request aims to improve NHTSA's defect investigation efforts, but the Commerce Committee links additional funding to resolving issues highlighted in the DOT OIG report. Chairman John Thune emphasizes the need for NHTSA to address existing problems before receiving a significant increase in funding. Despite recalls, many defective vehicles remain on the road due to owners not bringing them in for repairs. A recent review by J.D. Power and Associates of NHTSA data revealed that out of 120 million vehicles recalled from 2013 to 2015, 45 million remained unrepaired by mid-2016. Larger recalls have lower completion rates, with those affecting over a million vehicles having a 49% completion rate. The complexity of larger recalls, difficulty in locating owners, and delays in obtaining replacement parts contribute to the lower completion rates. Vehicle age, type, and safety issue also impact recall completion rates. The completion rates of vehicle recalls are influenced by factors such as age, vehicle type, and safety issue. Newer vehicles (2013-2017) had a 73% completion rate, while older vehicles (2003-2007) had a 44% rate. Recalls related to powertrain, hydraulic brakes, and electrical issues had the highest completion rates (71%, 66%, and 62% respectively), while airbag and suspension problems had lower rates (47% and 48%). A previous study by the U.S. Government Accountability Office found an average completion rate of 65% from 2000 to 2008, with significant variations among automakers. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) found varying completion rates for vehicle recalls, with some manufacturers consistently higher or lower. GAO recommended changes to improve the recall process, such as additional notification methods, modifying letters, publicizing resources like the NHTSA website, and developing national standards for recall severity. The FAST Act mandated new approaches to reach owners of recalled vehicles, and advancements in vehicle technologies have led to safer vehicles. The introduction of new vehicle technologies has accelerated in the past decade, moving towards more vehicle automation. The advancement of vehicle technologies towards automation has accelerated in the past decade, with a focus on fully autonomous vehicles. Congress and federal regulators are navigating how to promote these advancements while avoiding regulatory processes that could hinder innovation. New technologies are being integrated into motor vehicles, shifting towards automation of functions once controlled by drivers. Mary Barra, CEO of General Motors, predicts significant changes in the auto industry in the next five to ten years driven by technological advances, consumer demand for connectivity, and regulatory mandates on emissions and fuel efficiency. Technological advances in the auto industry are driven by consumer demand, regulatory mandates, and ownership models. Innovations like adaptive cruise control and ABS are improving driver and passenger safety. ABS prevent wheel lock-up during braking, originally developed for aircraft and now standard in automobiles. Technological advances in the auto industry, driven by consumer demand and regulatory mandates, include ABS, traction control, ESC, AEB, and FCW systems that enhance driver and passenger safety. These systems prevent wheel lock-up, limit wheel spinning, keep the vehicle on the intended path, apply brakes in emergencies, and alert drivers of imminent collisions. Future vehicles may feature driver override systems to automatically apply brakes in imminent crash situations. The advanced safety systems in vehicles use lasers and cameras to detect potential collisions with other vehicles or pedestrians. They alert drivers through visual and audible signals, prevent accidents by detecting blind spots, and can even steer the vehicle back into its lane. Lane-keeping assist technology goes a step further by correcting the steering direction. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) has found these systems to be effective in preventing accidents caused by driver fatigue or medical emergencies. The Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) found that drivers who fall asleep, have a medical emergency, or black out from drug/alcohol use are most likely to veer out of their lane, leading to fatal crashes. Lane departure accounts for a significant portion of highway fatalities. Advanced safety systems in vehicles use lasers and cameras to prevent collisions and alert drivers. Lane-keeping assist technology can even steer the vehicle back into its lane. This technology also includes automatic head restraint adjustment and adaptive headlights. Many automakers are transitioning to electronic keyless entry systems. In the future, vehicle access may be secured with biometric technology like fingerprint identification to prevent hacking. Telematics allow communication with emergency services using GPS and cellular technology, enabling features like Remote Vehicle Shutdown for stolen cars. Manufacturers are moving towards higher levels of automation, potentially leading to fully automated vehicles. The Society of Automotive Engineers International (SAE) has developed six categories of vehicle automation, adopted by NHTSA for standardization. Vehicles are increasingly connected with consumer electronics, showcased at events like the Consumer Electronics Show (CES). Consumer digital technology is driving motor vehicle innovation with the addition of sensors, cameras, and telecommunications features. These systems provide entertainment, navigation assistance, convenience, comfort, and security to consumers. A survey by the Boston Consulting Group (BCG) shows that U.S. consumers prioritize connectivity and safety when considering purchasing a new car, especially those under 30 years of age. The McKinsey & Company report forecasts growth in vehicle and aftermarket sales from 2015 to 2030, with the largest increases expected in on-demand shared mobility services and vehicle-related data connectivity. Technological advancements driven by emission, fuel economy, and safety regulations are increasing the demand for hybrid and electric vehicles, alongside improvements in internal combustion engines. Plug-in electric vehicle sales have significantly increased since 2011. Plug-in electric new vehicle sales have grown significantly, from over 17,000 units in 2011 to nearly 160,000 units in 2016. Sales increased by 37% in 2016 compared to 2015, with more than half of the new plug-ins sold in California due to the state's zero-emission vehicle mandate. California aims to have 1.5 million ZEVs on its highways by 2025, driven by state and federal emissions and fuel economy rules. The Obama administration's program announced in 2012 aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and increase vehicle fuel economy to 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025. Auto manufacturers are developing advanced technologies to meet these standards, including advanced engines, weight reduction, aerodynamic improvements, and more efficient accessories. President Trump announced in Detroit in March 2017 that his Administration will review the GHG emissions program, potentially changing emissions and fuel economy standards. Motor vehicle industry innovation, consumer choice, and federal regulatory mandates play a crucial role in enhancing vehicle safety. Technologies like vehicle-to-vehicle communications help reduce tailpipe emissions, improve driving patterns, and enhance vehicle safety. Additionally, sensors and lidar developed for automated vehicle safety may also contribute to improving vehicle fuel efficiency. The development of new Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards, led by former DOT Secretary Anthony Foxx and former NHTSA Administrator Mark Rosekind, aims to improve vehicle safety and fuel efficiency. They have adopted a more interactive approach with manufacturers and stakeholders to keep pace with technological advancements. Rosekind expressed concerns about the slow regulatory process and emphasized the need for innovation-friendly regulations to avoid outdated standards. The DOT and NHTSA took steps in 2016 to enhance vehicle safety, including a voluntary agreement with automakers to share safety data and improve recall response rates. They also committed to making automatic emergency braking a standard feature on new vehicles by 2022, three years earlier than traditional rulemaking. In September 2016, NHTSA adopted SAE International's levels of automation for automated vehicles and provided guidance to automakers with a 15-point \"Safety Assessment.\" The policy statement outlines federal and state roles in regulating automated vehicles and discusses using current regulatory tools to expedite their development. Congress addressed vehicle safety in the FAST Act, enacted in December 2015. The FAST Act, a five-year surface transportation law enacted in December 2015, includes provisions on vehicle safety. Rental car companies with over 35 vehicles must repair recalled vehicles before renting, leasing, or selling them. NHTSA can investigate rental car companies for recall violations. Motor vehicle dealers must notify owners of open recalls when servicing their vehicles. The law aims to increase owner participation in recall campaigns by expanding notification methods to include electronic means like email and social media. The FAST Act includes provisions on vehicle safety, requiring rental car companies to repair recalled vehicles before renting, leasing, or selling them. NHTSA must investigate rental car companies for recall violations, and motor vehicle dealers must notify owners of open recalls when servicing their vehicles. The law aims to increase owner participation in recall campaigns by expanding notification methods to include email, social media, and targeted online campaigns. DOT is mandated to conduct multiyear analyses of recall completion rates and report findings to Congress, including information on completion rates by manufacturer, model year, components, and vehicle type. NHTSA is also required to report on improving recall completion rates based on the analyses. The DOT Inspector General must audit NHTSA's management of safety recalls, and DOT is directed to initiate a two-year pilot grant program with select states to evaluate using motor vehicle registration processes to inform consumers of open recalls. Additionally, DOT has two years to enhance its website for easier public access to motor vehicle safety recall information. The law increases civil penalties for vehicle safety violations, extends the time period for automakers to remedy defects and retain safety records, and includes a whistleblower provision to encourage reporting of potential defects. The DOT is studying the feasibility of adding a technical system to new vehicles to alert owners of open recalls. The FAST Act includes provisions for whistleblowers to report motor vehicle safety violations and receive awards from recovered civil penalties. The Driver Privacy Act of 2015 states that data from event data recorders (EDRs) belongs to the vehicle owner, with access restricted except under certain circumstances. NHTSA must evaluate and regulate the time period for EDR data capture to investigate motor vehicle crashes. Congressional concern has been raised regarding the use and ownership of EDR data. The FAST Act requires DOT to research ways to reduce risks of hyperthermia or hypothermia to children left in vehicles. It also mandates NHTSA to collect more data on child restraints in crashes and develop rules for adding crash avoidance information on vehicle window stickers. Additionally, the Act includes provisions for updating tire pressure monitoring standards and developing rules for tire fuel efficiency. NHTSA updated tire pressure monitoring standards, established a tire recall database, and extended the time period for remedying defects to 180 days. Congress is considering proposals to expand NHTSA's authority to regulate motor vehicles, including requiring auto dealers to fix used cars with defects. In 2015, it was argued that auto dealers do not sell cars with defects and some recalls are overly broad. NHTSA lacks authority to order repairs for recalled vehicles used by taxi and ride-sharing services. The Obama Administration sought imminent hazard authority for NHTSA, but Congress did not grant it in the FAST Act. Some Members of Congress want NHTSA to make manufacturer information more publicly available. The NHTSA aims to make manufacturer information more accessible on a website for consumers and safety analysts to evaluate potential defects. They may allow regional recalls if evidence shows the defect is primarily in certain areas, as seen in the Takata airbag recall. Critics argue that regional recalls can be risky as vehicles can be sold or moved to high-humidity areas. Legislation proposed during the FAST Act considered expanding NHTSA's authority. The Security and Privacy in Your Car Act of 2017 (S. 680) proposed federal standards to secure connected features and vehicle data from hackers. It also suggested a \"cyber dashboard\" rating on vehicle stickers. The Security and Privacy in Your Car Study Act of 2017 (H.R. 701) would require NHTSA to report to Congress on cybersecurity standards for motor vehicles. The Obama Administration requested Congress to raise the maximum civil penalty for manufacturers selling vehicles that violate safety standards to $105 million, up from $35 million."
