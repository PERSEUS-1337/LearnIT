    "content": "A central goal of unsupervised learning is to acquire representations from unlabeled data for more effective learning of downstream tasks with limited labeled data. Instead of using proxy objectives like reconstruction or prediction, this method focuses on unsupervised meta-learning by constructing tasks from unlabeled data and running meta-learning over them. Simple task construction mechanisms, such as clustering embeddings, have shown good performance on various downstream tasks. Experiments on four image datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of this unsupervised meta-learning approach in acquiring a learning algorithm without any supervision. Our unsupervised meta-learning approach acquires a learning algorithm without labeled data, improving upon prior unsupervised learning methods. Unsupervised learning is a fundamental problem with promising results in image recognition and natural language understanding. The goal is to learn useful representations for downstream tasks without supervision. Our proposed unsupervised meta-learning method aims to learn a learning procedure without supervision, useful for solving a wide range of new tasks with only raw, unlabeled observations. Our model aims to enable few-shot learning of new tasks without labeled data by learning a useful prior through unsupervised meta-learning. To achieve this, tasks are automatically constructed from unlabeled data by leveraging prior unsupervised learning algorithms to categorize the data. The paper discusses using overcomplete partitioning of datasets to create categorizations for meta-learning algorithms. By leveraging unsupervised embeddings, the meta-learning algorithm acquires priors that improve performance on new tasks. This approach enables effective learning without additional assumptions or supervision. See Figure 1 for an illustration of the process. The paper introduces an unsupervised meta-learning algorithm for pre-training on downstream tasks without labels. It compares favorably to prior unsupervised learning methods across various image datasets, showing effectiveness in tasks like character recognition, object classification, and facial attribute discrimination. The method does not require hand-designed tasks during meta-learning and maintains consistent hyperparameters across different domains. The unsupervised meta-learning algorithm performs well on few-shot learning and downstream tasks with up to 50 training examples per class. Results show performance approaching fully-supervised meta-learning techniques. The approach involves clustering raw observations with k-means to create classification tasks for the meta-learner to solve. Our goal is to leverage unlabeled data for efficient learning of downstream tasks with minimal labeled data. Downstream tasks are M-way classification tasks assumed to have inputs from the same distribution as the unlabeled data. The unsupervised meta-training phase aims to learn a general prior for M-way classification tasks with limited labeled data, without specific information about the tasks. The upper bound N for the number of classes is known, but values of M and K are not predetermined. This approach is useful for training application-specific image classifiers efficiently. An unsupervised embedding learning algorithm E takes an unlabeled dataset and outputs lower-dimensional embeddings. These embeddings represent meaningful differences between inputs. A task consists of K training datapoints and labels per class, used for learning a classifier, and Q query datapoints per class for evaluation. Meta-learning is used for supervised learning in this context. Meta-learning involves a supervised algorithm that learns a learning procedure to produce classifiers for tasks. It iterates over training tasks, applying the learning procedure to improve performance. Two meta-learning algorithms, MAML and ProtoNets, are utilized for this purpose. Meta-learning involves learning initial parameters of a deep network for effective generalization. ProtoNets metalearn a representation where classes are identified by prototypes. Task generation for meta-learning involves constructing N-way classification tasks from labeled datasets. In meta-learning, tasks are constructed by sampling classes, data points, and one-hot vectors as task-specific labels. The goal is to acquire an efficient learning procedure from unlabeled data that can be transferred to human-designed tasks. By metalearning diverse and structured classification tasks, fast learning of new tasks can be achieved. In meta-learning, tasks are generated by constructing partitions over unlabeled data. The challenge lies in finding a systematic way to define these partitions without relying on human labels. Randomly partitioning the data leads to diverse tasks but lacks structure, resulting in failed meta-learning. A principled alternative to human labels is needed to create consistent tasks for effective learning. To address the challenge of failed meta-learning with random tasks, we propose using k-means clustering to group datapoints based on salient features. The clusters generated by k-means can be treated as classes for unsupervised meta-training, but the effectiveness depends on the metric space used. Clustering in pixel-space is problematic due to poor correlation with semantic meaning and high dimensionality of raw images. Clustering in pixel-space is challenging due to the high dimensionality of raw images. Meta-learning with tasks defined by pixel-space clusters also fails. To address this, we aim to cluster in spaces where distance functions correlate to semantic meaning, using state-of-the-art unsupervised learning methods to create useful embedding spaces. These embedding spaces exhibit semantic meaning and can be leveraged for structured tasks. To construct structured tasks, an unsupervised embedding learning algorithm is applied to map data into an embedding space. Clustering is then used to generate diverse partitions, with tasks derived for meta-learning. Sampling from uniform distribution helps avoid imbalanced clusters in meta-training tasks. The method CACTUs utilizes clustering to automatically create tasks for unsupervised meta-learning, choosing to meta-learn on images for better adaptation to new tasks at meta-test time. The method CACTUs utilizes clustering to automatically create tasks for unsupervised meta-learning, aiming to address the unsupervised learning problem by acquiring a transferable learning procedure without labels. The algorithm details the task construction process and provides an illustration of the complete unsupervised meta-learning approach for classification. CACTUs utilizes clustering to create tasks for unsupervised meta-learning without labels. The method samples embeddings and constructs meta-learning tasks, leveraging prior unsupervised learning methods to learn a more useful representation. Unsupervised pre-training has a history of success in neural network training and various domains. Unsupervised pre-training has been successful in various domains like speech recognition, image classification, machine translation, and text classification. Our approach, unsupervised meta-learning, focuses on optimizing for few-shot transferability to better learn downstream tasks compared to other unsupervised methods. We empirically evaluate this hypothesis in the next section. Unsupervised pre-training is beneficial when only a small amount of data is available for downstream tasks. It differs from semi-supervised learning by being more versatile in transferring learned representations to various tasks. This approach builds upon meta-learning concepts. Our method utilizes meta-learning algorithms to construct unsupervised tasks for efficient learning algorithms using unlabeled datasets. Unlike prior works that use supervised data, we focus on entirely unsupervised settings for downstream tasks, particularly high-dimensional visual observations. The experimental section presents research questions and experiments designed to address them, focusing on the benefit of meta-learning on tasks derived from embeddings. MAML and ProtoNets are run on tasks generated via CACTUs, compared to five alternate algorithms, including supervised learning methods on top of the embedding function. The experimental section compares MAML and ProtoNets on tasks generated via CACTUs with five alternate algorithms, including supervised learning methods on top of the embedding function. Different approaches like embedding linear classifier, embedding multilayer perceptron, and embedding cluster matching are also explored to isolate the effect of meta-learning on images. Unsupervised meta-learning using four embedding learning algorithms: ACAI, BiGAN, DeepCluster, and InfoGAN, covering various unsupervised learning objectives. Investigating if unsupervised meta-learning can provide a good prior for different task types, assessing the ability to distinguish between features on different scales and varying levels of supervision signal. The study evaluates unsupervised meta-learning on tasks assessing character identity, object identity, and facial attributes using Omniglot and miniImageNet datasets. A new few-shot classification benchmark based on the CelebA dataset is also constructed. Performance is compared to supervised meta-learning using labeled datasets for MAML and ProtoNets. In this study, supervised meta-learning algorithms like Oracle-MAML and Oracle-ProtoNets are compared with unsupervised variants using fair hyperparameter control. Task construction methods are explored, including clustering (CACTUs-MAML), hyperplane slices (Hyperplanes-MAML), random assignments (Random-MAML), and pixel-space clusters (Pixels CACTUs-MAML) with the Omniglot dataset. The study explores task construction methods like clustering (Pixels CACTUs-MAML) with the Omniglot dataset. Limitations are investigated by considering an easier version of the problem statement. Results on miniImageNet after unsupervised meta-learning on ILSVRC 2012 are presented. Adherence to proper experimental protocol is emphasized to avoid overfitting. Architecture engineering is avoided, using prior work architectures as-is or with light adaptations. The study avoids architecture engineering by using prior work architectures as-is or with light adaptations. Hyperparameters related to unsupervised meta-learning are kept constant, and an upper bound on the number of classes N is assumed for each dataset. Meta-training, meta-validation, and meta-testing splits are created, with unsupervised pre-training done on the unlabeled meta-training split. The study focuses on unsupervised meta-learning, using prior work architectures without architecture engineering. Hyperparameters are kept constant, and pre-training is done on the unlabeled meta-training split. Performance is evaluated on downstream tasks using labeled data from the meta-testing split. Meta-validation tasks are constructed using labels from the meta-validation split, without hyperparameter tuning. Fixed number of meta-training iterations are used, with no early stopping criterion. Embedding-plus-supervised-learning methods are used for comparison to unsupervised meta-learning. The study focuses on unsupervised meta-learning, using prior work architectures without architecture engineering. Methods used for fair comparisons to unsupervised meta-learning involve providing more supervision and data than technically allowed. Results show that CACTUs-MAML consistently outperforms other unsupervised methods in downstream task performance. CACTUs-ProtoNets perform best when meta-training shot and meta-testing shot are matched, preventing improvement upon ACAI for 20-way 5-shot Omniglot and DeepCluster for 50-shot miniImageNet. The success of CACTUs-based meta-learning is attributed to its ability to distinguish between distinct clusters and the out-of-distribution nature of the meta-testing split data. This factor explains why training from standard network initialization is competitive with using embedding cluster matching. Training from standard network initialization is competitive with using the task-generating embedding as a representation. CACTUs is effective for various embedding learning methods used for task generation, with unsupervised meta-learning performance largely predicted by non-meta-learning methods. ACAI and DeepCluster embeddings perform well with Omniglot and miniImageNet, respectively, leading to the best unsupervised results with CACTUs-MAML. The DeepCluster embedding corresponds to the best performing unsupervised meta-learner, CACTUs-MAML, which is effective for various task types. Despite being trained for 1-shot classification, these models work well for a variety of tasks. The penalty for not having ground truth labels for optimal tasks varies depending on task difficulty. Easier tasks incur less of a penalty. The effectiveness of CACTUs-MAML in various task types is highlighted, outperforming Hyperplanes-MAML consistently. Non-zero margin with Hyperplanes-MAML is crucial for miniImageNet but not for Omniglot due to dataset diversity. Multiple partitions for CACTUs-MAML are beneficial but not strictly necessary. Meta-learning on diverse datasets can result in a prior that is less useful than other algorithms. Overfitting is not observed in unsupervised tasks, but meta-training performance can sometimes be worse than metatest time performance due to nonsensical clusters. Using multiple partitions has a regularizing effect on the meta-learner. The study demonstrates that meta-learning on tasks created using simple mechanisms based on embeddings enhances the utility of these representations in learning downstream tasks. The performance of the meta-learner is heavily influenced by the nature and quality of the task-generating embeddings, acting as a bridge between embedding learning methods and meta-learning algorithms. The gap between unsupervised and supervised meta-learning persists due to the human-designed task distribution in the latter. CACTUs-based meta-learning offers broad applicability and the ability to train on unlabeled data, potentially outperforming supervised meta-learning on misaligned task distributions. Further investigation is needed to explore this potential advantage. Future work should focus on finding datasets and tasks where CACTUs-based meta-learning may not be effective, to better understand its practical applicability and drive further development in automatic task construction mechanisms. Concerns were raised about the experimental evaluation on MNIST, Omniglot, and miniImageNet, as they have structured class distributions designed for supervised learning benchmarks, which may not reflect real-world scenarios. Our CelebA results show that CACTUs is effective even with unbalanced datasets. Future work aims to characterize the performance of CACTUs with unstructured data. Unsupervised pretraining methods like MAML and ProtoNets produce learned representations, while our method derives a new representation suited for downstream tasks. This approach can be applied to various domains beyond visual classification, such as regression, speech, language, and reinforcement learning. The approach aims to improve unsupervised representations in various domains. Four methods are evaluated for learning task-generating embeddings, including ACAI and BiGAN. ACAI uses a convolutional autoencoder with a regularization term for meaningful interpolations in the latent space. BiGAN is a generative-adversarial framework where the generator produces synthetic images and embeddings from real embeddings. The generator in the framework produces synthetic images and embeddings from real data, with discrimination done in a joint image-embedding space. DeepCluster method involves clustering features of a neural network and using the clusters as labels to optimize network weights. InfoGAN decomposes the generator's input into a latent code and noise, with a mutual information term between the code and generated image. The framework involves variational inference for optimizing the mutual information term. The ACAI, BiGAN, InfoGAN, and DeepCluster methods focus on optimizing image generation and feature learning. The Omniglot dataset contains 1623 characters with 20 examples each, while the miniImageNet dataset has 100 classes with 600 examples. The miniImageNet dataset consists of 100 classes with 600 examples, while the CelebA dataset includes 202,599 facial images of celebrities with 40 binary attributes. Tasks are constructed for Omniglot and miniImageNet following specific guidelines, and for CelebA, binary classification tasks are considered. For the supervised meta-learning oracle, tasks are split into meta-training, meta-validation, and meta-testing using different sets of attributes. This results in various task prototypes for evaluation. Unsupervised methods are also assessed using the same meta-test time tasks, focusing on 5-shot tasks. The text discusses generating tasks using random hyperplanes in the embedding space to create a partition of embedding points. The goal is to avoid ill-defined classes by extending hyperplane boundaries with a non-zero margin, as shown empirically in Section 4.2. To generate a partition P of embeddings for metatraining tasks, hyperplanes are randomly defined in the embedding space. The signed point-plane distance is used to assign points to subsets, ensuring a desired margin. Subsets with fewer than R = K m-tr + Q members are pruned, and the partition must have at least N subsets. After generating partitions of embeddings for meta-training tasks using hyperplanes, we pre-compute 1000 hyperplanes and pairs of subsets. Partitions are created by sampling combinations of hyperplanes and taking intersections of subsets. The number of partitions needed is determined by the desired number of meta-training tasks. The MNIST dataset with 70,000 hand-drawn examples of 10 digits is used for 10-way classification tasks. This setup ensures examples from all 10 digits are present for both meta-training and testing. For MNIST, meta-training tasks involve examples from all 10 digits. The meta-validation split is constructed from the last 5,000 examples for ACAI and InfoGAN, and 10,000 for BiGAN. ACAI model with whitened embeddings achieves 96.00% accuracy, while InfoGAN embedding accuracy is 96.83% with categorical dimensions. In addition to running CACTUs-MAML on raw images, the study also applied it to embeddings using a simple model with 2 hidden layers. The results, shown in TAB8 in Appendix B, revealed that with better embeddings like ACAI and InfoGAN, there were improvements in performance. In TAB8 of Appendix B, CACTUs-MAML shows little benefit over embedding cluster matching with ACAI and InfoGAN embeddings. It falls short of state-of-the-art semi-supervised learning methods. The model architecture used is similar to BID15's experiments, with adjustments for consistency. The meta-learned 20-way Omniglot model is evaluated with 5-way tasks, using Adam as the outer optimizer and SGD as the inner optimizer. The codebase used is publicly available at https://github.com/cbfinn/maml. Using batch normalization for processing training or query inputs, using 1 query datapoint per class can lead to spurious accuracy improvements. To address this, we fix 5 queries per class for evaluation in meta-training or meta-testing. The architecture used is a 4-block convolutional architecture with 64 3x3 filters, BatchNorm, ReLU activation, and MaxPooling. The ProtoNets embedding is the flattened output of the last block. The Adam optimizer is used without a learning rate scheduler. The codebase is based on the authors' publicly available code. For Omniglot, miniImageNet, and CelebA datasets, the number of clusters is fixed at 500. The number of partitions is set to 100 for Omniglot and 50 for miniImageNet and CelebA. ACAI is run on MNIST and Omniglot datasets with a 256-dimensional embedding. Attempts to run ACAI on miniImageNet and CelebA at 64x64 resolution were unsuccessful, requiring additional layers for input size adjustment. ACAI's pixel-wise reconstruction loss prioritizes dominant features in datasets, leading to clusters corresponding to limited factors like background color and pose. Meta-learning on these clusters resulted in high accuracy on training tasks but was not useful for downstream tasks. BiGAN BID11 uses a uniform 50-dimensional prior for MNIST and a 200-dimensional prior for Omniglot, miniImageNet, and CelebA. For MNIST and Omniglot, the authors use a permutation-invariant architecture with fully connected layers. For miniImageNet and CelebA, they randomly crop to 64 \u00d7 64 and use an AlexNet-inspired architecture. They modify the first layer of the AlexNet architecture to accommodate the input size and use the output layer as the embedding. The dimensions are reduced to 256 using PCA followed by whitening. InfoGAN is only run for MNIST. The experimental results for MNIST, Omniglot, miniImageNet, and CelebA datasets are provided, including classification accuracy over 1000 tasks with specified labels. The latent code for InfoGAN consists of a 10-way categorical distribution and a 2-dimensional uniform distribution. The recognition network is used to obtain image embeddings, and the authors' architecture is utilized. The codebase for InfoGAN can be found at https://github.com/openai/InfoGAN. Unsupervised meta-learning was investigated using the ILSVRC 2012 dataset's training split BID24. Results showed varying accuracy percentages for different models and approaches, including CACTUs-MAML, CACTUs-ProtoNets, and supervised meta-learning Oracle-MAML. The meta-training dataset used for unsupervised meta-learning was based on the ILSVRC 2012 dataset's training split BID24, which includes 1000 classes and over 1,200,000 images. Task leakage was avoided by holding out data from 36 underlying classes to construct the meta-training split. DeepCluster with VGG-16 architecture was used to obtain embeddings with a 256-dimensional feature space and 10,000 clusters. No prior works have been published on this approach. The study explores using MAML for ImageNet-sized meta-learning, extending the CNN model with residual connections. Hyperparameters are validated with supervised meta-learning and used for unsupervised meta-learning. Tasks are generated using ground-truth ImageNet classes and CACTUs-based tasks for semi-supervised MAML. Task proportions are determined by data availability. The study explores using MAML for ImageNet-sized meta-learning, extending the CNN model with residual connections. The meta-learning methods only meta-learned on 1-shot tasks. The increased amount of unlabeled meta-training data results in significant performance increases for all methods. CACTUs-MAML slightly outperforms embedding linear classifier for 1-shot test tasks, but the linear classifier becomes better with more test time supervision. Augmenting unsupervised tasks with supervised tasks during meta-training shows slight improvement for 1-shot test tasks. Using larger architecture with MAML could improve performance for all methods. Unsupervised task construction with better meta-learning algorithms may enhance performance in unsupervised learning. Future work will investigate these possibilities."
