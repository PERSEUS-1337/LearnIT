    "content": "This report presents trends in discretionary budget authority as a percentage of GDP by subfunction within budget categories, using data from President Trump's FY2018 budget submission. It includes historical trends from FY1977 to FY2016, estimates for FY2017 spending, and levels consistent with the President's proposals for FY2018 through FY2022. The report shows spending as a percentage of GDP to account for inflation, population growth, and income growth. Past spending trends can help frame policy discussions for the 115th Congress as it prepares to address new challenges in the federal budget for FY2018. Discretionary spending is controlled through appropriations acts, funding activities associated with federal government functions. The discretionary budget authority presented in the report reflects funding for federal government functions, including executive branch agencies, congressional offices, and international operations. Discretionary spending is measured in terms of budget authority (BA), which is compared to having funds in a checking account. Outlays, which occur when the U.S. Treasury disburses funds to honor obligations, follow BA with a lag. Outlays typically follow budget authority (BA) with a lag, especially for personnel costs. Large projects may spread outlays over several years. Most BA eventually results in outlays, but some initiatives are later cancelled, leading to BA rescissions. Changes in historical budget data can reflect shifts in budgetary concepts or treatment of spending types. For example, the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 altered the budgetary treatment of federal credit programs starting in FY1992. Discussions on federal spending levels, especially in defense and security, have influenced congressional funding decisions. Statutory caps on discretionary funding were reintroduced in the 2011 Budget Control Act. Funding for FY2017 included two continuing resolutions with across-the-board reductions. The Budget Control Act of 2011 reintroduced statutory caps on discretionary funding. Funding for FY2017 was extended through various measures, including a one-week stopgap funding measure and an omnibus appropriations measure. Fiscal policy discussions focused on government deficits and debt following the Great Recession, with tax revenue drops and increased spending due to economic downturns. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 provided increased federal funding for education, energy, and other areas, along with tax reductions. The Budget Control Act of 2011 reinstated caps on discretionary spending to address rising deficits and debt levels. The act aimed to achieve $2.1 trillion in savings over FY2012-FY2021, with an initial set of caps estimated to save $900 billion over 10 years. The \"Super Committee\" was tasked with developing a plan to reduce deficits by $1.2 trillion, but failed to meet the deadline. The Budget Control Act of 2011 reinstated caps on discretionary spending to achieve $2.1 trillion in savings over FY2012-FY2021. When the \"Super Committee\" failed to report a plan by a November 2011 deadline, backup budget enforcement measures were triggered, including a sequester in January 2013 and revised caps on defense and non-defense funding for FY2013-FY2021. Annual sequester of non-exempt mandatory spending also contributes to savings. Discretionary spending under the Budget Control Act (BCA) would decrease to 5.3% of GDP by FY2026, down from 7.3% in FY2007. The BCA caps prompted adjustments through the Bipartisan Budget Acts of 2013 and 2015 to avoid disruptions in federal operations. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 raised cap levels for FY2016 and FY2017 by $25 billion and FY2017 by $15 billion. BCA caps for FY2018 through FY2021 remain unchanged, constraining budget decisions for FY2018. War spending adjustments have alleviated budget pressure on military and international programs, but some argue it weakens fiscal discipline. Obama Administration proposed raising BCA caps for FY2017, while Trump Administration proposed raising defense caps for FY2018. The Trump Administration proposed increasing defense spending by $54 billion for FY2018, while decreasing non-defense spending by an equal amount. The budget data from the Office of Management and Budget does not provide a breakdown by discretionary and mandatory subcomponents. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) maintains detailed budget data for internal use, which may differ from other budget data for various reasons. Differences can be due to scorekeeping adjustments, revisions, or technical differences. Detailed appropriations data may also differ from OMB data, with some small zero-balance transfers among funds not always reflected. Certain inflows like offsetting receipts and collections are treated as negative budget authority. Additionally, provisions in appropriations acts can impact mandatory spending programs. Scorekeeping adjustments, like CHIMPs, impact discretionary budget authority totals and BCA spending limits, causing differences between actual spending levels and budget caps. CHIMPs affecting programs such as criminal justice assistance and CHIP can lead to fluctuations in subfunction spending levels. The federal government uses accrual accounting for loan and loan guarantee programs, with net subsidy rates calculated according to FCRA rules. FCRA adjustments mainly impact mandatory spending due to the largest sources of federal credit being mandatory programs. Comparisons of federal credit program costs before and after FY1991 should be approached with caution due to changes in budgetary treatment. The budgetary treatment of federal credit programs changed after FY1991 with the implementation of FCRA rules. Before FCRA, loan guarantee programs were understated as they required no upfront federal disbursements, while federal loan programs did not reflect future repayments. FCRA made loan and loan guarantee programs more comparable, but estimates calculated before FCRA may not be comparable to those afterward. FCRA subsidy calculations may show negative net subsidy levels, but they do not include risk adjustments, leading to potentially substantial economic costs for federal credit guarantees. The economic cost of federal credit guarantees can be underestimated without risk adjustments. Functional categories allow comparison of federal funding across policy areas. Superfunction categories include National Defense, Human Resources, Physical Resources, and Other Functions. Net Interest, Allowances, and Undistributed Offsetting Receipts are additional categories. In addition to functional categories, superfunction categories like National Defense, Net Interest, Allowances, and Undistributed Offsetting Receipts are also considered. Trends in net interest are excluded due to automatic appropriations since 1847. Allowances contain technical budget adjustments, and undistributed offsetting receipts are excluded as well. Allowances in FY2018 include adjustments to BCA caps and proposals for various funding areas. International Affairs function is listed after National Defense in the report. Subfunction categories provide a finer division of funding levels within. Federal spending trends in functional areas are influenced by national priorities, international challenges, economic conditions, and demographics. Budget functions do not impact budget enforcement but are highlighted in budget resolutions to show fiscal priorities. Trends in defense and international affairs, domestic social programs, and other federal programs are discussed, with spending shown as a percentage of total. Federal spending trends in functional areas are influenced by national priorities, international challenges, economic conditions, and demographics. The National Defense (050) and International Affairs (150) budget functions have been most affected by changes in the geopolitical role of the United States. The allocation of discretionary spending between defense and non-defense programs reflects changing federal priorities over time. Relations with the USSR were a dominant security concern post-World War II. In the 1970s, U.S. defense spending decreased due to improved relations with the USSR, but rose sharply after their intervention in Afghanistan in 1979. Defense spending continued to increase until 1986, then decreased after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. The 9/11 attacks led to a surge in homeland security spending. Defense spending increased significantly with the start of the Afghanistan and Iraq wars. U.S. combat troops were withdrawn from Iraq in 2011, and most troops were planned to be withdrawn from Afghanistan by 2014, but operations were extended. The Obama Administration faced challenges from Russia, ISIS, and cyberattacks. President Trump proposed a $54 billion increase in defense programs in his FY2018 budget. The National Defense budget function includes subfunctions such as DOD-Military, atomic energy defense activities, and defense-related activities outside of DOD. The majority of funding goes to DOD-Military, while atomic energy defense activities support operations within the DOE, with a focus on NNSA. Counterterrorism activities within the FBI receive significant funding within the defense-related activities subfunction. The international affairs budget function receives a significant portion of funding, with fluctuations in response to foreign relations and federal priorities. Funding for security assistance rose sharply in the late 1970s and early 1980s, particularly for Israel and Egypt. Economic Support Fund (ESF) also grew rapidly during this time. Funding for security assistance decreased after the collapse of the Warsaw Pact and the Soviet Union. Funding for international development and humanitarian assistance fluctuated over the years, dropping from 0.2% of GDP in the late 1970s to less than 0.1% in the 1990s. The George W. Bush Administration increased funding in the early 2000s through initiatives like PEPFAR and MCC. Funding levels remained around 0.15% of GDP during the Obama Administration. Since the 1970s, funding for international financial programs has fluctuated, with occasional quota payments by the United States to the IMF. Budgetary treatment of these payments has varied, with costs calculated based on risks to U.S. investments in the IMF since 2009. Costs of conducting foreign affairs rose during the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq but have been declining since FY2012. Since 2001, domestic spending has increased, particularly in non-defense security areas, following the attacks of September 11. This rise in spending was driven by the overhaul of airport security procedures and the establishment of the Department of Homeland Security. Various definitions of \"security spending\" have been used, with the most recent one in the 2011 Budget Control Act. Since the 2011 Budget Control Act, security spending definitions have been utilized. Funding trends are divided into BCA security and non-security categories. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) was passed after the 2007-2008 financial crisis, providing support for state and local governments, tax cuts, and rebates. Initial estimates projected $787.2 billion in increased spending and reduced taxes, with a more recent estimate at $814 billion. Recovery Act effects are evident in the figures. However, since 2010, total non-defense discretionary spending has decreased in real terms. Since 2010, total non-defense discretionary spending has declined in real terms, with a more rapid decline in its share of the economy. Funding trends for most budget categories have been less volatile since FY2010. Federal training and employment programs, such as CETA and JTPA, have accounted for significant spending within the Education, Training, Employment, and Social Services budget function. Federal funding for various programs has fluctuated over the years, with increases during times of economic downturns such as the 1981-1982 recession and the Great Recession of 2007-2009. However, since 2010, funding levels have tapered off. Health care programs like Medicare and Medicaid continue to be significant costs in budget discussions, primarily supported by mandatory spending. Administrative costs for these programs are a small portion of the total costs. Federal funding for health programs, including Medicare and veterans' health care, is primarily supported by discretionary spending. While funding for federal health programs has decreased as a share of GDP since FY2009, veterans' health care funding has continued to increase. Discretionary funding for health care services supports programs administered by the Centers for Disease Control. The subfunction supports health programs administered by various agencies, with funding doubling from the mid-1980s to FY2001. Funding trends have been volatile since then, with spikes in FY2009 for influenza pandemic response and health technology investments. A downward spike in FY2017 and FY2018 was due to a change in mandatory spending affecting CHIP. NIH accounts for most health research and training. The NIH accounts for most health research and training funding, which has fluctuated over the years. Discretionary funding for Medicare and consumer and occupational health and safety has remained stable. Federal funding for income security programs, including housing assistance, has remained stable at about 0.03% to 0.04% of GDP. Discretionary spending outside of housing assistance covers administrative costs, while housing assistance programs rely on discretionary funding. Changes in the Income Security budget function mainly reflect shifts in funding for housing assistance programs in the 1970s and 1980s. Federal funding for income security programs, including housing assistance, has fluctuated since the late 1970s. The share of funding for housing assistance has varied due to new programs and rescissions of unobligated balances. Despite legislative responses to the Great Recession increasing funding for housing programs in FY2009, housing assistance's share of GDP remains below a quarter of its peak. Discretionary funding for Social Security supports program administration, with benefits primarily funded by mandatory spending. Since the late 1970s, federal funding for income security programs, including housing assistance, has fluctuated. The costs of administrating Old-Age and Survivors Insurance (OASI) benefits grew more slowly than the rate of economic growth. In recent years, costs of administering Disability Insurance (DI) benefits have exceeded costs of administering OASI benefits. Veterans' income security programs, such as disability compensation and pensions, are generally supported by discretionary funding within the Veterans' Benefits and Services budget function. Since 2001, veterans' health care costs have been one of the fastest growing components of discretionary spending. The Veterans' Health Care Eligibility Reform Act of 1996 required the establishment of a national enrollment system to manage the delivery of medical care for veterans. The VHA began enrolling veterans and classifying them into priority groups in FY1999. The VHA enrollment system was established to provide care to veterans based on available resources. By FY2016, the number of enrollees increased by 90% to 9.4 million, reflecting newer veterans from Afghanistan and Iraq, growth in female veterans, and economic conditions. Funding for veterans' benefits has doubled since FY2005. The Benefits and Services budget function has doubled since FY2005 as a percentage of GDP, with most funding supporting operations of the Department of Energy (DOE) and rural electrification programs. About half of DOE's budget funds nuclear weapons programs or cleanup efforts. The spike in funding within the energy supply subfunction in response to the 1978-1979 oil shock is notable. President Jimmy Carter signed the Energy Security Act in June 1980. President Jimmy Carter signed the Energy Security Act in June 1980, which allocated $88 billion for renewable energy initiatives and synthetic fuels production. The Synthetic Fuels Corporation, created by the act, was abolished in 1985 after facing challenges in project development. The Energy Security Act also mandated oil reserve purchases, with Congress requiring additional purchases in December 1980. In December 1980, oil reserve purchases were mandated by Congress. The ARRA provided $90 billion for clean energy projects, with $35 billion going to the DOE. Funding within the Natural Resources and Environment budget function supports various federal agencies like DOI, EPA, Forest Service, and NOAA. The curr_chunk discusses federal support for water projects by agencies like NOAA, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the U.S. Coast Guard. Funding for wastewater treatment plants increased in the 1970s but was reduced in the 1980s due to budget constraints. Federal aid for water infrastructure projects has evolved over time. The federal government provides grants to states for water infrastructure projects, including drinking water and environmental protection activities. Funding for water resources projects has declined since the mid-1970s. The decline in funding for water resources projects since the mid-1970s can be attributed to various reasons, including changes in federal cost-sharing policies under the Water Resources Development Act of 1986. Presidents Carter and Reagan targeted excess federal spending on water projects, leading to reductions in federal contributions and a shift away from new project construction by agencies like the Bureau of Reclamation. The focus of the Bureau of Reclamation has shifted from developing water projects to managing water resources. Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management funding are significant within the conservation and land management budget. ARRA provided additional funding for EPA, Army Corps of Engineers, and Forest Service capital improvements in FY2009. Commerce and housing credit budget function supports programs in various federal agencies. The Housing and Urban Development (HUD) programs, along with other federal agencies, provide credit for housing and business loans. The costs of these programs are calculated using methods prescribed by the Federal Credit Reform Act (FCRA). Fluctuations in budgetary costs are sensitive to anticipated economic conditions. Negative credit subsidies result when the present value of fees collected exceeds disbursements and default costs. For example, recent years have shown large negative credit subsidy estimates for the single-family mortgage insurance program within the Federal Housing Administration (FHA). Expected negative credit subsidies for FHA-insured mortgages increased due to various factors, including better credit quality, higher fees charged to borrowers, and increased loan volumes. The U.S. Postal Service operates without federal operating subsidies, covering its costs with its own revenues. Funding for the decennial census falls under the subfunction of commerce, with peaks visible at 10-year intervals. Funding within the transportation budget function primarily supports activities of the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT), including grants and financial support to state and local governments. Some ground transportation programs have special budgetary status since 1988, enabling transportation funding to bypass certain budget classifications. The transportation budget function primarily supports DOT activities, with some ground transportation programs having special budgetary status since 1988. This status allows transportation funding to bypass budgetary restraints. Trends in ground transportation funding exclude most federal highway funding from the Highway Trust Fund, which is mandatory, not discretionary. State governments typically match federal funds, and discretionary funding for ground transportation does not include transfers from the U.S. Treasury's general fund to the Highway Trust Fund. The transportation budget function primarily supports DOT activities, with special budgetary status for ground transportation programs since 1988. Discretionary funding for ground transportation peaked in the late 1970s and early 1980s, mainly for mass transit systems. Funding for road and infrastructure projects increased in the 2000s, including airport security post-9/11. Funding for water transportation has been more consistent. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) was established in March 2003. Funding for water transportation has been stable. The Community and Regional Development budget function includes funding for federal programs supporting state and local government development and disaster responses. The largest item in the Community Development subfunction is HUD's Community Development Fund, which includes the CDBG program. Federal community development funding decreased from almost 0.2% of GDP. Federal community development funding has decreased from almost 0.2% of GDP in the late 1970s to about half that level in the 1990s. Funding has fluctuated since FY2000 due to congressional responses to disasters and economic recessions. The Area and Regional Development subfunction includes programs such as the Bureau of Indian Affairs, USDA rural development initiatives, Economic Development Administration programs, and regional development commissions like the Appalachian Regional Commission. The Public Works Employment Act increased funding for FY1977 and FY1978 to support local public works. The Public Works Employment Act (P.L. 95-28) increased funding for FY1977 and FY1978 to support local public works job creation efforts. The disaster relief and insurance subfunction funds FEMA and other programs within USDA, SBA, and HUD, with funding being volatile due to responses to natural and manmade disasters. Major spikes in funding were seen after Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, Wilma, and Sandy. NASA's funding has been dominant in the past half century, especially during the Apollo program in the mid-1960s. Funding declined after the program ended in the 1970s, with a spike for a replacement space shuttle after the Challenger disaster in 1986. From FY1993 to FY2016, NASA's budget decreased from 0.2% to 0.1% of GDP due to inflation and economic growth. Funding for general science and basic research (251) has increased unsteadily from the mid-1980s to the late 2000s, with a goal set in 2006 to double funding for NSF and DOE Office of Science. This goal has not been achieved, especially when expressed as a share of GDP. In FY2009, ARRA provided a temporary boost in funding for science and basic research. The Agriculture budget function (350) includes Agricultural Research and Services (352) and Farm Income Stabilization (351) subfunctions. The Agriculture budget function (350) includes Agricultural Research and Services (352) and Farm Income Stabilization (351) subfunctions. Most USDA programs, such as SNAP and child nutrition programs, are classified within the Income Support budget function. Forest Service and USDA conservation activities fall under the Natural Resources and Environment budget function, while foreign food aid falls under the International Affairs budget function. Funding for the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) quadrupled between FY1999 and FY2003. Funding for Agricultural Research and Services as a percentage of GDP has declined over the years, with a spike in FY2015 due to bird flu threats. The Farm Income Stabilization subfunction saw a sharp increase in FY1992 due to the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990. Many farm income stabilization programs are funded through mandatory spending. The Administration of Justice budget function includes federal judicial, law enforcement, and correctional activities. The Federal Law Enforcement Activities budget function includes operations of DHS, DOJ, and counterterrorism activities. Funding within this subfunction more than doubled from FY1980 to FY2010, with increases for CBP and ICE. Funding for CBP and ICE increased significantly from FY1980 to FY2010, with their share of federal law enforcement funding rising from 35% to 54% by FY2016. However, funding as a percentage of GDP has since decreased slightly. In contrast, funding for other law enforcement activities remained flat during this period. The Federal Litigative and Judicial Activities subfunction covers judicial branch operations, trial-related activities, legal defense services, and DOJ legal activities. Funding for this subfunction has also been included in the analysis. The Federal Correctional Activities subfunction (753) includes the DOJ Federal Prison System. The Criminal Justice Assistance subfunction (754) includes DOJ programs that assist state and local governments combat crime, violence against women, and drug trafficking. Funding for this subfunction has trended slightly upward until FY2010 and slightly downward since then. The increase in funding in FY1994 reflects enactment of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994. The COPS program provided additional funding for 100,000 local police officers. Funding levels have decreased since the mid-2000s, with a downward spike in proposed spending for FY2017 and FY2018 due to CHIMPs affecting the Crime Victims Fund. The General Government budget function includes costs of operating the legislative and executive branches, federal personnel policy, managing federal records and property, and providing fiscal support to state and local governments. Funding trends by subfunction within this budget function are shown in Figure 18. The Legislative Functions (801) subfunction includes activities of Congress and congressional agencies, such as the GAO, CBO, and CRS, along with the Capitol Police and the Architect of the Capitol. Funding for this subfunction has ranged from 0.03% to 0.04% of GDP since FY2000. The Executive Direction and Management (802) subfunction includes activities of the White House, agencies like the OMB and U.S. Trade Representative. The Central Fiscal Operations (803) subfunction includes operations of the IRS and U.S. Treasury. Funding for this subfunction has not exceeded 0.01% of GDP from FY1977-FY2017, with the IRS accounting for about 90% of the funding in FY2017. The General Property and Records Management (804) subfunction includes operations of GSA and NARA, with fluctuations in funding reflecting costs of GSA's Federal Buildings Fund. The Federal Buildings Fund operates as a revolving fund that receives rent payments from federal agencies to lease or maintain properties. The Central Personnel Management subfunction includes OPM and offices related to federal workforce issues. Funding for this subfunction has declined since the late 1970s. The General Purpose Fiscal Assistance subfunction provides aid to state and local governments. The Other General Government (808) subfunction provides federal support for various activities, including electoral reform. Funding for this subfunction has declined since the early 1980s."
