    "content": "Since 9/11, domestic terrorists drawing inspiration from U.S.-based extremist ideologies have not received as much attention from federal law enforcement as violent jihadists. The FBI reported in 1999 that most deadly terrorist attacks in the U.S. were perpetrated by domestic extremists. The U.S. government enhanced counterterrorism efforts post-9/11, shaping the landscape largely in response to foreign-inspired terrorists. This report discusses how domestic terrorists fit into the counterterrorism landscape and how they are conceptualized by the federal government. The federal government struggles to assess the significance of domestic terrorism due to varying terminology and tactics used by those labeled as domestic terrorists. Unlike foreign-inspired jihadists, domestic terrorists often rely on non-traditional tactics such as theft and property destruction, leading to their secondary status as a threat at the federal level. Domestic terrorists in the U.S. have been active, with incidents causing significant casualties. Timothy McVeigh's bombing in Oklahoma City in 1995 resulted in 168 deaths and over 500 injuries. These terrorists, like their jihadist counterparts, use the internet for planning. Motivated by various ideologies such as animal rights and white supremacy, they pose a diverse threat. Domestic terrorists in the U.S. are motivated by ideologies such as animal rights, white supremacy, and abortion. They operate autonomously and draw ideological support from propagandists, separate from those who commit violent acts. Lone actors or small groups generally operate in secret, posing a significant threat despite not being the top federal counterterrorism priority. In 2011, Los Angeles Deputy Police Chief Michael P. Downing listed \"black separatists, white supremacist/sovereign citizen extremists, and animal rights terrorists\" as top counterterrorism concerns. A 2014 survey found sovereign citizens were the top terrorist threat among law enforcement officers. The violence in Charlottesville in 2017 highlighted domestic terrorism issues, with James Alex Fields driving into a group of protesters, killing one and injuring 19. The Department of Justice opened a civil rights investigation. The Department of Justice has opened a civil rights investigation into the incident in Charlottesville, where James Alex Fields drove into a group of protesters, killing one and injuring 19 others. Attorney General Jeff Sessions mentioned terrorism investigators are involved, exploring the possibility of domestic terrorism charges. This report discusses the definition of domestic terrorism and key factors in assessing this threat. The definition of domestic terrorism is complex, with some considering all terrorist plots within the homeland as such. However, a narrower federal definition excludes individuals directed or motivated by foreign groups like Al Qaeda or the Islamic State. The U.S. government does not provide a precise list of domestic terrorist organizations. The U.S. government does not provide a precise list of domestic terrorist organizations, but the FBI defines domestic terrorism as unlawful force or violence to intimidate or coerce. The FBI defines domestic terrorism as unlawful force or violence to intimidate or coerce for political or social objectives within U.S. jurisdiction. This definition is more specific than international terrorism and other criminal activities. The FBI's definition of domestic terrorism focuses on Americans attacking Americans based on U.S.-based extremist ideologies, emphasizing that these actors lack foreign direction. However, there is ambiguity as some ideologies have international roots. The FBI faces challenges in addressing domestic terrorism due to the origins of extremist ideologies abroad, such as eco-extremism, animal rights extremism, Nazism, anarchism, and the racist skinhead movement. Counting terrorist prosecutions or plots post-9/11 has been difficult, and there is ambiguity in the investigative process. The federal government faces challenges in addressing domestic terrorism post-9/11, with ambiguity in the investigative process and interchangeability of terms like \"terrorist\" and \"extremist.\" Specific domestic terrorist organizations are not publicly identified, and the focus is on \"threats\" rather than groups. There is a lack of clarity on the scope of the domestic terrorist threat based on available government information. The federal courts and DOJ have different criteria for categorizing terrorist prosecutions, including domestic terrorism cases. There is no separate federal crime for domestic terrorism, leading to challenges in accurately assessing the extent of this threat. Domestic terrorism cases often involve firearms, arson, or explosive offenses. Domestic terrorism cases involve firearms, arson, or explosive offenses, fraud, threats, and hoaxes. The FBI supports local partners in investigations, even if the crimes don't violate federal law. Suspects may not be federally charged as terrorists. Investigators work to clarify motives in these cases, which differ from ordinary criminal activity driven by self-centered motives like profit. Domestic terrorism cases involve crimes driven by ideology, unlike ordinary criminals motivated by profit. Distinguishing between hate crimes and domestic terrorism can be challenging for investigators. The distinction between domestic terrorism and hate crimes can be blurred, as it depends on the suspect's intent and ideology. Suspects linked to domestic terrorist movements may be charged with hate crimes. The government's understanding of the threat posed by extremist movements with racist beliefs is influenced by this distinction. The concept of \"extremism\" further complicates discussions on domestic terrorism. The term \"extremism\" complicates discussions on domestic terrorism, as it is often used interchangeably with \"terrorism.\" This lack of uniformity in prosecution allows for flexibility in charging individuals under a wider array of statutes without labeling them as terrorists. The FBI's definition of \"extremism\" includes adherence to specific ideologies and engaging in criminal activities to further those beliefs. An anarchist extremist, for example, is someone who follows anarchist ideology and uses criminal tactics. This dual definition of extremism complicates the identification and understanding of the domestic terrorist threat. Extremism can refer to ideologies outside a society's values or using tactics that ignore others' rights. The FBI and DHS use the term \"homegrown violent extremist\" to separate domestic terrorists from those motivated by foreign terrorist organizations. The FBI and DHS distinguish between domestic terrorists and homegrown violent extremists (HVEs), who act independently of foreign terrorist organizations. There is no official list of domestic terrorist groups or individuals due to civil liberties concerns, making it challenging to assess domestic terrorism trends and federal efforts to counter them. The government does not have a designated list of domestic terrorist groups, leading to vagueness in public knowledge. However, domestic terrorists are included in the Terrorist Screening Database. Foreign terrorist organizations are officially designated by the government. According to the State Department's Bureau of Counterterrorism, as of August 16, 2017, 61 foreign terrorist organizations have been designated by the Secretary of State. The Department of Justice (DOJ) and the FBI do not publicly list domestic terrorist organizations, which complicates federal policymakers' understanding of domestic terrorism. However, DOJ has identified domestic terrorism threats including criminal activities by various extremist groups such as animal rights extremists, ecoterrorists, anarchists, anti-government extremists, black separatists, white supremacists, and abortion extremists. The DOJ and FBI focus on investigating threats related to domestic terrorism, ensuring investigations are for national security or criminal purposes, not to monitor First Amendment rights. However, the criteria for identifying domestic terrorism threats and the process of labeling dissent as such remain unclear. Questions arise about how ideologies are categorized as threats and the role of criminal severity in this determination. The discussion of domestic terrorism threats includes animal rights extremism and eco terrorism, with examples from the past fifteen years. The terms refer to criminal acts committed in the name of animal rights and the environment, respectively. The report does not prioritize one type of threat over the other. \"Ecoterrorism and animal rights extremism involve criminal acts in the name of the environment and animal welfare. Perpetrators operate in small cells or as individuals, engaging in vandalism, theft, property destruction, and arson. While they avoid direct physical violence, their actions have caused significant property damage and intimidation of victims.\" The Animal Liberation Front (ALF) and the Earth Liberation Front (ELF) are radical movements with similar beliefs and overlapping membership. They do not have formal groups, rosters, or leadership structures, but communicate a shared identity through above-ground wings like websites. Supporters publish literature on movement philosophies, tactics, and recent criminal activity, allowing underground extremists to claim responsibility for crimes. The ALF and the ELF are radical movements with overlapping membership, allowing extremists to claim responsibility for criminal activity in the name of animal rights while maintaining secrecy. They share similar agendas and have declared solidarity, leading to confusion in the real world. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, the FBI uncovered a network that committed violent acts in the name of both movements. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, the FBI uncovered a network called \"the Family\" that committed violent acts in the name of both the ALF and the ELF. The group disbanded in 2001 due to law enforcement pressure after causing $48 million in damages, including an arson attack at Vail Ski Resort in 1998. The ALF and ELF share philosophical beliefs to justify their actions, aligning with mainstream animal rights and environmental activists. The ALF believes in animal rights and opposes speciesism, arguing that animals have basic rights and should not be owned. They view the U.S. legal system as corrupt and advocate for a moral law that transcends biased statutes. Speciesism, favoring one species over others, is seen as ethically flawed by the ALF and other animal rights supporters. The ALF and ELF are extremist groups that believe in animal liberation through illegal actions such as theft, destruction of property, and intimidation. They view speciesism as ethically flawed and advocate for environmental philosophies like biocentrism, deep ecology, social ecology, and green anarchism. The movement includes biocentrism, deep ecology, social ecology, and green anarchism. Biocentrism advocates for equality of all organisms, deep ecology sees all species as part of nature, social ecology criticizes hierarchical society, and green anarchism blames civilization for environmental harm and promotes rewilding. Anarchist extremists commit crimes in the name of ideals like individual autonomy and collective equality. Anarchism opposes hierarchical structures in society, believing authority leads to misuse of power. Anarchists advocate for revolutionary change but lack consensus on methods. Decentralized activity is common, with affinity groups playing a key role in shaping their work. Affinity groups are autonomous militant units consisting of 5-20 individuals who share causes and preferred actions. Decision-making is egalitarian and consensual. Groups form around specific objectives and disband upon completion. They can join clusters for coordinated legal or illegal, violent or nonviolent activities. Anarchists also use \"black bloc\" tactics for secretive planning of public, often criminal, actions. Anarchist extremists engage in secretive planning for criminal activities, often dressed in black and acting en-masse. They target symbols of Western civilization like financial corporations and government institutions, engaging in property damage, riots, fires, and small-scale bombings. Law enforcement is concerned about their potential use of improvised explosive devices. Anarchist extremists in the United States have a history of illegal activity during mass protests, such as the 1999 World Trade Organization Ministerial Conference in Seattle and the 2008 Republican National Convention in St. Paul. The \"RNC Welcoming Committee\" was formed to coordinate protests during the convention, but law enforcement infiltrated and arrested 800 people, including eight members. Five men with anarchist sympathies were arrested for plotting to blow up a bridge near Cleveland, OH in 2012. One was convicted, while the others pled guilty. The plot was timed to coincide with peaceful protests organized by Occupy Cleveland, but the group was not affiliated with the movement. An FBI sting operation led to their arrest. The group relied on an undercover FBI employee to provide them with inert bombs they believed were functional. Anarchist extremists have been involved in criminal acts not necessarily tied to specific events, such as arson attempts and setting fires at development sites in various cities. In another case, Joseph Konopka, known as \"Dr. Chaos,\" led a group in crimes involving vandalism to towers and storing cyanide powder in a subway tunnel. He pled guilty to possessing chemical weapons and other felonies. White supremacist extremism involves criminal acts in the name of white supremacist ideology. White supremacist ideology promotes the belief in white racial superiority and has been linked to numerous criminal acts. FBI and DHS reports show that white supremacists were responsible for the most homicides among domestic extremist movements from 2000 to 2016. These extremists target various groups, including Jews and African Americans, and can be part of organized hate groups or hold extremist beliefs individually. White supremacist ideology targets Jews and African Americans, with a belief in racial separation and discrimination against whites. The \"Fourteen Words\" slogan emphasizes securing the existence of the white race. Neo-Nazism, with a focus on Adolf Hitler and Nazi Germany, is a prominent aspect of white supremacist extremism in the United States. White supremacist extremism in the United States, led by figures like George Lincoln Rockwell, redefined the racial notion of \"white\" to include Southern and Eastern Europeans, denied the Holocaust, and tied neo-Nazism to religion. Key concepts shaping white supremacy include belief in violent conflict and conspiracies hostile to white supremacy. This ideology shares similarities with the militia movement. The FBI has stated that white supremacists commonly anticipate waging war against their opponents, with concepts like RAHOWA (racial holy war) central to groups like the neo-Nazi Creativity Movement. Some white supremacists interpret apocalyptic Norse mythology through racism, while conspiracism suggests major events are shaped by secret conspiracies benefiting elite groups. White supremacist extremists often believe in conspiracy theories, with anti-Semitism playing a significant role. They may subscribe to the idea of a Zionist Occupied Government (ZOG), where the federal government is controlled by international Jewish interests. This belief is used to explain personal or social grievances, and some groups even sell video games promoting violence against nonwhites and police agencies controlled by Jews. White supremacist extremists believe in conspiracy theories, including the idea of a Zionist Occupied Government (ZOG) controlled by Jews, Illuminati, Freemasons, and multinational corporations. ZOG is used to explain personal or social grievances, such as affirmative action and media control. In the 1980s and 1990s, white supremacist circles were dominated by a few figures, but by the early 2000s, these groups fragmented as they lost their leaders. In the early 2000s, white supremacist groups like the National Alliance and Aryan Nations suffered from the deaths of key leaders William Pierce and Richard Butler. These leaders had clear ideologies and resources that sustained their organizations, with the National Alliance even generating $1 million annually. The decline of these groups was also due to infighting, law enforcement pressure, and the emergence of new white supremacist movements. The National Socialist Movement (NSM) is a prominent white supremacist organization in the United States, benefiting from the decline of other groups and new leadership under Jeff Schoep. Emerging in 1974 as a descendant of the American Nazi Party, the NSM had around 500 members and associates in 2008. The group is flexible about membership, allowing members to participate in other white supremacist organizations. In Minnesota in April 2012, individuals tied to the NSM, Joseph Benjamin Thomas and Samuel James Johnson, were indicted on drug and weapons-related charges. Johnson, a former leader of the NSM in Minnesota, pled guilty to firearms possession, while Thomas pled guilty to drug possession. William White, a former NSM member and founder of a white supremacist group, has also faced criminal charges. In 2014, William White was found guilty on charges related to threats made against a Florida judge, state attorney, and FBI agent, including kidnapping, torture, rape, and murder. He targeted individuals involved in prosecuting suspects tied to the white supremacist organization American Front. White hoped his threats would secure the release of American Front suspects. In January 2011, he was convicted of soliciting violence online against a jury foreman in a separate case. In an unrelated case, William White was convicted of communicating threats and witness intimidation. He was involved with the NSM but had a falling out with Schoep. Racist skinheads have a history in the US since the 1980s, originating from the UK in the late 1960s. The movement in the US has seen a rise in regional groups rather than a united core since the early 2000s. Racist skinheads have a history of violence and are known for their white power music and literature. They cultivate a tough image through their appearance and clothing. Originating as a non-racist movement among British youth in the late 1960s, some skinheads in the UK turned to racism as immigration increased. This racist variant emerged in the US Midwest and Texas in the early 1980s. By the mid-1990s, US-based racist skinhead groups began forming alliances. In the mid-1990s, U.S.-based racist skinhead groups formed the Hammerskin Nation (HSN), with chapters in the US and Europe. HSN organized Hammerfest, had a record label and publishing company. Other groups like Outlaw Hammerskins challenged HSN's dominance. FBI highlighted violent tendencies within the racist skinhead subculture, with skinheads involved in numerous violent incidents tied to white supremacist extremism. Members of the racist skinhead subculture, including those from Battalion 14, engaged in criminal activities targeting nonwhites and minorities. One case involved the illegal sale of firearms and homemade grenades, with one man convicted and two others pleading guilty. The trio had multiple meetings to negotiate transactions and prepare weapons, selling them to an FBI informant posing as a member of the Ku Klux Klan. Two individuals tied to Battalion 14 were acquitted of charges. The militia movement, formed in the 1990s, consists of armed groups fearing government intrusion and firearm confiscation. While some members hold racist beliefs, most engage in constitutionally protected activities. Militia groups typically rally around a leader and may run training compounds for rehearsals. Some militia groups run training compounds for paramilitary tactics, survival skills, and weapons instruction. Extremists stockpile illegal weapons and believe in conspiracy theories about the U.S. government and the \"New World Order.\" Some militia supporters believe in a \"Shadow Government\" seizing firearms to undermine democracy, while others feel the federal government has exceeded its constitutional limits. Militias formed in response to incidents at Ruby Ridge, ID, and Waco, TX in the early 1990s involving confrontations over firearms violations. In August 1992, Randy Weaver and his family were involved in an 11-day standoff with federal agents due to firearms violations. The standoff resulted in the death of Weaver's son and a U.S. Marshal, as well as the shooting of Weaver and his wife. Weaver was found guilty of failing to appear in court on gun charges and sentenced to jail. He later received a $3.1 million settlement in a wrongful death suit against the U.S. government. The events at Ruby Ridge contributed to the emergence of the militia movement. The militia movement emerged due to standoffs with federal law enforcement, including the incidents at Ruby Ridge and Waco. The Branch Davidians standoff near Waco resulted in a gunfight and assault on the compound, leading to the deaths of several members. Timothy McVeigh's bombing in Oklahoma City in 1995 further fueled the militia movement. The bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City on April 19, 1995, led to a temporary decline in the militia movement. The bombing claimed 168 lives and was the largest act of terrorism on U.S. soil until 9/11. Some militia groups tempered their rhetoric while others became more extreme, causing militias to be more marginalized. The militia movement has seen a resurgence in the last decade, driven by growing antipathy toward the federal government. Jerry Drake Varnell was arrested in 2017 for attempting to detonate a bomb in downtown Oklahoma City. Jerry Drake Varnell was arrested in 2017 in Oklahoma City for attempting to detonate a bomb in a van, which was actually an inert device provided by an undercover FBI agent. Varnell was inspired by Timothy McVeigh's 1995 bombing and held militia extremist beliefs. In recent years, incidents involving militia and anti-government extremists have included the Bundy standoff in Bunkerville, NV in 2014 and the occupation by Ammon and Ryan Bundy in late 2015 and early 2016. During the armed occupation of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in Oregon led by Ammon and Ryan Bundy, a violent incident occurred where Oregon State Police officers fatally shot LaVoy Finicum. Finicum drove a pickup truck at high speed towards a police roadblock, refused to comply with commands, and reached for a gun before being shot to death. Cliven Bundy was later arrested on charges related to the 2014 Bunkerville standoff. Cliven Bundy was arrested for his involvement in the 2014 Bunkerville standoff. Militia adherents have engaged in criminal activities post-9/11, such as a group conspiring to detonate explosives targeting Somali immigrants in Kansas. Another fringe militia group planned violent attacks on government officials, leading to the arrest of four retirees by the FBI. In northern Georgia, a militia group with ties to an unnamed organization planned violent attacks on government officials. The quartet discussed criminal activities like murder, theft, and manufacturing toxic agents to undermine federal and state governments. Roberts and Thomas met with an FBI agent to buy weapons and explosives for their plot. They also discussed making ricin, a deadly poison. Roberts and Thomas pled guilty to conspiring to obtain explosives and silencers, while Crump and Adams were found guilty of conspiring to make ricin as a weapon. In January 2014, individuals were found guilty of possessing ricin as a biological weapon. In June 2012, members of an Alaska militia group were convicted of conspiracy and firearms charges for plotting a retaliatory response against law enforcement. They planned to kill two government officials for every militia member killed in the operation. In March 2012, members of the Hutaree militia group were acquitted of serious charges related to a violent plot against law enforcement. The group had allegedly planned to confront law enforcement violently, including murdering a local officer and attacking fellow officers. The judge cleared them of seditious conspiracy, rebellion, and weapons crimes. The Hutaree discussed using explosives against a funeral procession and had a hit list that included federal judges. Despite not having a specific plan to attack government targets, three members pled guilty to firearms charges. The FBI defines the sovereign citizen movement as \"anti-government.\" The sovereign citizen movement is described as \"anti-government\" and believes in being separate from the United States authorities. Originating in the 1970s with the Posse Comitatus group, it gained popularity in the 1980s and 1990s. While initially associated with white supremacists, some African Americans have also adopted its beliefs. In the 1990s, the movement attracted 250,000 followers and had a notable standoff with the FBI involving the Montana Freemen group. The sovereign citizen movement, originating in the 1970s, believes in being separate from US authorities. It includes leaders known as \"gurus\" who spread conspiracy theories about a government designed to take away citizens' rights. These leaders operate individually or in loosely affiliated groups, promoting illegal techniques. Sovereign citizens reject the legitimacy of much of the U.S. legal system, believing that the 14th Amendment shifted the nation to a federal corporation that enslaved everyone. They avoid taxes, laws, and government documents to cut ties with what they see as an illegitimate government. Sovereign citizens have attempted to sever ties with the perceived illegitimate U.S. government by filing court documents claiming they are not U.S. citizens. They have also engaged in creating fake financial documents to deceive others. Additionally, some have formed fictitious entities and used counterfeit currency, passports, license plates, and driver licenses. In some cases, individuals have been found guilty of selling fraudulent diplomatic credentials and license plates to avoid taxes and law enforcement. The Pembina Nation Little Shell Band of North America is a sham Native American tribe used by some as a way to avoid taxes and government fees. Sovereign citizen fraud can involve economic opportunism, such as pyramid schemes and tax frauds. In some cases, individuals have used fraudulent diplomatic credentials and license plates to evade taxes and law enforcement. In November 2011, Monty and Patricia Ervin were convicted of tax evasion and fraud, earning over $9 million from investment properties. They denied their U.S. citizenship and used sovereign schemes to avoid taxes. Sovereign citizens in North Georgia were indicted for stealing real estate. Some sovereign citizens have been involved in violent altercations with law enforcement, like Gavin Long who shot and killed three police officers in Baton Rouge in June 2016. In 2016, Gavin Long killed three police officers in Baton Rouge, LA, before being killed by police. He held sovereign citizen views. In May 2010, Joe Kane and his father killed two officers in West Memphis, TN, during a traffic stop. The FBI had investigated Jerry Kane for a \"debt elimination scheme.\" In June 2012, the FBI warned that sovereign extremists might be preparing for conflict with police. In August 2013, authorities in Las Vegas arrested two Sovereigns, David Allen Brutsche and Devon Campbell Newman, for planning to kidnap and kill police officers. Brutsche, who held Sovereign Citizen beliefs, was caught during undercover vehicle stops where he expressed his views. Brutsche pled guilty to felony kidnapping conspiracy in February 2014. In February 2014, prosecutors dropped serious charges against a defendant. In July 2011, James M. Tesi shot at a police officer during an arrest near Fort Worth, TX. Tesi was wounded and linked himself to a sovereign citizen group. In February 2012, Tesi was found guilty of aggravated assault. In June 2011, William Foust was shot and killed by a police officer during a struggle over a Taser. The DOJ includes black separatism in its list of movements potentially spawning domestic terrorists. The New Black Panther Party for Self Defense (NBPP) has been described as a racist and anti-Semitic organization that encourages violence against whites, Jews, and law enforcement officers. The NBPP emerged in the early 1990s and is not connected to the Black Panthers from the 1960s. The New Black Panther Party (NBPP) has been described as a racist and anti-Semitic organization that encourages violence against whites, Jews, and law enforcement officers. The group engages in high-profile rhetoric at rallies to incite confrontation with authorities and displays firearms in actions on behalf of the disadvantaged. An example of their rhetoric includes characterizing police actions as acts of terrorism. The New Black Panther Party (NBPP) has been involved in controversial incidents, including the 2015 shooting in Dallas by Micah Johnson. In 2008, NBPP members in Philadelphia were accused of voter intimidation at a polling station. DOJ filed a civil suit against them for wearing paramilitary uniforms and carrying weapons. In response to claims of voter intimidation, the NBPP member with a nightstick was removed while the certified poll watcher was allowed to remain. Police questioned individuals at the polling station about feeling threatened, with most denying any intimidation. One person found the presence of the NBPP members intimidating. The NBPP disavowed their actions. The DOJ dismissed claims against defendants in May 2009, leading to a congressional inquiry in July 2009. The DOJ's Office of Professional Responsibility found no inappropriate actions by officials. Abortion extremism involves criminal activities, but most activists engage in constitutionally protected activities. Abortion extremism involves crimes targeting providers and clinics, with instances of violence including shootings, bombings, arson, and acid attacks. Since 1993, eight clinic workers have been murdered by anti-abortion extremists in the United States. The Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act (FACE Act) was passed in 1994 in response to violence against abortion providers in the 1980s and early 1990s. In 2015, Robert Dear, Jr., allegedly killed three people and wounded nine others at a Planned Parenthood facility in Colorado Springs, CO. The 2009 murder of abortion provider George Tiller by Scott Roeder also received significant public attention. Roeder was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison. Other unrelated schemes targeting abortion clinics have been uncovered since Roeder's arrest. In January 2012, Bobby Joe Rogers was charged for firebombing a Pensacola abortion clinic, destroying it. He was indicted for arson and damaging a reproductive health facility, pleading guilty in July 2012. Ralph Lang was arrested in May 2011 for planning to kill abortion providers in Madison, WI. The Army of God (AOG) supports attacks on abortion clinics, promoting anti-abortion violence while denying being terrorists. They view attacks as \"Godly work.\" The Army of God (AOG) supports violent attacks on abortion clinics, promoting anti-abortion violence as \"Godly work.\" They disseminate a manual detailing methods for illegal activities like blockading entrances, arson, and bomb making. Eric Rudolph, who bombed abortion clinics, published his writings on the AOG website. The boundary between legitimate protest and terrorism in the context of domestic terrorism has been a topic of public discussion. The FBI has identified animal rights extremists and ecoterrorists as a serious domestic terrorism threat due to the large number of incidents and significant damages caused by their actions. Various industries, including pharmaceutical companies and research laboratories, have been targeted by these groups for their destructive tactics. The FBI has identified animal rights extremists and ecoterrorists as a serious domestic terrorism threat due to the significant damages caused by their actions. These groups have targeted industries like pharmaceutical companies and research laboratories with destructive tactics, impacting the work of scientists and pushing some to quit lab work involving animals. The Animal Enterprise Terrorism Act (P.L. 109-374; AETA) was enacted to combat animal rights extremists engaging in criminal activities, as critics argue that the government's pursuit of these individuals may be exaggerated and could suppress protected speech by protesters. The Animal Enterprise Terrorism Act (AETA) was signed into law in November 2006 to combat criminal activities by animal rights extremists. It amended the Animal Enterprise Protection Act (AEPA) to include intentional damage or loss to property, threats of harm to individuals involved with animal enterprises, and increased penalties. The AETA also prohibits placing individuals in fear of harm while interfering with animal enterprise operations, but does not restrict First Amendment-protected activities. The Animal Enterprise Terrorism Act (AETA) was signed into law in 2006 to combat criminal activities by animal rights extremists. In 2006, the DOJ successfully prosecuted individuals under the AEPA for the first time, convicting six individuals involved in a campaign against Huntingdon Life Sciences. They were convicted of inciting threats, harassment, and vandalism, violating the AEPA. The DOJ successfully prosecuted individuals under the AETA for inciting threats, harassment, and violence against Huntingdon Life Sciences and its employees. Examples include Scott DeMuth sentenced to six months for releasing ferrets at a farm, and William James Viehl and Alex Hall sentenced for releasing minks and vandalizing a ranch. In 2008, the DOJ faced setbacks in applying the AETA when four animal rights extremists were arrested for using force to interfere with the University of California's operations. The indictment was later dismissed in 2010 due to lack of specific descriptions of the alleged crimes. Opponents criticize the over-broad application of the AETA to First Amendment-protected behaviors, suggesting it makes it easier to prosecute individuals protesting secondary or tertiary targets. They also question the inclusion of \"reasonable fear\" in the AETA, which could potentially interpret protected speech as provoking fear. Despite significant property damage caused by U.S.-based animal rights extremists, critics argue that the AETA fails to specifically describe the crimes allegedly committed by the defendants. U.S.-based animal rights extremists have caused property damage but not harmed people. Critics argue that labeling their actions as terrorism dampens constitutionally protected protest activity. Lauren Gazzola, after serving prison time for involvement with SHAC USA, claimed she was not a terrorist as she had not committed any independent crime. The U.S. Code's definition of \"domestic terrorism\" has raised concerns about its impact on legitimate animal rights and environmental protest activities, particularly targeting a notorious animal testing lab in New Jersey. Critics argue that labeling actions by animal rights extremists as terrorism could suppress constitutionally protected protest activity. The Animal Liberation Front (ALF) ideology aims to instill fear in those engaging in activities opposed by the group, emphasizing fear of harm and economic loss. Animal rights terrorism, while not as violent as other extremist groups, still instills fear in academia, research, agriculture, and food service industries. Domestic terrorist attacks, like Timothy McVeigh's bombing in Oklahoma City, can cause significant devastation, ranking as the second-deadliest on U.S. soil after 9/11. Law enforcement officers are concerned about various domestic terrorist groups, including violent Islamists like Al Qaeda, Hezbollah, and Hamas, as well as black separatists, white supremacists/sovereign citizen extremists, and animal rights terrorists. Sovereign citizens were identified as the top concern in a 2014 national survey. State police agencies have reported the presence of dangerous domestic extremist groups in their jurisdictions. However, most followers of extremist viewpoints are not considered a threat. Domestic terrorists, like their violent jihadist counterparts, are often Internet savvy and use the medium for their operations. The decentralized nature of domestic terrorism involves lone wolves and leaderless resistance movements. The U.S. government does not publicly list domestic terrorist incidents, making it challenging to understand the diverse threat. The New America Foundation has reported on domestic terrorist incidents as of August 2017. The New America Foundation found that domestic terrorists have killed 75 people in the United States since 9/11, while jihadist terrorists have killed 95. The FBI estimated that animal rights extremists and ecoterrorists committed between 1,800 and 2,000 criminal incidents causing over $110 million in damages from 1979 to early 2009. The FBI also noted a decline in ecoterrorism after successful prosecutions in 2007. The FBI reported a decrease in domestic terrorist activity after successful prosecutions in 2007. The decline was attributed to activists perceiving a Democratic administration as more sympathetic to their goals. Between 2007 and 2009, 53 acts of violence were committed by white supremacist extremists, targeting other white supremacists, African Americans, and Latinos. Most incidents involved assaults. Sovereign citizen convictions increased from 10 in 2009 to 18 in both 2010 and 2011. Many domestic terrorist incidents have been linked to animal rights extremists or ecoterrorists. Many animal rights extremists and ecoterrorists engage in property crimes like arson or vandalism, avoiding direct violence towards people. They believe in \"direct action,\" involving non-violent but criminal protest activities to further their ideology. This group differs from violent jihadists who aim to harm people. The ALF and ELF play a significant role in furthering the ideology of direct action through criminal activities like sabotage and arson. Anarchist extremists, animal liberation extremists, and environmental extremists engage in \"paper terrorism\" by filing fraudulent documents to harass enemies or evade taxes. Criminality and direct action are seen as synonymous by ALF and ELF members. The Animal Liberation Front (ALF) and Earth Liberation Front (ELF) view direct action as nonviolent and heroic, drawing inspiration from historical movements like the Underground Railroad and the Boston Tea Party. They see themselves as reformers engaging in \"economic sabotage\" and \"ethical vandalism.\" The ALF and ELF support direct action through economic sabotage, property destruction, and intimidation of individuals and businesses involved in animal exploitation. They engage in trespassing, theft, and cyber hacking in the name of animal rights. The ELF also focuses on economic sabotage and rejects legal protest tactics. The ELF rejects legal protest tactics and promotes economic sabotage in the name of environmentalism, known as \"monkeywrenching.\" This tactic, depicted in a novel, calls for individuals to act heroically to defend the wild by disrupting the destruction of natural diversity. The guidebook on monkeywrenching emphasizes nonviolence and avoiding harm to people or other forms of life, causing concern among federal officials. Federal officials are concerned about the use of incendiary devices and explosives by animal rights extremists and ecoterrorists. In 2005, then-ATF Deputy Assistant Director Carson Carroll highlighted their willingness to use such devices. Two incidents near San Francisco involved explosive devices, claimed by the Revolutionary Cells of the Animal Liberation Brigade and linked to Daniel San Diego. In 2003, bombs at Chiron and Shaklee caused minimal damage and no injuries. In October 2003, a 10-pound ammonium nitrate bomb damaged Shaklee's offices, believed to be targeted by animal rights extremists. The use of incendiary devices by ecoterrorists and their willingness to instill fear ensure they are labeled as terrorists. The handbook \"Arson Around with Auntie ALF\" is circulated in extremist circles as a guide for making incendiary devices. In January 2012, NAALPO activists set fires at Harris Ranch using accelerant and digital timers in reaction to factory farming injustices. ELF actions since 2000 have targeted urban sprawl with arson on housing developments and destruction of industrial symbols. Between August and October 2002, individuals tied to the ELF damaged construction vehicles and vandalized fast food restaurants in Virginia, spray painting \"sprawl\" on homes under construction. In November 2005, the ELF claimed responsibility for fires set in townhomes under construction in Hagerstown, MD. Both the ALF and the ELF have guidelines on their websites for followers, emphasizing the avoidance of harm to animals and humans. The ALF also requires members to be vegetarians or vegans. The ALF supports intimidation as a tactic but does not consider it violence. Arson is seen as violence against property, not people. Some animal rights extremists, like Meredith Lowell, have supported violence, such as soliciting a hit man to kill someone wearing fur. The \"Justice Department\" advocates for violence against humans. The \"Justice Department,\" an offshoot of the ALF, has been linked to violent incidents targeting humans. In 1999, they sent razor blades covered in rat poison to animal researchers and hunting guides in the US and Canada. In 2010, they claimed to have sent AIDS-tainted razors to scientists at UCLA, threatening further attacks on the vivisection industry. Sovereign citizens engage in nonviolent crimes such as \"paper terrorism,\" including forging documents, tax evasion, and filing fraudulent property liens. They also hold illegal courts, issue fake criminal indictments, and target officials with warrants. These acts are designed to intimidate or defraud individuals, institutions, or government entities. Some sovereigns engage in \"paper terrorism\" by issuing fraudulent liens to intimidate officials enforcing laws. In 2011, Kenneth W. Leaming from Spanaway, WA, was arrested for issuing billions of dollars in frivolous liens. Kenneth W. Leaming, tied to sovereign citizen groups, planned to harass Chief Justice John Roberts' children. In 2013, he was convicted of filing false liens and harboring federal fugitives. Sovereign citizen ideology blurs with scams like \"redemption,\" claiming each U.S. child has a Treasury account as collateral against national debts. Redemption supporters believe they can draw money from secret Treasury accounts by filing false IRS forms. This tactic involves submitting fake tax returns and forms to request fraudulent tax refunds. Some scammers deceive individuals into filing these forms to access the supposed accounts, leading to money laundering charges and lengthy prison sentences for those involved. In December 2009, Audie Watson was sentenced to 14 years in prison for his role in an immigration benefit fraud scheme. He sold membership in the Pembina Nation Little Shell Band to illegal aliens, charging $1,500 for individuals and $2,000 for couples. Watson falsely claimed membership could prevent deportation. In March 2011, Gerald A Poynter was permanently barred from preparing tax returns for promoting a redemption scam. Poynter promised tax refunds to customers, producing fraudulent IRS forms claiming $64 million in refunds for 165 clients. Domestic terrorists utilize the Internet and social media for communication, recruitment, and propaganda. White supremacists have been early adopters of online technology, using extremist websites as recruiting tools. Some sites offer membership forms, multimedia content, and even retail items. The Internet allows white supremacists to connect, disseminate ideology, and manage perceptions. Virtual spaces serve as important platforms for indoctrination, articulating views, and discussing violence against 'racial enemies'. American white nationalist movements on Twitter have grown significantly since 2012, surpassing ISIS in follower counts and tweets per day. Online ideological activity includes constitutionally protected speech, with websites connecting like-minded individuals and key texts available online. Key ideological texts are available online, including those of animal rights extremists and ecoterrorists. Reverend Donald Spitz administers the Army of God's website, which lists people who support violent opposition to abortion and those incarcerated for anti-abortion crimes. The National Socialist Movement sponsors the \"New Saxon Social Network.\" Domestic terrorists engage in cyber attacks, with an animal rights extremist cell (SHAC USA, Inc.) listing personal information of targeted workers online between 2001 and 2004. The extremist cell published personal information of employees, including names of spouses and children, license plate numbers, churches, and schools. They also posted suggestions for terror tactics and supporters engaged in vandalism, cyberattacks, and other activities. Domestic terrorism suspects operate independently or in small cells without cohesive leadership structures. The interplay between above-ground extremist groups and independent underground cells is a critical feature of domestic terrorism. Decentralized activity, popularized by white supremacist Louis Beam in the 1980s, allows for leaderless resistance to avoid law enforcement. Louis Beam popularized leaderless resistance in the 1980s to transform the white supremacy movement, allowing for decentralized activity to avoid law enforcement infiltration. This approach involves underground cells or lone wolves engaging in illegal activities independently, while the above-ground public face propagandizes and disseminates ideology without accountability for the actions of the underground. The National Socialist Movement (NSM) is an above-ground movement that condemns violence and terrorism. They advocate for White Civil Rights through political activism and legal means. The Turner Diaries, a novel by William Pierce, is a key text for neo-Nazis and anti-government extremists, motivating underground individuals to commit illegal acts. The Turner Diaries, a novel by William Pierce, has inspired violent acts by white supremacist and anti-government extremists. It emphasizes the destruction of the current racial order and promotes white supremacist ideals. Pierce's book is widely read among far-right extremists and reflects his racist religious philosophies. The Turner Diaries, written by William Pierce, has influenced domestic terrorists. The novel follows Earl Turner leading a terrorist group that triggers a race war and nuclear apocalypse, resulting in the rebirth of a white race. White supremacist Robert Mathews formed The Order, inspired by the book, engaging in violent crimes for a revolution. The Turner Diaries influenced domestic terrorists, including The Order led by Robert Mathews. Timothy McVeigh, inspired by the book, carried passages with him during his arrest. The 1995 Oklahoma City bombing mirrored events in the novel, leading to increased book sales. Extremist movements like ALF and ELF adopt leaderless resistance, making it harder for law enforcement to investigate their activities. The ALF and ELF movements use above-ground elements to communicate their ideologies and provide guidelines for underground individuals to carry out criminal actions. They distance themselves from illegal activities by stating that they only receive and post communiqu\u00e9s from anonymous parties. This leaderless resistance model makes it difficult for law enforcement to investigate their actions. The ALF and ELF movements operate in a leaderless format to avoid law enforcement infiltration, following a model similar to franchising in the business world. Lone wolf terrorism involves individuals carrying out attacks independently without belonging to an organized group, directing their actions without outside command. According to the FBI, lone wolves are prominent in white supremacist extremism, filtering in and out of groups due to violent tendencies or passive ideologies. There is little research on lone wolves, who may adopt broader ideological causes to justify their actions without formal membership in terrorist movements. Debate exists on whether individuals are lone wolves or part of larger movements. Some individuals, like Scott Roeder and James von Brunn, have been involved in violent acts without clear ties to known groups. Roeder was convicted of killing an abortion provider, with debate over whether he had connections to anti-abortion groups or acted alone. Von Brunn, a neo-Nazi, shot a security guard at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum. Lone wolves like them are not affiliated with terrorist organizations, leading to discussions on their involvement in broader movements. Lone wolves, individuals not connected to terrorist organizations, pose challenges for law enforcement in determining their motives for violent acts. The FBI struggles to predict when radicalized individuals will act on their beliefs, making it difficult to prevent lone wolf attacks. The FBI faces challenges in assessing the operational capabilities of lone wolf terrorists, as they do not have connections to terrorist networks or training camps. To address this, the FBI initiated a study in 2009 to identify indicators and behavior predictors for lone offenders. Despite their weaknesses in tradecraft, lone wolves may find it harder to carry out large-scale attacks. Lone wolves may find it harder to engage in large-scale attacks without a terrorist network. Despite this, lone wolf attacks can still be lethal, as seen in the case of James Harris Jackson stabbing Timothy Caughman in 2017. Jackson, a white supremacist, faces murder and terrorism charges for his actions. Other evidence suggests the lethality of lone wolf violence, with examples such as Richard Poplawski shooting and killing three Pittsburgh police officers in 2009, and Keith Luke killing two Cape Verdean immigrants in 2009. Poplawski was described as a \"white supremacist\" lone wolf, while Luke planned to attack a synagogue after reading about \"the demise of the white race\" on a neo-Nazi website. Kevin Harpham planned a bomb attack during a Martin Luther King, Jr. Day March in Spokane, WA, in 2011. He was arrested and charged with a federal hate crime and attempting to use a weapon of mass destruction. Harpham had ties to white supremacists, including the neo-Nazi National Alliance. Harpham had contact with white supremacist leader Paul Mullet but never joined his group. He made postings on white supremacist websites and read The Turner Diaries. Lone wolf activity is not exclusive to white supremacists. Another case involved Walter Bond, an animal rights extremist who committed arson in 2010, condemning a store for selling sheepskin products. Bond worked alone, claiming the arson was in defense of animals. Walter Bond, an animal rights extremist, identified as a lone wolf and used the nickname \"Lone Wolf.\" He committed arson in retaliation for animal cruelty. Federal agencies use varying terminology to describe domestic terrorism threats, lacking a clear method to designate specific groups as terrorists. The federal government broadly conceptualizes domestic terrorism threats, using terms like \"extremist\" interchangeably with \"terrorism.\" This approach allows flexibility in discussing terrorist-like activity without labeling it as terrorism, potentially leading to inconsistencies in law application. The federal government lacks a process for publicly designating domestic terrorist organizations, unlike the well-established regimen for foreign terrorist organizations. This may be due to First Amendment concerns about discouraging speech related to extremist ideologies. FTO designation aids in counterterrorism efforts by enabling prosecution for material support, unlike domestic terrorism cases. It also helps in curbing terrorism financing, isolating terrorist groups, deterring donations, and raising public awareness. The absence of a designation regimen for domestic terrorist groups hinders the federal government's ability to discredit such groups and communicate the threat effectively. DOJ and the FBI have named domestic terrorism threats without a formal process, raising concerns about transparency and communication with other agencies. Federal lawmakers may need to consider formalizing this process. Federal lawmakers may need to consider formalizing the process of designating domestic terrorism threats to enhance federal efforts and protect civil rights. This could involve allowing input from state and local agencies and creating a mechanism for individuals to petition for threat removal. However, making the process more open may limit the FBI's flexibility to adapt quickly to evolving threats. A publicly available list of domestic terrorist plots and incidents could help policymakers understand the threat better. The federal government lacks a publicly available official record of domestic terrorist plots and incidents, making it challenging to assess the extent of this threat. The National Counterterrorism Center's Worldwide Incidents Tracking System (WITS) previously provided data on terrorism incidents globally, including in the United States. Prior to WITS, the FBI used to release reports on terrorist activity in the country. The absence of a comprehensive federal account hinders the understanding of domestic terrorism, which can be addressed at different levels of law enforcement. The lack of a publicly available official record of domestic terrorist plots and incidents hinders the understanding of the threat. It is important for policymakers to have a clearer sense of the scope of domestic terrorism, which can be addressed by releasing annual statistics on prosecutions and detailed reports on dismantled plots and investigations. This information can assist federal, state, and local agencies in combating domestic terrorism effectively. A regular public accounting of domestic terrorist activity is crucial for policymakers to assess the effectiveness of the government's response and allocate resources appropriately. It would help in comparing different domestic terrorist threats and measuring federal funding allocated to this issue."
