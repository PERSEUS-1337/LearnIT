    "content": "This report provides information on two federal entitlement programs administered by the Social Security Administration (SSA): Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) and Supplemental Security Income (SSI). SSDI offers monthly cash benefits to nonelderly disabled workers and their dependents who paid Social Security taxes, while SSI provides assistance to aged, blind, or disabled individuals with limited work experience and income. SSDI is part of the Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance (OASDI) program under the Social Security Act. The Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) program provides monthly benefits to insured workers under the full retirement age who meet the statutory test of disability and to their eligible dependents. SSDI is funded through a payroll tax on current workers covered by Social Security. In August 2016, 10.7 million individuals received SSDI benefits, including disabled workers, spouses, and children. Supplemental Security Income (SSI) is a need-based program that guarantees a minimum income for aged, blind, or disabled individuals with limited work experience and income. The Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program, established in 1974, provides cash payments to aged, blind, or disabled individuals with limited income and assets. It is funded through general revenues, not payroll taxes, and is considered a program of \"last resort.\" Unlike SSDI, SSI benefits are a flat amount based on need, not prior earnings. Many states also provide supplements to certain SSI recipients. In August 2016, 8.3 million individuals, including 1.2 million children, received federally administered SSI payments. The Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) program provides benefits based on a worker's career-average earnings, adjusted annually for inflation. Benefits are also provided to eligible spouses and children of disabled workers. In August 2016, the average monthly SSDI payment was $1,166 for disabled workers. Certain disabled dependents qualify for health coverage under Medicare after 24 months of cash benefits. The federal SSI benefit is $733 per month for individuals and $1,100 for couples. Benefits are adjusted annually for inflation. Some states supplement the federal payment. SSI recipients are automatically eligible for SNAP. The Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program provides monthly payments to individuals who are disabled and have limited income and resources. The average monthly SSI payment in August 2016 was $540 for all recipients. Disability under SSI is defined as the inability to engage in substantial gainful activity due to a medically determinable impairment. The SSI payment may be adjusted based on other income received, such as Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) benefits. The Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program provides monthly payments to disabled individuals. The average monthly payment in 2016 is $1,130 for non-blind individuals and $1,820 for statutorily blind individuals. To qualify for SSI, individuals must be unable to do substantial work, taking into account their age, education, and work experience. Children under 18 must demonstrate marked and severe functional limitations to qualify. To qualify for Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI), workers must be under the full retirement age, insured in the event of disability, and statutorily disabled. Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) provides disability insurance coverage to individuals who are statutorily disabled. To qualify, individuals must have worked in covered employment for a quarter of their adult lives before becoming disabled and for five years of the 10 years before the onset of disability. SSDI benefits start after a five-month waiting period from the onset of disability, with Medicare coverage beginning 24 months after SSDI eligibility. Benefits continue as long as the individual meets the disability standard or reaches full retirement age (FRA). To qualify for SSI benefits, an individual must be at least 65 years old, meet the disability standard, or have blindness. Income and resource tests must also be met, with a resource limit of $2,000 for individuals and $3,000 for couples. Some resources are excluded from the countable limit. Excluded resources for SSI eligibility include home, car for transportation, essential property, household goods, burial funds, and limited life insurance policies. Two types of income considered are unearned (e.g. Social Security benefits) and earned (e.g. wages). In-kind support includes food, clothing, or shelter provided to an individual. The SSI payment calculation includes wages, self-employment earnings, and earnings from services performed. Different exclusions apply to earned and unearned income, such as a $20 general income exclusion for unearned income. Various sources of income like food stamps, housing assistance, and student grants are excluded from unearned income for SSI purposes. The $20 exclusion is applied to unearned income, resulting in a dollar-for-dollar reduction in SSI benefits. Monthly earned income exclusions include the first $65 of earnings, one-half of earnings over $65, impairment-related expenses, and income used for a PASS. SSI benefits are reduced by $1 for every $2 of earned income after applying exclusions. Deeming is used to consider the income and resources of non-recipients in certain cases. To qualify for SSI, an individual must meet categorical and financial requirements, reside in one of the specified locations, and be a U.S. citizen or qualified noncitizen. Recipients outside the country for over a month lose eligibility, and those in public institutions are generally ineligible. Additional criteria apply, such as filing for other benefits and fugitive felon status. The application process for SSDI and SSI disability benefits is similar, utilizing both federal and state offices. The application process for SSDI and SSI disability benefits is similar, utilizing federal and state offices. An initial determination is made through a five-step sequential evaluation process to verify eligibility for benefits. This includes tests for work, severity of the condition, and meeting medical listings. The application process for SSDI and SSI disability benefits involves a five-step sequential evaluation process to determine eligibility. This includes tests for work, severity of the condition, and meeting medical listings. Field offices are responsible for validating non-medical eligibility requirements and interviewing claimants for relevant information. The application process for SSDI and SSI disability benefits involves a five-step sequential evaluation process to determine eligibility. Applications meeting non-medical criteria are forwarded to state Disability Determination Services for a medical determination. State disability examiners use medical evidence to assess the severity of the claimant's impairment without a personal interview. The state DDS evaluates a claimant's residual functional capacity (RFC) at Step 4 to determine if they can perform past relevant work. If not, the application moves to Step 5 where vocational factors are considered to see if the claimant can perform any work in the national economy. If unable, the claimant is found to be disabled. The state DDS evaluates child SSI claimants to determine if their severe impairment functionally equals the medical listings, assessing their daily functioning in various settings. The state DDS evaluates a child SSI claimant's functioning across six domains to determine if their impairment meets the criteria in the listings. Marked limitations in at least two domains or an extreme limitation in one domain may qualify for benefits. During the disability determination process, claimants have the right to appeal if their application for benefits is denied. The appeals process includes three levels of administrative review through SSA before a case can be appealed to the U.S. court system. At the first level, claimants can request reconsideration by a different examiner from the state DDS office, who will reexamine the evidence and notify the claimant of the decision. After a review of the evidence, the claimant is notified of the decision. If the claimant disagrees, they can proceed to an Administrative Hearing before an ALJ. The ALJ will investigate the appeal by questioning the claimant and witnesses, allowing for the presentation of additional evidence and arguments. The proceeding is non-adversarial as SSA is not represented. After an Administrative Hearing before an ALJ, the claimant is notified in writing of the decision. If dissatisfied, the case can be appealed to the Appeals Council (AC). The AC may dismiss, deny, grant, issue a decision, or remand the case to an ALJ. If still disagreeing, the claimant can proceed to file a lawsuit in U.S. district court. At each stage of the appeals process, claimants must request an appeal within 60 days. Disability cases can be appealed to the U.S. court of appeals and the U.S. Supreme Court. SSA conducts periodic reviews to ensure eligibility criteria are met. Continuing disability reviews evaluate if individuals are still medically eligible for payments. The Social Security Administration (SSA) conducts periodic reviews, known as continuing disability reviews (CDRs), to assess if individuals are still medically eligible for payments. The frequency of a medical CDR depends on the beneficiary's prospective medical improvement: Medical Improvement Expected (MIE), Medical Improvement Possible (MIP), and Medical Improvement Not Expected (MINE). SSA schedules reviews at intervals ranging from six to 18 months for MIE, at least once every three years for MIP, and once every five to seven years for MINE. Substantial evidence of medical improvement during a CDR is required for the SSA to deem a SSDI beneficiary or SSI disability recipient no longer eligible. The Social Security Administration conducts continuing disability reviews (CDRs) to assess if individuals are still medically eligible for payments. The legal requirement for determining if disability continues during a CDR is called the medical improvement review standard (MIRS). Under MIRS, the agency will consider an adult beneficiary no longer disabled if there has been substantial medical improvement in their impairment(s) related to work ability and they can engage in substantial gainful activity (SGA). For child SSI recipients, SSA will consider them no longer disabled if there has been substantial medical improvement in their impairment(s) to the point where their condition no longer meets the criteria. The Social Security Administration conducts continuing disability reviews (CDRs) to assess if individuals are still medically eligible for payments. When a beneficiary's condition no longer meets the severity in the listings, they may appeal the decision. SSA also reevaluates child SSI recipients who turn 18 under the adult standard. These reevaluations are known as age-18 disability redeterminations. Additionally, SSA conducts periodic non-medical reviews to ensure beneficiaries meet financial and other eligibility requirements. Work CDRs are performed to determine if a beneficiary's work activity represents substantial gainful activity (SGA). SSA conducts work CDRs to assess if a beneficiary's work activity constitutes SGA and if benefits should continue. The agency may cease disability benefits if a recipient is engaging in SGA without participating in an approved work incentive program. Periodic redeterminations under the SSI program verify non-medical eligibility factors like income and resources. Redeterminations can be scheduled or unscheduled based on changes in a recipient's circumstances affecting eligibility or payment amounts. The SSDI program is funded through the Social Security payroll tax, split between employees and employers. The SSI program is funded through annual appropriations. The tax rate is 12.40%, with 10.03% going to the OASI trust fund and 2.37% to the DI trust fund. Funding for each trust fund is prescribed in the Social Security Act. The DI and OASI trust funds, funded through the Social Security payroll tax, do not borrow from each other. Revenues from payroll tax contributions and taxation of Social Security benefits are invested in U.S. government securities. The DI trust fund pays for SSDI benefits and program costs, while the SSI program is financed through the general fund. In FY2016, the DI trust fund paid out over $149.2 billion, and the SSI program paid out $59.6 billion in federal benefits."
