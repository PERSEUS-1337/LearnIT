    "content": "The Constitution grants Congress the power of the purse and establishes procedures for spending legislation. Congress has developed rules and practices under its authority to determine proceedings. The Congressional Budget Act of 1974 created procedures for budget and fiscal policy, including the annual adoption of a budget resolution to coordinate decision-making. This resolution sets parameters for spending, revenue, and debt legislation. The budget resolution establishes parameters for spending, revenue, and debt legislation. It is not a law and cannot be vetoed. Congress considers legislation within this framework, with details included in subsequent committee legislation. All spending legislation must align with the budget resolution's levels and priorities, covering discretionary and direct spending. Direct spending programs are established in permanent law and continue until revised or terminated. The cost is determined by formulas in the legislation, based on eligibility requirements and benefits. Congress does not determine the annual cost, which is dictated by the program's criteria. The budget resolution sets levels for new budget authority, outlays, revenue, and public debt for the budget year and outyears. It deals with aggregates, not programmatic spending details, and establishes congressional priorities by dividing spending among 20 major functional categories of the federal budget. These categories do not correspond to the committee system by which Congress operates. The budget resolution divides spending among 20 functional categories of the federal budget, not corresponding to the committee system. Committees are allocated spending levels through 302(a) allocations to stay within budget limits. Committees submit \"views and estimates\" to help determine spending levels. The Budget Committee determines spending levels for functional categories in the federal budget resolution. The resolution does not allocate funds to specific agencies or programs but includes assumptions for the amounts in each category. For example, the FY2009 resolution assumed $2 billion for the Department of Energy's Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy program, which was $738 million above the President's request. The funding would support various R&D programs and provide $450 million for the Weatherization Assistance Program. However, the report language is not binding. The budget resolution determines spending levels for functional categories but does not allocate funds to specific programs. Report language and \"Sense of the Congress\" provisions express desires for certain programs to receive priority funding. For example, the FY2010 resolution included language on Great Lakes restoration. The budget resolution includes funding to address issues in regional ecosystems, such as invasive species, habitat restoration, pollution, and contaminated sediment. It supports using performance goals to track progress. Policy statements may also be included, like opposing TRICARE fee increases for military retirees under 65. Federal budgeting is a cyclical activity where the President submits a budget request to Congress, followed by hearings and submission of \"views and estimates\" by congressional committees to the Budget Committee. Budget resolutions may include procedural provisions like reserve funds and reconciliation instructions. \"Sense of the Congress\" provisions and \"Policy\" statements are not binding on spending and revenue committees. The committee's \"views and estimates\" inform Budget Committees of their preferences and legislative plans on budget matters. The Congressional Budget Act sets a timetable for budget legislation consideration, with target dates for key actions. After adopting a budget resolution, chambers can consider appropriations bills and other spending legislation. 302(a) allocations to Appropriations Committees reflect their jurisdiction over discretionary spending and hold them accountable for staying within budget limits. Budget resolutions may also include explicit spending measures in recent years. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees have 12 subcommittees responsible for reporting regular appropriations bills, which can be packaged together in an omnibus appropriations act. Once the committees receive their 302(a) allocation, they subdivide it among subcommittees through 302(b) subdivisions. The appropriations committees may allocate funds among subcommittees, even if they do not align with the budget resolution's functional categories. Section 302(c) of the Budget Act establishes a point of order against considering appropriations measures before the Appropriations Committee reports. The appropriations committees must report their subdivisions to their respective chambers after receiving their 302(a) allocation. They can adjust the 302(b) subdivisions during the appropriations process and inform their chamber of any changes. Subcommittees then report regular appropriations bills to the full appropriations committee, which in turn reports the bill to its respective chamber. Section 302(f) of the Budget Act prohibits exceeding the 302(a) or 302(b) allocations. The appropriations process involves 302(b) allocations that limit spending levels, making amendments on the floor challenging as they must not exceed these limits. Legislative committees also have 302(a) allocations for direct spending programs, and any legislation must align with these allocations. Section 302(f) prohibits exceeding these allocations. The reconciliation process is used to align legislation with budget resolutions by instructing committees to recommend changes to revenue or spending laws. Instructions are specific and given to a particular committee for legislative adjustments. The reconciliation process aligns legislation with budget resolutions by instructing committees to recommend changes to revenue or spending laws. Instructions are specific and include the committee responsible, dollar amount, and measurement period. Deadlines are also included for submitting recommendations. For example, the budget resolution for FY2006 included reconciliation instructions for committees to submit recommendations by a specific date. The reconciliation process involves committees recommending changes to revenue or spending laws to align with budget resolutions. Instructions include specific details like the committee responsible, dollar amount, and measurement period. Reconciliation acts have resulted in changes to various direct spending programs, such as Medicare, Medicaid, and LIHEAP. The process begins with Congress including reconciliation instructions in a budget resolution. The reconciliation process involves committees recommending changes to revenue or spending laws to align with budget resolutions. Committees draft legislative language to meet specified targets, which is then included in reconciliation bills without substantive revision. Reconciliation legislation is considered under special procedures on the House and Senate floor. Spending allocations may be revised after the adoption of the budget resolution, with provisions like \"reserve funds\" included to provide authority to the Budget Committees. The budget resolution allows the chairs of the House and Senate Budget Committees to adjust spending allocations under certain conditions. Reserve funds ensure that legislation's budgetary impact is deficit neutral, allowing committees to exceed allocations if offsetting amounts are provided. This prevents a point of order under the Budget Act. The budget resolution allows adjustments to spending allocations under certain conditions. Reserve funds ensure deficit-neutral budgetary impact, allowing committees to exceed allocations with offsetting amounts to prevent a point of order under the Budget Act. Reserve funds in the 2018 budget may exceed spending levels set in the budget resolution as long as policy legislation meets reserve fund conditions. Increases authorized by reserve funds may be limited to specified amounts."
