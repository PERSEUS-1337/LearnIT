    "content": "The Act titled \"Disaster Savings and Resilient Construction Act of 2012\" introduces a Resilient Construction Tax Credit under section 45S of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The Resilient Construction Tax Credit under section 45S of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 provides eligible contractors with a credit for buildings constructed in a disaster area after a federally declared major disaster, and placed in service within 2 years of the disaster declaration. The Resilient Construction Tax Credit under section 45S of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 provides eligible contractors with a credit for buildings constructed in a disaster area after a federally declared major disaster. The applicable amount for qualified commercial property is the lesser of 1 percent of the cost of construction or $25,000, and for qualified residential property, it is the lesser of 1 percent of the cost of construction or $3,000. Qualified commercial property is defined as a building located in the United States according to the 2009 or later International Building Code. The Resilient Construction Tax Credit provides a credit for buildings constructed in disaster areas. Qualified residential property must meet resilient construction requirements outlined in the International Residential Code. The Resilient Construction Tax Credit requires properties to be designed to resist hazards, reduce disruptive events, and have the capacity to withstand potential disasters. Qualified commercial properties meeting these requirements can receive the tax credit. The Resilient Construction Tax Credit requires commercial properties to meet the 2009 International Building Code standards or equivalent with FORTIFIED for Safer Business designation. The Resilient Construction Tax Credit requires commercial properties to meet the 2009 International Building Code standards or equivalent with FORTIFIED for Safer Business designation. Additionally, qualified residential properties must meet the requirements of the 2009 or later International Residential Code published by the International Code Council to qualify for the tax credit. The building received FORTIFIED designations for Safer Living and Existing Homes. It was designed and built in a jurisdiction that requires meeting the 2009 International Building Code or equivalent with amendments equivalent or more restrictive than FORTIFIED requirements. The FORTIFIED for Safer Living Builders Guide, published by the Insurance Institute for Business and Home Safety, requires buildings to have a certificate of occupancy from the jurisdiction. It defines absorptive capacity as the ability to endure disruptions, adaptive capacity as the ability to adapt to drastic changes, and recoverability as the ability to quickly recover at low cost. The term 'resilient construction' refers to the ability of a building to recover quickly and at low cost from disruptive events. Other definitions related to this include 'eligible contractor', 'construction', 'disaster area', and 'federally declared major disaster'. The resilient construction credit under the Emergency Assistance Act reduces the basis of eligible properties. The credit is now part of the general business credit, and there is a termination clause for properties with occupancy certificates issued after December 31, 2015. Basis adjustment is also addressed in section 1016. The resilient construction credit under the Emergency Assistance Act is now included in the general business credit. Amendments have been made to sections 196(c) and 45S, allowing for deductions and credits for certain unused business credits. The amendments made by this section apply to property with a certificate for occupancy issued after the enactment of this Act."
