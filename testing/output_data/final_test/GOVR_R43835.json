    "content": "In recent years, the United States designated Iran, North Korea, Sudan, and Syria as state sponsors of terrorism. In 2015, the JCPOA was agreed upon by the US, China, France, Germany, Russia, UK, EU, and Iran to ensure Iran's nuclear program was peaceful. In 2018, President Trump withdrew from the JCPOA and imposed restrictions on Iran's economy, while maintaining sanctions for Iran's support of terrorism. Sanctions remain in place to address Iran's support for terrorism, missile proliferation, human rights violations, and regional instability. In 2014, President Obama announced plans to reestablish diplomatic relations with Cuba and ease restrictions. In 2015, Cuba was certified as not supporting terrorism, meeting requirements to be removed from the terrorist list. In November 2017, President Trump designated North Korea as a state sponsor of terrorism due to various factors, including the assassination of Kim Jung-un's half-brother and their pursuit of nuclear weapons. The possibility of redesignating North Korea had been debated since 2014 when the Obama Administration attributed a cyberattack to them. Congress had been discussing this issue since 2008 when the terrorism designation was removed as part of negotiations to dismantle North Korea's nuclear program. In November 2017, North Korea was designated as a state sponsor of terrorism by President Trump due to factors such as the assassination of Kim Jung-un's half-brother and their pursuit of nuclear weapons. Congress had been discussing this issue since 2008 when the terrorism designation was removed as part of negotiations to dismantle North Korea's nuclear program. The Secretary of State missed the deadline to report on North Korea's designation but it was confirmed on November 21. Sudan was designated as a state sponsor of terrorism in 1993 under President Clinton for supporting international terrorism, destabilizing neighboring governments, and human rights violations. The State Department described Sudan as generally cooperative on counterterrorism efforts, leading to a positive outlook for U.S.-Sudan relations. President Obama's order in January 2017 signaled a potential end to the national emergency and economic sanctions due to Sudan's efforts in reducing military activity and improving humanitarian access. In November 2018, the Administration considered rescinding Sudan's sanctions. In 2018, the State Department announced the possibility of rescinding Sudan's designation as a state sponsor of terrorism if certain conditions were met. Legislation authorizes the designation of foreign governments supporting terrorism, outlining criteria, aid/trade restrictions, delisting process, presidential waivers, and congressional oversight. Three statutes empower the Secretary of State to designate such governments. Section 620A of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 prohibits aid to countries supporting terrorism, while Section 40 of the Arms Export Control Act restricts exports and financial assistance. Additionally, Section 1754(c) of the Export Controls Act of 2018 is also relevant. The Export Administration Act of 1979 and the Arms Export Control Act have been amended over time to include provisions for trade in goods controlled for national security reasons. The designations of Iran, Sudan, Syria, and North Korea as terrorist states were based on these statutes. The Export Controls Act of 2018 continues these designations and requires validated export licenses for controlled goods. Congress has played a role in defining these statutes and their processes. The Arms Export Control Act and Export Administration Act have been amended to include provisions for national security. Iran, Sudan, Syria, and North Korea were designated as terrorist states based on these statutes. The Export Controls Act of 2018 continues these designations and requires validated export licenses for controlled goods. The AECA identifies objectionable activities related to international terrorism. Section 140 of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act defines \"international terrorism\" as terrorism involving citizens or territory of more than one country, with \"terrorism\" being premeditated violence against noncombatant targets by subnational groups or clandestine agents. The act also defines \"terrorist group\" as any group practicing international terrorism. The terms \"territory\" and \"territory of the country\" refer to the land, waters, and airspace of a country. \"Terrorist sanctuary\" means an area used by terrorists for activities with the government's consent. The Export Control Act, FAA'61, and AECA provide paths for removing a foreign government from designation. The President can certify a change in leadership and policies, ensuring no support for international terrorism. Notifications are required to Congress and specific committees for each statute. The FAA'61 and AECA allow the President to notify Congress and specific committees about the removal of a foreign government from designation if certain conditions are met, including a certification of no support for international terrorism. There is no requirement to notify Congress about the start of a six-month period of changed behavior by the designated government. The Secretary of State may publish a notice when reviewing a designation, but this is not mandated by law. The ECA'18 allows for export licenses to be issued with advance notice to specific committees in Congress. The AECA permits the President to waive restrictions on munitions provision for specific transactions. The President can waive restrictions on munitions provision for specific transactions if deemed essential to national security interests. Consultation with relevant committees and submission of a detailed report are required. The President can waive restrictions on foreign aid to designated foreign governments by enacting language in annual appropriations. The AECA provides a legislative mechanism for Congress to block a delisting of a state sponsor of terrorism. The AECA provides a mechanism for Congress to block a delisting of a state sponsor of terrorism by enacting a joint resolution within 45 days. The resolution prohibits the proposed rescission of the determination under section 40(d) of the Arms Export Control Act. The Secretary of State and President have removed five foreign governments from terrorism lists over the years. Iraq was delisted in 1982, relisted in 1990, and removed again in 2004. South Yemen was removed in 1990 due to merging with North Yemen. Libya was delisted in 2006 without Congress blocking the procedure. After delisting, the Senate and House expressed concerns about accepting representatives from the Government of Libya. The United States will not accept the credentials of any representative from the Government of Libya without assurances that outstanding claims of US victims of terrorism sponsored by Libya will be resolved, including final payment to families of Pan Am Flight 103 victims. The United States delisted North Korea on June 26, 2008, after introducing S.Res. 399 to set benchmarks for sanctions removal. Cuba was delisted on May 29, 2015, without Congress exercising blocking procedures under the AECA. Prior to the President's announcement to rescind the terrorism designation for Cuba, a resolution was introduced calling for the extradition of fugitives in Cuba. The measure did not progress further."
