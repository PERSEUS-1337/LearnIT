    "content": "Credit for prior group health plan coverage can be used against preexisting condition limitations. Group health plans must reduce preexisting condition limitation periods for individuals with prior qualified coverage starting after December 31, 1995. The \"limitation period\" in a group health plan refers to the period where benefits for a preexisting condition are not provided. The \"aggregate period of qualified prior coverage\" is the total duration of prior qualified coverage before the individual's new coverage starts, with a break of more than 60 days resetting this period to zero. The 60-day break in coverage under a group health plan is defined as the period between the end of the most recent qualified coverage and the start of new coverage. The term \"qualified coverage period\" refers to any period of coverage under a group health plan, excluding periods before breaks in coverage. Waiting periods are not considered breaks in coverage for this purpose. For purposes of determining breaks in coverage under a group health plan, waiting periods are not considered breaks in coverage. Continuation coverage is treated as coverage under the group health plan. A qualified coverage period can be established through certifications or other specified means. The group health plan administrator must certify an individual's coverage period upon request. Coverage before January 1, 1996, is not included in the qualified coverage period unless it was under the same group health plan as of December 31, 1995. This applies to small employer plans as well. The group health plan must not discriminate in eligibility based on health status for certain previously covered individuals. This includes not establishing requirements based on factors related to health status, medical history, or evidence of insurability. The group health plan cannot discriminate in eligibility based on health status for individuals with prior coverage. Preexisting condition limitations consistent with subsection (g) are allowed. Technical amendments are made to section 4980B of the Code. The amendments to section 4980B of the Code, effective for plan years after December 31, 1995, pertain to qualified beneficiaries and individuals covered under the group health plan. Amendments include changes to subsection (f) regarding specific references within the Code."
