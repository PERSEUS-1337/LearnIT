The \"Abandoned Hardrock Mines Reclamation Funding Act\" aims to address the legacy of inactive or abandoned mines in the western States, which pose safety hazards and damage water quality. Lack of funding hampers environmental cleanup efforts, making it necessary to establish a funding source for cleanup initiatives. The \"Abandoned Hardrock Mines Reclamation Funding Act\" aims to address inactive and abandoned mine sites by establishing a funding source for cleanup initiatives. The \"Abandoned Hardrock Mines Reclamation Funding Act\" aims to establish a funding source for cleanup initiatives. SEC. 2 defines key terms. The Act defines \"gross proceeds\" as the value of extracted hardrock minerals that are sold, exchanged, removed from the country, or used in manufacturing or services. \"Net proceeds\" are gross proceeds minus extraction, transportation, refining, marketing, and delivery costs. The curr_chunk discusses the actual costs related to maintenance, repairs, fire insurance, depreciation, industrial insurance premiums, and medical expenses for machinery, equipment, and facilities used in mining operations. The curr_chunk discusses the costs related to hardrock minerals, including royalties, severance taxes, and various laws governing mineral disposition on mining land. The curr_chunk defines key terms related to mining laws, including the Materials Act of 1947, the Mineral Leasing Act for Acquired Lands, the term \"Secretary\" referring to the Secretary of the Interior, and the definition of a patented mining claim and general mining laws. The curr_chunk defines the term \"Fund\" as the Abandoned Minerals Mine Reclamation Fund, as per sections 161 and 162 of title 30, United States Code. The Abandoned Minerals Mine Reclamation Fund is defined as the \"Fund\" in sections 161 and 162 of title 30, United States Code. The source of revenues for abandoned mine cleanup is addressed in SEC. 3. The Abandoned Minerals Mine Reclamation Fund, defined as the \"Fund\" in sections 161 and 162 of title 30, United States Code, addresses the source of revenues for abandoned mine cleanup. A reclamation fee is imposed on persons producing hardrock minerals from a mine within an unpatented mining claim or a mine on land patented under the general mining laws. The fee is based on a percentage of net proceeds derived from the mine, with rates ranging from 2.00% to 2.50% based on the ratio of net proceeds to gross proceeds. The reclamation fee rates for different age brackets are as follows: 10-18 years - $2.50, 18-26 years - $3.00, 26-34 years - $3.50, 34-42 years - $4.00, 42-50 years - $4.50, and 50 years and above - $5.00. Gross proceeds under $500,000 from minerals produced in a calendar year are exempt from the fee if from a single patented claim or multiple contiguous claims. Payment of fees is due within 60 days after the end of the calendar year. The Secretary deposits revenues in the Abandoned Minerals Mine Reclamation Fund. State fees are not affected by this Act. Fees required by this section are reduced by royalties paid to the Fund. Effective December 31, 2004, with subsection (f) taking effect one year later. SEC. 4. ABANDONED MINERALS MINE RECLAMATION FUND. Established in the Treasury of the United States is the Abandoned Minerals Mine Reclamation Fund, administered by the Secretary. The Secretary of the Treasury invests a portion of the Fund in public debt securities, with the income from investments credited to the Fund. The Abandoned Minerals Mine Reclamation Fund is administered by the Secretary and investments form part of the Fund. The Secretary uses the existing Federal program for abandoned mine reclamation to administer the Fund and make expenditures. Amounts in the Fund are available without further appropriation for reclamation and restoration activities in eligible areas, including reclaiming surface mined and processing areas. The Abandoned Minerals Mine Reclamation Fund is used for reclamation activities such as sealing mine entries, planting land affected by mining, controlling water pollution, and preventing surface subsidence. The Fund can be used directly by the Secretary or through grants to approved State reclamation programs. Coordination with eligible States is required for projects funded by the Fund. Reclamation expenditures under this section are limited to States specified in subsection (e) for lands no longer actively mined for hardrock minerals, not designated for remedial action under certain environmental laws, and lacking identifiable owners or operators. Expenditures from the Fund are for reclamation of lands in States with abandoned hardrock sites, subject to the general mining laws, and have completed a statewide inventory. States without inventory may receive grants up to $2,000,000 annually. The Secretary may provide grants up to $2,000,000 annually to assist in completing the required inventory for approved state reclamation programs applicable to hardrock mining. If a State lacks an approved program, funds may be provided after the State gains implementation authority. The Secretary determines State authority for implementing a hardrock abandoned mine land program, including establishing a reclamation plan and authorizing fund administration. Expenditures from the Fund prioritize public health, safety, and welfare protection from extreme danger and adverse effects of past mining activities. The Secretary may authorize expenditures from the Fund for remediation activities conducted by Federal agencies or remediating parties who are permittees under the abandoned mine land waste remediation permit program. Funds collected for a mine are distributed with 25% for the eligible State where the mine is located and 50% for reclamation activities. The Secretary determines the allocation of funds for eligible States based on their mineral production from 1900-1980. If funds are not spent within three years, they are reallocated to other States as deemed appropriate."
