The Great Blacks in Wax Museum, Inc. in Baltimore, Maryland, is the Nation's first wax museum presenting the history of great Black Americans, including those who have served in Congress, in senior executive branch positions, in the law, the judiciary, and other fields, as well as others who have made significant contributions to benefit the Nation. The museum plans to expand its facilities to establish the National Great Blacks. The National Great Blacks in Wax Museum and Justice Learning Center is a national museum and center showcasing wax figures of prominent Black Americans. Founded in 1983 by Drs. Elmer and Joanne Martin, the museum uses the wax medium to preserve the history of great Black Americans. The Martins used personal savings to purchase wax figures and displayed them in various locations to gauge public interest in a Black history wax museum. The museum has gained national recognition and attracts over 300,000 visitors annually. The new museum will continue the tradition of the wax medium, focusing on honoring great Black Americans not widely recognized. It will employ skilled artisans, use interactive technologies, and feature Black senators and representatives from the 19th century. The new museum will honor Black Americans from the 19th century, including those who served in the judiciary, Department of Justice, military engagements, executive branch positions, and made contributions to human history. The museum showcases Black educators, authors, scientists, inventors, athletes, clergy, and civil rights leaders. It plans to collaborate with other museums, offer training and resources for wax medium use, and host traveling exhibits nationwide. Located in Baltimore, it is recognized for presenting Black history through wax art.
