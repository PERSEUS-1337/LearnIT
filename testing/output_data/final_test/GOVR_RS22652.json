    "content": "On January 11, 2007, the PRC successfully tested an anti-satellite weapon by launching a ballistic missile armed with a kinetic kill vehicle to destroy a weather satellite in low earth orbit. The test was conducted near China's Xichang Space Center using a two-stage, solid-fuel medium-range ballistic missile fired from a mobile launcher. The U.S. designated this ASAT weapon as SC-19, and the White House expressed concerns about China's development of such weapons. China conducted a successful anti-satellite weapon test on January 11, 2007, using a land-based medium-range ballistic missile to destroy a satellite. The United States and other countries issued formal protests, while Russia downplayed the test. China did not give advance warnings and emphasized the peaceful use of space. The test created space debris, posing a short-term challenge. This was the first satellite destruction since the Cold War ASAT tests by the US and Soviet Union in the 1980s. Since the 1980s, the United States and Russia have not destroyed satellites in space. However, China's satellite destruction in low Earth orbit (LEO) has created a debris cloud threatening space assets. The debris cloud consists of approximately 950 pieces 4 inches or larger, along with thousands of smaller pieces. The Johnson Space Center estimates the threat to satellites in LEO, with the Air Force tracking about 15,000 particles as of January 11. The last U.S. kinetic ASAT test in LEO occurred in 1985, resulting in significant debris. China's ASAT test in 1985 at a higher altitude of LEO resulted in debris that posed a threat to space assets for over 20 years. The debris increased collision risk for about 700 spacecraft, raising concerns about China's capability and intention to attack U.S. satellites. China has been actively participating in international efforts to address space debris, but some observers doubt its true intentions. China's ASAT capability has been developing since 1998, confirmed by a test in January 2007. The test showed China's ability to launch a kinetic kill vehicle to destroy a satellite in LEO. While China lacks enough satellite interceptors currently, it is estimated to have sufficient by 2010 to potentially threaten U.S. satellites in LEO with little warning. The ASAT test did not pose a threat to U.S. missile defense systems. The ASAT test conducted by China in January 2007 demonstrated their capability to deploy a system that could threaten U.S. satellites. General Peter Pace emphasized that the threat includes capabilities and intentions, with China's intention remaining unclear. PLA officers and PRC analysts justified the test as a response to perceived U.S. dominance in space and the vulnerability of U.S. satellite dependence. China's ASAT program aims to maintain nuclear deterrence and counter U.S. dominance in space. Analysts suggest China seeks limited capabilities to reduce the risk of U.S. attacks on space assets. Some reports indicated U.S. surprise at China's ASAT test, despite prior Defense Department warnings. China conducted a kinetic kill ASAT test in January 2007, alarming U.S. intelligence agencies. Despite prior warnings, China developed a direct-ascent ASAT system, conducting four tests between 2004 and 2006. The U.S. monitored the January 11 test using missile-warning satellites. China conducted an ASAT test in January 2007, alarming U.S. intelligence agencies. Despite foreign protests, China did not issue an official statement until January 23, 12 days after the test. Questions arose about China's intentions and whether top leaders approved the test. NASA and STRATCOM proposed space contacts with China after a U.S.-China summit in April 2006. In September 2006, NASA's Administrator visited China. National Security Advisor Stephen Hadley questioned if China's leaders knew about the PLA's ASAT test in advance. Deputy Under Secretary of Defense Richard Lawless dismissed the speculation, citing Hu Jintao's multiple roles. Admiral William Fallon noted PLA's efforts to counter U.S. military power in a conflict over Taiwan. The ASAT weapon demonstration was linked to the PLA, and the January 2007 test followed changes in the PLA Air Force's control. The PLA Air Force made sudden changes in airspace control near Shanghai in late 2006, leading to a rare shutdown of Pudong airport. Concerns about potential crises in the Taiwan Strait in 2007 were raised by PRC officials and scholars. The ASAT test by the PLA Air Force may have been a signal to the U.S. regarding Taiwan. China's test was possibly influenced by the new U.S. National Space Policy, which emphasized opposition to space arms control. The U.S. National Space Policy in October 2006 opposed new space arms control and denied space use to adversaries hostile to U.S. interests. Under Secretary of State Robert Joseph stated that the U.S. does not monopolize space but faces growing threats from countries acquiring capabilities to counter U.S. space systems. China had conducted three ASAT weapon tests and used a ground-based laser to blind U.S. satellites. This raised concerns about China's vulnerability. China's vulnerability to U.S. dominance in military and space power has raised concerns among military and civilian analysts. Following an ASAT weapon test, Chinese analysts emphasized the need for space arms control, while the U.S. opposed a resolution on the Prevention of an Arms Race in Outer Space. The test highlighted the potential weaponization of outer space, with China not being the only country with such capabilities. China's ASAT test raised concerns about the need for space arms control. China's Foreign Ministry did not provide an explanation for the test, leading to speculation about its motives. China had subtly shifted its stance on space arms control at the United Nations. The test raised questions about the benefits of engaging in arms control agreements with China and other countries. China's ASAT test did not violate any existing arms control treaty but broke a voluntary moratorium on satellite destruction since the 1980s. There are discussions about a narrowly-targeted ban on kinetic ASAT weapons to prevent space debris. The Bush Administration opposed the idea of pursuing outer space arms control in response to China's test, as it would not address China's ground-launched ASAT activities. There is debate on whether to protest future tests by China, but it is uncertain if U.S.-only objections would influence China's leaders. China's leaders may not heed U.S.-only objections to a PLA program, prompting calls for a new strategic dialogue. General Pace visited China to strengthen military ties, but the ASAT test impacted debates in Congress on relaxing legal restrictions for contacts with the PLA and resuming commercial satellite deals. There are discussions on continuing or suspending bilateral space cooperation proposed in 2006, including talks on collision avoidance and station keeping.
