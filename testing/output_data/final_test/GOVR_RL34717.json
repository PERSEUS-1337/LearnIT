    "content": "The United States and the European Union have a significant economic partnership, known as the transatlantic economy, which is the largest in the world. Despite high integration, regulatory differences hinder further market integration and lead to trade disputes. Efforts like government dialogues aim to address these challenges and promote understanding between policymakers and regulators on both sides of the Atlantic. Efforts to minimize regulatory barriers in the U.S.-EU economic relationship through transatlantic regulatory cooperation (TRC) aim to prevent trade disputes and reduce costs for producers and consumers. Despite various initiatives since 1995, many companies feel the results have not been significant. At the 2007 U.S.-EU Summit, leaders committed to increasing efficiency and transparency in transatlantic economic cooperation, reducing barriers to trade and investment, and creating the Transatlantic Economic Council (TEC) to oversee regulatory cooperation. The TEC's effectiveness in promoting cooperation remains uncertain. The Transatlantic Economic Council (TEC) was established in 2007 to reduce regulatory barriers between the EU and the United States. Its effectiveness in promoting cooperation remains uncertain, with six meetings held since its inception. The report serves as an introduction to the complex issues surrounding regulatory cooperation. Since the mid-1990s, U.S. and European multinational companies have identified divergent regulations as significant barriers to transatlantic commerce. Redundant standards and certification procedures are viewed as more costly than trade barriers like tariffs. Domestic regulations can impact firms' competitive positions by affecting imports. Different regulations between the U.S. and EU create non-tariff barriers to trade, impacting firms by requiring costly re-labeling, re-packaging, or re-testing of products. This includes differences in product standards, health and safety regulations, accounting requirements, and consumer protection measures. These divergent regulations add to the cost of doing business on both sides of the Atlantic. Regulatory differences between the U.S. and EU, such as in chemicals, GMOs, and pharmaceuticals, create non-tariff barriers to trade and lead to politically charged disputes that threaten the transatlantic market. In the pharmaceutical sector, regulatory differences between the United States and EU pose significant challenges for drug approvals, testing protocols, and manufacturing practices. Varying rules within the EU member states further complicate the process, making it costly for companies to obtain marketing authorization. This contrasts with the automotive sector, where American and European car makers face different standards and testing requirements for various parts. Regulatory barriers in the automotive sector between the United States and EU pose challenges for various parts, crash standards, and testing requirements. A comprehensive study to identify differences and reduce burdens on transatlantic commerce has not been undertaken, despite proposals from the European Commission in 2003. In the 2008 U.S. trade barriers report, 12 pages are dedicated to EU regulatory barriers, highlighting major divergences that hinder trade. Efforts to improve Transatlantic Regulatory Cooperation (TRC) are backed by economic and political reasons, supported by businesses and governments on both sides. However, some in the U.S., particularly academics, argue for regulatory independence to maintain control over consumer, health, and environmental regulations. Concerns exist that TRC driven by business interests could lead to a \"race to the bottom\" compromising domestic standards. Many export industries seek harmonization in international standards to reduce compliance costs. Transatlantic regulatory differences can increase costs, as seen in the auto industry example where a U.S. truck model couldn't meet European standards. This led to redesign efforts for future export potential. The manufacturer designed a new model with maximum export potential for Europe, using 100 unique parts and incurring $42 million in costs. Additional staff were committed to the program, but safety performance remained unchanged. Regulatory differences between the US and Europe can cost manufacturers millions to comply with, without impacting safety or fuel economy. A 2005 OECD study highlights the costly impact of regulatory barriers on producers and consumers on both sides of the Atlantic. Regulatory differences between the United States and Europe can cost the US 1%-3% of GDP annually. Regulatory cooperation is advocated to prevent obstacles to trade and unfair advantages, such as disparities in emissions standards and labeling requirements. Proponents argue that regulatory convergence can avoid a \"race to the bottom\" in competitiveness. The rationale for regulatory cooperation is to prevent a \"race to the bottom\" in competitiveness as jurisdictions aim to advance their industries through lax regulation or lower standards. This has led to an expansion of federal legislation in the US and harmonization programs in the EU to promote global regulatory standards. The competition between the US and Europe for acceptance of their regulations in third markets allows countries like India and China to play them off against each other. India and China can manipulate the United States and Europe by creating their own standards and regulations, causing complications in global trade. Efforts have been made since the end of the Cold War to strengthen the transatlantic relationship, with a focus on regulatory cooperation to address trade disputes. Efforts to enhance transatlantic regulatory cooperation have been a significant component of the U.S.-EU economic relationship. Annual summits with high-level political leaders aim to address commercial disputes and common regulatory challenges. With the U.S. and EU representing over 50% of global production, joint regulatory policies can have global significance. Efforts to enhance transatlantic regulatory cooperation between the U.S. and EU are crucial due to their significant global production share. While they can promote common regulatory policies globally, disagreements often lead to deadlock. The World Trade Organization plays a role in promoting regulatory cooperation but has limitations in addressing all transatlantic regulatory differences. The United States and EU need to develop bilateral mechanisms for coordinating their regulatory policies to address trade disputes. While there is strong support for Transatlantic Regulatory Cooperation (TRC), critics argue for regulatory competition over a centrally adopted framework to promote bureaucratic efficiency and discipline governments. Some consumer groups caution against business groups' influential role in transatlantic regulatory cooperation, fearing compromise on safety and health standards. The Trans Atlantic Consumers Dialogue advocates for promoting higher health and safety standards through regulatory cooperation between the United States and EU. Opponents of TRC argue for dismantling centralized regulatory programs and decentralizing regulatory powers to promote higher health and safety standards in the States and EU. They believe that regulatory cooperation faces challenges due to key differences in political cycles, public preferences, transparency attitudes, and institutional capacities between the two regions. These differences impact various regulatory areas such as product safety, environmental protection, securities trading, and customs procedures. The regulatory policies in the EU and the United States have diverged over the last 50 years, with differences in stringency and expansion. The United States often had more comprehensive and stringent standards, especially in identifying and addressing new risks. The challenge lies in merging or harmonizing these varied approaches until regulatory structures become more aligned. Over the last 50 years, regulatory policies in the EU and the United States have diverged. The US had more stringent standards historically, but in recent years, European standards have become more comprehensive and demanding in areas such as GM foods, chemicals, and environmental regulations. The EU has stricter regulations on chemicals and greenhouse gas emissions compared to the United States. Rising concerns about product safety and the financial crisis have led to increased support for regulatory actions in the US. Differences in public preferences, such as European consumers favoring \"naturally produced\" foods, contribute to transatlantic regulatory divergences. Europe has restrictions on growth hormones in beef, reflecting these differences. Europe has imposed restrictions on growth hormones for beef and dairy cows, while the United States has not. The US prefers a science-based approach to regulation, waiting to act until significant problems arise, while Europe takes a more cautious approach, regulating out of precaution. This difference in risk management systems has led to less political controversy in the US regarding biotechnology compared to Europe. The United States and EU have different approaches to public participation in rule-making. In the US, Congress passes laws and grants authority to regulatory agencies, with regulations subject to public input. Transparency is ensured through various laws and acts. The EU lacks an effective equivalent to the APA for regulatory processes, with directives developed by the European Commission and approved by the European Parliament. The US and EU differ in their approaches to public participation in rule-making, with the US having more transparency and public input in the regulatory process. The EU's institutional framework is well-suited for regulatory changes, with the European Commission leading in coordinating European-wide policies. The regulatory culture in the EU promotes free trade while ensuring public safety, but enforcement varies among member states. In contrast, U.S. regulatory agencies focus on domestic issues with less emphasis on international cooperation. The United States lacks a clear institutional mechanism for coordinating cooperative efforts in regulatory issues. The Commerce Department and USTR do not have the authority to overhaul domestic regulatory policymaking, and regulatory agencies are not usually funded or mandated to engage in transatlantic regulatory cooperation. State regulations also play a significant role in overseeing professional services such as insurance, banking, and architecture. Regulatory cooperation encompasses a wide range of activities, from simple discussions to harmonizing regulatory approaches through common standards. Mutual Recognition Agreements (MRAs) are one example of agreements that recognize each other's standards or certification procedures. The line between different categories of regulatory cooperation can be arbitrary, and there are other activities that may not fit neatly into these categories. Most transatlantic regulatory cooperation efforts involve information exchanges, dialogues, and negotiating MRAs for goods. Little focus has been on harmonizing standards. Basic cooperation includes establishing working groups for information exchange among technical experts or regulators from different jurisdictions. The primary goal is to understand technical differences in standards. The objective of consultations is to understand technical differences in standards and consult before new regulations take effect to minimize barriers. Exchange of people and information builds trust for more informed regulations and potential agreement on best practices. Dialogue is a necessary first step for convergence to occur and prevent unilateral actions creating new barriers. In the transatlantic context, U.S. regulatory agencies have engaged in information exchanges and dialogues with European counterparts over the past decade, encouraged by the Guidelines on Regulatory Cooperation and Transparency. These exchanges aim to enhance cooperation in developing technical regulations through regular consultation and exchange of data. The annual U.S.-EU summits since 2004 have strengthened regulatory cooperation through a Roadmap for Regulatory Cooperation in various sectors. Lighthouse projects focus on intellectual property rights, secure trade, financial markets, innovation, and technology. A High Level Regulatory Cooperation Forum was established for common ground on horizontal issues. Cooperation also includes Mutual Recognition Agreements (MRAs) for accepting products or services from each other. Mutual Recognition Agreements (MRAs) involve regulators accepting products or services from another jurisdiction under specified conditions. This can include mutual recognition of conformity assessment certifications or alignment of standards. The goal is for products to be tested once and accepted in both markets. In 1998, the US and EU completed an MRA allowing companies to sell pharmaceuticals in the US after meeting European standards without FDA approval. In 1998, the United States and EU completed an MRA for testing and certification requirements in various sectors. The MRA did not include mutual recognition of product standards but allowed certification bodies in the exporting country to assess conformity with destination country standards, introducing competition among assessors. This competition was new in the US, where government agencies had previously dominated the process. The MRAs between the United States and the EU aimed for cheaper and faster certification, raising concerns about product safety. They were not legally binding but established through letters between regulatory agency heads. Successful implementation required mutual trust in regulatory standards and inspection equivalence. Regulatory cooperation could involve harmonization of standards across jurisdictions. In the transatlantic context, there is a lack of precedents for adopting similar regulatory standards. Despite calls for regulatory convergence, little progress has been made in aligning existing laws. Stakeholders have proposed a binding regulatory cooperation agreement to push for greater transatlantic regulatory cooperation. The EU sees a binding treaty or regulatory cooperation agreement as necessary for a transatlantic single market. The Commission's white paper identified legislation harmonization and institutional mechanisms for a Single European Market. U.S. public support may depend on the goal of identical or comparable legislation development. Stakeholders are concerned about loss of regulatory autonomy with deeper integration. The United States and EU have pursued policy initiatives to reduce regulatory barriers over the past 15 years, with mixed results. Stronger regulatory cooperation may be desirable, and past efforts, starting with the Transatlantic Declaration in 1990, could be assessed. High-level summits were held to focus on cooperative activities. At high-level summits, the United States and EU adopted the New Transatlantic Agenda in 1995 to enhance regulatory cooperation. This included establishing dialogues like the Transatlantic Business Dialogue and focusing on converging regulatory systems. In 1998, MRAs were negotiated in sectors such as electrical equipment, pharmaceutical products, telecommunications, and information technology. The Transatlantic Economic Partnership (TEP) was established at the 1998 summit in London to improve bilateral economic and trade relations. The TEP set deadlines for regulatory cooperation, mutual recognition, and consumer product safety. At the Bonn Summit in June 1999, a warning system for non-tariff barriers to trade was adopted. The 2000 U.S.-EU Summit in Lisbon established the Consultative Forum on Biotechnology. At the 2000 U.S.-EU Summit in Lisbon, the Consultative Forum on Biotechnology was established to improve communication and understanding on biotechnology concerns. The 2002 summit in Washington reached agreements on Guidelines for Regulatory Cooperation and Transparency, encouraging consultation between U.S. and EU regulatory agencies. In 2004, a Roadmap for EU-U.S. Regulatory Cooperation and Transparency was developed, listing 10 specific projects for regulatory discussion. The 2005 EU-U.S. Summit produced a second Roadmap for EU-U.S. Regulatory Cooperation. The 2005 EU-U.S. Summit expanded the list of sector-specific projects to 15 and established two new dialogues. One dialogue focused on transparency and methodologies for impact and risk assessment, while the other created a High-Level Regulatory Cooperation Forum. This forum aimed to develop a joint regulatory work plan based on mutual best practices. The cooperation between economic regulators has improved significantly, leading to deeper, broader, and more decentralized collaboration. Cooperation across various sectors, including pharmaceuticals, medical devices, financial services, and marine equipment, has deepened and become more routine through the NTA process and regulatory efforts. The TABD has played a key role in enhancing cooperation between transatlantic businesses and governments. Efforts to align U.S. and EU competition policies have led to significant convergence in standards voluntarily. Significant cost savings for U.S. businesses were achieved through MRAs covering over $50 billion in trade in three sectors. Agreements allowed U.S. and EU testing facilities to recognize each other's standards, saving industries more than $1 billion in testing and certification costs. The 2002 Guidelines for Regulatory Cooperation promoted procedural steps facilitating effective dialogue, including sharing non-public information between regulators. The Roadmap for Regulatory Cooperation now guides consultations and dialogue in 15 different sectors. The U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Agreement, implemented in 2002, allowed U.S. firms to meet EU data privacy requirements for exporting personal data. In 2004, an MRA on marine safety equipment was signed, covering $150-200 million in annual trade. The U.S.-EU High Level Regulatory Cooperation Forum, established in 2005, focuses on developing good regulatory practices. The Financial Markets Regulatory Dialogue made progress on recognizing financial standards, including mutual acceptance of accounting standards by 2009. However, enthusiasm for mutual recognition as a regulatory strategy faded when some agreements failed to become operational by established deadlines. Some analysts believe that mutual recognition agreements (MRAs) between the U.S. and Europe were not implemented due to U.S. reluctance to accept European certifiers. The FDA had doubts about EU member states overseeing pharmaceutical standards, while OSHA refused to allow European labs to certify electrical products for sale in the U.S. The EU's tendency to regulate at the European level but leave enforcement to member states also created obstacles. The Transatlantic Economic Partnership (TEP) was inactive from 1998 to 2004 despite annual summits. Despite recommendations and political declarations, little progress was made from 1998 to 2004. Legislation like REACH and Sarbanes-Oxley created challenges for transatlantic businesses by imposing regulations without considering input from the other side. This lack of cooperation hindered companies in various sectors. The transatlantic regulatory divide persists in the area of chemicals despite two decades of cooperation efforts. Differences in regulations on hormones, GMOs, cosmetics, and chemical substances remain. Past initiatives in sectors like autos and pharmaceuticals have been fragmented and lacked political accountability for success or failure. In evaluating past initiatives for transatlantic regulatory cooperation, key obstacles include the independence of regulatory agencies, lack of resources, and complexity. To promote more effective cooperation, policy options include attracting political support, involving legislators, and developing an institutional architecture. Regulatory cooperation, like mutual recognition, requires domestic regulators to accept foreign counterparts' competency in product testing, but accountability to domestic legislators remains a challenge. Regulators on both sides of the Atlantic are hesitant to transfer authority to foreign bodies, as shown in MRA negotiations. High-level political pressure is often used to push for regulatory reforms that reduce barriers between the US and EU. Successful regulatory cooperation requires resources for meetings and dialogues. Regulatory cooperation requires resources for meetings and dialogues to take place. Stakeholders propose funding mandates for U.S. agencies to participate in transatlantic dialogues. The broad and technical transatlantic regulatory agenda involves various agencies and sectors. The Transatlantic Economic Council (TEC) was established in April 2007 at the U.S.-EU Summit to provide minister-level political guidance for regulatory cooperation and reducing trade barriers. Led by German Chancellor Angela Merkel, European Commission President Barroso, and President Bush, the TEC aims to prioritize issues and enhance regulatory progress. The Transatlantic Economic Council (TEC) was created to foster regulatory cooperation and reduce trade barriers. An advisory group was formed to involve the U.S. Congress and European Parliament in transatlantic regulatory cooperation. The TEC addresses previous shortcomings by including high-level political leadership and stakeholders in the regulatory process. Permanent members of the TEC include EU Commissioners, U.S. Cabinet members, and key officials from both sides. The Transatlantic Economic Council (TEC) includes high-level political leaders from the U.S. and Europe to reduce regulatory barriers and promote cooperation in harmonizing regulatory approaches. The TEC focuses on addressing differences in regulatory processes, sectoral barriers, and disputes to enhance transatlantic trade relations. The Transatlantic Economic Council (TEC) aims to reduce barriers to transatlantic economic integration by harmonizing regulatory processes and addressing sector-specific regulations. This involves reforming regulatory processes, promoting sector-by-sector cooperation, and examining specific projects to enhance transatlantic trade relations. The Transatlantic Economic Council (TEC) was established to reduce barriers to transatlantic economic integration by harmonizing regulatory processes and addressing sector-specific regulations. Initially focused on resolving trade disputes, the TEC shifted its efforts towards aligning regulations and standards in emerging technologies like nanotechnology and electric cars. The council's work program now focuses on sectors where regulatory cooperation can prevent unintended trade barriers. The TEC meeting focused on developing compatible regulatory approaches in new sectors to avoid trade disputes. Specific sectors like electronic health records, energy-saving products, and electric vehicles were highlighted for regulatory cooperation to reduce costs and barriers to exports. An Innovation Action Plan was launched to promote innovation and emerging technologies. The TEC meeting endorsed a work plan for e-mobility and electric vehicles, noting steps taken to develop a transatlantic market. Regulatory cooperation remains challenging due to differences in approaches. Transatlantic regulatory cooperation has mainly involved executive branches and regulatory agencies, with limited involvement from Congress or the European Parliament. Congress and the European Parliament have limited involvement in transatlantic regulatory cooperation. Congress has mainly focused on oversight hearings and introducing resolutions, with occasional actions that both hinder and support regulatory cooperation. For example, some members expressed concerns in the late 1990s about international agreements potentially lowering American health and safety standards. U.S. regulators hesitant to join MRA negotiations, but Congress passed legislation directing FDA to support Commerce and USTR in implementing MRAs. The inclusion of MRA language in the FDA Modernization Act of 1997 was seen as a crucial step. Congress could have a more significant role in regulatory cooperation if it chose to be more involved. Congress has the power to mandate U.S. regulators to cooperate in transatlantic initiatives and provide necessary resources. It can also influence regulatory actions by prioritizing safety and health concerns. Congress could play a bigger role in preventing new legislation from creating transatlantic regulatory barriers. Currently, the transatlantic impact is not considered during the legislative process. The U.S.-EU summits have called for a more institutionalized process to make Congress aware of the impact of new legislation on transatlantic trade. Various congressional committees have jurisdiction over issues related to transatlantic regulatory cooperation. This includes committees such as Energy and Commerce, Transportation, Judiciary, Agriculture, Commerce, Science, and Transportation, among others. Currently, Congress lacks formal institutional links for oversight of transatlantic relations, with key committees like Senate Foreign Relations and House Foreign Affairs not involved. The Transatlantic Legislators Dialogue serves as an advisor to the Transatlantic Economic Council (TEC), but questions remain about its effectiveness. This raises the question of whether Congress should be an advisor or a participant in the transatlantic regulatory cooperation process. Congress should play a more proactive role in the transatlantic regulatory cooperation process, potentially participating in the TRC process and U.S.-EU Summits. However, there is uncertainty about developing the necessary mechanisms and mandate for this. Congressional hearings have addressed topics such as mutual recognition agreements on drug prescriptions, data protection directives, and financial services action plans related to transatlantic regulatory dialogue. The U.S.-EU regulatory dialogue and cooperation on emerging technologies have been discussed in various Congressional hearings, highlighting the importance of transatlantic relations and the need for continued dialogue between the U.S. and Europe. Congressional involvement in the regulatory cooperation process is seen as crucial, but there is uncertainty about the mechanisms and mandate for this. The U.S.-EU regulatory cooperation on emerging technologies has been discussed in Congressional hearings, emphasizing the importance of transatlantic relations. Congressional involvement in the process is crucial, but there is uncertainty about the mechanisms and mandate for this. The appendix provides details on U.S.-EU regulatory cooperation by sector, U.S. regulatory agency, and committee oversight."
