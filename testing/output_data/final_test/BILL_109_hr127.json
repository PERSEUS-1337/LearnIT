Congress finds that approximately 3,000,000 reports of child abuse and neglect are investigated each year, with 1,000,000 confirmed cases requiring ongoing intervention. Over 500,000 children are served outside their homes by the child welfare system, in foster homes and residential programs. The child welfare workforce crisis is attributed to low unemployment levels and increasing numbers of children and families. The child welfare workforce is facing a crisis due to increasing demand for services, low pay, and difficult working conditions. Vacancy rates in State agencies are at 8.1% and 14.3% in private agencies. Turnover rates have doubled since 1991, reaching 13.9% in public agencies and 46.5% in private agencies. This crisis is compromising the system's ability to provide essential services and is expected to worsen over the next decade. The child welfare workforce is in crisis due to high demand, low pay, and tough conditions. Steps are needed to attract more workers and improve salaries, working conditions, and training to address the worsening situation over the next decade. Loan forgiveness for child welfare workers is being addressed in an amendment to the Higher Education Act of 1965. This is aimed at improving the situation of the child welfare workforce, which is currently facing challenges such as high demand, low pay, and tough working conditions. The purpose of this section is to attract and retain highly trained individuals in the child welfare profession. Definitions for child welfare services, child welfare agency, and institution of higher education are provided. The Secretary may carry out a demonstration program to assume the obligation to repay a loan for new borrowers who obtain a bachelor's or master's degree in social work and work in child welfare services. The Secretary may provide loan repayment for social workers in child welfare services who have worked full time for 2 consecutive years. Repayment is on a first-come, first-served basis, with priority given to previous recipients. The Secretary will post information on loan availability on a Department website. The Secretary will repay 20 percent of loans after three years of employment. Regulations may be prescribed as necessary. After the fourth consecutive year of employment, 30 percent of total loans will be repaid, and after the fifth consecutive year, 50 percent will be repaid. This section does not allow for the refunding of any loan repayments. If the Secretary repays a portion of a loan, they will also repay the accrued interest for that year. The Secretary can repay loans for up to 2 academic years for borrowers returning to higher education for a degree. Loans are only repaid for eligible borrowers as per the section's provisions. No student borrower can receive benefits under both this section and another section of the National and Community Service Act of 1990. The Secretary will repay eligible lenders for loans subject to repayment each fiscal year. Eligible individuals must submit an application for loan repayment after completing each year. The borrower receives forbearance during qualifying employment, with an independent evaluation conducted on the impact of the loan forgiveness program on child welfare workers' education. The loan forgiveness program for child welfare workers is evaluated on its impact on job retention, experience, quality of workers, and performance outcomes of child welfare services. The evaluation of the loan forgiveness program for child welfare workers focuses on performance outcomes in child welfare services, including child well-being, permanency, and safety. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will submit interim and final evaluation reports to the President and Congress, with a final report due by September 30, 2005. $20,000,000 is authorized for fiscal year 2006, with additional funding for the following 4 years."
