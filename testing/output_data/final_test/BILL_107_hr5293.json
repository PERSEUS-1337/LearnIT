    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Still Saving Women's Lives Act of 2002\". The Congress finds that the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) plays a crucial role in global population stabilization, women's health, and HIV/AIDS prevention. UNFPA focuses on maternal and child health programs, family planning services, contraception supply, and enhancing women's status. The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) aims to enhance women's status by improving access to contraceptive services and reducing deaths and injuries from unsafe abortions. The US contribution to UNFPA provided contraception to 870,000 women, preventing unintended pregnancies, abortions, and maternal and child deaths. UNFPA also helps countries plan for and slow rapid population growth to address global environmental problems. The UNFPA assists countries in planning for and slowing population growth to reduce its impact on the environment. The organization upholds the right of individuals to decide on the number and spacing of their children, opposing coercion in any form. It ensures that its programs align with human rights principles and addresses concerns about population policies, such as those in China, in a diplomatic manner. The UNFPA plays a constructive role in reducing coercive practices in China through its successful country program, promoting voluntary family planning and informed consent. It improves contraceptive choices, expands reproductive health services, and enhances women's status to implement a human rights approach. The United States Government provided financial support to UNFPA for fiscal years 2001 and 2002, with additional funding pledged in 2001 to address reproductive health care needs of Afghan refugees. In fiscal year 2002, Congress showed bipartisan support for a $34,000,000 voluntary contribution to UNFPA, which the President chose not to use. In February 2002, Representatives urged the President to investigate UNFPA programs in China. In May 2002, a delegation was sent by the President, including Ambassador William A. Brown, to address the issue. The independent team, including Ambassador William A. Brown, investigated UNFPA programs in China and found no evidence of coercive abortion practices. They recommended releasing $34,000,000 to UNFPA, but the Administration overruled this decision. The Administration overruled its delegation's recommendation and cut funding for UNFPA based on a broad interpretation of the law, prompting the introduction of this bill in response. The bill amends the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to require funds for voluntary contributions to the UNFPA to be obligated and expended within 30 days unless the President certifies that the UNFPA performs coercive abortions or involuntary sterilizations. The President's certification authority cannot be delegated. Authorization of $50,000,000 for US voluntary contributions to UNFPA in fiscal year 2003."
