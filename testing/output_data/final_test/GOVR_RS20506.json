It provides training in U.S. Defense Department schools to military students from allied and friendly nations on a grant basis. Students are taught military skills, exposed to American military procedures, and learn about democratic values and human rights. Through the IMET program, the United States trains military students from allied and friendly nations to enhance their capabilities and strengthen regional relationships. Over 10,000 students from approximately 130 countries are trained annually, with a focus on professionalizing foreign armed forces and promoting civilian control over the military. The IMET program trains military students from 130 countries in the United States through formal instruction involving over 2,000 courses. Other activities include orientation tours, observer training, and on-the-job training. The United States Coast Guard provides education in maritime skills. Additionally, senior military and civilian officials attend Service War Colleges and the National War College programs focusing on security policy and defense programs. The Services and the Joint Staff invite foreign governments to send students for training at senior service schools in the US. These schools include NDU, Army War College, Navy War College, and Air War College. The US military offers various professional training programs, such as Service Command and Staff College programs, accounting for 50% of the annual IMET appropriation. Approximately 50% of the annual IMET appropriation is used for professional training programs at senior service schools in the US, including Army Command and Staff College, Army Logistics Management College, U.S. Army Infantry School, and Air Force Institute of Technology. English language proficiency is required for IMET sponsored training, with the Defense Language Institute English Language Center (DLIELC) providing resident English language training at Lackland Air Force Base, TX. The Foreign Operations Appropriations Act for FY1991 directed the Defense Department to establish a program within IMET focused on training foreign civilian and military officials in managing military establishments and budgets, creating effective military judicial systems. The Foreign Operations Appropriations Act for FY1991 directed the Defense Department to establish a program within IMET focused on training foreign civilian and military officials in managing military establishments and budgets, creating effective military judicial systems, and fostering civilian control of the military. Congress earmarked $1 million for the program, known as Expanded IMET (E-IMET), which has been broadened each year. Although funding was not earmarked after FY1991, Congress expects increased investment in E-IMET. The program now includes participation by national legislators and individuals not in government, funded as part of the annual IMET appropriation. The E-IMET initiative, funded as part of the annual IMET appropriation, includes educational programs in the United States for foreign civilian and military officials. It emphasizes longer training experiences in the U.S to maximize exposure to American life. The program was launched in FY1991 by the Defense Department, offering new courses and refining existing programs through the military departments. The E-IMET initiative, funded as part of the annual IMET appropriation, includes educational programs in the United States for foreign civilian and military officials. New educational programs were established to address military justice, human rights, and civil-military relations. This effort is mainly carried out through three schools: Defense Resource Management Institute, Naval Postgraduate School (NPS), Monterey, CA; Center for Civil-Military Relations, Naval Postgraduate School, Monterey, CA; and the Naval Justice School, Newport, RI. The Defense Resource Management Institute at NPS in Monterey, CA, reactivated a two-week Mobile Education Team and developed two resident programs within the U.S. - the 11-week International Defense Management Course and the four-week program. The Naval Justice School, under Defense Department guidance, established a program on military justice and human rights, leading to the passage of a rewritten military code by Albania in 1995. The Center for Civil-Military Relations at the Naval Postgraduate School offers graduate level educational programs and research on civil-military relations. The Center for Civil-Military Relations offers graduate level educational programs and research on civil-military relations, including a one week seminar attended by key officials and a one year accelerated graduate degree program. Other E-IMET programs cover topics such as equal opportunity, financial management, and maritime law, with recent additions in environmental military law and resource management. U.S. military assistance funding has decreased post-Cold War, but the IMET program is seen as a valuable tool for American foreign policy. IMET provides professional military training to allies, enhancing their self-defense capabilities and reducing the need for U.S. military intervention. Advocates call for increased funding to expand the program to more nations. Critics argue that IMET, a military training program, is outdated and minimally effective in promoting U.S. interests. They believe that training in human rights and democratic values is superficial and should focus more on these aspects. Some suggest reducing or eliminating elements that strengthen anti-democratic military forces and associate the U.S. with their practices. The funding for the IMET program has significantly increased since FY1995, reaching an estimated $91.7 million for FY2004. This increase is seen as necessary to meet training requirements for emerging democracies globally. Critics argue that the program should focus more on training in human rights and democratic values to be more effective in promoting U.S. interests. The funding for the IMET program has increased due to inflation, growing requirements in Central Europe and the Newly Independent States, and the popularity of Expanded IMET. There has been a shift towards professional military education programs and English language training, with a reduction in technical training. This raises the question of whether more resources and funds should be allocated. The current issue revolves around the debate on allocating more resources and funds for technical training, particularly in light of advancing policy goals in NATO enlargement and enhancing IMET participants' capabilities for international peacekeeping operations. However, providing additional funding for IMET may come at the expense of other programs due to budget constraints. Concerns over human rights practices have led to restrictions on certain nations' participation in the IMET program, such as Indonesia requiring certifications from the President before receiving funds. The IMET program is crucial for US military contact with countries with human rights violations or undemocratic governments. It is a key tool for Congress to sanction nations for human rights abuses. IMET could also help change military-dominated governments towards democracy. The current debate is whether IMET restrictions can effectively sanction nations with poor human rights records. The debate revolves around whether IMET restrictions can effectively sanction nations with poor human rights records."
