While likelihood-based training produces high-quality models, decoding methods like beam search often result in bland or repetitive output. Nucleus Sampling is proposed as a solution to this issue, drawing higher quality text by sampling from the most probable tokens and avoiding text degeneration. The comparison of maximization-based and stochastic decoding methods for text generation reveals that maximization is not suitable for open-ended text generation. The best language models have unreliable tail distributions that need to be truncated during generation. Nucleus Sampling is identified as the optimal strategy for generating high-quality and diverse long-form text. OpenAI's GPT-2 model produced top-quality text through randomness in decoding methods like top-k sampling. Decoding methods like top-k sampling, as opposed to maximizing likelihood, produce more diverse and high-quality text. Even state-of-the-art models like GPT-2-117M show degenerate results with strategies like beam search. Pure sampling from model probabilities results in incoherent text. In this work, the unreliable tail of candidate tokens with low probability is identified as the reason for incoherent text generated by pure sampling. Nucleus Sampling is introduced as a solution, focusing on sampling from the top-p portion of the probability mass to improve text quality. Nucleus Sampling is introduced as a solution to improve text quality by sampling from the top-p portion of the probability mass, addressing issues with diversity and coherence in generated text. Nucleus Sampling is found to be the best overall decoding strategy, as demonstrated by Human Unified with Statistical Evaluation (HUSE). It addresses incoherency issues and offers a balance between quality and diversity in generated text. Previous works have highlighted the limitations of generation by maximization, emphasizing the importance of diversity in output. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have been a prominent research direction, but recent work has shown that GAN-generated text fails to outperform language models in terms of quality and diversity. Neural dialog systems have proposed methods for diverse beam search, but choosing an appropriate decoding strategy remains crucial. Nucleus Sampling is believed to offer complementary advantages in text generation tasks. An unprecedented number of mostly young whales have become stranded on the West Australian coast since 2008 due to poor nutrition, leading to a rise in stranded humpback whales. Carly Holyoake from Murdoch University highlighted this issue at a veterinary conference in Perth. Additionally, there has been an increase in calves caught in whaling nets, making pilot whales vulnerable during migration to feeding grounds. The decline in wild populations has made pilot whales vulnerable during migration to feeding grounds. The size of the Petrels is shrinking, and dwindling populations mean there will only be room for a few new fowl. Pumping Station #3 shut down due to construction damage. In the top 10 killer whale catastrophes in history, up to 12 orcas were struck by lightning in 1986, leading to many deaths and injuries. Last week's storms and cyclones caused the deaths of at least nine large fin whales near Whitsundays, the largest loss of any species globally. The Australian Food Safety Authority warns of revitalized beaches due to healthy seabirds and seals on the move. Over 50,000 seabirds, sea mammals, and seahorses swept into the sea by ships. A white-bat and umidauda migration with 50,000 estimated numbers across Australia. The number of stranded whales on the West Australian coast has increased by over 50% in the past year. The fate of a stranded whale on the West Australian coast was confirmed when it was found by fishermen off the coast of Bundaberg. Experts believe the whale was struck by a fishing vessel and died after being sucked into the ocean. Directed generation tasks involve using encoder-decoder architectures with attention mechanisms or Transformer models. Beam search is commonly used for generation, but issues can arise with large beam sizes. Open-ended generation, such as conditional story generation, has shown promise with advancements in neural language models. Open-ended text generation involves generating coherent text continuations from a given context, allowing for a considerable degree of freedom in output generation. The probability of a repeated phrase increases with each repetition, creating a positive feedback loop. This effect holds true for most phrases tested, regardless of length or source. The task of open-ended text generation involves generating coherent text continuations from a given context. Models use maximization-based decoding strategies like beam search to find the continuation with the highest likelihood. Nucleus Sampling is a new stochastic decoding method proposed as an alternative to maximization-based decoding for open-ended text generation. It involves selecting tokens based on the shape of the probability distribution, adjusting the sampling set dynamically, and sampling from a re-scaled distribution. This method aims to improve the quality of generated text compared to traditional decoding strategies like beam search. For high values of p, a small subset of vocabulary, known as the nucleus, holds most of the probability mass. Flat distributions result in many moderately probable tokens, while peaked distributions concentrate probability mass into a few tokens. Top-k Sampling, a popular alternative sampling procedure, samples from truncated Neural LM distributions. Nucleus Sampling and top-k differ in where they truncate the distribution, determining the trustworthy prediction zone for the generative model. Top-k sampling involves sampling the top k possible next tokens based on their relative probabilities. The choice of k can vary across contexts, as the distribution of probabilities may differ. This method leads to higher quality text compared to beam search or sampling from the full distribution. Under Nucleus Sampling, the number of candidates considered dynamically changes based on the model's confidence region over the vocabulary, addressing issues of bland or inappropriate text generation. Temperature sampling, another common approach, shapes the probability distribution for text generation by adjusting the softmax function based on temperature values. In text generation, adjusting the softmax function with temperature values can skew the distribution towards high probability events. Lowering the temperature can improve generation quality but reduce diversity. The Generative Pre-trained Transformer has been successful in large-scale training setups and was trained on a 40GB collection of text from the web. The study involves analyzing text passages generated using a Large model with 762M parameters. The evaluation includes computing perplexity using different decoding strategies and comparing it to the gold text. The goal is to generate text with a perplexity close to that of the gold text to avoid low-diversity and repetition loops. The study analyzes text passages generated by a Large model with 762M parameters. The perplexity of text obtained from pure sampling is worse than the gold text, indicating the model is confusing itself. Nucleus Sampling shows closer perplexity results in both conditional and under conditional cases compared to other methods.

The perplexity of text obtained from pure sampling is worse than the gold text, indicating the model is confusing itself. Nucleus Sampling shows closer perplexity results in both conditional and under conditional cases compared to other methods. Beam search has failed to find higher probability text than the decoded ones, with natural language rarely remaining in a high probability zone for multiple consecutive time steps. Language tends to veer into lower-probability but more informative tokens, avoiding repetition loops despite the model assigning high probability to them.

We conjecture that the predictability of words in human language is an intrinsic property, making it challenging for models to capture this effect. Training larger models or improving neural architectures using standard per-word learning objectives may not solve this problem, as blindly predicting the future will lead to predicting the lowest common denominator rather than information-rich language. Zipf's law suggests an exponential relationship between word rank and frequency in text, with the Zipfian coefficient s used for comparison. The Zipfian coefficient s is used to compare word distribution in text to an exponential curve. Pure sampling overestimates rare words, leading to higher perplexity. Lower temperature sampling avoids rare words, improving diversity. Self-BLEU is computed as a metric of diversity in generated documents. Self-BLEU is a metric for diversity in generated documents, with lower scores indicating higher diversity. Nucleus Sampling and top-k sampling show the least repetition, while temperature sampling requires very high temperatures to reduce repetition, affecting coherence negatively. Stochastic methods face repetition issues when tuning parameters are set too low. Nucleus Sampling is the only method that meets all distributional criteria for desirable text generation. Human evaluation is necessary to fully assess text quality, as statistical evaluations may not capture coherence accurately. HUSE combines human and statistical evaluation by training a discriminator to distinguish between human and model text distributions. Self-BLEU scores show diversity in unconditional generations by stochastic decoding methods. Common values of t and k result in high self-similarity, while \"normal\" values of p match human text distribution. Nucleus sampling aligns closely with human distribution. Low temperatures affect repetition. Nucleus Sampling obtains the highest HUSE score in qualitative analysis, with Top-k sampling performing next best. Beam Search gets stuck in repetition loops, while full sampling output is hard to understand, even inventing new words. Nucleus Sampling's generation isn't perfect, as the model gets confused at times. The paper provides a deep analysis of common decoding methods for language generation. Likelihood maximizing decoding leads to repetition and generic language use, while sampling methods risk low-confidence predictions. Nucleus Sampling is proposed as an effective solution, capturing the model's confidence region. Future work aims to characterize this region dynamically and enhance the decoding process with a semantic utility function.
