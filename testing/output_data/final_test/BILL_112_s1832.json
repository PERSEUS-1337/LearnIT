    "content": "The \"Marketplace Fairness Act\" allows States to enforce sales and use tax laws equally, regardless of the sales transaction method. States have the right to collect taxes owed under State law. The \"Marketplace Fairness Act\" allows Member States under the Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement to require all sellers not qualifying for a small seller exception to collect and remit sales and use taxes for remote sales sourced to that State. Non-Member States can also enforce tax collection if they adopt minimum simplification requirements. The \"Marketplace Fairness Act\" allows Member States to require sellers to collect and remit sales taxes for remote sales. Non-Member States can enforce tax collection by adopting minimum simplification requirements, including a single State-level agency for tax administration. The \"Marketplace Fairness Act\" allows states to require remote sellers to use a single sales and use tax return, ensuring a uniform tax base and collection of taxes based on destination rates. Software and services are provided to assist sellers in tax compliance. The \"Marketplace Fairness Act\" requires remote sellers to use a single sales tax rate for sales sourced to the State, with certification procedures for providers and liability protection for sellers. The \"Marketplace Fairness Act\" requires remote sellers to use a single sales tax rate for sales sourced to the State, with liability protection for sellers who rely on State-provided information and 30 days notice of rate changes by localities. Local rate changes are effective on the first day of a calendar quarter, and failure to provide notice holds the seller harmless for collecting tax at the previous rate. The \"Marketplace Fairness Act\" requires remote sellers to use a single sales tax rate for sales sourced to the State, with liability protection for sellers who rely on State-provided information and 30 days notice of rate changes by localities. A State can require a remote seller with over $500,000 in total remote sales in the previous year to collect sales tax. Sales of related persons must be aggregated to determine the threshold. The authority granted by the \"Marketplace Fairness Act\" will terminate when the highest court determines the State no longer meets the Act's requirements, with no further appeal. The \"Marketplace Fairness Act\" does not subject sellers to various taxes other than sales and use taxes, does not affect tax application, and does not change state authority on taxes. It also does not impact nexus determination for taxes other than sales and use taxes, and does not restrict states from licensing or regulating businesses. The \"Marketplace Fairness Act\" prohibits requiring qualification for intrastate business, imposing unrelated State taxes, or exercising authority over interstate commerce. It does not encourage new taxes and only applies to remote sales, not intrastate sales. States must comply with intrastate provisions of the Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement. SEC. 6. DEFINITIONS AND SPECIAL RULES. In this Act, a \"consolidated provider\" is defined as a person certified by a State with rights and responsibilities for sales and use tax administration. \"Locality\" and \"local\" refer to any political subdivision of a State. A \"Member State\" is defined as a state under the Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement, excluding associate members. The Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement defines terms like \"person,\" \"remote sale,\" \"remote seller,\" and \"single provider\" in relation to sales and use tax administration. The Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement defines terms related to sales tax administration, including the sourcing of remote sales based on delivery instructions provided by the purchaser or the customer's address known to the seller. The Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement dictates that remote sales are sourced to the seller's address. States granted authority must adhere to the Agreement's sourcing provisions. SEC. 7. SEVERABILITY. If any provision of this Act is deemed unconstitutional, the rest of the Act remains unaffected."
