    "content": "In the United States, there are approximately 9,000 local election jurisdictions, which can be counties, major cities, or small townships. The number of registered voters and polling places varies greatly, with a median of about 12,000 in 2006 and 13,000 in 2008. Around two-thirds of jurisdictions reported an increase in registered voters from 2004 to 2008. Between 2004 and 2008, the number of polling places in local election jurisdictions varied greatly, with about 15% having only one polling place and a similar percentage having more than 50. The number of election personnel also varied significantly, with some jurisdictions having none and others having more than 10,000, including pollworkers. County jurisdictions had about 10 times more registered voters, polling places, and pollworkers compared to townships. Counties reported an average of about 56,000 registered voters, while townships averaged 6,000. Counties had about 40 polling places on average, while townships had 3. On average, there are 40 polling places per county and 3 per township. Counties have about 290 pollworkers and townships have 30. The typical Local Election Official (LEO) is a white woman between 50 and 60 years old, a high school graduate, elected to office, works full-time in election administration for about 10 years, earns under $60,000 per year, and belongs to a state-level professional organization. About one-quarter of LEOs are men and 5% belong to minority groups. The demographic profile of Local Election Officials (LEOs) is diverse, with about one-quarter being men, 5% belonging to minority groups, 40% being college graduates, and 10% having graduate degrees. LEOs range in age from under 25 to over 80, with varying years of service and salaries. Most LEOs are elected rather than appointed, and many belong to professional organizations. This demographic profile sets LEOs apart from other local government employees, with unique characteristics and representation. The demographic profile of Local Election Officials (LEOs) is diverse, with about one-quarter being men, 5% belonging to minority groups, 40% being college graduates, and 10% having graduate degrees. LEOs range in age from under 25 to over 80, with varying years of service and salaries. Most LEOs are elected rather than appointed, and many belong to professional organizations. The average tenure in the current position declined by about one year from 2004 to 2008, with a small increase in job turnover. Other trends included a decrease in the proportion of elected LEOs, an increase in full-time workers, higher salaries, and a decrease in conservative ideology. The survey found changes in election administration, with more officials working full-time and spending increased hours on election duties. The complexity of elections and federal reforms have highlighted the importance of professionalism in election administration. Newer election officials are expected to have more formal education compared to those with longer tenure. The survey revealed a statistical association between education level and years of service among election officials. Those with graduate degrees averaged 8-9 years of service, while those without a college degree averaged 11-12 years. Reported salaries of election officials increased by about 7% per year from 2004 to 2008. Officials in jurisdictions with more voters tended to have higher salaries and education levels, and were more likely to be male. The survey found that salaries for LEOs varied based on jurisdiction size, with $40-50,000 for smaller jurisdictions and $50,000-$60,000 for larger ones. Education levels also differed, with over 20% of LEOs in larger jurisdictions having attended graduate school compared to 10% in smaller ones. Additionally, the survey looked at LEOs' membership in professional associations, revealing that about 40% belonged to national or international associations, while more than half were only members of state or regional associations. In 2006, LEOs reported varying percentages of having a written job description based on whether they were elected or appointed. They have diverse election-administration responsibilities beyond just running elections, including budgeting and personnel. Initial training for LEOs was typically less than 20 hours, with only one-fifth required to pass an examination. Most LEOs believed their training was effective in improving their effectiveness and problem-solving abilities. The survey results showed that most election officials believed that training and experience are equally important for a successful election. Factors such as HAVA requirements, public attention to election administration problems, and concerns about voting system reliability may have influenced their views. Respondents suggested more training in technical and legal aspects of elections, as well as more hands-on training. Additionally, the surveys asked about election officials' attitudes toward technology. In 2004, a majority of jurisdictions used traditional voting systems like lever machines, punchcards, hand-counted paper ballots, or central-count optical scan (CCOS). By 2008, there was a significant decrease in the use of lever machines, paper ballots, CCOS, and punchcards. The use of central-count optical scan (CCOS) decreased initially but then increased again by 2008. On the other hand, the use of PCOS and DREs increased substantially from 2004 to 2008. From 2006 to 2008, there was a 5% increase in PCOS and a decrease in DREs, which was not statistically significant. The trends align with HAVA requirements for improved usability in voting systems. The rise in CCOS usage during this period contradicts expectations, as CCOS does not assist voters in preventing errors. Possible reasons for this increase include the rise in \"no-excuse\" absentee voting and concerns about the security of DREs leading to paper-ballot requirements. The average length of time jurisdictions have been using different voting systems varies greatly. Jurisdictions with hand-counted paper ballots have used them for 80 to 100 years, while those with DREs have had them for under 10 years on average. The reluctance to change voting systems creates stability but may lead to using outdated technology for too long, increasing risks. The risks of negative consequences associated with outdated voting technology, such as punchcard systems, were highlighted in the 2000 presidential election. Factors like legal and budget constraints may impede jurisdictions from adopting improvements in voting technology. In 2008, election officials were surveyed about the voting systems used to meet accessibility requirements, including electronic ballot marking devices and DREs. Accessible voting systems used in jurisdictions varied depending on the primary voting system. Approximately 40% used DREs, 37% used BMDs, and 12% used vote-by-phone systems. Most jurisdictions had one accessible machine per polling place, with some using two. Most LEOs reported having one accessible machine per polling place, with some using two or three. They noted that voters without disabilities used accessible machines less than other machines, especially in jurisdictions using DREs. Concerns have been raised about limiting accessible voting systems to voters with disabilities, as it could compromise ballot secrecy. LEOs play a significant role in deciding on voting systems, with input from various stakeholders. LEOs play a significant role in deciding on voting systems, with input from various stakeholders. The survey asked LEOs about the influence of stakeholders on decision-making, with local elected officials being the most influential according to the results. Other stakeholders like state election officials and the public were viewed neutrally, while nonelected officials and professional associations were not seen as needing greater influence. In 2004, LEOs were neutral about media, political parties, and advocacy groups' influence. By 2008, they believed these groups had too much influence. Vendor influence was also seen as too high in 2006 and 2008. LEOs were less convinced in 2008 that professionals and experts should not have greater influence. Cost was considered to have too much influence on selecting voting systems in 2008. Support for greater influence by local elected officials is higher among elected LEOs compared to appointed LEOs. Elected LEOs also show more support for state elected officials and the public, while being less supportive of unelected officials and the federal government. Local officials have well-known concerns about federal government influence in various areas, including election administration. Local officials have concerns about federal influence in election administration, including the impact of HAVA requirements on voting systems. There is also debate about the influence of stakeholders like the media, advocates, and voting system vendors in the selection process. The 2004 survey showed that while LEOs had high trust in vendors, they did not consider them highly influential in decisions about voting systems. Some believed there was insufficient oversight by local governments, but most jurisdictions had interacted with their voting-system vendors in the last four years. In a 2004 survey, Local Election Officials (LEOs) had high trust in voting system vendors, with over 90% considering them responsive and of high quality. However, some LEOs believed vendors prioritized profit over security. LEOs relied heavily on state election officials for information on voting systems, followed by other election officials, the Election Assistance Commission (EAC), and advocates for the disabled. About one-third of LEOs also relied on vendors for information. In a 2004 survey, Local Election Officials (LEOs) had high trust in voting system vendors, with over 90% considering them responsive and of high quality. LEOs relied heavily on state election officials for information on voting systems, followed by other election officials, the Election Assistance Commission (EAC), and advocates for the disabled. When asked about the influence different actors had on decisions about voting systems, LEOs rated state, local, and federal officials as the most influential, with political parties and the media rated the least influential. Voters and advocates for the disabled were considered more influential on average than vendors. LEOs believed local elected officials should have more influence, federal government has too much, and were neutral about state officials. They had strong opinions on voting systems, supporting the system used in their jurisdiction the most. Lever machine users strongly supported their use, while being neutral about DREs and optical scan systems, and opposed to punchcard and hand-counted systems. LEOs had strong opinions on voting systems, supporting the system used in their jurisdiction the most. Support for DREs declined among nonusers, while users showed a slight decrease in support from 2004 to 2006. In 2008, LEOs were asked about their support for vote-by-phone systems, with three-quarters opposing their use. In states using such systems, about half of LEOs opposed them. Overall, LEOs reported high satisfaction with their voting systems and rated their performance well. In 2008, LEOs rated satisfaction and performance of voting systems highly, with DREs receiving lower ratings than in 2004. Satisfaction with accessible voting systems was lower than primary voting systems, with DRE users being the most satisfied. In 2008, LEOs rated satisfaction and performance of voting systems highly, with DREs receiving lower ratings than in 2004. Users of DREs were the most satisfied, but LEOs who used DRE as their primary voting system were less satisfied with its accessibility performance. Satisfaction with PCOS systems was slightly higher overall than CCOS or DRE systems. No significant differences in rated performance of different voting systems were found in the surveys. In 2008, LEOs were asked to rank voting systems in order of preference. The current voting system used in the jurisdiction was the top preference for about three-quarters of LEOs, while Internet voting was the least preferred. PCOS users preferred CCOS as their second choice, and CCOS users preferred PCOS as their second choice. The surveys asked LEOs to rank their primary voting systems based on specific characteristics. Ratings for accuracy, security, reliability, and usability remained high across different voting systems. However, LEOs were less satisfied with the performance of their voting systems in 2006 and 2008 compared to 2004, especially with optical scan and DRE systems. In 2006 and 2008, LEOs rated optical scan and DRE systems lower for cost, size, storage, and machine error compared to 2004. Optical scan systems were rated higher for accessibility in 2006 and 2008. DREs received the highest ratings for accessibility and multilingual use, while hand-counted paper ballots were rated lowest for counting speed. Ratings for reliability, security, accuracy, and ease of use were high and similar for all voting systems. The ratings for reliability, security, accuracy, and ease of use were high and similar for all voting systems, despite expectations based on media reports and past election issues. Punchcards were not rated lower in accuracy, possibly due to their decreased usage since the 2000 presidential election. Despite negative media coverage of system limitations, election officials opted not to participate in the punchcard buyout program offered through HAVA. The ratings for acquisition and maintenance costs, size, and storage requirements of optical scan and DRE systems were similar, contradicting widely held views. DREs are often considered the most expensive voting systems due to needing multiple machines per polling place, while optical scan systems usually require only one machine or none. These discrepancies suggest that election officials' perceptions of voting systems may differ from media portrayals and activist views. If officials' perceptions are accurate, acting on criticisms of specific voting systems could be unnecessary and counterproductive. The recent controversy surrounding election reform has mainly focused on electronic voting systems. Public concerns about the security and reliability of these systems increased sharply after 2003, influenced by the provisions of HAVA. The survey data does not provide a clear assessment of the accuracy of election officials' perceptions regarding the security of voting systems. If officials' perceptions are accurate, implementing regulations based on criticisms of specific voting systems may be unnecessary and counterproductive. The controversy surrounding electronic voting systems, particularly DREs, was widely publicized due to security vulnerabilities highlighted in studies from 2003. A survey in 2006 found that most election officials believed current federal and state guidelines on electronic voting systems were at the right level of strictness, with some officials feeling they were either too strict or not strict enough. There was no significant difference in opinion between users and nonusers of electronic voting systems. Nonusers were slightly more likely than users to believe that the standards for electronic voting systems were either too strict or not strict enough. LEOs were asked about their agreement with statements regarding DRE and optical scan systems, with nonusers generally having less strong opinions compared to users. Nonusers were neutral on average regarding statements about DREs, including knowledge level, vulnerability to tampering, and the need for more public trust. Users of DREs had stronger opinions compared to users of other voting systems. Users of DREs generally agreed they had sufficient knowledge about the system, certification procedures were adequate, DREs are not vulnerable to tampering, security concerns can be addressed, public should trust DREs more, and media reports too many criticisms. Nonusers had less strong opinions about optical scan systems. User beliefs about the media were neutral in 2006 but in 2008, they believed the media were overly critical. LEOs using DREs were less neutral about OS systems than users of other systems. The controversy surrounding the security and reliability of DREs has led to calls for voter-verified paper audit trails. The percentage of LEOs using DREs and implementing VVPAT increased from 18% in 2004 to 46% in 2008. In 2008, 44% of LEOs allowed voters to use a paper ballot instead of a DRE. In 2008, concerns about the auditability of ballots recorded on DREs led to questions about accuracy in close elections. Some LEOs switched from DREs to other systems, citing state mandates and the lack of a paper ballot. Non-DRE users were more supportive of a VVPAT requirement compared to DRE users. In 2004 and 2008, LEOs' views on VVPAT requirement varied among DRE users. Support for VVPAT increased among DRE users from one in five in 2004 to one in three in 2008. LEOs using DREs with VVPAT were more supportive. In 2006 and 2008, about 60% of LEOs were willing to use VVPAT if reimbursed. However, most respondents were only willing to spend $300 or less for the feature. In 2004 and 2008, LEOs' views on VVPAT requirement varied among DRE users. Support for VVPAT increased among DRE users from one in five in 2004 to one in three in 2008. LEOs using DREs with VVPAT were more supportive. In 2006 and 2008, about 60% of LEOs were willing to use VVPAT if reimbursed, with most willing to spend $300 or less for the feature. DRE users and nonusers differed in their views on the disadvantages and benefits of VVPAT, with DRE users expressing greater concern about disadvantages and less agreement with the advantages. In 2008, DRE users showed more concern about disadvantages and less agreement with advantages compared to nonusers. LEOs with VVPAT experience had fewer concerns about disadvantages and were more likely to see advantages. The majority of LEOs using VVPAT were satisfied with it, with confidence in its accuracy. In 2008, the majority of LEOs had confidence in the accuracy of VVPAT, with fewer expressing concerns. About 90% considered themselves familiar with HAVA's requirements, and believed most jurisdictions were in full compliance. The perception of HAVA's impact varied across surveys, with a decrease in those believing no improvements by more than half in 2008. In 2008, LEOs had varying views on the impact of HAVA on elections. Larger jurisdictions did not necessarily find HAVA more beneficial than smaller ones. The type of voting system used had an effect on how LEOs rated improvements from HAVA. Most LEOs saw the major provisions of HAVA as advantageous, with federal funding being the most supported and the requirement for provisional voting and the creation of the EAC being the least supported. Support for provisional voting and the creation of the EAC declined from 2004 to 2008, with provisional voting receiving the highest negative ratings. Overall, support decreased for seven provisions, including federal funds, error-correction requirements, and accessibility requirements. Despite this, half of LEOs still regarded the creation of the EAC as an advantage in 2008. Support for funding decreased over three elections, possibly due to the decrease in federal funds availability. Controversies about voting system security and reliability may have contributed to the decline in support for voting system provisions. Some provisions saw no significant change, while support for provisional voting increased. Support for HAVA's provisions varied based on the primary voting system used. DRE users showed strong support for accessibility, provisional ballots, and military/overseas voters. Users of different voting systems showed varying levels of support for different HAVA provisions. DRE and PCOS users strongly supported the error correction requirement, while users of hand-counted paper ballots exhibited lower support for certain provisions. Overall, implementation of HAVA provisions was reported to be moderately difficult by LEOs, with some provisions becoming easier over time while others became more challenging. The difficulty of implementing HAVA provisions varied among different voting system users. Overall, LEOs were less likely to support provisions they found difficult to implement, showing an inverse relationship between difficulty and support. Optical scan users found the accessibility requirement more challenging, while DRE users did not find it significantly easier compared to other voting systems. Provisional ballots were the most challenging, while providing information to voters was the least difficult. PCOS and DRE users found the voter error-correction requirement easier to implement than users of other voting systems. Paper ballot users perceived the certification provision as less difficult. CCOS users found the voter registration requirement more challenging. Users of different systems did not differ in their assessments of implementing the provisions. The decrease in support for most HAVA provisions across the three surveys may have resulted from perceptions about costs and funding. About 90% of respondents in 2006 and 75% in 2008 believed that HAVA has increased the cost of elections, and only 2% believed the costs have decreased. LEOs expressed concerns about the sufficiency of future funding for implementing election requirements and the impact of the 2008 financial crisis on election administration. Their views on the impacts of HAVA changed significantly between 2006 and 2008, with most agreeing that the law has made elections more accessible for voters in 2008. In 2008, LEOs expressed skepticism about Congress paying attention to their views on election administration legislation. They believed HAVA made elections more complex to administer, with responses being evenly distributed. When HAVA created the Election Assistance Commission, it gave specific responsibilities such as grant programs, testing voting systems, studying election issues, and issuing guidelines. The EAC has no rule-making authority and does not enforce HAVA requirements. In 2006 and 2008 surveys, LEOs were asked about the EAC's responsibilities and benefits. The Election Assistance Commission (EAC) has four main responsibilities: providing guidance to local election officials, researching election administration issues, certifying voting systems, and ensuring compliance with federal law. Local election officials rated guidance as most important and compliance as least important. Research and certification were rated in the middle, with consistent results across surveys. In 2006, about one third of officials indicated the EAC helped them at least once, with a significant improvement in helpfulness from 2006 to 2008. In 2008, LEOs had more positive ratings of the Election Assistance Commission (EAC) compared to 2006. Half of LEOs found the EAC not very helpful in 2006, but this dropped to one-fifth in 2008. The proportion of LEOs finding the EAC moderately helpful doubled. However, the proportion finding the EAC very helpful remained the same. LEOs also rated the benefits of EAC functions higher in 2008 than in 2006. In 2008, LEOs had more positive ratings of the Election Assistance Commission (EAC) compared to 2006. They considered local guidance as the most important responsibility but rated it lowest in benefit. Perceived benefits from research and certification were somewhat higher, with funding rated highest. The discrepancy in ratings for importance versus benefits of EAC guidance to local jurisdictions could be due to frustration with delays in the EAC start-up or difficulties in understanding the guidance issued. In 2008, LEOs had varying views on the Election Assistance Commission (EAC). Some felt the EAC needed to move faster in certifying new systems, while others found the information on their website helpful. Local jurisdictions often rely on states for compliance with EAC requirements. The EAC commissioners and staff are aware of their situation and work closely with others. Suggestions include working more with states for equipment certification and enforcement power, reducing HAVA requirements for small entities, and giving more power to correct election problems. In a survey, most LEOs were familiar with their state's database, with about a third very familiar in 2006. Four-fifths stated that implementing the computerized list did not require hiring additional staff. Funding for this came mainly from local governments. LEOs expressed confidence in the effectiveness of the statewide voter registration database regarding security, accuracy, and contingency plans. LEOs expressed confidence in the effectiveness of the statewide voter registration database, believing it to be secure and accurate. They also had contingency plans in case of failure on election day. Respondents were very confident about the database's security and accuracy, believing it to be an improvement over previous systems. LEOs with larger jurisdictions were more likely to believe that new databases reduced the need for provisional ballots. In 2008, about one in six LEOs reported using electronic pollbooks, with two-thirds finding them better than paper registers for resolving voter eligibility issues. Voter identification issues have been controversial under HAVA requirements. Issues surrounding voter identification have been contentious under HAVA requirements. While first-time voters registering by mail must provide specified identification, not all states mandate photographic ID. Most jurisdictions require some form of identification, with options including document verification, signature comparisons, or verbal identification through personal information. The main argument for stricter voter ID laws is to prevent ineligible voting, although opponents argue that the risk is minimal. The surveys asked local election officials about their views on voter identification, including support for requiring photo IDs, frequency of ineligible voting, concerns about voter fraud, and the impact of photo ID requirements on election security and voter turnout. The surveys asked local election officials about their views on voter identification. On average, LEOs mildly supported a requirement for photo identification. DRE users were more supportive of photo ID than users of other systems. Two-thirds of LEOs believed that requiring photo identification would make elections more secure. LEOs generally support photo ID requirements for elections, with DRE users showing stronger support. Concerns about ineligible voters or fraud were not significant. While some believed photo ID would not affect voter turnout, others thought it would decrease turnout. Confidence in photo ID improving election security decreased slightly from 2006 to 2008. Local election officials generally support photo ID requirements for elections, with varying views on its effects on security, turnout, and voter fraud. Some believe requiring photo ID would increase security, while others think it may depress turnout. The controversy surrounding these issues is evident among LEOs, even after the implementation of HAVA requirements in the 2006 election. Local election officials (LEOs) found that they spent more time preparing for elections in 2006 and 2008 compared to 2004, with an average increase of 15% in hours spent. Despite the perception of increased complexity in administering elections, the time spent did not change from 2006 to 2008. LEOs were also asked about voter education programs, with about half reporting that their jurisdictions had such programs in place. About half of local election officials reported having voter education programs to increase voters' knowledge of election rules. 90% agreed that voter education is important, with 60% believing that lack of voter knowledge causes problems in elections. Support for voter education was lower among officials without programs. The presence of voter education programs varied based on the voting system used. In recent elections, local election officials reported various issues like voting-system malfunctions, problems with pollworkers, vendors, long lines, and media coverage. Surveys showed that around 65% of officials in 2006 and 50% in 2008 experienced at least one of these events. Officials in more populous areas reported more incidents than those in less populated areas. In 2008, local election officials in more populous areas reported more \"uncontrollable\" events like fires or power outages. Over a quarter of officials considered the election process very successful, with no one deeming it unsuccessful. The success perceived was linked to the number of incidents reported, with higher turnout expected in the presidential election year. 70% of officials reported increased turnout in 2008, especially in jurisdictions using hand-counted paper ballots. About 65% of LEOs using DREs or PCOS as the primary voting system reported problems, with the lowest incidence, 20%, among LEOs using hand-counted paper ballots. DRE users reported a slightly higher malfunction incidence than PCOS users. The study found that DREs and PCOS systems had similar reliability rates, with DREs having a slightly higher malfunction incidence. Only one instance of hacking was reported in 2006 by a precinct-count optical scan user. About 10% of LEOs were disappointed in the level of support provided. In 2008, ballots were slightly longer on average than in 2004, with half of LEOs reporting no difference. More than half of LEOs found confusing ballots to be a problem for voters. Three-quarters believed additional resources should be devoted to ballot design. About 40% of LEOs had little familiarity with ballot-design studies, while only 10% reported a high level of familiarity. In 2008, LEOs reported long lines at polling places, with higher prevalence in jurisdictions using DREs. DRE users also reported more unfair media coverage compared to other systems. Problems with accurate and timely reporting of election results were low, except for lever machine users who reported higher failure rates in reporting accurately. In both surveys, a higher incidence of polling place failure to report accurately was reported, around 10%, which was five times higher than other voting systems. Deliberate election fraud reports were minimal, with 8 LEOs in 2006 and 14 in 2008, accounting for less than 1% of jurisdictions. The number of elections requiring recounts was higher in 2006 (264) compared to 2008 (156), with recounts more likely in close races and jurisdictions using lever machines and hand-counted paper ballots. In 2006, LEOs noticed no significant change in residual votes across different voting systems. The decrease in confidence in voting systems may have been influenced by factors like media coverage. The number of provisional ballots used varied greatly among jurisdictions, with smaller jurisdictions using fewer provisional ballots on average compared to larger ones. In 2008, the use of provisional ballots varied among jurisdictions, with some using none and others using over 1,000. About one-third of jurisdictions did not use provisional ballots, while in others, they accounted for 1%-5% or more of all ballots cast. Some polling places even ran out of provisional ballots during the election. The percentage of provisional ballots cast did not depend on the size of the jurisdiction. In 2008, the use of provisional ballots varied among jurisdictions, with some using none and others using over 1,000. About one-third of jurisdictions did not use provisional ballots, while in others, they accounted for 1%-5% or more of all ballots cast. The percentage of provisional ballots cast did not vary with the size of the jurisdiction. 36% of LEOs reported an increase in the use of provisional ballots compared to 2006, while 26% reported a decrease. Most LEOs found provisional ballots slightly easier to use in 2006 and 2008, but there was more variability in 2008. The percentage of jurisdictions offering early voting increased from about half in 2006 to nearly two-thirds in 2008, with most LEOs reporting an increase in early voters in 2008. In 2008, voting systems varied with optical scan, CCOS, PCOS, DREs, and paper ballots used. A quarter of jurisdictions used multiple systems for early voting. DREs were more common in jurisdictions with higher early voting rates. Absentee voting has increased nationally with most jurisdictions using only one system for absentee ballots. In 2008, voting systems varied with optical scan, CCOS, PCOS, DREs, and paper ballots used. About three-quarters of jurisdictions used optical scan systems, and about one-quarter used paper ballots. 10% reported using DREs for absentee ballots. The average percentage of all votes cast by absentee voting in 2006 and 2008 was about 15%. CCOS jurisdictions had a higher proportion of absentee ballots (26%) compared to other systems (13%). In 2008, LEOs reported receiving ballot requests from military and overseas voters, with 62% receiving voted ballots after the deadline. Suggestions to improve participation included greater use of electronic methods, more time for ballot processing, improved training for voters and military personnel, and updating address information. Concerns were raised about early and \"no excuse\" absentee voting, citing security risks and no increase in turnout. LEOs largely do not share concerns about absentee voting and early voting, with most agreeing that absentee voting should be a voter's right. Users of different voting systems had varying opinions on early voting, with lever-machine users somewhat negative, DRE users positive, and paper ballot/optical scan users neutral. About 10% of jurisdictions experienced pollworkers not reporting for duty. Absenteeism among pollworkers has been cited as a significant problem on election day, with factors such as long hours, low pay, poor training, and age or illness contributing to the issue. About 20% of LEOs reported instances of pollworkers not understanding their jobs, with the lowest rate in jurisdictions using hand-counted paper ballots. Results from LEOs using other voting systems were higher but did not differ significantly from each other. The differences in the roles of technology in various voting systems contribute to variations in the number of pollworkers and registered voters. Factors such as training quality and pollworker experience also play a role in absenteeism issues on election day. The number of pollworkers in jurisdictions was correlated with the number of registered voters and polling places. Voting systems varied based on registered voter numbers, with hand-counted paper ballots having the fewest voters and polling places. On average, there were 5-10 pollworkers per polling place, with jurisdictions using lever machines and DREs having the lowest numbers. Paper-ballot jurisdictions had about 600 voters per polling place and 100 registered voters per pollworker. The number of pollworkers in jurisdictions varied based on registered voter numbers and polling places. Compensation for pollworkers also varied significantly, with rates ranging from $30 to over $200 on average. Pay did not change significantly from 2006 to 2008 and was not influenced by the number of registered voters or voting system used. Performance issues with pollworkers did not affect their pay. The survey found that pollworker performance did not impact their pay, which varied based on registered voter numbers and polling places. Demographic factors and training received were not statistically associated with performance problems, but there were concerns about inadequate training among LEOs, especially DRE users. The overall concern about training improvement was somewhat lower in 2008 compared to 2006. In both surveys, 93% of LEOs reported that pollworkers received about two to three hours of training on average. Seventy percent of LEOs considered pollworker training \"extremely important,\" with training being 20% lower for jurisdictions using paper ballots. In 2008, 9 out of 10 LEOs believed that classroom training was the most effective method for training pollworkers. Pollworkers receive training through various methods, including instruction at polling places and online materials. Over 90% are trained in voter check-in, accessibility, election laws, voting machine operation, and election integrity. Some pollworkers and LEOs feel that more training is needed in voting-machine operation and election laws. HAVA is seen as changing the nature of pollworker training, with 20% of LEOs reporting substantial changes. Most LEOs believe that HAVA has made elections more complex to administer. In 2006, concerns were raised about the increased complexity of elections impacting pollworker recruitment. In 2008, while recruiting pollworkers was seen as difficult, most felt the number and skills of pollworkers were adequate. LEOs were neutral about the technological complexity affecting pollworkers. Hand-counted paper-ballot system users had positive views on their pollworkers. In 2008, election officials were asked about student participation programs in election administration. Some reported an increase in high-school and college student volunteers, with DRE users being the most likely to report an increase. Lever-machine and paper-ballot users were the least likely to report an increase. Some observers suggest making election administration more nonpartisan by limiting state election officials' involvement in political campaigns. LEOs were generally satisfied with state-level election administration and believed it was independent of partisan politics. Views remained consistent from 2006 to 2008, regardless of whether a LEO was elected or appointed. Three-quarters of LEOs believed the state's role in local elections had not changed in the last five years. Local elections have changed in the last five years, with three-quarters believing the state role has increased. About 60% found the effects of this change beneficial. There was more variation in views on the political contentiousness of the election-administration environment, with more seeing it as contentious in 2008 than in 2006. LEOs who were appointed were more likely to find the environment contentious. In 2008, more believed the degree of contention had increased since the last election. About 40% thought the political environment had made election administration more difficult. In 2006, LEOs were asked about election administration as a civil service function in their state. Half had no opinion, with more elected LEOs opposed than in favor. Steps were taken to ensure the sample was representative in the study design. The study design ensured the sample's representativeness. Caution is needed in interpreting responses as they may not reflect actual beliefs or reality. Election officials may be hesitant to rate voting systems negatively, leading to potential disparity in beliefs. The survey results show an association between voting systems and the number of pollworkers, but other factors like the number of registered voters may be more important. Caution is advised in using survey results to shape policy decisions, as desired changes may not always lead to the most effective policies. The survey results may not always lead to the most effective policies, but can help policymakers identify areas for improvement in communication and understanding. The results have policy implications at federal, state, and local levels, highlighting the need for increased professionalism in election administration. Congress could address this through various means, such as improving education and professional involvement at the national level. Congress could address the potential need for educational and training programs for LEOs and professional certification of election officials. Efforts should be made to ensure diversity among LEOs, especially in minority representation. The issue of partisanship among election officials, particularly at the local level, remains controversial. Policymakers may need to consider addressing this issue. Since the enactment of HAVA, controversy has arisen over the security of DRE voting systems. A survey revealed that LEOs using DREs are confident in their security and accessibility, while those using other systems are less confident and support VVPAT. Congress may need to determine if DRE users are overconfident in their systems' security or if nonusers have valid concerns. The survey results suggest that HAVA is achieving its policy goals, with most LEOs supporting its provisions. The selection of new voting systems to reduce errors shows progress. Concerns about ongoing implementation costs may need to be addressed by Congress during HAVA appropriations and reauthorization. The influence of the federal government in decisions about new voting systems may increase with HAVA, addressing concerns of LEOs about vendors, media, and advocacy groups. Scientific surveys of local election officials are rare, suggesting the need for additional research, such as a survey of state election officials, to assess the federal role in promoting HAVA goals effectively. The federal government's role in promoting HAVA goals at all levels of government is a common suggestion among LEOs. Adjusting requirements to fit the needs of smaller jurisdictions is recommended. Specific information on how jurisdictions vary in size and duties of LEOs could be useful. Election administration is often just one part of an LEO's job, and the impact of other responsibilities on election administration is unknown. Surveys have provided snapshots of LEO characteristics and perceptions over three election cycles, suggesting the need for further research. Surveys conducted over three election cycles have provided insights into LEO characteristics and perceptions. The surveys were sponsored by CRS and conducted by graduate students and faculty at Texas A&M University and the University of Oklahoma. The topics were chosen based on their potential usefulness for Congress. The surveys conducted after the 2004, 2006, and 2008 federal elections included approximately 3,800 LEOs from 50 states. A modified random-sampling method was used to ensure representation from all states without bias towards states with more LEOs. Surveys were distributed electronically to respondents. The surveys conducted after the 2004, 2006, and 2008 federal elections included approximately 3,800 LEOs from 50 states. Administration was mostly electronic, with respondents visiting a website to enter their responses. In cases where electronic administration was not possible, LEOs were sent paper surveys via the U.S. Postal Service. The final response rate was about 40% of the sample, allowing for statistical analysis and comparison of results among the surveys. Individual response rates per state ranged from 25% to 50% for most states. Response rates for surveys varied between LEOs with under 25% and over 50% response rates. Most respondents worked in county election jurisdictions, with a slight increase in county jurisdiction respondents over the three surveys analyzed. Data for the surveys was provided by Texas A&M University and the University of Oklahoma, with corrections made for errors in the raw data. The raw data from surveys of Law Enforcement Officers (LEOs) in Oklahoma were examined for errors and corrected where necessary. Data analysis included parametric methods like analysis of variance, linear regression, and Student's t-tests. Three types of hypotheses were tested: group differences, differences from a hypothetical value, and associations. Statistical significance was determined using a significance level of .01. The data analysis included parametric methods like analysis of variance, linear regression, and Student's t-tests. Most tests yielded highly statistically significant results with p-values much lower than the significance level. Lack of statistically significant effects were noted in the reported data.
