Additionally, it mentions a National Academy of Sciences study arrangement within 60 days of the enactment of the section. The Commission will conduct a study with the National Academy of Sciences on industrial, research, and commercial uses for sealed sources, aiming to identify processes that can replace radioactive materials. The results will be submitted to Congress within 24 months. The Atomic Energy Act of 1954 is amended to include new items related to chapter 14.
