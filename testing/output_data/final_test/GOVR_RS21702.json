    "content": "The courts initially distinguished between \"quid pro quo\" and \"hostile environment\" sexual harassment claims. Quid pro quo involved threats by a supervisor based on a subordinate's response to sexual advances, while hostile environment did not require tangible harm to pursue a claim. In a hostile environment action under Title VII, the plaintiff must show unwelcome sexual conduct that creates a hostile, abusive, or offensive working environment. Courts had varying approaches to holding employers liable for supervisor harassment, with some imposing strict liability and others applying a negligence standard. The Supreme Court aimed to clarify this confusion in Faragher and Ellerth. The Supreme Court in Faragher and Ellerth clarified employer liability for supervisor harassment in Title VII cases. Employers are strictly liable for a sexually hostile work environment resulting in a \"tangible employment action.\" In the absence of such action, employers can raise an affirmative defense by showing they had a reasonable remedial process in place and the employee failed to take advantage of it. This defense requires employers to prevent and promptly correct any harassing behavior, while employees must reasonably utilize preventative measures provided by the employer. The Supreme Court defined a \"tangible employment action\" as any significant change in employment status that may result in economic harm. This includes hiring, firing, failing to promote, reassignment with different responsibilities, or a decision causing a change in benefits. The unresolved issue of constructive discharge, where an employee quits due to intolerable conditions, raises questions about employer defenses. Nancy Suders claimed she was forced to resign from her job at the Pennsylvania State Police due to a sexually hostile work environment created by male supervisors. Nancy Suders faced harassment from male supervisors at work due to her age and political affiliation, including name-calling, sexual gestures, offensive conversations, and vulgar images. She complained to the employer but received no help. Accused of theft near the end of her tenure, she was handcuffed and questioned, leading her to resign. Suders filed a lawsuit alleging a hostile work environment based on sex, age, and political affiliation, and constructive discharge. The defendants successfully moved for summary judgment in Suders' lawsuit alleging a hostile work environment and constructive discharge. The State Police were shielded from strict Title VII liability by the Farager/Ellerth affirmative defense, which requires demonstrating intolerable harassment leading to resignation. The Third Circuit joined the Eighth Circuit in recognizing the direct economic harm to employees in constructive discharge cases. The Third Circuit, along with the Eighth Circuit, concluded that constructive discharge is equivalent to actual dismissal and constitutes a tangible employment action. In contrast, the Second and Sixth Circuits argued that voluntary resignation does not deprive employers of legal defenses. Constructive discharge can result from actions of co-workers or supervisory harassment, but some circuits do not consider it a tangible employment action due to being a unilateral act of the employee. The Third Circuit in Suders argued that allowing the affirmative defense in constructive discharge cases could discourage employer intervention to prevent harassment and may even promote its continuation. They believed that the stringent test for proving constructive discharge makes it unlikely for an employee to resign at the first sign of harassment and expect to prevail under Title VII. As a result, if an employee shows that working conditions have become unbearable leading to resignation without formal dismissal, the employer would be strictly liable for damages under Title VII. In Suders, Justice Ginsburg's opinion applied a middle ground approach to constructive discharge, stating that an employer may not assert an affirmative defense when an employee raises a genuine issue of material fact. The case presented a \"worst case\" scenario of harassment escalated to the breaking point, requiring more than just severe or pervasive workplace abuse for a constructive discharge claim. Employees with compound claims must prove abusive working conditions. Employees with compound claims must prove that the abusive working environment became intolerable enough to compel resignation. Employer vicarious liability for supervisor harassment is determined by tangible or official acts of the enterprise. Without tangible employment action, the focus shifts to prevention policies, where the employer can avoid liability by demonstrating reasonable anti-harassment procedures were in place. The Supreme Court affirmed employer liability for constructive discharge claims due to supervisor harassment. It disagreed with the Third Circuit's conclusion that the affirmative defense from Ellerth and Faragher was never available in such cases, stating that constructive discharge and tangible employment actions are separate inquiries. When an official act does not underlie the constructive discharge, the employer's liability is uncertain. The Supreme Court affirmed employer liability for constructive discharge claims due to supervisor harassment, stating that the agency relationship in the supervisor's misconduct is uncertain. The Third Circuit's error in drawing a different line was highlighted by Justice Ginsburg, who pointed out that the affirmative defense would be eliminated in all hostile-environment constructive discharge cases under their formulation. This would make proving the graver claim of hostile-environment constructive discharge easier than its lesser component, hostile work environment, leading to confusion for jurors. The Third Circuit's decision on hostile environment constructive discharge cases was criticized by the Supreme Court for potentially causing confusion for juries. The Court disagreed with the Third Circuit's suggestion that an effective anti-harassment policy could be relevant in determining the intolerability of harassment leading to a constructive discharge. Justice Ginsburg highlighted the inconsistency in applying the affirmative defense in such cases. In response to the Third Circuit's decision on hostile environment constructive discharge cases, Justice Ginsburg clarified that the burden of proving the unreasonableness of the employee's actions lies with the employer. Justice Thomas criticized the Court for adopting a broad definition of constructive discharge, making it easier for employers to defend against such claims. Suders decision enhanced Title VII protection for employees who quit due to intense sexual harassment but also allowed employers to defend themselves by showing reasonable procedures for reporting and correcting harassment. If an employee quits in response to an employer-sanctioned adverse action like a demotion or pay cut, the employer may be strictly liable for damages under Title VII. Defenses include arguing the harassment didn't occur as alleged or was not severe enough, showing the adverse action was unrelated to the harassment, or taken for legitimate reasons by others. The employer may also escape liability by proving reasonable procedures for reporting and correcting harassment. The employer may escape liability by demonstrating that the underlying supervisory harassment did not meet the standard for constructive discharge. However, the Suders decision makes it harder to obtain summary judgment in sexual harassment cases involving constructive discharge claims. If there is a dispute about whether the employee suffered a tangible employment action, the employer cannot rely on the affirmative defense to obtain summary judgment."
