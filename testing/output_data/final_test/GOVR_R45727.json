    "content": "In FY2019 and FY2020, over 90% of federal highway assistance is distributed to states by formula, which has been in use for over a century. The apportionments from these formulas are used to evaluate how states benefit from federal highway assistance. Despite being referred to as \"formula programs,\" the distribution of funds is not straightforward, making it challenging to understand how funds are determined and if they reflect concerns of Members of Congress. The report discusses the origins of highway formula funding and how various factors led to the current apportionment mechanism. The Federal Aid Road Act of 1916 used three factors to distribute federal highway funds among states based on land area and other relevant considerations. The Federal Aid Road Act of 1916 used three factors to distribute federal highway funds among states: land area, population, and postal road mileage. These factors caused disagreement between urban and rural interests and raised constitutional concerns about federal spending on road construction. The population and land area factors represented rural and urban state interests, with the population factor protecting densely populated eastern states and the land area factor protecting large but less populated western states. The Federal Aid Road Act of 1916 used land area, population, and postal road mileage factors to distribute federal highway funds among states. The act set the maximum federal share of highway project costs at 50% and supported the construction of rural roads while excluding streets in more populated areas. The formula factors remained in place until the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1944, which established three separate highway systems. The Federal Highway Act of 1921 established three highway systems: Primary, Secondary, and Urban. Funds were apportioned among states by formula, with federal control over fund usage. Each state was guaranteed a minimum appropriation, and funds could only be spent on designated federal-aid highways. The Federal Highway Act of 1921 established three highway systems: Primary, Secondary, and Urban. Funds were apportioned among states based on formula factors such as land area, population, and rural post road mileage. The act marked a shift towards urban areas and by the 1970s and 1980s, Congress created numerous targeted programs within the Federal-Aid Highway Program. By FY1977, there were 35 authorized programs within the Federal-Aid Highway Program, with 13 apportioning funds based on various statutory formulas. Examples include the new highway safety and hazard elimination programs, which allocated funds based on state population and road mileage. The Interstate 4R Program was created for resurfacing and restoration, with funding based on state's Interstate Highway lane miles and vehicle miles traveled. A 1986 GAO report criticized the use of land area and population in funding distribution, recommending the use of vehicle miles traveled instead. The Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (ISTEA) reorganized highway programs and apportioned funds based on states' share of apportionments during the FY1987-FY1991 period. This method was criticized for making funding outcomes predetermined and not reflecting new census data. The Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21) in 1998 reestablished apportionment formula factors for programs within the Federal-Aid Highway Program, using new factors to address program needs. For example, the formula for the National Highway System program used factors based on lane miles and vehicle ratios. The apportionment formula for the Surface Transportation Program under the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21) in 1998 used weighted factors based on lane miles, vehicle miles, and tax payments for highway users. Users paid into the Highway Trust Fund for federal highway funding. The last reauthorization in 2005, SAFETEA-LU, used formula factors to allocate funds to 13 programs based on factors like lane miles, vehicle miles traveled, and fatalities. Some programs, like the Highway Safety Improvement Program, used specific criteria for funding allocation. Land area and postal route mileage were no longer considered, and population figures were used instead. Between 1982 and 2005, formulas in surface transportation acts did not always determine fund distribution. Congress enacted \"equity\" programs to address states paying more in highway taxes than they received in federal funding. These programs guaranteed a minimum funding level for each state, increased funding for most states, and aimed to balance out discrepancies in tax contributions. The Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (MAP-21) in 2012 made significant changes to federal highway funding distribution. It eliminated or consolidated two-thirds of the programs and altered the way funds were apportioned among states. Prior to MAP-21, Congress specified formula factors for each state's apportionments under individual programs. MAP-21 in 2012 changed federal highway funding distribution by consolidating programs and altering fund apportionment among states. The formula factors for state apportionments were no longer specified, with apportionments based on each state's share of total apportionments in FY2012. Congress aimed to address fairness concerns by ensuring each state received a minimum apportionment. The Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act (FAST Act; P.L. 114-94), enacted in 2015, increased the minimum apportionment for states to at least 95 cents of every dollar paid in highway taxes. Congress also ensured that states receiving more funding than their residents paid in taxes would still see increases in funding by transferring $18 billion to the Highway Trust Fund. The FAST Act of 2015, the current federal highway program authorization, made modest changes to the MAP-21 apportionment mechanism. It retained the basic formula and program structure, ensuring each state receives at least 95% of what its residents pay into the Highway Trust Fund. The Act funds six programs within the Federal-Aid Highway Program, apportioned among states by formula. The FAST Act of 2015 made changes to the MAP-21 apportionment mechanism for federal highway programs. It funds six programs, including NHPP, STBG, HSIP, CMAQ, MP, and NHFP. The Federal Highway Administration reserves funds for NHPP and STBG before calculating states' apportionments for FY2020. States' initial apportionment amounts are calculated based on FY2015 apportionments. Adjustments are made to ensure fair distribution. The FAST Act of 2015 made changes to the MAP-21 apportionment mechanism for federal highway programs, funding six programs. Initial apportionment amounts are based on FY2015 apportionments and adjusted to ensure fair distribution. Large transfers from the Treasury general fund to the highway account of the Highway Trust Fund authorized in the FAST Act made it possible to fund the Federal-Aid Highway Program without reducing other states' funding. The FAST Act of 2015 modified the apportionment mechanism for federal highway programs, funding six programs. Each state's base apportionment is divided among the programs, with specific percentages allocated to each program. Reserves from certain programs are added to supplement state amounts. The FAST Act of 2015 modified the apportionment mechanism for federal highway programs, funding six programs. Each state's base apportionment is divided among the programs, with specific percentages allocated to each program. Reserves from certain programs are added to supplement state amounts. Funds are added to supplement each state's STBG and NHPP amounts calculated from the state's base apportionments. The procedure currently used to apportion federal highway funds among the states is not based on any particular policy objectives other than ensuring the stability of state shares based on the apportionment shares in the last year of MAP-21, FY2015. Each state is guaranteed an amount at least equal to 95 cents on the dollar of the taxes paid by its residents into the highway account of the Highway Trust Fund. Some policy-related factors used to distribute highway funds in the past are no longer in use. States' rates of population growth and projected increases in truck traffic have never been used as formula factors. The apportionment of federal highway funds among states is based on various factors, with Table 5 showing the ranking of states' apportionment amounts."
