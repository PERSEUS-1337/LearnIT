    "content": "The former Soviet Union boasted about its socialized healthcare system, but post-Soviet collapse revealed incomplete and falsified data, masking significant health issues. Newly independent states struggled to maintain costly and inefficient healthcare systems, leading to deteriorating health conditions in the 1990s. Efforts to improve health conditions in Eurasian states accelerated in the 2000s, but challenges persist hindering economic and democratic development. Data from Eurasian states and international organizations, including estimates from the World Health Organization, are sources for this report. Factors affecting health, such as poverty rates, conflict, living conditions, and the environment, are mentioned but not analyzed in detail. U.S. health assistance to Eurasia began before the collapse of the Soviet Union with a medical aid program. In the early 1990s, U.S. and Western donors lacked a clear picture of health conditions in Eurasian states, assuming a short-term aid infusion would quickly improve health systems. However, it became evident that Eurasian states faced significant health challenges that would be difficult to address. The Eurasian states faced significant health challenges that were difficult to address, despite initial assumptions that democratic reform and economic growth would improve social sector conditions, including health. U.S. policymakers became increasingly concerned with global disease threats, highlighted by a 2000 National Intelligence Estimate on the implications of rising infectious diseases on U.S. national security and the potential for disorder in Eurasian states. The National Intelligence Estimate warned that diseases in Eurasian states could lead to political, military, social, and economic disorder, hindering democratic and free market reforms. This instability could complicate U.S. arms control cooperation and efforts to contain weapons of mass destruction. Additionally, health problems in Eurasian militaries and populations could harm national security and diminish military effectiveness in international peacekeeping. There was concern that military forces with health issues could spread diseases to U.S. forces during international exercises and training. The National Intelligence Council (NIC) issued a report in September 2002 highlighting the threat of infectious diseases like HIV/AIDS in countries of strategic importance to the United States, including Russia. The report warned that infectious diseases could exacerbate social and political instability in key countries and pose a threat to the U.S. homeland and foreign interests. Major means of combating this threat include addressing biological terrorism. The National Intelligence Council highlighted the threat of infectious diseases in countries of strategic importance, including Russia, in a report issued in September 2002. The lack of capacity, funds, and commitment in many Eurasian states hinder efforts to combat infectious diseases and biological terrorism. The National Intelligence Council's report in December 2008 expanded concerns to include non-infectious health issues like maternal mortality and malnutrition, warning of potential impacts on economies, governments, and armed forces of countries of strategic interest to the United States. The report warned of significant health problems in Russia that could hinder economic diversification and military readiness. Poor health among Russian troops could compromise joint missions with the U.S. The faltering healthcare system and rising infectious diseases could lead to economic decline, authoritarianism, and regime instability in Eurasian countries. Former Director of National Intelligence Dennis Blair included these findings in his threat assessment testimony to Congress. The Strategy for Countering Biological Threats emphasizes the need to improve global access to life sciences to combat infectious diseases and establish norms against misuse. It also calls for coordinating activities to influence and interdict those who seek to misuse life sciences, while ensuring global availability of disease surveillance and detection capabilities to respond effectively to outbreaks. The Strategy for Countering Biological Threats aims to enhance community response to disease outbreaks, deter deliberate biological attacks, and improve data reporting on infectious diseases. The United States has a strong track record in reducing risks from legacy biological weapons programs in Eurasia by redirecting research, repurposing facilities, and enhancing work with high-risk pathogens. U.S. policymaking on health issues in Eurasia involves various State Department bureaus. The State Department's Coordinator of Assistance to Europe and Eurasia plays a key role in integrating policy and implementation goals for allocating foreign aid to Eurasian countries. USAID is the lead agency in implementing healthcare aid programs in Eurasian states, focusing on maternal and child health, HIV/AIDS, malaria, and other infectious diseases. The Office of Global Health Affairs (OGHA) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) work with USAID to provide health assistance in Eurasia, focusing on preventing and controlling infectious diseases. Critics call for better interagency coordination in healthcare policy in line with national strategies and directives. The CDC's efforts in Eurasia focus on combating infectious diseases to protect U.S. citizens and support humanitarian aims, world economy, and stability. Aid is provided to strengthen public health infrastructures and establish infectious disease surveillance systems for prevention and early response to health threats. This includes the establishment of a Global AIDS Program Office in Russia and staffing at a Global Disease Detection and Emergency Response Branch site in Kazakhstan. The CDC has a presence in Kazakhstan and Central Asian states through various programs such as the Global Disease Detection and Emergency Response Branch and the Field Epidemiology Training Program. USAID also has staff in Russia and Central Asian countries for HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis programs. Congress has been concerned about infectious diseases since 2005 and has continuously allocated funds for related legislation. The House Congressional Global Health Caucus was established in 2005 to address global health issues. Attention in Congress has shifted from focusing solely on infectious diseases in Africa to also include health problems in Eurasia and other regions. Legislation such as the Global AIDS and Tuberculosis Relief Act of 2000 and the HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act of 2003 have allocated funds to combat infectious diseases in Eurasia. The establishment of the Office of the Global AIDS Coordinator in the State Department aims to integrate and expand U.S. government efforts in global HIV/AIDS prevention, care, and treatment. The Global Health and Child Survival (GHCS) Account, formed by combining CSD with the Global HIV/AIDS Initiative (GHAI) Account, expanded U.S. government efforts to address global healthcare challenges. Assistance through the GHCS Account was provided to Eurasian states, excluding Belarus and Moldova. Partnership Framework agreements were signed with Russia and Ukraine in 2008 to combat HIV/AIDS. Congress generally supported health assistance in Eurasia, amounting to a few percent of overall aid. Total U.S. aid budgeted for health programs in Eurasia from FY1992-FY2010 was less than 5% of all aid for the region. Health aid in Eurasia has historically been minimal compared to aid for democratization, economic reform, and arms control. However, there has been an increase in health aid following heightened U.S. concerns about global health issues after 9/11. The Obama Administration increased health aid to Eurasia from 14% in FY2009 to 19% in FY2010. The region inherited a centralized healthcare system from the Soviet Union, which lagged behind Western standards. The Soviet healthcare system lagged behind Western standards in terms of access to medical procedures, medicines, and basic facilities like plumbing and heat. It focused on specialized medical facilities with prolonged hospitalizations, neglecting primary and preventive care. The system was isolated from global treatment standards, lacked medical supplies, and hindered disease surveillance. After gaining independence, Eurasian states faced challenges due to borders separating medical industries from customers. After gaining independence, the new international borders separated many medical industries from their customers in other countries, leading to the re-negotiation of business relations. The Eurasian states emerged from the Soviet collapse with varying health situations, with Central Asia's population suffering the most from inadequate healthcare. Environmental catastrophes like radiation fallout in Ukraine, Belarus, Russia, and Kazakhstan also affected health in several regions. The health crisis in Eurasia post-Soviet era was influenced by various factors such as economic decline, environmental catastrophes, and conflicts. Demographers have analyzed suppressed health data, revealing a decline in life expectancy since the 1960s in Russia and other former Soviet republics. The health crisis in Eurasia post-Soviet era saw a decline in life expectancy since the 1960s, linked to factors like alcoholism, violence, and poor diets. Central Asian states suffered the most, with improvements in health conditions seen in the late 2000s. Despite improvements in health conditions in the late 2000s, Eurasian countries still lag behind developed nations in key health indicators such as life expectancy, maternal mortality, TB rates, HIV/AIDS rates, and alcoholism. A USAID report ranked Eastern European and Eurasian states poorly in terms of health factors, with countries like Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan being the most vulnerable. Poor health not only affects society's productivity but also hinders economic and democratic progress due to low GDP allocations towards healthcare. Despite low healthcare spending in Eurasian states compared to OECD countries, President Putin of Russia increased budgetary resources for healthcare in 2000. A National Health Project was launched in 2005 to improve healthcare by boosting pay for medical staff, providing new equipment, and increasing the number of ambulances. In 2006, healthcare spending in Russia increased with added funds from the National Priority Health Program, surpassing Soviet-era levels. President Putin's decree in 2007 aimed to increase life expectancy to 75 years and promote childbirth and immigration to stabilize the population at 142-143 million by 2015 and 145 million by 2025. However, forecasts suggest the population may decline to less than 136 million by 2025, casting doubt on the feasibility of these goals. The government commission released a Healthcare Development Concept to 2020 focusing on improving medical care quality, promoting healthy lifestyles, increasing life expectancy, and reducing population decline. Measures include providing more medicines, lowering medical expenses, enhancing healthcare personnel qualifications, and promoting healthy lifestyles. In 2009, Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Zhukov reported a slight population growth, a 1.2-year increase in life expectancy to over 69 years, decreased mortality rates for most diseases, and fewer deaths from alcohol. In mid-April 2010, Prime Minister Putin highlighted improvements in healthcare, including decreased mortality rates for diseases, a 32% drop in alcohol poisoning deaths, fewer road fatalities from a pilot program, and enhanced infant healthcare. He mentioned a significant increase in healthcare spending from 2000 to 2009 but acknowledged ongoing issues like low public satisfaction, regional disparities, inefficient spending, out-of-pocket expenses, and inadequate outpatient care. Putin also announced increased funding for the National Health Project in his 2010 government address. Faltering healthcare in Central Asia is evident in decreasing life spans, high infant and maternal mortality rates, and rising prevalence of diseases like TB, hepatitis, and HIV. Factors contributing to declining health include poor sanitation, drug abuse, and malnutrition. Healthcare reforms aim to improve efficiency by closing excess hospitals and increasing funding through taxes and payroll deductions, but efforts have faltered, leading to a heavy reliance on user fees. Kyrgyzstan has made the most progress in healthcare reform in Central Asia, while Tajikistan and Turkmenistan have made the least progress. Poor quality healthcare is hindering economic development in the region. Life expectancy rates for adult males and females, maternal mortality rates, and mortality rates for children under five years of age vary throughout the Eurasian region. Belarus, Kazakhstan, Russia, and Ukraine saw a decline in life expectancy between 1990 and 2008. There is a significant gap in life expectancy between Eurasian countries and OECD countries. According to demographers, factors contributing to lower life expectancy in Eurasian countries include higher rates of heart-related disorders, cancers, and injuries, with alcoholism playing a significant role. Mortality rates for children under five years of age have declined in some Eurasian countries like Moldova and Tajikistan. According to USAID, high child mortality rates in Eurasian countries, particularly in Moldova and Tajikistan, indicate poor healthcare and widespread poverty. Maternal mortality rates are also significantly higher in Eurasian states compared to European countries, with causes likely including poor nutrition and lack of maternal care. Despite some improvements, the Eurasian countries are unlikely to meet Millennium Development Goals. In several Eurasian states, high rates of abortion are decreasing due to education and access to contraceptives. The Russian government launched a plan in 2006 to boost birth rates and reduce abortions by providing free maternity care, childcare benefits, and maternity leave. Despite these efforts, the overall abortion rate in Russia remains high. Economic conditions have led to a sharp decline in health infrastructure, contributing to increased levels of infectious diseases like TB. The increase in infectious diseases, particularly TB and HIV/AIDS, in Eurasian states since gaining independence is a major concern. HIV/AIDS is spreading among injecting drug users, with rising rates of STDs indicating potential spread to the general population. Childhood vaccination rates declined dangerously in the late 1980s and early 1990s, leading to a diphtheria epidemic in the mid-1990s, with Ukraine, Russia, and Tajikistan being hardest hit. International efforts, including collaboration with the WHO and USAID, helped deliver vaccines and advocate for childhood immunizations, leading to a decline in diphtheria cases by the late 1990s. In the late 1990s, childhood vaccination rates in Eurasian countries had reached 96-99% coverage, except for Armenia and Georgia in 2006 which were still below this range. TB cases in Eurasia are higher than in OECD countries, with Tajikistan showing a rapid increase in new cases. In 2001, Russia initially refused a World Bank loan to combat TB and HIV/AIDS due to restrictions on Russian drug manufacturers. However, they accepted aid in 2003 and collaborated with USAID and WHO to expand DOTS treatment. Russia is among the top twenty countries for U.S. assistance in TB treatment, but faces challenges with multi-drug resistant TB due to poor living conditions and prisoner releases. The spread of drug-resistant TB in Russia is exacerbated by the release of convicts with advanced stages of TB, cancer, or AIDS. The high burden of multi-drug resistant TB cases in Eurasian states, except Turkmenistan, strains healthcare finances. WHO reports that most countries with high rates of multi-drug resistant TB cases are in Eurasia, with Russia making successful efforts to reduce infection rates since 2006. In Eurasia, efforts have been made to combat multi-drug resistant TB and rising HIV prevalence. Injecting drug use, prostitution, and population mobility contribute to the spread of HIV. Ukraine has the highest HIV infection level in Europe. In 2007, Ukraine had the highest HIV infection level in Europe, with over 1.6% of the population aged 17-49 affected. By 2014, Ukraine could see a 1.6% reduction in GDP due to HIV/AIDS costs, and AIDS mortality could decrease employment by 10.4%. Russia had the largest number of people living with HIV in Eurasia, estimated at 940,000 in 2007. The Russian government increased spending on HIV/AIDS from $6 million to $13 million, reversing years of neglect. In the early 2000s, Russia increased spending on HIV/AIDS from $6 million to $13 million in 2009. Azerbaijan, Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Ukraine funded over 50% of their HIV/AIDS programs domestically. Despite an emphasis on treatment, only a quarter of those needing antiretroviral therapy in Eurasia receive it. Most new HIV cases in Eurasia come from injecting drug users and spread through partners to the general population. In Eurasia, HIV/AIDS is primarily spread through injecting drug users (IDUs) and their partners to the general population. Heterosexual transmission is common, but social stigma and punitive laws may hinder men who have sex with men from seeking treatment. Some Eurasian states outlaw consensual same-sex adult relationships. Observers urge increased spending on HIV prevention, including opioid substitution treatment for IDUs. The Russian medical establishment opposes this approach. Cooperation efforts among Eurasian states include the Program of Urgent Response to HIV/AIDS by the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). The CIS prime ministers approved a program in 2008 to strengthen regional responses to HIV/AIDS, calling for unified national AIDS programs and improved access to counseling and testing. Turkmenistan's deputy minister claimed no reported HIV cases in the country, while Uzbekistan focused on prevention programs for vulnerable populations. President Karimov's daughter Lola Karimova directs HIV prevention efforts for youth in Uzbekistan, supported by UNICEF. However, an HIV/AIDS activist was sentenced to seven years in prison for publishing an HIV prevention brochure funded by UNICEF. Eurasian states, including Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Uzbekistan, face increased illegal drug use, with inadequate demand reduction efforts due to budget constraints. Drug treatment in Eurasia is inadequate due to budget constraints and a lack of focus on prevention. Laws mainly target drug traffickers and users, leading to fear of seeking treatment. Limited access to treatment programs like OST exists in some countries, while others do not provide it. Drug use in Russia has been steadily increasing since 2000, with heroin and opiates being the dominant substances. In 2004, Russia amended its narcotics law to allow drug treatment options instead of imprisonment, but law enforcement still focuses on imprisonment. Efforts to reduce drug users by 20% by 2010 have failed, with Russia having the second-highest rate of heroin and opium use globally. Over 550,000 registered drug addicts and 30,000 overdose deaths annually were reported in 2010. In Russia, drug addiction and overdose rates are a national security concern, with 30,000 overdose deaths reported annually. The country has urged the US and NATO to address drug production in Afghanistan. Drug treatment programs in Eurasia are struggling to meet increasing demands. In Armenia, new drug treatment facilities have been established to improve long-term treatment and counseling efforts. Belarus treats drug addicts in psychiatric hospitals or outpatient clinics. In Belarus, drug addicts are treated in psychiatric hospitals, outpatient clinics, and prisons. Treatment focuses on detoxification rather than stabilization and rehabilitation. The Ministry of Health operates three OST clinics, while NGO-run centers offer fee rehabilitation services to both registered and anonymous addicts. Availability and quality of services have improved somewhat, but many addicts still avoid seeking treatment due to the official registry being accessible to law enforcement. In Georgia, there is a high demand for detoxification and substitution therapy, surpassing the available supply. In Kazakhstan, pilot projects for methadone therapy were launched in two cities in 2009, with 29 heroin addicts participating. In Kyrgyzstan, insufficient funding hampers prevention and treatment programs for drug users. UNODC supports various drug treatment assistance programs. Moldova lacks a structured approach to drug addiction treatment, with an underdeveloped after-care and reintegration system. In Turkmenistan, the after-care and reintegration system for drug addiction is underdeveloped. Detoxification services are available in government medical institutions and some private healthcare facilities. Insured individuals can access detoxification services through the National Health Insurance Fund, while uninsured individuals must pay for treatment. Private healthcare institutions offer anonymous detoxification for insured patients. NGOs provide free rehabilitation and reintegration programs anonymously. The Ministry of Health in Turkmenistan operates seven drug treatment clinics where addicts can receive confidential treatment without revealing their identity. Drug addiction is a prosecutable crime in Turkmenistan, but judicial officials typically sentence addicts to treatment instead of jail time. In Ukraine, pilot OST programs using buprenorphine are being implemented, with a shift towards methadone treatment expected to cover up to 20,000 addicts in 111 clinics by 2013. In Uzbekistan, there is a shortage of hospitals with drug dependency recovery programs, but efforts are being made to open new treatment facilities. Smoking prevalence in Eurasia increased during the 1990s but began to decline in the early 2000s due to anti-smoking campaigns. Austria and Bosnia had the highest smoking rates globally, while Russia and Ukraine had the highest rates in Eurasia. In Russia, almost two thirds of adult males reportedly smoke, with many starting at young ages. The percentage of males who smoke has stabilized in recent years, while the percentage of females who smoke has risen. In Ukraine, the percentage of male smokers has increased significantly, while female smoking rates have fluctuated. Smoking has been linked to high percentages of male deaths in several Eurasian states, with rates higher than in the United States. Alcohol consumption in Russia and other Eurasian states remains high. Only Azerbaijan does not restrict tobacco advertising on television. Moldova and Russia have the highest per capita alcohol consumption in the world. Ukraine has the highest rate of alcohol consumption among children and youth. Alcohol-related issues in Russia include a rise in male alcohol poisoning, homicide, suicide, and various diseases. Excess alcohol and tobacco use contribute to early deaths in Russians aged 15-54. In 2009, Russian President Medvedev expressed concern about the high alcohol consumption in the country, calling for an anti-alcohol campaign. The Health Ministry drafted a plan for discussion, and proposals were made to increase the minimum price of vodka. Market (Rosalkogolregulirovaniye) proposed increasing the minimum price of vodka, cracking down on illicit alcohol production, and implementing penalties for selling alcohol to minors. Putin approved an anti-alcohol campaign in January 2010, aiming to reduce alcohol consumption by 15% by 2012 and 55% by 2020. Legislation for the campaign has faced obstacles due to resistance from officials and commercial interests. Some Eurasian states have made progress in improving water and sewer systems, but challenges remain in Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan. In Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, water-borne illnesses like hepatitis, cholera, and typhoid fever are still serious problems. An outbreak of poliomyelitis in Tajikistan in April 2010 resulted in the deaths of twelve children and paralysis in nearly 300, with the disease spreading from Afghanistan. UNICEF rushed oral polio vaccines for 1.1 million children to Tajikistan for an immunization campaign. Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Russia imposed restrictions on travel or trade with Tajikistan following the outbreak. In Tajikistan, health officials urged families to vaccinate children against polio before travel. Some children entering Russia were found with polio. Cases of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever in Russia's Bashkortostan republic increased in 2009, linked to rodents, animals, and ticks. The Penza region also saw a surge in cases. Other regions reported lower incidences, but still had infections and deaths. Tajikistan reported suspected cases of viral hemorrhagic fever, with recent cases in southwestern towns and Dushanbe. Picnics and outings in South were banned. In Eurasia, special health needs are faced by increasing numbers of people, including orphans, refugees, and internally displaced persons due to conflicts since the breakup of the Soviet Union. The UNHCR estimated that during the 1990s, there were up to nine million internally displaced persons or refugees in Eurasia. Major humanitarian emergencies caused by conflict have occurred in Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Russia, and Tajikistan, resulting in the exile or displacement of over 1.5 million people. In Eurasia, there have been population shifts involving Armenians, Azerbaijanis, Georgians, Chechens, and other residents of Russia. Ethnic Russians have returned to Russia, Crimean Tatars to Ukraine, and Georgians displaced during the Russia-Georgia conflict. Despite some returning, as of January 2009, there were still 987,804 displaced persons in Eurasia. The longer-term health needs of this vulnerable population are challenging to address due to inhospitable living conditions and limited access to healthcare facilities. According to UNICEF, the number of children in residential care in Eurasia has increased since 1991, with most in boarding schools and fewer in orphanages. Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan are using boarding schools to help children from poor families access education. Orphanages in Eurasia often care for children with disabilities and chronic health conditions. USAID and international donors are providing assistance, including healthcare and support for a foster care system. In Eurasia, USAID has provided advice and training on early crisis identification, family preservation, and social support for families with HIV. The number of children in foster care has increased in Western Eurasian states, but progress in other Eurasian states has been slow. Homeless and street children numbers may have decreased in recent years. In St. Petersburg, Russia, USAID supported a program from 2004-2008 to provide medical and psychological services for street and neglected children to ensure their rehabilitation and transition from streets to birth families, foster-care, or independent living. U.S. assistance budgeted for health in Eurasia was less than 5% of total aid, indicating relatively low support. The U.S. government health aid to Eurasia has been significantly lower than private donations, totaling about $35.3 billion. Funding for healthcare saw a notable increase after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, with funding tripling to about 9% of Eurasian funding, averaging around $66 million per fiscal year. This shift reflected a greater recognition of the national security implications of global health issues. The U.S. government's funding for healthcare in Eurasia has increased after the events of September 11, 2001. The former Clinton Administration proposed the \"Partnership for Freedom\" initiative to support grass-roots economic and social reforms, including health programs. Although Congress did not approve a large boost in aid, they endorsed many programmatic emphases, leading to USAID focusing more on social needs in Eurasia. USAID emphasized the importance of adequate healthcare and social services in Eurasian states to maintain faith in the reform process. In 2005, USAID launched a Health Sector Strategy to improve the health of populations and support the transition to democracy and free-market economies. USAID's strategy in Eurasia focuses on improving healthcare systems to address HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, reproductive health, and non-communicable diseases. The program includes public-private partnerships, finance, policy, management, procurement, primary care, quality improvement, and human resources development. USAID's Quality Public Health and Primary Health Care in Central Asia (\"Zdrav-reform,\" \"Zdrav Plus,\" and \"Zdrav Plus II\") started in 1994 with $30 million allocated by 2009 to restructure healthcare systems in Central Asian countries. The program, in partnership with the World Bank and Asian Development Bank, has helped improve health systems efficiency and response to population health needs. The American International Health Alliance (AIHA) facilitates public-private partnerships for healthcare aid efforts in Eurasian states, with a focus on educational activities and professional exchanges. Private donations of medical goods and expertise are provided through the Health Partnerships program. Georgia is the only Eurasian state that has applied for funds for health systems strengthening purposes. In Eurasian states, AIHA has active healthcare partnerships, including Operation Provide Hope and USAID's ocean freight program for transporting medical goods. The value of health-related donated cargoes has decreased over the years. U.S. public and private health-related assistance totaled about $4.9 billion in aid to Eurasia from FY1992-FY2008. Additionally, efforts are made to redirect former Soviet biological warfare scientists to peaceful healthcare research. In Eurasia, healthcare partnerships focus on drug and vaccine development for diseases like tuberculosis, hepatitis, and HIV/AIDS. The Civilian Research and Development Foundation supports collaborative medical research funded by various U.S. departments. Post-9/11 programs retrain scientists from Russia, Ukraine, and Central Asia who previously worked on biological and chemical warfare. The Peace Corps conducts preventive health education and community health development activities in Armenia, Kazakhstan, and Moldova. The Peace Corps conducts education and community health development activities in Armenia, Kazakhstan, and Moldova, with a focus on preventing HIV/AIDS. The Defense Department has donated military hospitals and provided training to Eurasian states. The Obama Administration increased health aid to Tajikistan, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan in FY2010, emphasizing their role in counter-terrorism efforts. The Obama Administration increased health aid to Tajikistan, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan, emphasizing their role in counter-terrorism efforts and the need for support in border security, counter-narcotics efforts, democratic reforms, health, education, and economic growth. Tajikistan's severe needs in health and education jeopardize progress in other priority objectives, while Ukraine faces challenges with HIV and TB infections. The Obama Administration increased health aid to Tajikistan, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan to address their role in counter-terrorism efforts and the need for support in various areas. USAID called for health assistance to continue in Eurasian states to address communicable and non-communicable diseases. The European Union provided funding for healthcare in Eastern Europe and Central Asia, including reproductive health. EU-Russia talks in 2009 resulted in a decision to hold meetings on public health issues. The EU allocated funds for healthcare in Chechnya and disabled persons in Russia. International organizations like WHO, UNICEF, and the World Bank have health programs in Eurasia. WHO focuses on functional programs and regions, with each Eurasian state having a WHO special representative. WHO deployed experts in 2010 to assess a polio outbreak in Eurasia. In late April 2010, WHO deployed experts to assess a polio outbreak in south-west Tajikistan, the first imported polio outbreak in the WHO European Region since 2002. In November 2009, experts were sent to western Ukraine to investigate a suspected pandemic flu outbreak. WHO also collaborated with the European Commission to reduce maternal and neonatal mortality rates in Kazakhstan. The Global Fund disbursed $805 million to combat diseases in Eurasia, with a significant portion going to Russia and Ukraine. The Global Fund disbursed $805 million to combat diseases in Eurasia, with a significant portion going to Russia and Ukraine. The United States is the largest donor to the Global Fund, contributing $841 million in 2009 and pledging $1 billion in FY2010. UNICEF has health and nutrition programs throughout Eurasia, with spending in the region over the last five years totaling $68 million. The United States is also the largest donor to UNICEF programs in the region. The UNFPA and World Bank have programs in Eurasian states focusing on improving access to basic services for women and children, training authorities on social services, and addressing issues like high mortality rates and inadequate education. UNFPA programs in countries like Armenia, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan prioritize reproductive health and family planning. World Bank projects in the region, excluding Russia, amount to $485 million and include initiatives like avian influenza control and health sector reforms. There is debate about U.S. health assistance to Eurasia, focusing on disease outbreaks that could spread to the U.S. and the importance of disease prevention for homeland security. Some argue that infectious disease rates in Eurasia are not as high as in other developing countries and do not threaten U.S. interests. Some analysts are concerned about the impact of infectious diseases on U.S. defense personnel in Eurasia. Bolstering the health of Eurasia's military and civilian populations can serve U.S. security interests by maintaining their ability to combat terrorism and drug trafficking. Declining health in the military forces could hinder their missions, affecting the effectiveness of U.S. border and security aid. Some argue that U.S. health aid benefits Eurasian military cooperation, while critics believe Eurasian military personnel pose no greater health risk than others. Adverse health trends in Russia could hinder economic reforms and lead to political unrest, potentially creating a more belligerent, nuclear-armed Russia. Increasing health aid could prevent these developments. Without greater commitments to healthcare by Eurasian states, U.S. and international assistance may not have a lasting impact. Addressing societal roots of health problems like alcohol and drug abuse, homicides, and suicides is crucial. Some suggest shifting aid from democratization and economic reform programs to meet pressing health needs in Eurasia. Many urge caution in taking on new health aid initiatives. Many urge caution in providing new health aid to Eurasian states due to interrelated and costly healthcare, public health infrastructure, and environmental problems. Congress and the executive branch have clashed over the amount of aid to provide, with suggestions to increase foreign aid devoted to health or establish Congressional guidelines for health assistance. In Eurasia, U.S. policy may need to shift towards longer-term health aid commitments, focusing on healthcare institution-building and reform efforts. Recent years have seen increased funding for specific health needs in the region, including assistance from various accounts. Analysts suggest Congress alter aid allocation for Eurasian states to address healthcare, public health infrastructure, and environmental issues. In FY2004, funds were allocated for healthcare improvements in Eurasian states. Some analysts recommend adjusting aid distribution among these states, with larger amounts historically going to Armenia, Kazakhstan, Russia, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan. Less assistance has been provided to Azerbaijan, Belarus, Moldova, and Turkmenistan. Decision-making on aid distribution is influenced by various factors, including targeting aid to strategic U.S. allies, democratic states, and those receptive to healthcare reforms. In Russia and other Eurasian states, critics argue that governments are corrupt, inefficient, and neglect health budgets and policies. This hinders U.S. and international medical assistance, which can be redirected for political purposes. Some governments block humanitarian aid for political reasons, using it as a weapon. To overcome these challenges, some suggest focusing on supporting indigenous health-related NGOs in Eurasia for effective aid utilization and long-term self-help capabilities. In Eurasia, U.S. health aid may shift to disaster assistance or IDPs, potentially shortchanging health support for the general population. USAID family planning programs in the region aim to promote maternal health and modern contraception methods to reduce high abortion rates. While some Eurasian states have made progress in health sector reform, others have seen worsening conditions since the 1990s. In recent years, health conditions in Turkmenistan, Tajikistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Russia have worsened, with low public health expenditures leading to a lack of medicines, poor service quality, and low salaries for health workers. USAID identified these countries as having the poorest health status in Europe and Eurasia, making them vulnerable to setbacks in democratization and market transition. USAID also highlighted the need for continued support in combating malaria as part of the President's Global Health Initiative. The Global Health Initiative includes efforts to combat malaria. Several bills were introduced in 2010 to promote sexual and reproductive health in developing countries and coordinate US foreign health assistance. Several bills were introduced in 2010 to enhance global healthcare cooperation and raise awareness about tuberculosis. These bills aim to improve the health of newborns, children, and mothers in developing countries through assistance and technology programs. The Health Technology Program in the United States Agency for International Development aims to research and develop technologies to improve global health. Bills introduced include the Global Autism Assistance Act of 2009 and the Newborn, Child, and Mother Survival Act of 2009 to provide assistance for autism spectrum disorders and improve health in developing countries. The Newborn, Child, and Mother Survival Act of 2009 was introduced on March 10, 2009, to enhance the health of newborns, children, and mothers in developing countries. It was referred to the House Committee on Foreign Affairs."
