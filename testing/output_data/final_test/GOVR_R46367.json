    "content": "The Trump Administration proposed a FY2021 budget of $44.12 billion for the Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs (SFOPS) accounts, which is about 3% higher than the FY2020 request. This funding supports various U.S. activities globally, such as embassy operations, diplomatic activities, development, security, and humanitarian assistance. The proposed budget is nearly 23% below the FY2020 SFOPS funding level enacted by Congress, including supplemental funds for COVID-19 response. The Trump Administration's proposed FY2021 budget for SFOPS accounts is higher than the FY2020 request. Congress has consistently allocated more funds for SFOPS than requested, with the requested funding level being the lowest in over a decade. The appropriations process has been influenced by the Budget Control Act of 2011, with Congress amending the caps to raise discretionary spending limits for FY2020 and FY2021. Congress has raised the BCA caps for FY2020 and FY2021 to work around budget limits, using OCO funding excluded from discretionary limits. OCO funding in SFOPS budget expanded significantly from FY2012 to FY2017, peaking at $20.80 billion in FY2017, supporting various accounts like USAID and Foreign Military Financing. The use of Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) funding in the SFOPS budget has raised concerns about its distinction from core activities, with some calling it a slush fund. Despite a decrease in OCO usage since FY2017, Congress designated $8.00 billion in enacted SFOPS funding for OCO in both FY2019 and FY2020. Additionally, $2.37 billion in emergency funding was allocated in FY2020 to combat the COVID-19 pandemic abroad, which, like OCO funding, does not count towards discretionary spending caps. The FY2021 budget request for SFOPS has been delayed due to disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The request includes a funding cut for the Department of State and Related Agency appropriations accounts to $14.03 billion, down 18.9% from FY2020. The Administration's request does not include funds for the State Department's COVID-19 response. Congress has yet to establish subcommittee allocations or introduce SFOPS legislation for FY2021.

The Administration's FY2021 request includes a $5.38 billion funding for the State Department's key diplomatic security accounts, with $3.70 billion for Worldwide Security Protection (WSP) and $1.68 billion for Embassy Security, Construction, and Maintenance (ESCM). The Administration is proposing to decouple WSP from Diplomatic Programs and establish a standalone WSP account to fund the Bureau of Diplomatic Security (DS) responsible for security programs at U.S. embassies and overseas posts. The ESCM account funds the Bureau of Overseas Building Operations (OBO) for providing secure facilities for U.S. diplomatic missions. The Administration's priorities for FY2021 include hiring additional special agents at DS and deploying High Definition Secure Video Systems at overseas posts worldwide. They also proposed a cut of $109 million for DS operations in Afghanistan to consolidate locations and reduce costs. The ESCM request includes $866.67 million for the State Department's share. The Administration's ESCM request of $866.67 million for the State Department includes funding for Capital Security Cost Sharing and Maintenance Cost Sharing Programs to support overseas diplomatic posts.

Construction projects to be funded include new embassy and consulate compounds in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, Adana, Turkey, and Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The Contributions to International Organizations (CIO) account covers payments to over 40 organizations for membership dues. The United States contributes funding to over 40 international organizations, including the United Nations, World Health Organization, Organization of American States, and NATO.

The Administration's FY2021 budget request aims to support strategic partners and allies like Israel, Egypt, Jordan, Colombia, and Venezuela, enhance long-term development, strengthen U.S. leadership in global health and humanitarian assistance, and advance national security and economic interests. The budget proposes cuts in most assistance types except for export promotion assistance, which would see a significant increase due to funding for the new U.S. Development Finance Corporation. The FY2021 foreign operations budget request focuses on global health programs, humanitarian assistance, and security assistance, comprising two-thirds of the total budget. The Global Health Programs (GHP) account is proposed to receive nearly $6.00 billion, a 5.4% reduction from the FY2020 budget request. The budget includes an increase in pandemic influenza funding compared to FY2020-enacted levels. The FY2021 budget request includes a $25 million deposit to replenish the Emergency Reserve Fund for infectious disease outbreaks.

Additionally, the request includes $2.80 billion in carryover funding from previous years. The FY2021 request for humanitarian assistance totals close to $9.00 billion, allowing for funding above previous levels.

This restructuring would also shift the administration of overseas refugee and migration assistance funding from the State Department. The budget request for FY2021 proposes significant changes to humanitarian assistance funding, consolidating accounts and shifting administration from the State Department to USAID. The request would eliminate the Emergency Refugee and Migration Assistance account, reduce funding for Migration and Refugee Assistance, and combine functions within USAID.

The request seeks flexibility to provide assistance through a combination of grants and loans. The FY2021 foreign operations request aims to expand tools for the US to help NATO and non-NATO allies purchase American defense equipment. It also emphasizes burden sharing by asking partners to contribute more funds. Funding for development sectors like environment, education, and water would be reduced, while there is an increase in programming to promote women in developing economies.

The DPF aims to support diplomatic and peace efforts globally, but Congress has not accepted the proposal. The budget request also reduces funding for the Peace Corps and the Millennium Challenge Corporation, proposes eliminating the Inter-American Foundation and the U.S African Development Foundation, and integrating their activities into USAID's Bureau for Development, Democracy, and Innovation. The Administration proposes consolidating the Inter-American Foundation and the U.S. African Development Foundation into USAID's new Bureau for Development, Democracy, and Innovation.

Other strategically significant countries receiving aid include Afghanistan, Ukraine, and several African countries. The Middle East and Africa would receive the largest shares of aid, with Africa receiving a majority of global health and development aid. The distribution of assistance within regions varies significantly. The International Affairs budget includes a small proportion of INCLE funding for the Western Hemisphere region, while a large proportion of INCLE funds go to this region. Additionally, international food assistance programs and other departments are funded separately from the Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs appropriation. The Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs appropriation measure includes funding for certain international commissions not part of the International Affairs Function 150 account."
