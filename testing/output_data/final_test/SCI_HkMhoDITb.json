This paper introduces free-energy-based reinforcement learning (FERL) as an application of quantum hardware, proposing a method for approximating the free energy of a quantum Boltzmann machine using a quantum annealer. The technique is applied to reinforcement learning on the grid-world problem with promising results, showing the potential of quantum sampling in RL tasks. Reinforcement learning involves an agent interacting with an environment to learn optimal navigation strategies. Free-energy-based reinforcement learning (FERL) uses a restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) to approximate a utility function called the Q-function efficiently. RBMs can represent any joint distribution over binary variables. General Boltzmann machines (GBM) are proposed as universal Q-function approximators with polynomially large Boltzmann networks. Monte Carlo simulation is traditionally used for approximating the free energy of GBMs, but representing a GBM as an equivalent physical system, such as a quantum annealer, can speed up the process. Quantum annealers, consisting of pair-wise interacting qubits, have been applied in various computational science fields, including combinatorial optimization and machine learning. Quantum annealing can be used for Reinforcement Learning by representing the Q-function as the free energy of a physical system. By evolving the system towards a Boltzmann-like distribution, we can approximate the free energy and estimate the Q-function. Recent studies have extended classical methods to quantum algorithms for approximating the free energy of General Boltzmann Machines (GBMs) using simulated quantum annealing. In this work, the algorithm uses simulated quantum annealing to approximate the free energy of classical Boltzmann machines. The challenge lies in sampling from a quantum system due to the superposition state at the end of each anneal. The study introduces a quantum annealer to estimate the free energy of classical Boltzmann machines and extends the concept to quantum Boltzmann machines. The study introduces quantum Boltzmann machines in reinforcement learning, utilizing a quantum annealer to approximate the free energy of a quantum system. A novel stacking procedure is proposed to reconstruct superposition states from partial information obtained after each anneal. Experimental results using the D-Wave 2000Q quantum processor support the applicability of quantum annealers in reinforcement learning. Refer to BID33 and BID37 for more on Markov decision processes and reinforcement learning aspects. The text discusses the optimal policy for a Markov Decision Process (MDP) by computing the expected value of rewards using the Bellman optimality equation. The focus is on finding the fixed point of an operator defined on the state-action space. The text focuses on TD(0) Q-learning with neural network parametrization to find optimal policy \u03c0\u02dapsq and Q\u02daps, aq by minimizing the distance between T pQq and Q. It introduces a clamped Boltzmann machine with fixed visible node assignments and energy calculation based on visible and hidden nodes interactions through weighted edges. A clamped quantum Boltzmann machine (QBM) uses qubits instead of binary random variables, with a quantum Hamiltonian based on an induced transverse field Ising model. When \u0393 is 0, a clamped QBM is equivalent to a classical Boltzmann machine. The energy function in this case is a diagonal matrix in the \u03c3 z -basis, with a spectrum identical to the classical Hamiltonian. In BID27, the equilibrium free energy Fpvq is calculated for visible variables v using a fixed thermodynamic beta. The negative free energy of a GBM is used to approximate the Q-function, with weights w trained using the TD(0) update rule. The equilibrium free energy Fpvq for visible variables v is calculated using a fixed thermodynamic beta. The negative free energy of a QBM is used to approximate the Q-function with weights trained using the TD(0) update rule. The negative free energy of a QBM is used to approximate the Q-function with weights trained using the TD(0) update rule. The development of the FERL method using QBMs is concluded, with more details available in Algorithm 3 in BID10. In this paper, quantum annealing is used to approximate free energy values and expected observables. The evolution of a quantum system under a time-dependent Hamiltonian is characterized by the quantum adiabatic theorem (QAT). Quantum adiabatic computation, closely related to quantum annealing, was introduced as a paradigm of quantum computing. Manufacturing efforts have been inspired by the history of quantum annealing and the quantum adiabatic theorem. Manufacturing efforts inspired by the history of quantum annealing and the quantum adiabatic theorem led to physical realizations of adiabatic evolution via quantum hardware. However, the existing adiabatic theory does not cover the behavior of these machines operating at non-zero temperatures and not isolated from their environment. A contemporary investigation in quantum adiabatic theory is studying adiabaticity in open quantum systems, proving adiabatic theorems for such systems under various assumptions. This research shows potential for using quantum annealers to sample from the Gibbs state of a TFIM. The research explores using quantum annealers to sample from the Gibbs state of a TFIM. The samples obtained are not necessarily from the final Hamiltonian's Gibbs state but from an intermediate point called the freeze-out point. Parameters like the strength of the transverse field and the inverse temperature are unknown and need to be associated with all TFIMs. The D-Wave 2000Q quantum annealer uses a Chimera graph structure with superconducting qubits. Spin configurations can only be measured along a fixed axis, leading to the collapse of quantum information related to the spin projection. The Suzuki-Trotter expansion of the TFIM, known as replica stacking, offers a method to overcome the challenge of unknown energy in the system. A grid search is performed over virtual parameters \u03b2 and \u0393 to find the most effective learning for FERL. The partition function of the TFIM can be approximated using an effective Hamiltonian, leading to a classical Ising model in higher dimensions. The Suzuki-Trotter decomposition maps the original Ising model with a non-zero transverse field to a classical Ising model of one dimension higher. This is achieved by representing hidden nodes as classical spins and using replicas in the z-basis to simulate quantum superposition. The probabilities of measuring spin states are determined by choosing a replica at random. The quantum Boltzmann machine uses replicas in the z-basis to simulate quantum superposition, with hidden nodes carrying more information than classical ones. Connections between hidden nodes are more complex, and coupling strengths follow the Suzuki-Trotter formula. This machine is an undirected graphical model one dimension higher than the classical version. The quantum Boltzmann machine utilizes replicas in the z-basis to mimic quantum superposition, with hidden nodes containing richer information than classical nodes. Connections between hidden nodes are intricate, following the Suzuki-Trotter formula. To update weights, samples from the Boltzmann distribution are needed, and the simulated quantum annealing algorithm (SQA) can be used for this purpose. SQA is a quantum Monte Carlo method that simulates the quantum annealing behavior of a TFIM by gradually decreasing the transverse field strength. In our implementation, a single spin-flip variant of SQA with a linear transverse-field schedule is used to simulate the annealing phenomena of a TFIM by gradually reducing the transverse field strength at finite temperature. SQA can approximate Boltzmann distributions of classical and quantum Hamiltonians, unlike conventional simulated annealing (SA) which is based on thermal annealing. SQA can approximate the Boltzmann distribution of the effective classical Hamiltonian one dimension higher than the quantum Hamiltonian. Sampling from the Boltzmann distribution using MCMC is slow and computationally intensive. Quantum annealers offer a more efficient way to provide samples from Boltzmann distributions corresponding to TFIM in the z-basis. Quantum annealing can efficiently approximate the free energy of a TFIM by sampling from Boltzmann distributions. By using quantum annealers, spin configurations can be obtained from a replica of the effective classical Hamiltonian. This method allows for the approximation of the free energy for a TFIM. The quantum annealer samples the TFIM with replicas, denoted as effective configurations. The probability mass function is supported by configurations synthesized from candidate replicas, allowing for efficient approximation of free energy. The MCMC method for sampling from effective configurations involves attaching classical spin configurations to the SQA's structure and transitioning with a Metropolis acceptance probability based on exchanging configurations. This stochastic process satisfies the detailed balance condition, allowing for efficient sampling from the effective distribution. The MCMC method involves sampling from effective spin configurations by attaching classical spin configurations to the SQA structure. This process creates a pool of effective spin configurations used to approximate the free energy of the TFIM. In experiments with a small number of hidden nodes, classical spin configurations are randomly attached to the SQA structure without the need for the MCMC method. The replica stacking technique creates an undirected graphical model with hidden nodes governed by Boltzmann distribution. Each hidden node activation is influenced by r replicas in a higher dimension. The energy function of this model differs from a classical Boltzmann machine. The free energy of the model approximates the Q-function. Various FERL methods are tested on a grid-world problem with different actions available to the agent. The replica stacking technique involves creating an undirected graphical model with hidden nodes influenced by replicas in a higher dimension. The energy function of this model differs from a classical Boltzmann machine. Various FERL methods are tested on a grid-world problem with different actions available to the agent. The algorithm involves calculating and updating Q-values, initializing the structure of the effective Hamiltonian, obtaining spin configurations, and performing the MCMC technique to obtain effective spin configurations. The task involves finding an optimal policy for the agent in a grid-world, using Boltzmann machines with 16 hidden nodes. The agent receives rewards, penalties, and neutral values for different actions. FERL methods are tested with training samples and fidelity measures to evaluate the policy. The experiment involves running algorithms 100 times to find an optimal policy in a grid-world. A fully connected deep Q-network with specific node configurations is used, along with a network of superconducting qubits represented as a clamped QBM with hidden layers. The experiment involves running algorithms 100 times to find an optimal policy in a grid-world using a fully connected deep Q-network with specific node configurations. The state nodes are connected to blue qubits and action nodes to red qubits. Virtual parameters are chosen for constructing effective classical configurations from reads on the D-Wave 2000Q chip. The average fidelity of policies generated by different FERL methods is shown to grow over runs with training samples. In 100 independent runs with 500 training samples, different methods like D-Wave replica stacking, SQA Bipartite, SQA Chimera, SA Bipartite, SA Chimera, and D-Wave Classical were used to train classical and quantum models on various graphs. The training was based on specific formulae and virtual parameters for each method. The performance of various Q-learning methods with different neural networks is compared, including a fully connected deep Q-network method and a free-energy-based RL method using an RBM. The deep Q-network method processes every training sample efficiently but requires a large number of samples to converge, while the RBM method is successful at learning the optimal policy but does not outperform other FERL methods. The RBM-based FERL method outperforms the fully connected deep Q-network method in efficiency. Replica stacking is successful in estimating classical configurations from a quantum annealer. FERL using the quantum annealer with replica stacking shows significant improvement over FERL using classical Boltzmann machines. SQA-based FERL using a DBM slightly outperforms the one using a D-Wave 2000Q. The D-Wave 2000Q is outperformed by the SQA-based FERL using a DBM. Quantum annealing chips with greater connectivity and control over annealing time can enhance the replica stacking method for RL tasks. Comparing SA-based FERL using a DBM to using the Chimera graph, the DBM is a better choice due to its additional connections. Virtual parameters \u03b2 and \u0393 are associated with all TFIMs constructed using FERL for practical reasons. BID5 and BID25 offer methods to estimate the effective inverse temperature \u03b2 for various applications. Samples from the quantum annealer match the Boltzmann distribution of a classical Ising model, with the transverse-field strength as a second virtual parameter. The optimal choice of transverse-field strength \u0393 = 0.5 corresponds to 2/3 of the annealing time, in agreement with previous work. Quantum annealer measurements can be considered good approximations of Boltzmann distribution samples of classical Ising models. The developed graphical model using the replica stacking method is not limited to Q-function approximation in RL tasks and can be applied to tasks where Boltzmann machines are used. This method provides a way to approximate activations and partition functions of quantum Boltzmann machines. The paper describes a free-energy-based reinforcement learning algorithm using the D-Wave 2000Q quantum annealer for quantum Boltzmann machines with a significant transverse field. Results show potential for outperforming digital hardware algorithms, paving the way for larger-scale quantum machine learning tasks in the future."
