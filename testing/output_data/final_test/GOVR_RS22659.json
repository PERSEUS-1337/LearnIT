The election was deemed competitive and \"genuinely democratic\" by international observers. Following the election, the Middle East Quartet stated that assistance to the PA would only continue if Hamas renounced violence, recognized Israel, and accepted previous agreements, conditions which Hamas refused. In March 2006, Hamas formed a government without Fatah, the secular party that had long dominated Palestinian politics. On April 7, 2006, the United States and the EU announced they were halting assistance. The Hamas-led PA government faced financial crisis as the US and EU halted assistance, while Israel withheld tax revenues. International aid and Israeli revenues made up two-thirds of PA income, leading to a fiscal crisis. The Hamas-led government struggled to pay wages and poverty levels deepened in the Palestinian territories. The Hamas-led government in the Palestinian territories faced financial crisis due to halted international aid and Israeli tax revenues. Living conditions deteriorated, leading to clashes between Fatah and Hamas supporters, resulting in over 100 Palestinian deaths. In February 2007, Fatah and Hamas signed an agreement to form a national unity government to end violence and lift the international aid embargo. The national unity government agreement between Fatah and Hamas was signed in Mecca, Saudi Arabia, with Ismail Haniyeh remaining as prime minister. Hamas controls nine ministries, Fatah six, and independents lead the rest. The government's platform includes establishing a Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital and affirming the right to resistance against Israeli aggression. The new Palestinian unity government commits to respecting previous agreements but does not renounce violence or recognize Israel. The Bush Administration is disappointed with the government platform but remains open to meeting with non-Hamas members. On March 20, U.S. Consul General in Jerusalem Jacob Walles met with Palestinian Finance Minister Fayyad in Ramallah, marking the first diplomatic contact between the United States and Palestinians in a year. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice also held a meeting with Fayyad at the State Department on April 17. U.S. officials are exploring ways to allow donor funds from Arab and European countries to flow to accounts controlled by Fayyad without violating U.S. law. Additionally, the Administration is redirecting some assistance to PA President Abbas, including reprogramming up to $86 million to support Palestinian civil security forces loyal to Abbas. The House Appropriations Committee placed a hold on funds for Palestinian civil security forces loyal to Abbas, seeking more information on the money's intended use. Secretary Rice requested $59 million for Abbas, with $43 million for training and non-lethal assistance to the Palestinian Presidential Guard and $16 million for improvements at the Karni crossing. The EU's reaction to the Palestinian unity government has mirrored that of the United States. EU officials have started meeting with non-Hamas members of the PA government. The EU has had success in forging consensus on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and views resolving it as key to reshaping the Middle East. Despite differences among member states, some like France, Spain, and Italy may be inclined to resume direct aid to the PA, while others like the UK and Germany are more cautious. The Quartet will measure the unity government not only on its composition and platform but also its actions. Some European officials see a softening of the Quartet position towards Hamas, focusing on future actions rather than just the official platform. Despite EU policy, 10 European Parliament members met with Hamas Prime Minister Haniyeh in Gaza. Norway has taken the lead in normalizing relations with the Palestinian government and is willing to resume direct aid to the PA. Russian officials, including Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, have maintained contact with Hamas leaders and advocated for lifting the aid embargo. They aim to position themselves as mediators between Arabs and Israelis while still supporting the Quartet's conditions. Despite their ambition to reestablish Moscow as a significant player in the region, they continue to see the Quartet as a necessary mechanism. Hamas leader Khalid Mish'al has visited Moscow twice since taking power. The U.N. has not taken a stance on the unity government formed by Fatah and Hamas. Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon did not meet with Hamas officials during a visit to the region. Saudi Arabia called for an end to the international boycott of the Palestinian Authority at the Arab League summit. King Abdullah also relaunched the Arab Peace Initiative of 2002. The Arab Peace Initiative of 2002 was relaunched at the summit, calling for Israeli withdrawal from 1967 territories, creation of a Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital, and a solution to the refugee problem in exchange for peace agreements with Arab states. The Saudi diplomatic drive aims to end Palestinian violence, resume peace talks with Israel, and bring Hamas into the Arab consensus for a two-state solution. This initiative seeks to create momentum towards peace and undermine anti-Israeli ideology. The Saudis aim to undermine Iran's influence and promote peace by supporting the two-state solution and unity government. Jordan and Egypt are tasked with promoting the Arab peace initiative with Israel. King Abdullah II has been vocal about restarting Israeli-Palestinian peace talks. In March 2007, there were talks urging renewed international engagement for the Israeli-Palestinian peace process. Israel maintains a ban on meetings with Palestinian ministers and withholds tax revenues from the PA. Direct talks with a Palestinian government including Hamas are refused due to past terrorist attacks. Prime Minister Olmert meets with PA President Abbas to discuss economic aspects of a future Palestinian state. In mid-April, Prime Minister Olmert and PA President Abbas discussed economic aspects of a future Palestinian state. Olmert expressed support for the Arab peace initiative and willingness to meet with any Arab leader. Iran has provided cash, arms, and training to Hamas since the 1990s, despite tensions over Hamas' independence. Iran has increased aid to Hamas since the aid boycott, with Hamas officials reportedly returning from Tehran with large sums of cash. The International Monetary Fund estimates that in 2006, $70 million in cash, mostly from Iran, was carried into the territories. Prime Minister Haniyeh announced Iran's agreement to provide $120 million in 2007 and up to $250 million in total. Israeli security officials have warned of growing Iranian influence in Gaza, with Iranian experts training Palestinian terrorists. President Bush signed the Palestinian Anti-Terrorism Act of 2006 into law, barring aid to the Hamas-led Palestinian government unless it acknowledges Israel's right to exist and adheres to international agreements. The Palestinian Anti-Terrorism Act of 2006 exempts funds for humanitarian aid and democracy promotion, provides $20 million for Palestinian democracy and peace, limits PA's representation in the US, and restricts US contact with Palestinian officials. The President viewed some provisions as advisory, not mandatory, due to concerns about impinging on foreign policy authority. Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen introduced H.R. 1856 in 2007 to amend the Act. H.R. 1856, the Palestinian Anti-Terrorism Act Amendments of 2007, aims to further restrict contact with and assistance to the PA."
