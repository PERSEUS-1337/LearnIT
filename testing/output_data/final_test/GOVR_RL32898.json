    "content": "The Treasury Department has historically played key roles in formulating economic policies, serving as the financial agent for the government, enforcing various laws, and producing currency. However, the creation of the Department of Homeland Security in 2002 significantly changed Treasury's functions, limiting its role in law enforcement. Despite this, Treasury still influences economic policymaking and manages government finances. The Treasury Department is organized into departmental offices and operating bureaus. Departmental offices handle policy initiatives and department operations, while operating bureaus carry out specific tasks. Bureaus account for most of the department's personnel and funding, focusing on financial matters and law enforcement. Notable bureaus include the Comptroller of the Currency, U.S. Mint, and Bureau of Engraving and Printing. The Treasury Department's operating bureaus, such as the Community Development Financial Institutions Fund (CDFI) and Office of Thrift Supervision, have key responsibilities in law enforcement. The creation of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) transferred several law enforcement duties from Treasury to DHS, including the Secret Service and Customs Service. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) remains involved in tax revenue collection and enforcement. The Treasury Department transferred law enforcement duties to the Justice Department, creating the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau in 2003. This bureau focuses on tax collection and regulation, separate from law enforcement tasks. Some Treasury bureaus are funded through annual appropriations from Congress, including the IRS and other key departments. In FY2005, Treasury received $11.218 billion in appropriated funds, with 91% used to finance the IRS operations. The remaining $982 million was distributed among other Treasury bureaus and departmental offices. In FY2005, Treasury received $11.218 billion in appropriated funds, with 91% allocated to IRS operations. The remaining funds were distributed among other Treasury bureaus and departmental offices. For FY2006, the Bush Administration requested $11.649 billion for Treasury operations, with the majority going to the IRS. The requested amount represented a 3.8% increase from FY2005. For FY2006, the Bush Administration requested $11.649 billion for Treasury operations. Departmental offices and bureaus would have received varying amounts, with most accounts funded at higher levels than in FY2005. Total full-time employment at Treasury was projected to rise to 113,242 under the Administration's budget proposal. In FY2006, the Bush Administration requested $11.649 billion for Treasury operations, with total full-time employment projected to rise to 113,242. Congressional action on the budget request led to the approval of funding for Treasury and other federal agencies in H.R. 3058. The House approved the measure on June 30 by a vote of 405 to 18. The House approved H.R. 3058 with $11.529 billion funding for Treasury in FY2006, $311 million more than FY2005. IRS received $10.556 billion, $320 million more than FY2005. Funding increased for various accounts including Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau, Financial Management Service, and TIGTA. In the Senate, an amended version of H.R. 3058 was favorably reported by the Appropriations Committee. The Senate approved a version of H.R. 3058 with $11.698 billion in funding for the Treasury Department in FY2006, differing from the House-passed version. The Senate approved $11.698 billion in funding for the Treasury Department in FY2006, $480 million more than FY2005, $49 million more than the Bush Administration's request, and $169 million more than the House's approval. The IRS received $10.679 billion, $443 million more than FY2005, with the same amount requested by the Administration. The Senate allocated $4.726 billion for tax law enforcement, matching the Administration's request. The Senate approved increased funding for various Treasury Department offices in FY2006, with some departments receiving additional funding while others faced cuts. Additionally, funding was restored for programs that were eliminated in FY2005. The differences between the House and Senate versions of H.R. 3058 required a conference to reconcile. A conference committee was formed to resolve differences between House and Senate versions of H.R. 3058. The committee reached an agreement detailed in a conference report (H.Rept. 109-307) released on November 18. The House approved the report with a vote of 392 to 31, and the Senate did likewise through unanimous consent. The President signed the measure (P.L. 109-115) on November 30, providing increased funding for the Treasury Department in FY2006. The Treasury Department's departmental offices are receiving $197 million, with $40 million allocated to combat financial crimes, including terrorist financing. Other funded accounts include department-wide systems, Office of Inspector General, TIGTA, Air Transportation Stabilization program, Treasury building repair, FinCEN, Financial Management Service, Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau, Bureau of Public Debt, and CDFI. Total appropriations for FY2004 to FY2006 are detailed in Table 1. The Treasury Department's budget request for FY2006 aims to improve taxpayer compliance, modernize IRS systems, disrupt terrorist financing, safeguard federal finances, and promote economic development through policy initiatives like permanent tax cuts. The figures provided by the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations may not sum due to rounding or excluded line-items. Rescissions of 0.59% in FY2004 and 0.83% in FY2005 were implemented. The Treasury Department's budget request for FY2006 focuses on improving taxpayer compliance, modernizing IRS systems, disrupting terrorist financing, safeguarding federal finances, and promoting economic development through policy initiatives like permanent tax cuts. One of the key policy issues raised is combating terrorist financing, with Treasury officials prioritizing uncovering, monitoring, and disrupting funds to terrorist groups post-9/11. Treasury has taken significant steps to address this issue. The Treasury Department established the Executive Office of Terrorist Financing and Financial Crimes (EOTF) in March 2003 to combat terrorist financing and financial crimes. However, plans for the office did not materialize, leading to the formation of another office to oversee the government's efforts against terrorist financing. The Office of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence (TFI) coordinates the department's efforts in combating terrorist financing and financial crimes by integrating various offices such as TF/FC, OFAC, FinCEN, OIA, and the Treasury Executive Office for Asset Forfeiture. TFI is responsible for gathering and evaluating financial intelligence, as well as enforcing financial laws and regulations through activities like freezing bank accounts of terrorists and implementing U.S. sanctions policy. The Office of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence (TFI) coordinates efforts to combat terrorist financing and financial crimes by integrating various offices. TFI assists IRS special agents in investigating allegations of terrorist financing, money laundering, and other financial crimes. The Administration's proposed budget for Treasury in FY2006 seeks to increase funding for programs combating financial crimes, including terrorist financing, from $25 million to $40 million. Congress approved this increase in funding. The Administration's request to increase spending on Treasury programs to combat terrorist financing and financial crimes raised questions about how the funds would be used and if the benefits would outweigh the costs. Specifically, concerns were raised about how the proposed budget would enhance Treasury's capability to disrupt terrorist financing and how it would fit into the government's overall campaign against terrorist financing. The Administration's budget documents lacked details on expanding Treasury's programs to counter terrorist financing, raising questions from Congress about the purpose and role of TFI in the government's campaign against terrorist financing. Future congressional oversight may focus on these policy questions. The Administration's FY2006 budget request included a controversial reduction in funding for the Community Development Financial Institutions Fund (CDFI) from $55.1 million to $7.9 million. The CDFI aims to increase credit, investment capital, and financial services in poor urban and rural communities by partnering with certified financial institutions and equity groups. The Administration's FY2006 budget proposed consolidating key elements of the Community Development Financial Institutions Fund (CDFI) within the Commerce Department, without additional funding. The $7.9 million requested for CDFI in FY2006 would have enabled the fund to continue administering its programs. The Administration's proposal to transfer CDFI programs to the Commerce Department was criticized for potentially undermining economic development in poorer communities by eliminating vital funding for CDEs and small banks. Critics, including some Members of Congress, raised concerns about the loss of seed capital and the impact on private investment in disadvantaged neighborhoods. The enacted version of H.R. 3058 provided $55.0 million in funding for the CDFI in FY2006 and FY2007, with $6 million for direct loans and $4 million for technical assistance for specific communities. Concerns were raised about the impact of the Administration's proposal on lending to small firms, investment in real estate development, and the availability of financial services in these communities. Future congressional oversight of the CDFI may assess the effects of its programs in affected communities. The Administration proposed user fees for services provided by the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau, including administrative and filing fees. Legislation would be sought to authorize fee collection from firms benefiting from regulatory activities. The Administration proposed user fees for services provided by the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau to cover regulatory costs. Some lawmakers opposed the fees, citing concerns for smaller firms like family-owned wineries. Ultimately, the enacted legislation rejected the proposed user fees, raising questions about federal agencies relying on user fees over appropriated funds. The federal government finances its operations through various taxes and fees collected by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). In FY2004, the IRS collected $2.035 trillion, with individual income tax revenue being the largest component at $990 billion. In FY2005, the IRS received $10.236 billion in appropriated funds, with allocations for processing, assistance, tax law enforcement, information systems management, and the business systems modernization program. Congress specified funding for programs like Tax Counseling for the Elderly and low-income taxpayer clinics. The IRS Commissioner required consent from the House and Senate Appropriations Committees for spending on the BSM program. The IRS Commissioner needed approval from the House and Senate Appropriations Committees for spending. The Bush Administration requested $10.679 billion for IRS operations in FY2006, a 4.3% increase from FY2005. The proposed budget restructuring aimed to reduce appropriations accounts from six to three: tax administration and operations (TAO), BSM, and administration of the health insurance tax credit. The Administration sought increased funds for tax law enforcement, processing, and information systems in FY2006. They requested $10.460 billion for TAO, $199 million for BSM, and $20 million for health insurance tax credit administration. The budget proposal aimed to increase IRS full-time employment. The IRS planned to achieve a $38 million reduction in taxpayer service spending by closing 68 locations. The Administration proposed cutbacks in IRS services to save money, including closing 68 Taxpayer Assistance Centers and reducing telephone assistance hours. This sparked concerns about compliance with tax laws. To secure $6.893 billion for tax law enforcement, the Administration suggested a contingency appropriation method for IRS funding in FY2006. The Administration proposed cutbacks in IRS services to save money, including closing Taxpayer Assistance Centers and reducing telephone assistance hours, sparking concerns about tax law compliance. To increase IRS funding by $446 million in FY2006, Congress needed to allocate all additional funds for enforcement and approve a base funding level of $6.446 billion. The IRS Oversight Board plays a crucial role in the annual budget cycle, recommending a budget of $11.629 billion for FY2006, about 14% higher than the previous year. The IRS Oversight Board recommended a budget of $11.629 billion for the IRS in FY2006, which was 14% higher than the previous year. They argued for additional funding for enforcement, taxpayer service, BSM, and operating costs. Congressional action on the budget request began with hearings in the House Appropriations Subcommittee. The Subcommittee approved funding for the Treasury Department and other executive agencies in FY2006. The House passed H.R. 3058 with $10.556 billion for IRS operations, rejecting the Administration's proposed budget restructuring. The House approved $10.556 billion for IRS operations in FY2006, with allocations for processing, assistance, tax law enforcement, information systems, BSM program, and health insurance tax credit administration. The Senate approved $10.679 billion for IRS operations in FY2006, allocating funds for various programs including Tax Counseling for the Elderly and low-income taxpayer clinics. The bill also included provisions to prevent IRS closures until a study on taxpayer compliance impact was completed. The Senate approved $10.679 billion for IRS operations in FY2006, with allocations for different programs. The Senate rejected the Administration's proposed IRS budget restructuring, citing concerns about oversight. The Senate-passed version of H.R. 3058 allocated funds for processing, assistance, management, tax law enforcement, information systems, and the BSM program. The Senate approved $10.679 billion for IRS operations in FY2006, including funds for the BSM program and health insurance tax credit administration. The Senate also included provisions to prevent the IRS from reducing taxpayer services and allocated funds for programs like Tax Counseling for the Elderly and low-income taxpayer clinics. The Senate approved $10.679 billion for IRS operations in FY2006, including provisions to prevent the IRS from competing with the private sector in tax return software development and to continue the Free File program. The appropriations for IRS operations from FY2004 to FY2006 are detailed in Table 2. The budget request for IRS operations in FY2006 included consolidating three appropriations accounts into a single account known as tax administration and operations (TAO), with a request for $10.460 billion. The differences between the House and Senate versions of the bill were resolved by a conference committee, and the measure was signed by President Bush. President Bush signed the measure on November 30, allocating $10.672 billion to the IRS in FY2006. The funds are designated for processing, assistance, tax law enforcement, information systems, BSM, and administering the health insurance tax credit. The IRS is restricted from reorganizing or reducing its workforce without approval, and must maintain services until a study on taxpayer compliance is completed. The IRS is also bound by a new agreement with the Free File Alliance. The IRS, under the act signed by President Bush, is allocated $10.672 billion in FY2006 for various purposes. The agency is required to develop a five-year plan for taxpayer services and is restricted from competing in the tax return preparation software market. The budget request for the IRS in FY2006 raised policy issues tied to the agency's strategic plan, focusing on improving taxpayer service, enforcing tax laws, and modernizing information systems. Congress faces challenges in allocating resources to advance these aims amidst the tax gap and federal budget concerns. The FY2006 budget request for the IRS emphasized improving taxpayer compliance through increased enforcement spending, despite decreases in taxpayer service and other programs. This marked the sixth consecutive year of requesting funding for more enforcement staff, as previous funding increases were used for operating expenses. IRS Commissioner Mark Everson highlighted the importance of prioritizing enforcement efforts before the House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Oversight. IRS Commissioner Mark Everson stated that with the requested budget increase for enforcement, the IRS could raise the audit rate for mid-size corporations and individual taxpayers, aiming to address the growing issue of unpaid taxes. The gross tax gap in the 2001 tax year was estimated to be between $312 billion and $353 billion. Tax evasion is a serious policy issue as it can undermine the tax system's fairness and integrity, waste economic resources, and hinder the economy's performance. From the mid-1990s to the early 2000s, IRS resources for enforcing tax compliance declined while the number of tax returns increased. The IRS workforce engaged in enforcement activities decreased by 26% from FY1996 to FY2003, but saw a slight increase in FY2004. Meanwhile, the number of individual income tax returns filed rose by 12% from 1995 to 2003. The number of tax returns filed increased by 12% from 116.5 million to 130.8 million, leading to a decrease in audit rates for individual and corporate taxpayers. Enforcement spending has the potential to generate a significant return on investment by deterring tax evasion and increasing tax payments. The IRS's enforcement activities in FY2004 resulted in $43.1 billion in additional revenue, a 15% increase from FY2003. The Administration proposed spending $265 million more on enforcement in FY2006, claiming it would yield nearly $1.2 billion in additional revenue by FY2008. However, research suggests no clear link between enforcement spending and revenue collected. A report by TIGTA questioned the IRS's methodology for projecting a $4.40 return for every dollar spent on enforcement. This proposed increase in enforcement spending raises policy questions for lawmakers. The Bush Administration sought legal authority to hire private debt collection agencies to help the IRS collect delinquent tax debt as part of its strategy to improve taxpayer compliance and shrink the tax gap. This raised policy questions about the IRS's budget allocation for enforcement and whether Congress should set enforcement goals for the agency. The IRS is authorized to contract with private debt collection agencies to pursue overdue taxes. The agency is soliciting bids for the initiative, with plans to award three contracts in February 2006. Critics argue that using private collection agencies may violate established practices. Critics argue that using private collection agencies to pursue overdue taxes may violate established practices, threaten taxpayer privacy, and undermine IRS job security. Supporters claim that using private collection agencies offers advantages over hiring additional IRS staff, as no appropriated funds would be used, the agencies would augment IRS staff, and resources could be focused on more challenging tax evasion cases. The IRS's private debt collection initiative faces opposition from some Members of Congress, with a proposed amendment to prohibit the use of appropriated funds for contracts with private collection agencies. The effectiveness of private collection agencies compared to IRS enforcement staff in collecting debts without violating taxpayer rights is a key question for Congress to consider during oversight. The Administration proposed cuts in taxpayer service spending, with a net reduction of $38.5 million in FY2006. This was on top of a previous drop in spending for this purpose in FY2005. IRS officials justified the cuts due to declining usage of taxpayer assistance services. The IRS TeleFile service and toll-free telephone help line have declined as taxpayers increasingly use the IRS website for tax forms and filing electronically. Cost of online assistance is lower than in-person or over the phone. Concerns arise over budget cuts impacting taxpayer service advancements since RRA98. IRS officials announced steps to cut $134 million from taxpayer service spending in FY2006. The IRS planned to cut $134 million from taxpayer service in FY2006 by closing 68 taxpayer assistance centers, eliminating electronic tax law assistance, reducing telephone assistance hours, and ending the TeleFile service. These measures aimed to save $50-55 million, $18 million, and additional savings from the TeleFile service closure. The IRS planned to cut $134 million from taxpayer service in FY2006 by closing 68 taxpayer assistance centers, eliminating electronic tax law assistance, reducing telephone assistance hours, and ending the TeleFile service. Critics were concerned about the impact on compliance for vulnerable groups like the elderly, low-income households, and immigrants. Congressional critics inserted a provision in H.R. 3058 to prevent the IRS from reducing taxpayer services until a study by TIGTA is completed. The IRS planned to cut $134 million from taxpayer service in FY2006 by closing 68 taxpayer assistance centers, reducing telephone assistance hours, and ending the TeleFile service. Congressional concerns led to a provision in H.R. 3058 to prevent the IRS from reducing taxpayer services until a study by TIGTA is completed. In response to congressional pressure, the IRS suspended the closure of TACs and the reduction of telephone assistance hours until a budget for FY2006 was approved. The proposed reduction in spending on taxpayer service in FY2006 raised concerns about its impact on taxpayer compliance. Lawmakers questioned whether cuts in service would lead to more individuals not meeting tax obligations, despite arguments from IRS officials that shifting funds to enforcement would improve compliance. The balance between tax law enforcement and taxpayer service is a key issue for lawmakers overseeing IRS operations. The Administration's budget request for FY2006 aimed to support the modernization of the IRS. The BSM program was created in FY1998 to modernize the IRS's computer systems with a total cost not exceeding $8 billion. $2.1 billion has been appropriated for BSM through FY2006, with annual appropriations declining since FY2006. Approval from House and Senate Appropriations Committees is required before funds can be spent on BSM. The BSM program's annual appropriation has been declining since FY2002, with doubts in Congress about IRS management's ability to improve performance and control costs. Despite concerns, the program is showing technological advances that could benefit taxpayers and the IRS by enabling electronic filing and retrieval of information. The IRS has deployed various information systems through the BSM program since 2004, including Modernized E-File for electronic tax returns, E-Services for electronic business transactions, Customer Account Data Engine for processing taxpayer information, and Integrated Financial System for internal accounting. The BSM program is crucial for IRS operations, with concerns raised about proposed funding cuts impacting goals, technology improvements, taxpayer service, and enforcement activities. Raymond Wagner emphasized the program's importance in improving customer service, enforcement, and modernizing outdated computer systems."
