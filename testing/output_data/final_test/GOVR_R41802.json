    "content": "In FY2012, the United States spent $8.8 billion on global health programs, with 84% allocated to HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria. The US is the largest donor for global HIV/AIDS and considers fighting these diseases as important foreign policy priorities. The US is the largest donor for global HIV/AIDS and has played a key role in addressing TB and malaria. Despite progress in controlling these diseases, challenges remain such as increasing drug resistance and limited access to treatment. Congress has debated the US strategy for confronting these diseases, with implementing agencies making programmatic changes in response. The Obama Administration has called for a revised U.S. approach to HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria programs to improve effectiveness and efficiency. Decreased funding for these diseases due to the financial crisis has led to a reevaluation of U.S. global health investments. The 112th Congress may consider policy issues such as health systems strengthening, country ownership, research and development, monitoring and evaluation, and engagement with multilateral organizations. In May 2011, a study showed that early HIV treatment reduced transmission risk by 96%, a significant breakthrough in the fight against global HIV/AIDS. The Global Fund canceled its 11th round of funding in November 2011 due to inadequate funding, implementing a transitional funding mechanism. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2012 allocated $7.4 billion for HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria programs in FY2012. In FY2012, Congress allocated $7.4 billion for HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria programs, with slight changes in funding levels. The FY2013 budget request proposed $7.2 billion for these programs, including decreased bilateral funding but increased support for the Global Fund. The Administration aimed to treat 6 million HIV-positive individuals by 2013, reaffirming its commitment despite funding adjustments. The U.S. has significantly expanded efforts to combat HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria over the years. The U.S. government has been increasingly recognizing the severity of HIV/AIDS and taking action. President Clinton initiated the LIFE Initiative in 1999 to address HIV/AIDS in African countries and India. President Bush also contributed to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria in 2001. In 2002, President Bush launched the International Mother and Child HIV Prevention Initiative and in 2003, established the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) with a $15 billion pledge over five years to combat HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria. This marked the largest commitment by a single nation towards an international health issue, emphasizing the role of donor governments in the fight against HIV/AIDS. The 108th Congress authorized the establishment of PEPFAR in 2003 with $15 billion for global HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria efforts, including $1 billion for the Global Fund. The Leadership Act also created the Office of the Global AIDS Coordinator to oversee U.S. global HIV/AIDS activities and shifted focus to extending anti-retroviral therapy. The Leadership Act set targets for extending anti-retroviral therapy (ART) and required that 55% of PEPFAR funds be spent on HIV/AIDS treatment. President Bush announced the establishment of the President's Malaria Initiative (PMI) in 2005, significantly increasing U.S. funding for global malaria programs. PMI aimed to halve malaria-related deaths in 15 sub-Saharan African countries by 2010 through proven techniques like indoor residual spraying, insecticide-treated bed nets, artemisinin-based combination therapies, and intermittent preventative treatment for pregnant women. This initiative marked a shift from past USAID malaria programs. The President's Malaria Initiative (PMI) was established in 2005 to increase U.S. funding for global malaria programs, with a focus on purchasing and distributing malaria-fighting commodities. The initiative aimed to align programs with country priorities and integrate them into national health systems. In 2007, the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2008 significantly increased funding for TB control efforts, expanding USAID TB programs in high-burden countries and addressing HIV/TB co-infection. In July 2008, the 110th Congress enacted the Lantos-Hyde Act, authorizing $48 billion for global HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria efforts from FY2009 through FY2013. $4 billion was allocated for bilateral TB programs, $5 billion for bilateral malaria programs, and $2 billion for the Global Fund in FY2009. The act also established the Global Malaria Coordinator at USAID. U.S. HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria programs under the Bush Administration had bipartisan support. The health community debated various aspects of PEPFAR, including the effectiveness of abstinence-only education, integration of family planning, use of branded vs generic drugs, and funding balance between prevention, treatment, and care. Critics argued PEPFAR was too unilateral and relied heavily on U.S. organizations, lacking in strengthening national health systems. The Lantos-Hyde Act aimed to address these criticisms and transition PEPFAR to a sustainable, country-led program. President Obama announced the Global Health Initiative in response to these debates in 2009. In 2009, President Barack Obama announced the Global Health Initiative (GHI), a $63 billion effort to coordinate existing global health programs and funding streams managed by various U.S. agencies. The GHI aims to integrate HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria programs for maximum effectiveness, strengthen health systems, support country ownership, and prioritize woman- and girl-centered approaches to global health. The Obama Administration proposes spending 81% of all GHI funding on HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria programs from FY2009 through FY2014. President Obama announced a target of providing treatment to 6 million people infected with HIV by 2013. Key documents show GHI principles being implemented in the field since its launch in 2009. The GHI principles are being implemented in 29 \"GHI Plus\" countries with additional resources and technical assistance. The Administration released the Global Health Initiative Strategy Document and GHI Country Strategies to guide coordination efforts between PEPFAR, USAID, and CDC. Studies show progress towards cohesive and coordinated health programs. The Global Health Initiative (GHI) is showing early signs of progress in coordinating global health efforts for HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria programs. Questions remain about scaling up innovation and sustaining integration without additional resources. Concerns exist about potential decreased support for disease-specific programs despite the Administration's commitment to existing initiatives like PEPFAR and PMI. Congress allocates funds for global health assistance through various appropriations vehicles to multiple U.S. agencies. Funds are appropriated to U.S. agencies including the Department of State, USAID, CDC, and DOD for global HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria programs. Congress also supports international research efforts for these diseases. Funding has significantly increased since FY2001, with continued commitment in FY2012. In recent years, Congress has shown strong support for U.S. programs addressing global HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria. Legislation such as the Leadership Act and the Lantos-Hyde Act have increased funding for these diseases. Congressional hearings have been held to assess and discuss strategies for combating these diseases. Despite congressional action grouping HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria together, funding and attention vary greatly. HIV/AIDS receives the most funding, with close to or over 50% of the global health budget, while TB receives between 1.6% and 3.6%, and malaria receives between 5.0% and 9.1%. U.S. support for global TB lags behind HIV/AIDS and malaria, with no designated U.S. coordinator. Funding for HIV/AIDS, malaria, and TB has seen different trends since FY2001. HIV/AIDS funding increased rapidly from FY2004 to FY2008, then leveled off. Malaria funding increased significantly after PMI was established in FY2006. TB funding had rapid growth in FY2008 and FY2010, with slight fluctuations in subsequent years. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2012 included specific funding for these diseases. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2012 (P.L. 112-74) provided funding for global HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria programs, as well as U.S. contributions to the Global Fund. Funding for these programs in FY2012 was slightly lower than in FY2011, with a decrease in global HIV/AIDS funding but slight increases in global TB and malaria funding. Some health experts are concerned about the leveling of global health funding, particularly for HIV/AIDS, which they argue undermines recent scientific breakthroughs in prevention and treatment methods. Some argue that cuts to HIV/AIDS programs may impact prevention and care activities, as well as broader HIV-related efforts. The FY2012 Consolidated Appropriations Act saw small decreases in funding for the three diseases, following debates over reducing the budget deficit. Members of Congress debated the impact of these cuts on essential programs. In FY2012, there were debates over funding reductions for global health programs, with the House Subcommittee recommending $7.1 billion (18% decrease) and the Senate recommending $7.9 billion (9.2% decrease) compared to the President's request of $8.7 billion. Despite the cuts, the total funding level for these programs was higher than both recommendations, with a 6.9% decrease from the Administration's request. Health advocates praised the relatively small reductions made in FY2012. President Obama released the FY2013 budget request, which includes funding decreases for most bilateral HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria programs, with a 10.8% decrease in funding for bilateral HIV/AIDS programs. However, there is a significant increase in funding for the Global Fund by 26.9% over FY2012 levels. Health advocates applaud the increase in support to the Global Fund but express concern over the reduction in funding for bilateral programs, especially PEPFAR programs. Experts warn that divestment in U.S. global HIV/AIDS and TB programs could endanger lives, reverse progress, and lead to decreasing support from other donors. The Lantos-Hyde Act authorized $48 billion for global HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria programs from FY2009 through FY2013, including contributions to the Global Fund. Current spending trends suggest that the authorized level may exceed appropriated amounts by over $10 billion. In late 2011, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) released new estimates of the scale of the global HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria epidemics, highlighting significant progress in the fight against these diseases. The 2011 WHO/UNAIDS report on global HIV/AIDS highlighted progress in combating the epidemic, including the effectiveness of antiretroviral therapy in reducing transmission by 96%. Expanded access to interventions like HIV testing, counseling, and PMTCT has led to a decline in HIV-related mortality and incidence rates. The 2011 WHO report on global HIV/AIDS noted a 25% decrease in new infections compared to 1996. Challenges remain as there is no cure or vaccine, with 2.7 million new infections in 2010. The global adoption of WHO's Stop TB Strategy has led to treatment for 55 million TB patients and prevented 7 million deaths between 1995 and 2010. Global TB infection rates have been declining since 2002. The WHO report highlighted ongoing obstacles to TB control, including HIV/TB co-infection and drug-resistant TB. Outdated tools for diagnosis and treatment hinder further progress. The 2011 WHO report on global malaria emphasized effective scale-up of malaria control interventions, resulting in significant reductions in malaria cases in 43 countries since 2000. The WHO report highlighted obstacles in the fight against malaria in African countries, including low coverage rates of ITNs and IRS, access to ACTs, and drug and insecticide resistance. A study in The Lancet estimated 1.1 million malaria deaths in 2010, indicating a more severe epidemic than previously thought. HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria overlap geographically and share risk factors, presenting unique challenges that Congress may consider in the U.S. response to each disease. The U.S. response to HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria presents challenges in sustaining successes and addressing new policy issues. Improved access to anti-retroviral therapy has led to more people needing lifelong treatment, raising concerns about the financial sustainability of treatment programs. Congress may consider these challenges in the U.S. response to each disease. The expansion of ART to treat HIV/AIDS has significantly reduced AIDS-related mortality. UNAIDS estimates suggest that 2.5 million deaths in low- and middle-income countries have been averted since 1995. PEPFAR programs have focused on treatment, with 46% of funds supporting treatment efforts from FY2006 to FY2009. PEPFAR was directly supporting ART for over 3.9 million individuals in 30 countries as of September 2011. The Administration committed to treating an additional 4 million people in 2009. In 2009, the US committed to treating an additional 4 million people with HIV/AIDS by FY2014. President Obama later set a new target of treating 6 million by the end of 2013. Despite progress, new HIV infections outpaced treatment in 2010. The 6.7 million receiving treatment in 2010 represented 47% of those in need. The number of new HIV infections requiring treatment is expected to rise, leading to increased long-term treatment costs and potential drug resistance. Increased rates of drug resistance have led to the need for costly second-line therapies, which are 5-10 times more expensive than first-line drugs. Experts suggest scaling up prevention efforts to reduce HIV incidence. A 2011 HIV prevention trial showed that early ART initiation in discordant couples reduced HIV transmission by 96%, emphasizing the importance of treatment for prevention. This has shifted the focus from a dichotomous choice between treatment and prevention to a more balanced approach in allocating limited funding for global HIV/AIDS. The President's FY2013 budget request proposed decreased funding for bilateral global HIV/AIDS programs while reaffirming the goal of treating 6 million HIV-positive individuals by 2013. Experts emphasize the importance of allocating global HIV/AIDS funds efficiently, including the use of ART for treatment and prevention in combination with other prevention options. Prevention-specific activities, including biomedical, behavioral, and structural interventions, accounted for 22% of HIV/AIDS spending in low- and middle-income countries in 2009. Successful prevention methods include prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) and male circumcision. However, global prevention interventions are not adequately reaching key populations such as people who inject drugs, sex workers, and men who have sex with men (MSM). Many experts argue that expanding HIV testing and counseling is crucial to improve the effectiveness of HIV prevention efforts. PEPFAR has committed to preventing over 12 million new infections from FY2009 to FY2014 by scaling up combined interventions tailored to individual country epidemics, with a focus on PMTCT and male circumcision. Health experts call for increased U.S. support for HIV/AIDS prevention efforts, especially targeting high-risk groups. Additionally, experts urge the United States to enhance support for new methods to measure and evaluate infection trends and prevention. Many Members of Congress are divided on which prevention activities are most effective in HIV/AIDS programs. Some express concerns about supporting activities related to sex work or family planning. Health experts stress the importance of data-driven prevention programs tailored to specific country epidemics. Tuberculosis is a significant cause of infectious disease mortality globally. Tuberculosis is the second-leading cause of infectious disease mortality globally, following HIV/AIDS. Despite this, it receives less funding than HIV/AIDS or malaria. Challenges in global TB control include HIV/TB co-infection and drug-resistance, impacting diagnosis, treatment, and surveillance. WHO recommends the \"Three I's\" to address HIV/TB co-infection: Isoniazid Preventative Therapy, intensified case finding, and TB infection control for HIV-positive individuals. The global response to TB/HIV co-infection has been slow and uncoordinated, leading to limited access to diagnostic, prevention, and treatment services. PEPFAR has scaled up its HIV/TB activities, focusing on screening, testing, and counseling for TB patients. Integration of HIV and TB services remains a challenge. PEPFAR faces challenges in integrating HIV and TB services due to operational differences. Advocates call for WHO's \"Three I's\" to be mandated in high co-infection rate settings. Drug resistance in TB is mainly due to poor treatment adherence. In 2010, there were 650,000 cases of MDR-TB and 58 countries had XDR-TB cases. India reported cases of TB resistant to all available drugs in January 2012. In January 2012, India reported cases of TB resistant to all available drugs. Treatment for drug-resistant TB is more time-intensive and costly, posing challenges for low-resource countries. Without a scaled-up response, MDR- and XDR-TB could lead to increased TB-related mortality rates. The United States is beginning to address drug resistance, but there is debate on the extent of targeting these threats. Interventions for MDR- and XDR-TB strains are debated, with concerns about resources shifting from basic TB control efforts. There is a discrepancy in U.S. targets for TB and MDR-TB control between the Lantos-Hyde Act and the 2010 U.S. TB Strategy. Advocates urge Congress to support the original Lantos-Hyde goals. Recent data show reductions in global malaria cases and deaths, but new drug-resistant forms of malaria are emerging. New drug-resistant forms of malaria and insecticide-resistant mosquitoes threaten gains in global malaria control. Resistance to artemisinin-based malaria drugs has been identified in Asia, along the Thai-Cambodian and Thai-Myanmar borders. Mosquito resistance to insecticides used in Indoor Residual Spraying and insecticide-treated bed nets is increasing globally. Factors contributing to drug and insecticide resistance include misdiagnosis and improper medication use. Drug and insecticide resistance pose threats to U.S. malaria efforts, with factors including misdiagnosis, improper medication use, and counterfeit drugs. The U.S. is working with WHO to monitor resistance, promote judicious insecticide use, and support surveillance networks in Southeast Asia and the Americas. Experts call for increased commitment to reducing resistance and better surveillance systems. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation called for a global commitment to eradicate malaria in October 2007, reigniting the debate on malaria control, elimination, and eradication efforts. Key global health actors are discussing the practicality of these efforts, which can be classified into three levels: malaria control, elimination, and eradication. The World Health Organization categorizes countries into different stages of malaria control, pre-elimination, elimination, prevention of reintroduction, and malaria-free. The United States and its partners support the goal of universal malaria eradication and are increasing efforts in eligible countries. The President's Malaria Initiative (PMI) focuses on control activities but also supports pre-elimination efforts in specific areas like Zanzibar, Rwanda, and Senegal. Many health experts believe that malaria eradication by 2020 is not feasible with current tools and new strategies, medications, and a vaccine will be needed. Some argue that focusing on malaria elimination is a more realistic option, but it may pose challenges such as diverting funds from basic malaria control in high burden countries. Mass treatment for elimination without proper monitoring could lead to drug resistance. Malaria elimination requires appropriate monitoring and surveillance to prevent drug resistance. Governments and donors must ensure disease surveillance systems are in place even after elimination. Challenges extend to HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria, including health system strengthening, country ownership, research, monitoring, and engagement with organizations. Weak health systems hinder scaling up interventions for these diseases due to shortages of facilities, equipment, and personnel. Shortages of ART and inadequate laboratory facilities in high-burden TB countries have been reported in Africa. Inadequate clinical management and drug availability contribute to fatalities among hospitalized malaria patients. Health system strengthening is crucial for long-term approaches to HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria, but there is a lack of clarity on its implementation. There is a lack of clarity on the implementation of Health System Strengthening (HSS), with no international consensus on its definition. WHO identifies six critical building blocks for a health system. The U.S. approach to HSS aims to improve financial strategies, decrease health outcome disparities, and increase trained health workers. The U.S. approach to Health System Strengthening (HSS) aims to improve health management, information systems, and pharmaceutical systems to reduce stock-outs. Specific indicators for meeting these goals have not been identified yet, leading to concerns about the potential gap between rhetoric and reality in HSS activities. PEPFAR, PMI, and USAID TB programs have been integrated into national health systems to varying degrees. PEPFAR has supported the establishment of stand-alone systems and funded activities through international NGOs. PMI learned lessons from PEPFAR's early years. PMI activities have historically been better integrated than PEPFAR into established clinics and laboratories. PMI services have also been frequently combined with other maternal and child health care services. USAID's TB programs are often implemented by local groups and closely aligned with WHO TB initiatives. Debate about the impact of single disease initiatives on health systems has intensified. Some argue that U.S. single disease initiatives like PEPFAR have negatively affected national health systems by creating duplicative systems and diverting resources from general health services. However, others believe that these initiatives have positively impacted broader systems by increasing training of healthcare workers and improving health supply chains and facilities. Some experts argue that supporting single disease programs should not exclude support for health systems strengthening. The shortage of healthcare workers in countries facing HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria is a significant challenge for health systems. WHO reports that only 5 out of 49 low-income countries meet the minimum recommendation of healthcare workers per 1,000 people. Sub-Saharan Africa, with a high burden of these diseases, has a severe shortage of health workers. This shortage limits the number of patients who can receive testing, counseling, treatment, and care, leading to poor adherence and drug resistance. In resource-poor countries with high disease burdens, limited workforce capacity is a major challenge due to factors like brain drain, underinvestment in health workforces, and lack of educational opportunities. Efforts by U.S. HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria programs have addressed this issue through training and retraining encounters for health care workers, task-shifting, and support for existing health workers. In FY2009, USAID-funded programs trained 63,000 health care workers in TB interventions, including pre-service and in-service training. In FY2010, PMI trained over 36,000 health workers in malaria diagnosis and treatment with ACTs, sponsoring malaria-specific trainings for maternal and child health workers and community health workers. Critics debate the impact of single disease initiatives like PEPFAR on health workforce capacity. Critics argue that PEPFAR's focus on HIV/AIDS programs has limited impact on broader health systems, drawing health workers away from other public health needs. Short-term contracts and task-shifting used by PEPFAR programs may cause disruptions in treatment and care, without addressing underlying workforce constraints. The Lantos-Hyde Act recommends training and retaining over 140,000 new health workers by 2013 to deliver primary health care. The GHI consultation document aims to train 140,000 new health workers through HIV/AIDS programs by 2014. PEPFAR launched MEPI and NEPI to support this goal. Advocates suggest a higher target for training health workers to address shortages in various health programs. Some experts recommend performance incentives for health workers to improve primary health care skills and reduce attrition. The international community emphasizes \"country ownership\" of health programs to strengthen recipient governments and local civil society. The Lantos-Hyde Act and the Administration emphasize country ownership of health programs, including HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria efforts. Concerns have been raised about the feasibility of countries progressively owning U.S.-supported programs. PEPFAR has implemented Partnership Frameworks to promote host government commitment to these programs. PEPFAR has implemented Partnership Frameworks with countries to outline goals and commitments. The United States aims to shift aid to technical assistance for recipient governments to take on program management. PMI and USAID TB programs do not have formal agreements with recipient countries but align with national plans. The PMI and USAID TB programs align with national plans and support countries in taking greater control over disease control efforts. Questions remain about recipient countries' readiness to assume more responsibility, especially regarding HIV/AIDS. Some analysts doubt Congress will prefer recipient countries managing substantial resources for health care due to concerns about efficiency and misuse of funds. Partnership Frameworks' nonbinding nature raises questions about their effectiveness. A 2010 IOM report on PEPFAR's country ownership efforts found alignment with national HIV/AIDS strategies but highlighted operational challenges in managing global health programs. The United States provides significant funding for HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria programs through international contractors and private organizations instead of recipient governments. There are challenges in in-country capacity and differences in program evaluation indicators. Research and development for diagnostic, preventative, and treatment tools for these diseases are crucial, with the U.S. being the largest funder of global health R&D. The United States is the largest funder of global health R&D, contributing 45% of total global investment. NIH leads research on HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria, while USAID, DOD, and CDC conduct field research. FDA supports product development. R&D investments in HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria have shown progress. Existing R&D investments in HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria have led to progress in combatting the diseases, with developments like simpler HIV/AIDS drug regimens and long-lasting insecticide-treated bed nets for malaria control. Recent accomplishments include a 96% reduction in HIV transmission with early ART use, a 44% risk reduction in HIV infection with prophylactic treatment, and a 39% effectiveness in reducing HIV risk with a microbicide gel. WHO endorsed a new rapid diagnostic test for TB and MDR-TB in 2010, providing a diagnosis within 100 minutes. The development of a rapid diagnostic test for TB and MDR-TB funded by NIH provides results within 100 minutes, a significant improvement from existing tests that can take up to three months. Promising research on malaria vaccines is ongoing, with over a dozen candidates in clinical development and one by GlaxoSmithKline in clinical trials. However, outdated technologies continue to hinder progress in disease treatment, with expensive second- and third-line therapies for AIDS and challenges in nutritional intake for HIV/AIDS treatment. Many current TB diagnosis and treatment tools are outdated and ineffective, especially for poor individuals and families. Sputum smear microscopy, the most common method of TB diagnosis, is labor-intensive and unreliable. Treatment regimens for TB and drug-resistant forms can be lengthy and costly, requiring specialized facilities. Drug and insecticide resistance in malaria pose additional challenges to disease control. Many health experts believe U.S. funding for HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria research lags behind what is needed, particularly in basic TB diagnostics, new drugs for TB and malaria drug resistance, and an AIDS vaccine. The long-term nature of research complicates financial support efforts, and low incomes in affected countries deter private investment. Nonprofit ventures like Product Development Partnerships support research for health technologies in developing countries. Product Development Partnerships (PDPs) support research for drugs, vaccines, microbicides, and diagnostics for HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria. WHO and the United States provide significant funding for these efforts, but experts advocate for increased support for innovative R&D approaches. Operations research, which studies technology implementation in the field, is also seen as crucial for improving service delivery and intervention scale-up. Advocates emphasize the importance of operational research in improving prevention and treatment outcomes for HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria programs. There is a growing call for innovative approaches to testing the impact of early ART use as a prevention method. Monitoring and evaluation (M&E) are crucial components of global health initiatives, including the United States' strategies for HIV, TB, and malaria. The United States is working on making its HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria programs more results-based, with concerns raised about meeting these goals. Various evaluations have been mandated by the Lantos-Hyde Act and Congress, including a comprehensive assessment of U.S. HIV/AIDS programs' impact on health. Reports from IOM and GAO have analyzed PEPFAR's program planning and delivery of services in focus countries. The GAO released reports in July 2011 analyzing PEPFAR's program planning and in September 2010 analyzing efforts to align PEPFAR programs with partner countries' HIV/AIDS strategies. The evaluation of PMI from FY2006-FY2010 concluded it was largely successful and made progress towards its goals, with recommendations for expansion and improvement. The U.S. is enhancing its monitoring and evaluation of HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria programs through initiatives like PEPFAR's \"Next Generation Indicators\" to track outcomes and impacts more effectively. Congress has not mandated systematic reviews of USAID TB programs beyond annual reports. The U.S. is improving monitoring and evaluation of HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria programs through initiatives like PEPFAR's \"Next Generation Indicators\" to focus on program and population coverage, program quality, and standardizing data collection internationally. USAID is collaborating with WHO for TB-related M&E activities. The WHO and USAID are working together to standardize TB control indicators and improve national M&E systems. Challenges remain in collecting timely and high-quality data, especially in resource-poor countries with weak health information systems. Malaria M&E efforts are hindered by gaps in tracking childhood health and treatment-seeking behavior. Efforts to monitor and evaluate TB and HIV co-infection rates face challenges due to limited information sharing between programs. Drug-resistant TB strains also hinder M&E in resource-poor countries. Evaluating the outcomes of U.S. global health programs is complicated by interactions with other donors. Factors influencing health systems and national governments make measuring progress and impact difficult. Many experts urge the United States to develop specific indicators for measuring the effectiveness of activities related to health systems strengthening, country ownership, and HIV prevention. Calls have been made for regular and comprehensive monitoring and evaluation of HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria programs, along with increased support for in-country data collection and assessment. Improving data transparency and alignment of health indicators with multilateral organizations and national governments is also recommended. Supporting the use of national information systems for monitoring and evaluation is seen as a way to strengthen these systems and enhance country capacity. The United States supports global HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria efforts through bilateral programs and partnerships with multilateral organizations. Members of Congress have debated the balance between funding bilateral and multilateral global health efforts, particularly regarding support for the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria. The Global Fund receives support from various donors, including governments and organizations. The United States is the largest donor, pledging $4 billion over three years in 2010. The Obama Administration has shown support for increased engagement with multilateral organizations like the Global Fund. The FY2013 budget request includes a 27% increase in funding for the Global Fund over estimated FY2012 levels. Despite limited resources, the Global Fund has implemented a \"Transitional Funding Mechanism\" to prevent gaps in services. The Global Fund has implemented a Transitional Funding Mechanism (TFM) to secure funding for programs facing disruptions in services between 2012 and 2014. Experts argue for increased multilateral funding from donors like the United States to prevent imperiling lives and setbacks in progress against diseases. Advocates suggest that supporting multilateral organizations gives recipient countries greater control over programs. Some argue for increased multilateral funding to prevent disruptions in services and setbacks in progress against diseases. Multilaterals offer greater control to recipient countries, flexibility to respond to local needs, and the ability to pool resources for more effective spending. They can also provide multi-year support for diseases like HIV/AIDS. U.S. engagement in multilateral organizations showcases leadership in global health and encourages global cooperation. The President's decision to increase funding for the Global Fund in the FY2013 budget is applauded. Some argue for bilateral assistance to target health aid more effectively, while others support multilateral funding for its flexibility and pooling of resources. Concerns about corruption in multilateral organizations like the Global Fund are ongoing. The 112th Congress will likely debate funding for global HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria programs. Discussions in Congress may focus on funding for global HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria programs, as well as assessing the impact and efficiency of these programs. Tradeoffs between investing in low-cost interventions like bednets versus higher-cost interventions like antiretroviral therapy may be considered. The United States may need to prioritize funding for global health programs addressing high-mortality issues like drug-resistant TB and widespread issues like malaria infection. Policymakers must balance funding between high-impact activities like ART programs and health systems strengthening for long-term progress. The US plays a crucial role in combating HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria globally, despite some calls for cuts in global health funding to reduce the deficit. Many supporters argue for U.S. leadership in combating global HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria, emphasizing potential negative consequences of divestment. Some note that European countries donate more as a share of GDP for these diseases. US leadership is crucial for sustaining the Global Fund's activities. Advocates stress the importance of U.S. leadership in supporting the Global Fund's efforts against HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria. They urge other countries like China, India, Brazil, and Saudi Arabia to increase their contributions to achieve the UN Millennium Development Goal. There is debate on how U.S. leadership can encourage greater involvement in global health efforts. Congressional consideration of U.S. HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria programs may be influenced by their role in broader foreign policy. These diseases have humanitarian, economic, and security implications, threatening political stability and U.S. interests. Global health efforts like PEPFAR serve as diplomatic tools, enhancing the U.S. image abroad. However, some caution against overemphasizing the security and diplomatic aspects of these diseases. The Global Health Initiative (GHI) goals for HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria programs include providing support for millions on treatment, preventing new infections, ensuring testing and treatment coverage, and doubling the number of at-risk babies born HIV-free. Concerns have been raised about overly emphasizing security and diplomatic implications, potentially leading to funding allocation based on U.S. interests rather than human need. The Global Health Initiative aims to support HIV-positive mothers to give birth to HIV-negative babies, provide care for millions, train healthcare workers, and involve partner governments in evaluating needs. The U.S. TB Strategy targets a 50% reduction in TB deaths, detection and treatment of cases, and treating 2.6 million new patients by 2014. The U.S. TB Strategy aims to reduce TB deaths by 50% and treat 2.6 million new patients by 2014. The U.S. Malaria Strategy targets halving the burden of malaria in sub-Saharan Africa and limiting the spread of drug resistance. The U.S. aims to integrate malaria prevention with other health programs, strengthen health systems, update National Malaria Control Strategies, and focus on a woman-centered approach for malaria activities.
