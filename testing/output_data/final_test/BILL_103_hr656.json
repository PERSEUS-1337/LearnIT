    "content": "The Act titled \"Marine Mammal Capture, Export, and Public Display Protection Act of 1993\" amends the Animal Welfare Act to include provisions related to the protection of marine mammals. The Act imposes civil or criminal penalties for violations related to marine mammals, defers to state laws providing greater protection, and defines marine mammals as per the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972. The Secretary of Agriculture must review and revise standards within 180 days of the Act's enactment. The Agriculture department will review the Animal Welfare Act standards for marine mammals in captivity to ensure adequate living conditions based on various factors like size, physiology, behavior, social grouping, and interspecies compatibility. The Agriculture department will review Animal Welfare Act standards for marine mammals in captivity to ensure humane handling, care, treatment, and transportation. This includes considerations for size, physiology, behavior, social grouping, interspecies compatibility, and environmental modifications for normal behavior and social interaction. The Marine Mammal Tracking System is established under Section 3. The Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 is amended to include a tracking system for marine mammals in captivity in the United States. This system will monitor their location, assign registration numbers, and verify their location annually. The Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 is amended to include a tracking system for marine mammals in captivity in the United States. The system will provide summaries of information on the status of marine mammals collected through the tracking system and impose a moratorium on takings in U.S. waters. The Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 is amended to include regulations for tracking marine mammals in U.S. waters. Penalties for violations are specified, and definitions for key terms are provided. SEC. 4. LIMITATIONS ON EXPORTATION OF MARINE MAMMALS. The Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 is amended to require a permit for exporting marine mammals from the United States. This includes changes to sections 102(a), 103(a), and 104 of the Act.

SEC. 5. LIMITATIONS ON SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH PERMITS. Section 104(c)(3) of the Marine Mammal Protection Act is amended to require permits for scientific research on marine mammals to demonstrate a bona fide scientific purpose without unnecessary duplication. Permits for research involving surgical procedures or lethal taking are only allowed if the research directly benefits the species and nonlethal methods are not feasible. Permits for scientific research on marine mammals require a bona fide scientific purpose without unnecessary duplication. Release of captured marine mammals must occur in the vicinity of capture or in the natural environment of the species. The Secretary gives preference to simultaneous releases of marine mammals at the same location and requires permanent marking of released mammals. The Marine Mammal Protection Act requires that each marine mammal used for scientific research purposes must be permanently marked for easy identification. Permits for research are effective for up to 2 years, with the possibility of extension if deemed necessary for long-term studies. These amendments apply to permits issued after the enactment of the Act."
