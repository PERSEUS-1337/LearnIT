Operators must disclose covered information unless it is for preschool or prekindergarten purposes, legal compliance, judicial processes, user safety, or site security. Further disclosure is only allowed for operability within the classroom or when legally required. To protect user safety, operators can disclose information to service providers under specific conditions. Operators can use information for site maintenance and improvement. Operators must ensure service providers only use information for contracted services and maintain security measures. Operators must implement security procedures to protect covered information from unauthorized access, deletion upon request, and disclosure in compliance with federal and state laws. Operators must protect covered information from unauthorized access, deletion, and disclosure as required by state and federal laws. Covered information can be shared for legitimate research purposes or with educational agencies for preschool and prekindergarten purposes. Operators can use deidentified pupil information within their own platforms to improve educational products. To demonstrate product effectiveness, operators can share aggregated deidentified pupil information for educational site improvement. \"Covered information\" includes personally identifiable materials provided by pupils or guardians for preschool purposes. Cloud computing services must comply with regulations if they meet the operator definition. The curr_chunk states that information created or provided by educational staff to an operator must comply with regulations. The curr_chunk describes the types of information gathered by an operator that identifies a pupil, including personal details, educational records, contact information, discipline records, test results, and more. The section defines \"preschool or prekindergarten purposes\" as activities directed by the school for instructional, administrative, or collaborative purposes. It clarifies that law enforcement can still access information as authorized by law or court order and allows operators to use pupil data for adaptive learning or customized early learning. This section excludes general audience websites, services, and applications from the regulations. It also allows Internet service providers to offer connectivity to preschools and prekindergartens. Operators can market educational products to parents as long as it is not based on covered information obtained through their services. This section exempts providers of electronic stores, gateways, and marketplaces from enforcing compliance with the regulations. It also does not require interactive computer service providers to ensure compliance by third-party content providers. Additionally, it does not restrict pupils from saving their own data. The chapter will be effective on July 1, 2017, and the provisions of the act are severable."
