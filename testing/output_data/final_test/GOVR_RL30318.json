    "content": "The social security number (SSN) was initially used for tracking contributions to the Social Security program but has now become a widely used personal identification number. SSNs are collected by government agencies to verify eligibility for benefits and by private entities for various purposes such as obtaining a driver's license, applying for public assistance, or accessing insurance records. The original Social Security Act of 1935 did not mention the use of SSNs but authorized record-keeping. Section 807(b) allowed for tax collection methods prescribed by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue. Section 808 granted authority to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue. The Social Security Act of 1935 authorized record-keeping and granted the Commissioner of Internal Revenue the authority to make rules for enforcement. The Bureau of Internal Revenue then required the issuance of an account number to each employee covered by the program, leading to the use of the SSN as a federal identifier based on Executive Order 9397. The Executive Order mandated the use of Social Security account numbers for federal identification purposes, aiming to streamline administration and avoid multiple systems. This decision was influenced by the consideration of establishing a numerical identification system for all Federal employees by the Civil Service Commission. The Executive Order mandated the use of Social Security account numbers for federal identification purposes. The Civil Service Commission adopted the SSN for Federal employees in 1961, and the IRS followed suit in 1962 for taxpayer identification. President George W. Bush amended Executive Order 9397 on November 18, 2008, making the use of Social Security Numbers (SSN) by federal agencies voluntary rather than mandatory. This change aimed to protect personal identifiers against unlawful use. While individuals are often required to disclose their SSN when dealing with government entities, possession of an SSN is not a condition of U.S. citizenship. In the United States, possession of a Social Security Number (SSN) is not a requirement for citizenship. Individuals can apply for an SSN when needed, as federal and state laws may require its disclosure for various activities such as tax matters, government programs, and obtaining a driver's license. While one can choose not to disclose an SSN in some situations, it may result in forgoing certain benefits. An SSN is necessary for tax credits and work in the United States. Employers must verify eligibility by asking for a Social Security card and reporting the employee's SSN on forms. Different types of Social Security cards are available based on authorization to work in the U.S. Individuals lawfully admitted to the United States can receive a Social Security card with specific restrictions based on their work authorization status. Those without work authorization but with a valid non-work reason for needing an SSN can also obtain a card for certain purposes like government benefits. The SSA does not assign SSNs solely for obtaining a driver's license, credit check, or filing taxes, suggesting the use of ITINs instead. Federal agencies are increasingly recognizing the risks of identity theft associated with Social Security Numbers (SSNs). Organizations use SSNs for authentication, but steps are being taken to reduce exposure, such as truncating SSNs on benefit statements and assigning random account numbers instead of SSNs for Federal Thrift Savings Plan beneficiaries. Concerns have been raised about the increased risk of identity theft for individuals carrying federal ID or program cards with SSNs. Individuals carrying federal ID or program cards with SSNs are at risk of identity theft. In 2009, the U.S. Government Accountability Office reported that millions of cards, including Medicare, Department of Defense, and Veteran Affairs cards, displayed SSNs. The VA and DOD have taken steps to remove SSNs from cards, with the VA planning to eliminate them by late 2016. The Office of the Inspector General recommended removing SSNs from Medicare cards by late 2016 due to identity theft risks. The transition to a non-SSN based Medicare identifier was estimated to cost over $300 million. The OIG report recommended removing SSNs from Medicare cards to prevent identity theft risks, estimated to cost over $300 million. SSA should proactively support legislation for this change and work with CMS to develop an alternative identifier. In August 2012, the House Ways and Means Committee discussed options to remove SSNs from Medicare cards, with CMS estimating an $845 million cost. GAO suggested cost-effective solutions like truncating the number or using a new \"Medicare Beneficiary Identifier.\" The House passed the Medicare Identity Theft Prevention Act of 2012 to address concerns, but as of September 2013, CMS had not taken steps to remove SSNs from Medicare cards. The technology project aims to remove SSNs from Medicare cards and address identity theft concerns related to the Death Master File (DMF). Congress has restricted access to the DMF, a database of over 85 million death records, to reduce identity theft. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 directs the Secretary of Commerce to create a certification program for accessing DMF data for deceased individuals. The certification program for accessing Death Master File (DMF) data requires individuals to prove a legitimate fraud prevention interest or business purpose. Penalties of up to $250,000 may be imposed for improper disclosure or use of DMF data. Various bills in the 113th Congress aimed to limit the use of Social Security Numbers (SSNs) to prevent identity theft. Concerns about SSN usage date back to the 1970s, prompting congressional action to restrict government and private entity access. The SSN has evolved beyond just a \"social security number\" due to increased uses in recent years. The Social Security Number (SSN) has evolved into a widely used numerical identifier in society, with adults needing it for various functions. In 1973, recommendations were made to inform individuals of the legal requirement to disclose their SSN and to prevent denial of benefits for refusal. The Privacy Act of 1974 was a legislative step towards limiting compulsory SSN disclosure. The Privacy Act of 1974 aimed to restrict government agencies from using Social Security Numbers (SSNs) as personal identifiers to protect individual privacy. It prohibited agencies from denying rights or benefits based on refusal to disclose SSNs, although exemptions limited its effectiveness. The Privacy Act of 1974 aimed to restrict government agencies from using Social Security Numbers (SSNs) as personal identifiers to protect individual privacy. The act exempts certain disclosures required by federal statute or to verify identity. Under Section 7(b) of the Privacy Act, government agencies must inform individuals if providing their SSN is mandatory or voluntary. Courts have granted declaratory relief for violations of Section 7, which does not explicitly provide remedies. The Privacy Act of 1974 restricts government agencies from using SSNs as personal identifiers to protect privacy. Courts have granted relief for violations of the act, requiring proof of harm for statutory awards under Section 7. Government entities cannot require SSNs unless specific conditions are met. In 1976, Congress modified the Privacy Act to allow states to use SSNs for various purposes, including tax, public assistance, driver's license, and vehicle registration laws. The government can request SSNs if specific conditions are met, and must disclose how the number will be used. The Privacy Act was modified in 1976 to allow states to use SSNs for various purposes. Section 1211(c) of the Tax Reform Act amended the Internal Revenue Code to use the SSN as the identifying number for individuals for tax purposes. The Privacy Act and the Tax Reform Act in 1976 allowed for the use of SSNs as identifying numbers for tax purposes. The Privacy Protection Study Commission found that restrictions on SSN use had little impact on government agencies, preserving the widespread collection and use of SSNs. Recent congressional enactments have increased confidentiality of SSNs in public records. The confidentiality of social security account numbers obtained by authorized persons after October 1, 1990 is protected by federal laws, with penalties for unauthorized disclosures. The Driver's Privacy Protection Act restricts the distribution of SSNs from state driver records. Certain highly restricted information, including SSNs, may not be disclosed by state DMVs without individual consent. Violations of these provisions can result in criminal punishment and private legal action. The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and other federal laws protect personal information, including social security numbers (SSNs), from unauthorized disclosure. Exemption 6 of the FOIA allows agencies to withhold records that invade personal privacy. Laws like the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) and the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act limit access to SSNs for permissible purposes. Consumers can also request to exclude the first five digits of their SSN from credit reports. The privacy laws such as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, HIPAA, and FERPA regulate the sharing of personally identifiable information, including SSNs. Educational institutions need written permission to release SSNs from student records. Not all colleges and universities comply with these laws. FERPA regulates the use of a student's SSN in educational records. Many schools have stopped displaying SSNs on identification cards, class rosters, and for posting grades. In a case against Rutgers University, students sued to prevent the dissemination of class rosters with SSNs. The Social Security Administration audited schools' collection of SSNs for K-12 students, recommending a coordinated effort to address the issue. The auditors recommended informing schools about the risks of collecting unnecessary SSNs and implementing stringent safeguards. Court challenges to SSN collection by government agencies have mostly been unsuccessful. Displaying SSNs in online public records has faced successful court challenges, especially when fundamental rights are involved. Courts have struggled to find a constitutionally protected privacy interest in Social Security Numbers (SSNs) due to their widespread dissemination in public and private records. Challenges to SSN collection requirements on constitutional grounds have generally not been successful, as courts have upheld the legality of requiring SSNs for various purposes, such as on driver's license applications and for welfare recipients. The legality of requiring Social Security Numbers (SSNs) for various purposes has been upheld by courts, including for welfare recipients and in court filings by non-attorney bankruptcy preparers. The Supreme Court of Montana ruled that a state statute mandating the last four digits of a person's SSN for a wildlife conservation license did not violate privacy rights. Additionally, an employee's refusal to provide her SSN to her employer did not constitute a violation of her constitutional right to privacy. The legality of requiring Social Security Numbers (SSNs) for various purposes has been upheld by courts, including for welfare recipients and in court filings by non-attorney bankruptcy preparers. In a case involving a federal requirement imposed on states, Michigan challenged a provision in the Welfare Reform Act that requires states to collect SSNs for driver's licenses and other state licenses. The purpose is to prevent fraud in federal welfare programs. The Michigan Department of State challenged a federal requirement to collect Social Security Numbers (SSNs) for driver's licenses and other state licenses to track delinquent child support payments. The court upheld the requirement as constitutional, stating it was related to the federal interest in nationwide child support collection. The United States Supreme Court upheld the Driver's Privacy Protection Act of 1994 as constitutional, restricting states from disclosing a driver's personal information without consent. South Carolina's statute allowing the sale of driver information was found to violate the DPPA's restrictions on interstate commerce regulation. The Supreme Court upheld the Driver's Privacy Protection Act of 1994, which restricts states from disclosing driver's personal information without consent. In Greidinger v. Davis, the court addressed SSN collection and dissemination issues, finding that while it's not a violation of privacy rights, Virginia failed to comply with the Privacy Act by not specifying the disclosure's nature and purpose. The court found Virginia's practice of making voter records, including SSNs, available for public inspection burdens the fundamental right to vote. Although Virginia's rationale for collecting SSNs was to prevent voter fraud, the court ruled that the policy was not narrowly tailored to the state's interest. As a result, further dissemination of voters' SSNs was barred. This ruling was specific to the burden on the right to vote, not because the public availability of SSNs was per se unconstitutional. In another case, the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals held that a Virginia statute prohibiting the intentional publication of a person's information was constitutional. The court in v. Cuccinelli ruled that a Virginia statute prohibiting the intentional publication of a person's social security number online violated the First Amendment's protection of free speech. The plaintiff, Ostergren, a privacy advocate, published public land records revealing SSNs of public officials on her website. The court applied strict scrutiny, stating that drawing attention to the problem of unredacted SSNs in public records was valuable speech. Virginia was allowed to enforce the statute against Ostergren. The court ruled in favor of Ostergren, stating that Virginia cannot punish her for posting publicly available online land records with SSNs, as it violated her First Amendment rights. Recent court cases have increasingly balanced the public's right to know with protecting personal information privacy. For example, in Sherman v. U.S. Dep't of the Army, courts have sided with protecting informational privacy in FOIA requests for unredacted SSNs. The court ruled that disclosing unredacted SSNs would invade personal privacy and increase the risk of identity theft. Similar decisions have been made in other cases, such as denying public access to SSNs and dates of birth of state employees. The court used a balancing test to determine if employees' non-disclosure outweighed the public's right to know under the state statute. Disclosure of personal information was found not to significantly serve the purpose of ensuring public confidence in government. Private sector uses of SSNs include credit risk assessment, patient care tracking, locating bankruptcy assets, and background checks for new employees. Private businesses and organizations may request an individual's SSN for various transactions, such as insurance policies, hospital admissions, car purchases, and utility accounts. While federal statutes do not restrict private sector use of SSNs, individuals can refuse to provide their SSN, and businesses can choose not to provide goods or services in return. There is no federal law prohibiting private entities from requiring an SSN, but accommodations can sometimes be made to use alternative identifiers. Private businesses may request an individual's SSN for transactions, but federal law does not prohibit this practice. State laws may restrict SSN use. The USA PATRIOT Act requires financial institutions to verify identities for new accounts. Financial institutions are required by the USA PATRIOT Act to implement a Customer Identification Program (CIP) that includes obtaining an individual's name, date of birth, address, and SSN. Some states have laws restricting the use of SSNs in various contexts. California was the first state to pass such a law. California was the first state to pass a law prohibiting the public display and printing of SSNs by certain businesses. Other states have followed suit with similar laws, some going further to restrict the solicitation and disclosure of SSNs. Concerns have been raised about the impact of technology on SSN usage. Organizations selling personal information, including SSNs, benefit from technological advances in computer technology. Laws in many states require notification of residents in case of security breaches releasing personal information. Several states, including Rico and the Virgin Islands, have implemented laws with similar requirements regarding the use of Social Security Numbers. Federal developments related to SSN usage are detailed in the following chronology."
