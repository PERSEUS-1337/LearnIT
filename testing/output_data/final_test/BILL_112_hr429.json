SEC. 3. DEDUCTION FOR PREMIUMS PAID BY FEHBP NON-EMPLOYEE ENROLLEES. An amendment to the Internal Revenue Code allows for a deduction for premiums paid for FEHBP coverage by non-employee enrollees. In the case of an individual, a deduction is allowed for premiums paid during the taxable year for health insurance coverage for the taxpayer, spouse, and dependents under chapter 89A of title 5, United States Code. Coordination rules apply to prevent double deductions and the deduction is not allowed for self-employment tax purposes. The deduction allowed for health insurance premiums under chapter 89A of title 5, United States Code is not considered in determining an individual's net earnings from self-employment. Premiums paid for FEHBP coverage are deductible in computing adjusted gross income. A clerical amendment renumbers section 224 to 225 and adds a new item for section 224 in the table of sections. The Director of the Office of Personnel Management will submit a plan to Congress for the extension of the Federal Employee Health Benefits Program within 6 months of the Act's enactment. The plan will include the implementation of amendments and a schedule of actions to be taken."
