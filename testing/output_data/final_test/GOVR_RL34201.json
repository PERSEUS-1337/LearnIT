    "content": "The Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) is the primary federal law for protecting public water supplies from contaminants. Administered by the EPA, it regulates contaminants, funds infrastructure projects, and promotes water system compliance. EPA can delegate enforcement authority to states and tribes. Public Water Supply Supervision (PWSS) program is the basic regulation program for water systems, delegated to all states except Wyoming and the District of Columbia. The Safe Drinking Water Act delegates the Public Water Supply Supervision program to all states except Wyoming and the District of Columbia. EPA is responsible for implementing the program in these areas and regulating underground injection of wastes to protect drinking water sources. Progress has been made in regulating 91 contaminants, with more regulations pending. EPA has lead enforcement authority in 10 states, while 33 states have assumed primacy for the underground injection control program. Despite progress in regulating 91 drinking water contaminants, concerns and challenges remain. EPA's 2006 report showed that 93% of public water systems had no health-based violations, but only 62% of violations were reported to the EPA database. Efforts to improve data quality and reporting continue, as tens of thousands of violations of SDWA requirements still occur each year. Thousands of violations of SDWA requirements occur each year, including monitoring, reporting, standards, and treatment techniques. Concerns exist over EPA's review and update of contaminant regulations, potential health effects of unregulated contaminants like perchlorate and MTBE, and the need for continual evaluation and periodic review of standards. EPA's perceived lack of action is a point of concern. The Safe Drinking Water Act Amendments of 1996 (P.L. 104-182) revised the act to address criticisms of inflexibility and unfunded mandates. Key provisions included the establishment of a drinking water state revolving loan fund program, a process for selecting contaminants for regulation based on health risk, and schedules for regulating certain contaminants. EPA's perceived lack of action on specific contaminants has generated criticism. The 1996 Safe Drinking Water Act Amendments established schedules for regulating contaminants like arsenic and radon, aimed at building water system capacity to comply with regulations. States were required to develop programs for source water assessment, operator certification, and compliance capacity development. Community water systems must provide annual consumer confidence reports on regulated contaminants. Funding for SDWA programs was authorized through FY2003, with no broad reauthorization bills proposed since then. In 2002, Congress added drinking water security provisions to the Safe Drinking Water Act through the Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act. This required community water systems serving more than 3,300 people to conduct vulnerability assessments and prepare emergency response plans. The EPA was also tasked with researching prevention and response to terrorist attacks. In 2009, the House passed the Chemical and Water Security Act to establish risk-based performance standards for water and wastewater utilities. The Safe Drinking Water Act added security provisions in 2002, requiring community water systems to conduct vulnerability assessments and emergency response plans. Federal regulations apply to over 154,000 water systems serving at least 25 people. This includes community water systems serving a total population of 294 million, non-transient non-community water systems, and transient non-community water systems. The Safe Drinking Water Act added security provisions in 2002, requiring water systems to conduct vulnerability assessments and emergency response plans. There are over 154,000 water systems serving at least 25 people, including community water systems, non-transient non-community water systems, and transient non-community water systems. Among these systems, roughly 83% of community water systems serve 3,300 or fewer people, while 8% serve more than 10,000 people. Additionally, 85% of non-transient, non-community water systems and 97% of transient non-community water systems serve 500 or fewer people. Recent drinking water safety issues include funding gaps for infrastructure, compliance challenges for public water systems, and contamination by unregulated substances like perchlorate and pharmaceuticals. Groundwater protection concerns involve proposals for carbon dioxide storage, hydraulic fracturing for oil and gas, and their potential impacts. The 111th Congress amended the Safe Drinking Water Act with the Reduction of Lead in Drinking Water Act, reducing the allowed amount of lead in water pipes, plumbing fittings, and fixtures to 0.25%. This legislation aims to further reduce lead exposure in drinking water. The 111th Congress amended the Safe Drinking Water Act to reduce lead content in water pipes, fittings, and fixtures to 0.25%. Funding bills were also passed, including $2 billion from ARRA for drinking water infrastructure projects. States are required to allocate 20% of DWSRF grants for green infrastructure or energy efficiency projects. The 111th Congress amended the Safe Drinking Water Act to reduce lead content in water pipes, fittings, and fixtures to 0.25%. Funding bills were passed, including $2 billion from ARRA for drinking water infrastructure projects. Congress extended EPA funding at FY2010 levels through March 4, 2011. Senate and House committees reported bills related to water infrastructure financing and quality. The Safe Drinking Water Act was amended by the 111th Congress to reduce lead content in water pipes, fittings, and fixtures to 0.25%. Funding bills were passed, including $2 billion from ARRA for drinking water infrastructure projects. EPA published a draft list of unregulated contaminants in 2008, including 93 chemicals and 11 microbiological contaminants. The EPA screened 7,500 chemicals and selected 104 candidates for the draft Contaminant Candidate List 3 (CCL 3), which included agricultural chemicals, biological toxins, disinfection byproducts, and pathogens. The final CCL 3 added 10 pharmaceuticals, including one antibiotic, nine hormones, and three microbes. EPA is required to evaluate whether to regulate at least five contaminants from the CCL every five years. The EPA evaluated contaminants from the candidate list, regulating those of public health concern with meaningful risk reduction opportunities. In 2008, final determinations for 11 contaminants from CCL 2 were made, all decisions not to regulate due to low occurrence frequencies not presenting health risk reduction opportunities. EPA is updating health advisories for contaminants with new information or degradation details. The EPA did not make determinations for perchlorate and MTBE, two chemicals detected in water supplies. The health risk assessment for MTBE is being revised, and the Obama Administration decided not to further review perchlorate. EPA published a notice seeking public comment on analyzing health effects and occurrence data. The EPA is seeking public comment on analyzing health effects and occurrence data for perchlorate, focusing on potential exposure for infants, young children, pregnant women, and fetuses. Legislation has been proposed to establish a drinking water standard for perchlorate and to study water resources in California for perchlorate sources. Additionally, the 1996 amendments directed EPA to establish criteria for monitoring unregulated contaminants. The EPA collects data on unregulated contaminants in drinking water every five years, monitoring up to 30 contaminants based on candidate lists. Systems serving over 10,000 people must monitor for these contaminants, with data added to the National Contaminant Occurrence Database. Two rules, UCMR 1 and UCMR 2, required monitoring for various chemicals. Perchlorate was initially included in UCMR 2 but later removed, sparking criticism from advocates for further monitoring. The 1996 amendments to the Safe Drinking Water Act focused on regulating contaminants with the greatest health risks. The EPA is directed to establish regulations for contaminants that may have adverse health effects, are likely to occur in public water systems at concerning levels, and can be reduced to improve public health. Drinking water regulations set numerical standards for contaminant levels in public water systems. The EPA establishes regulations for contaminants in public water systems based on health risks and feasibility. This involves estimating occurrence, evaluating exposure risks, ensuring monitoring methods, assessing treatment costs, and considering impacts on public health and the economy. The EPA sets nonenforceable maximum contaminant level goals (MCLGs) based on health effects studies, with a focus on protecting sensitive populations. MCLGs are then used to establish enforceable maximum contaminant levels (MCLs) as close to the MCLG as feasible for water systems. The EPA sets nonenforceable maximum contaminant level goals (MCLGs) based on health effects studies to protect sensitive populations. The MCL must be set as close to the MCLG as feasible, considering costs, using the best available technology. Congress expects standards to be less affordable for smaller water systems. In 1996, Congress expanded the act's variance and exemption provisions to give small water systems compliance flexibility. EPA may establish less stringent standards if benefits do not justify costs, as seen with arsenic and radium standards. Recent rulemaking includes requirements for controlling pathogens and disinfectants in water systems. The EPA has implemented rules to control pathogens and disinfectants in water systems, including the Long Term 2 Enhanced Surface Water Treatment Rule (LT2 Rule) and the Stage 2 Disinfectant and Disinfection Byproduct Rule (Stage 2 DBP). These rules aim to reduce health risks for consumers but may require communities to expand treatment facilities to comply. Additionally, the EPA revised the Lead and Copper Rule (LCR) in 2007. In 2007, the EPA revised the Lead and Copper Rule (LCR) to address weaknesses identified after high lead levels were found in Washington, DC tap water in 2004. The changes included regulatory requirements for monitoring, treatment, customer notification, and lead service line replacement. EPA is also revising the Total Coliform Rule and finalizing a radon rule. EPA is working on finalizing a radon rule and evaluating new contaminants like perchlorate and MTBE for regulation. They are re-evaluating potential perchlorate exposure for infants, young children, pregnant women, and fetuses. EPA is also updating risk assessments and regulations for chromium, with the current standard set at 100 parts per billion to protect against allergic dermatitis. The EPA is re-evaluating the chromium standard, specifically focusing on chromium-6 which is now known to cause cancer if ingested. In 2008, EPA began reviewing the standard and in September 2010, released a draft human health assessment for chromium-6. The agency will use this assessment to determine whether a drinking water standard for chromium-6 is needed. The EPA is re-evaluating the need for a drinking water standard for chromium-6, which is known to cause cancer if ingested. Monitoring technologies have detected traces of pharmaceuticals and personal care products in water supplies, released through various means like waste disposal and industrial discharges. Research is ongoing to understand the occurrence of these chemicals in the environment. The presence of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) in public water supplies raises concerns due to their potential health risks. These products contain chemical compounds that can disrupt the endocrine system, affecting growth, development, reproduction, and metabolism in humans, animals, and plants. Scientists are increasingly worried about the impact of low-level PPCP exposure on aquatic organisms and potentially on human health. The USGS and EPA have identified research needs to understand the impact of PPCPs on aquatic organisms and human health. Research has shown that a wide range of these chemicals are commonly found downstream from urban and animal production areas. Pharmaceutical manufacturing facilities are significant sources of pharmaceuticals in the environment. EPA is conducting research on the importance of different sources of PPCPs in the environment. Research is being conducted to understand the impact of PPCPs on aquatic organisms and human health. Studies focus on sources of PPCPs, their movement in the environment, exposure pathways, monitoring tools, health effects, and ecological risks. EPA is also evaluating drinking water treatment technologies' ability to remove PPCPs and studying their discharge into wastewater treatment plants. Additionally, research is ongoing to develop analytical methods for tracking PPCPs in the environment, with a particular emphasis on ecological risks for aquatic life. Exposure risks for aquatic life are greater than for humans. Research gaps include the need for tests to detect subtle health effects from low doses of PPCPs. EPA proposed a list of unregulated contaminants in 2008, none of which were pharmaceuticals. Recent reports of pharmaceuticals in drinking water prompted evaluation by EPA's Science Advisory Board and stakeholders. The EPA made changes to the Contaminant Candidate List 3 based on recommendations and new data, adding 10 pharmaceuticals including erythromycin and nine hormones. Water suppliers and stakeholders are considering changes at wastewater treatment plants to address the issue of pharmaceutical contaminants in drinking water. The Association of Metropolitan Water Agencies has made recommendations to tackle this emerging problem. The AMWA has recommended prioritizing research on treatment technologies for pharmaceutical contaminants in drinking water, urging water utilities to inform consumers of monitoring efforts. They also called for determining the health and environmental effects of trace pharmaceuticals, developing a national program for disposing of unused prescriptions, and reducing antibiotics and steroids from animal feeding operations in water supplies. Several bills in the 111th Congress addressed this issue. The 111th Congress introduced bills addressing research on contaminants of emerging concern in water resources, including pharmaceuticals. The House Appropriations Committee report encouraged EPA to develop a plan to address these contaminants systematically. EPA was directed to publish a list of chemicals for screening in the Endocrine Disruptor Screening Program, including pharmaceutical contaminants like PPCPs. In July 2010, the House Energy and Commerce Committee reported H.R. 5320, the Assistance, Quality, and Affordability Act of 2010. The bill aimed to revise the Endocrine Disruptor Screening Program, require EPA to list 100 substances for screening, set testing schedules, and prioritize substances. It also directed EPA to study PPCPs in drinking water sources and their effects on the environment and human health. Another bill, H.R. 276, proposed convening a task force to recommend proper disposal of unused pharmaceuticals to protect water sources. EPA is currently operating under a continuing resolution through March 4, 2011. The Water Infrastructure Financing Act of 2009 aimed to study sources of PPCPs in water and evaluate treatment methods. The SDWA addresses water systems' ability to comply with regulations and ensure safe water supply. The DWSRF program helps finance infrastructure projects for drinking water standards. EPA is authorized to award annual funds for this program. The SDWA authorizes EPA to award annual grants to states for the DWSRF program, which helps finance infrastructure projects for drinking water standards. States use the grants to provide loans and assistance to public water systems, with communities repaying the loans to replenish the fund. Eligible projects include treatment facilities, distribution systems, and storage facilities. Congress has authorized appropriations totaling $9.6 billion for the program, with additional funding provided in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. For the DWSRF program, Congress provided additional funding through the ARRA, with a total of $14.5 billion appropriated since FY1997. The President requested $1.29 billion for FY2011, and EPA programs are funded through a continuing resolution. Through June 2009, $10.6 billion in capitalization grants had been awarded, resulting in $18.7 billion available for loans and assistance. 6,905 projects had received assistance by that time. The DWSRF program has provided $16.2 billion in total assistance, with 4,567 projects completed. EPA's needs survey estimates that $334.8 billion is needed for water infrastructure improvements over 20 years. Most of the costs (84%) are nonregulatory, with the majority going towards transmission and distribution infrastructure upgrades for safe drinking water delivery. The EPA has identified potential funding gaps for drinking water and wastewater infrastructure. Under different scenarios, they projected a 20-year funding gap for capital investment and operations/maintenance. The estimated gaps range from $45 billion to $161 billion, depending on revenue growth assumptions. In 2000, the Water Infrastructure Network (WIN) reported a $23 billion annual investment gap for water and wastewater systems to meet health and environmental priorities. Various groups have proposed multibillion dollar investment programs for water infrastructure, while others advocate for more financial self-reliance within the water sector. The issue of funding for water infrastructure was a focus in the economic stimulus debate during the 111th Congress, with funding provided through ARRA and appropriations acts. In 2000, the Water Infrastructure Network (WIN) reported a $23 billion annual investment gap for water and wastewater systems. Various groups proposed multibillion dollar investment programs for water infrastructure. The issue of funding for water infrastructure was a focus in the economic stimulus debate during the 111th Congress, with funding provided through ARRA and appropriations acts. Appropriations acts provided $829 million and $1.387 billion for a total of more than $4.2 billion for drinking water infrastructure. Congress extended EPA funding at FY2010 levels through March 4, 2011, under the Continuing Appropriations Act, 2011 (P.L. 111-322). In July 2009, the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee reported a broad drinking water and wastewater infrastructure financing bill, S. 1005 (S.Rept. 111-47), the Water Infrastructure Financing Act, which would have authorized more funding for drinking water and wastewater SRF programs. The EPA program for small or economically disadvantaged communities focuses on critical drinking water and water quality projects. S. 1005 proposed applying Davis-Bacon prevailing wage provisions to projects financed through the DWSRF. H.R. 5320 aimed to reauthorize the DWSRF for three years with a total of $4.8 billion and included prevailing wage requirements for funded projects. The Water Protection and Reinvestment Act (H.R. 3202) proposed establishing a dedicated water infrastructure trust fund supported by taxes on various products. H.R. 537, the Sustainable Water Infrastructure Investment Act of 2009, aimed to provide alternative financing for water infrastructure investments. In response to uncertainty about increased federal assistance for water infrastructure, EPA, states, communities, and utilities are exploring alternative management and financing strategies to address SDWA compliance costs and infrastructure maintenance. Strategies include public-private partnerships, asset management improvements, and full-cost pricing for water services. However, these strategies may not be sufficient for small or economically disadvantaged communities, leading stakeholders to push for increased funding from Congress. Concerns have been raised about the capacity of small systems to comply with SDWA regulations, as roughly 83% of the nation's community water systems are small. Many small community water systems, serving 3,300 persons or fewer, face challenges in complying with SDWA rules and ensuring water quality due to infrastructure issues, lack of capital, limited customer base, and managerial capabilities. The DWSRF program has not been as successful for small systems compared to larger ones. Despite serving only 9% of the population, the sheer number of small systems poses challenges for policymakers and regulators. Congress recognized the difficulties small systems face in meeting standards set for larger cities. The 1996 SDWA amendments aimed to help small water systems improve compliance by providing strategies for technical, financial, and managerial capacity. Provisions were added for exemptions in cases where systems cannot comply due to factors like cost. Compliance flexibility is granted through temporary exemptions from standards. The 1996 SDWA amendments aimed to assist small water systems in improving compliance by providing strategies for technical, financial, and managerial capacity. Provisions were added for exemptions in cases where systems cannot comply due to factors like cost. Exemptions may allow for additional time for compliance, with small systems potentially eligible for extensions up to a total of nine years. EPA noted that exemptions are crucial for helping states address the financial assistance needed for compliance with SDWA rules. Granting an exemption requires a state to hold a public hearing and ensure that the extension will not pose an unreasonable health risk. Since 1996, the SDWA has required EPA to identify affordable technologies for small water systems serving 10,000 or fewer people. If affordable compliance technologies are not identified, variance technologies can be used to protect public health. States can grant variances to systems serving 3,300 people or fewer if compliance is unaffordable. Exemptions, on the other hand, offer temporary compliance flexibility but have been rarely used due to uncertainty and burden on states. The EPA can grant variances to small water systems serving between 3,300 and 10,000 people if compliance with a regulation is unaffordable. Affordability criteria were established in 1998 to determine if a regulation is affordable for small systems. Compliance costs should not exceed 2.5% of annual median household income. EPA has found affordable compliance technologies for every drinking water regulation. The EPA has not identified any small system variance technologies, leading to no small system variances being available. Recent regulations have raised concerns, especially among rural communities, about EPA's lack of tools to help small systems comply with SDWA regulations. Prompted by debate over the revised arsenic standard's cost to small communities, EPA was directed to review its affordability criteria and small system variance programs for the arsenic rule. EPA sought advice from the NDWAC and SAB during the review process. The NDWAC and SAB provided recommendations to EPA regarding small system variances. The NDWAC acknowledged the statutory basis for variances but highlighted practical and ethical issues against their use. The National Rural Water Association dissented, advocating for a safe and affordable variance approach for small communities. The SAB supported EPA's approach but suggested improvements to the criteria, including lowering the affordability threshold. The SAB recommended EPA develop clear guidelines for granting variances and consider alternative measures to assess impacts on disadvantaged households. EPA proposed three options to revise affordability criteria for compliance technology, aiming to replace the current 2.5% rule based on median income. EPA's current approach assumes technology costs are affordable if they don't exceed $1,000 annually for the average household. EPA proposed three options to replace the current affordability threshold of 2.5% based on median income with lower levels of 0.25%, 0.50%, and 0.75%. They also considered evaluating affordability at both national and county levels, with a county analysis only if a standard is affordable nationally. The revised criteria aim to ensure variances are protective of public health and would only apply to future rules. States could grant small-system variances on a case-by-case basis if systems cannot afford to comply with a standard. The EPA is considering lower affordability thresholds for variances in drinking water regulations to protect public health. Variances may be granted on a case-by-case basis for small systems unable to comply with standards, raising concerns about water quality in lower-income communities. The agency is reviewing policies to provide equitable consideration for small system customers, including the use of variances and capacity development strategies. Bills have been proposed to assist small water systems in complying with federal regulations. The Water Infrastructure Financing Act proposed a grant program at EPA for small and economically disadvantaged communities, with funding priority. Legislation also aimed to authorize $14.7 billion for the DWSRF program over five years. H.R. 5320 sought to revise factors for identifying disadvantaged communities, increase assistance to water systems, and expand technical support for small communities. H.R. 2206 aimed to provide increased appropriations for technical assistance to help small water systems comply with regulations. H.R. 4798 and S. 3038 proposed amendments to provide exemptions for small public water systems from naturally occurring contaminants and address small system issues, including studying treatment technologies and revising affordability criteria. S. 3038 proposed provisions to prioritize funding and technical assistance for smaller water systems, allowing states to determine exemption renewal periods. The 1974 Safe Drinking Water Act authorized EPA to regulate underground injection to protect drinking water sources. EPA was directed to establish regulations for state underground injection control programs to prevent endangerment of drinking water sources. EPA could delegate enforcement authority for underground injection control. Section 1422 of the Safe Drinking Water Act authorized EPA to delegate primacy for UIC programs to states, with 33 states assuming primacy. EPA has lead enforcement authority in 10 states, and authority is shared in others. UIC program regulations cover siting, construction, operation, closure, and financial responsibility for injection wells. EPA has established five classes of injection wells based on similarity in fluids injected and activities. The 1974 SDWA specified that UIC regulations could not interfere with underground injection of brine from oil and gas production unless it affects underground sources of drinking water. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 amended the Safe Drinking Water Act to exclude hydraulic fracturing operations from the definition of \"underground injection.\" This has drawn attention due to its role in carbon dioxide sequestration and the increasing use of hydraulic fracturing in natural gas production. Geologic sequestration involves injecting CO2 captured from sources like coal-fired power plants deep into the earth for long-term storage. Research shows that various geologic formations in the US and globally can store large amounts of CO2, making carbon capture and storage (CCS) appealing for reducing emissions from coal use. However, concerns remain about the long-term safety and effectiveness of storing CO2 underground, including impacts on groundwater quality, potential health and environmental risks, and the issue of long-term responsibility and legal implications. The potential risks of storing CO2 underground include leakage, water contamination, and legal liability. The IPCC report highlights the importance of careful site selection, regulatory oversight, monitoring programs, and remediation methods to prevent adverse impacts on human health and the environment. The IPCC report emphasizes the need for careful site selection, regulatory oversight, and implementation of remediation methods to control CO2 releases. Despite uncertainties and research gaps, there are no insurmountable technical barriers to increased geological storage as a mitigation option. EPA proposed regulations in 2008 to manage underground injection of CO2 for geologic sequestration, aiming to provide certainty to industry and the public. The EPA proposed regulations in 2008 to create a new class of injection wells (Class VI) for geologic sequestration, with national requirements for well owners and operators to ensure safe and effective practices. The goal is to enable commercial-scale CCS projects to move forward, with a focus on proper permitting regulations and site selection. EPA issued a Notice of Data Availability in 2009 to gather additional public input on evolving issues related to the proposed rule. The EPA issued a final rule in November 2010 under the SDWA Section 1421 for geologic sequestration projects. EPA's authority is limited to protecting underground sources of drinking water, leaving issues like long-term liability and regulation of emissions unresolved. Congress has passed provisions to regulate underground injection wells for carbon sequestration, including funding from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 allocated $50 million for site characterization in geologic formations for carbon sequestration and $20 million for training and research. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 expanded DOE's carbon sequestration program, requiring at least seven large-volume sequestration tests and compliance with Safe Drinking Water Act regulations. Previous Congress proposals included similar geologic sequestration provisions in energy and climate change bills. The House passed H.R. 2454 and the Senate reported S. 1733, both bills aimed to amend the Safe Drinking Water Act by directing the EPA to regulate CO2 geologic sequestration wells. They also proposed a coordinated certification and permitting process for sequestration sites, with regulations to minimize the risk of atmospheric CO2 release within two years of enactment. The bills aimed to regulate CO2 geologic sequestration wells and address legal and regulatory barriers. They required EPA reports on environmental statutes and the legal framework for sequestration sites. Another issue discussed was the use of hydraulic fracturing for natural gas extraction. Hydraulic fracturing enables the production of natural gas and oil from unconventional formations, with roughly 90% of new gas wells relying on this technique. It has produced 600 trillion cubic feet of gas and 7 billion barrels of oil. Fracturing a single well can use over 6 million gallons of water, posing challenges for managing contaminated flowback water. Hydraulic fracturing can pose water quality challenges for regulators and developers. Landowners are concerned about well contamination incidents, often attributed to poor construction or surface activities. Stronger regulation advocates argue that well construction is crucial for gas development. Identifying contamination causes is complex due to various factors like lack of hydrogeologic evaluations and confidential fluid formulae. EPA is directed by the Safe Drinking Water Act to regulate underground activities. The Safe Drinking Water Act directs EPA to regulate underground injection of fluids to protect drinking water sources. EPA had not regulated gas production wells until a court ruling in 1997 classified hydraulic fracturing as underground injection. In response to a 1997 court decision, EPA began studying the impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water sources. A 2004 report concluded that hydraulic fracturing fluids in coal-bed methane wells posed little threat to underground water sources, but noted a lack of research on environmental impacts beyond that point. EPA also highlighted the need for more data on diesel fuel components and other fracturing fluids. The 2004 EPA report on hydraulic fracturing found little threat to underground water sources from fracturing fluids in coal-bed methane wells. However, criticism from Congress and EPA staff led to the Energy Policy Act of 2005 amending SDWA Section 1421(d) to exclude EPA's authority to regulate underground injection of fluids for hydraulic fracturing. Concerns over groundwater impact have increased with the rise in hydraulic fracturing, but few studies have been conducted to address these concerns. The rise in hydraulic fracturing has raised concerns about its impact on groundwater resources, especially in densely populated areas. Studies are lacking to evaluate these concerns, particularly in unconventional shale formations like the Marcellus shale. The U.S. Geological Survey highlighted the need for more research on how gas extraction may affect water resources. The gas industry and some states argue that state regulations are sufficient to address these concerns. The gas industry argues that state regulations are adequate and more suitable than federal regulation for hydraulic fracturing. They claim that a million fracturing jobs have been done with few issues, warning that additional federal regulation could hinder domestic gas development and increase energy prices. However, landowners have reported well water contamination incidents, leading to calls for federal regulation or further study. The Ground Water Protection Council supports state regulatory authority but acknowledges uneven environmental regulations among states and suggests ways to strengthen them. In the 111th Congress, bills were proposed to address hydraulic fracturing under the SDWA. H.R. 2300 stated that SDWA was not meant to regulate oil and gas well construction, while the FRAC Act aimed to amend the definition of \"underground injection\" to include fluids used in hydraulic fracturing and require disclosure of chemical constituents. The proposed bills in the 111th Congress aimed to address hydraulic fracturing under the SDWA. They included requirements for public disclosure of chemical constituents used in the fracturing process, with provisions for emergency situations. However, none of the bills were enacted. The House Appropriations Committee called on the EPA to review the risks of hydraulic fracturing to drinking water supplies using the best available science. Hydraulic fracturing poses risks to drinking water supplies, with ongoing studies by EPA and NRC. Views are mixed on whether EPA should regulate hydraulic fracturing under SDWA, with some advocating for federal legislation like the FRAC Act or chemical disclosure requirements. Some argue for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing, while others believe states should oversee it. Contamination incidents have prompted states to review and update oil and gas regulations to protect water resources. Congressional committees have discussed water infrastructure financing and EPA water enforcement. The curr_chunk discusses various reports and programs related to water supply infrastructure and enforcement by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The curr_chunk mentions reports on water infrastructure and health implications by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the National Research Council."
