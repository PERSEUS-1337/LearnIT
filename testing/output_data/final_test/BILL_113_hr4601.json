It includes provisions for funding the Highway Trust Fund and cost reduction measures such as Data Center Consolidation. Subtitle A--Data Center Consolidation includes sections on Purpose, Definitions, Federal Data Center Optimization Initiative, Performance requirements, Cost savings, and Reporting requirements. Subtitle B focuses on the Repeal of Duplicative Catfish Inspection Program, while Subtitle C addresses Closing Empty Bank Accounts. TITLE I pertains to the Funding of the Highway Trust Fund. TITLE I--HIGHWAY TRUST FUND\n\nSEC. 101. FUNDING OF HIGHWAY TRUST FUND.\n\nSection 9503(f) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to appropriate $5,000,000,000 to the Highway Account in the Highway Trust Fund.\n\nTITLE II--COST REDUCTION MEASURES\n\nSubtitle A--Data Center Consolidation\n\nSEC. 201. PURPOSE.\n\nThe purpose of this subtitle is to optimize Federal data center usage and efficiency.\n\nSEC. 202. DEFINITIONS. The Federal Data Center Optimization Initiative, developed by the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, aims to optimize data center usage in covered agencies. The Federal Chief Information Officer oversees this initiative, defining data centers as spaces for storage and management. The Federal Data Center Optimization Initiative, led by the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, aims to optimize data center usage in covered agencies. A Federal data center is defined as a space for storage, management, and dissemination of data and information. Key terms include server utilization, which measures server activity level, and power usage effectiveness, which calculates the ratio of power consumed in running a data center. The Federal Data Center Optimization Initiative focuses on optimizing data center usage in covered agencies. It includes key terms like server utilization and power usage effectiveness, which measures the power consumed by information and communications technology in the data center. The Federal Data Center Optimization Initiative, outlined in SEC. 203, focuses on optimizing data center usage in covered agencies by measuring server utilization and power usage effectiveness. The Federal Chief Information Officer, in consultation with covered agencies, must develop and implement the Federal Data Center Optimization Initiative to optimize data center efficiency. Within 6 months, a plan for implementation must be submitted to Congress, considering the Comptroller General's review findings. The plan should cover specific matters. The plan for the Federal Data Center Optimization Initiative must include descriptions of how agencies will use various methods to meet requirements and consider shifting federally owned data centers to commercial ones. SEC. 204. PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS RELATED TO DATA CENTER CONSOLIDATION. Each covered agency can maximize server utilization by closing underutilized data centers, consolidating services within existing data centers, or using any other method approved by the Federal Chief Information Officer. Failure to close inefficient data centers requires a detailed explanation, which will be assessed by the Federal Chief Information Officer in the annual report to Congress. The officer, with input from agency CIOs, determines server optimization needs. Covered agencies can improve energy efficiency by measuring power usage, setting goals, and adopting best practices in data centers. Other methods can also be implemented for efficiency. The Federal Chief Information Officer, in consultation with agency CIOs, can implement methods to optimize data center energy efficiency. SEC. 205. COST SAVINGS RELATED TO DATA CENTER OPTIMIZATION. Each covered agency must track costs related to the Federal Data Center Optimization Initiative and report them annually to the Federal Chief Information Officer. Factors to consider include energy, personnel, real estate, capital expenses, software licenses, and other relevant costs determined in consultation with the Federal Chief. Each covered agency is required to track and report savings from the Federal Data Center Optimization Initiative annually to the Federal Chief Information Officer. Factors to consider include energy, personnel, real estate, capital expenses, and software license savings. Covered agencies must use cost-effective measures to implement the Federal Data Center Optimization Initiative and any resulting savings should be used to offset implementation costs and enhance IT capabilities. The Government Accountability Office will review methods for calculating savings. The Comptroller General will examine methods for calculating savings from the Federal Data Center Optimization Initiative and may establish a special fund to support data center optimization. A report on findings and recommendations will be submitted to the Federal Chief Information Officer and Congress. SEC. 206 requires covered agencies to report to the Federal Chief Information Officer annually on the Federal Data Center Optimization Initiative implementation and savings. The Federal CIO must then report to Congress on agency progress. SEC. 207 focuses on the reduction and consolidation of data centers. SEC. 207 mandates a reduction and consolidation of Federal data centers by at least 40% by September 30, 2018, and 80% by September 30, 2023, with executive agencies required to implement recommendations issued by the Director of the Office of Management and Budget within 6 months. Subtitle B of the text repeals the duplicative catfish inspection program, while Subtitle C focuses on documenting and closing long-empty federal bank accounts. Subtitle C of the text focuses on documenting and closing long-empty federal bank accounts. The Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency must submit a report to Congress listing zero-balance bank accounts held by the government for 180 days or more, recommending which should be closed. Agencies must close recommended accounts within 7 days of the report."
