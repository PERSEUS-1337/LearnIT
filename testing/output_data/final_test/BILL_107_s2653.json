    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Teacher Paperwork Reduction Act of 2002\". It includes findings related to the Act. Congress finds that special education teachers are burdened by excessive paperwork, spending an average of 5 hours per week compared to general education teachers' 2 hours. Individualized education programs (IEPs) are between 8 and 16 pages long, contributing to the paperwork load. Over 60 percent of special education teachers spend \\1/2\\ to 1\\1/2\\ days a week on paperwork, hindering their ability to provide quality education. Special education teachers believe IEPs are essential but need to be streamlined and more relevant. 83% spend \\1/2\\ to 1\\1/2\\ days weekly in IEP meetings, and 53% report paperwork interferes with student interaction. 14% spend 1 hour or less on paperwork, while 24% spend 1.5 to 3 hours, and 8% spend 14 hours or more. The causes of burdensome paperwork for special education teachers include Federal regulations, misconceptions at State and local levels, and litigation. The benefits of mediation as an alternative to lawsuits for special education disputes include maintaining positive relationships and working together as partners. Mediation is a cost-effective alternative to litigation for special education disputes, resulting in satisfactory agreements for both families and school districts. In Pennsylvania, 85 percent of special education mediations end in agreement. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, key definitions include the Department of Education, elementary school, individualized education program, local educational agency, and secondary school. The curr_chunk defines \"State educational agency\" as per the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. The curr_chunk focuses on paperwork reduction. The Comptroller General will conduct a study on the paperwork burden on special education teachers, determining the impact of Federal regulations compared to State and local regulations. The Comptroller General will study the impact of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act Amendments of 1997 on paperwork burden for special education teachers and the cost savings from participating in mediations instead of litigation. The Comptroller General will submit a report to Congress within 180 days of the enactment of the Act, detailing recommendations on reducing paperwork burden for special education teachers through streamlining IEP forms, regulations, and utilizing technology. State and local educational agencies must comply with reducing paperwork for special education teachers by at least 50% within 18 months of the Act's enactment. The Department will work with these agencies to achieve this reduction and explore the use of technology to lessen the burden on teachers. State and local educational agencies, along with the Department, are encouraged to reduce paperwork for special education teachers by more than 50%. SEC. 5. MANDATORY MEDIATION. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act is amended to require mandatory mediation in section 615(e), replacing voluntary with mandatory participation. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act is amended to require mandatory mediation, with amendments taking effect one year after enactment. SEC. 6. FUNDING.
