    "content": "The peripheral nervous system serves as the input/output system for the brain, with cuff electrodes allowing observation and control. Data from these electrodes have a low signal-to-noise ratio and complex content. A new unsupervised learner using convolutional neural networks can de-noise and cluster neural data from the vagus nerve in animal models. Despite recent advances in chronic observation and limited control over the peripheral nervous system, consistent detection of single neuron activity remains a challenge with current cuff electrode technology. The challenge with current cuff electrode technology for in vivo neural data acquisition is the interference of signal components, leading to the observation of local field potentials instead of individual action potentials. A method based on convolutional neural networks is developed to de-noise and categorize the signals, trained on data from a single subject post surgical implantation. The study demonstrates the applicability of neural data collected from two nerve cuffs implanted on the vagus nerve, showing cross-time, cross-subject generalization of trained models. The architecture of the Coordinate-VAE involves encoding input signals through convolutional/pooling/leaky-ReLu/dropout blocks to a categorical latent vector, with time coordinates sampled to account for phase shifts and time warping. The Coordinate-VAE model involves encoding input signals through convolutional blocks to a latent vector, which is then concatenated with the latent vector and upsampled to reconstruct the original signal. The data is standardized, filtered, and rescaled before being inputted into the model. Time windows of fixed size are sampled for input, and a variational auto-encoder with Gumbel-Softmax activation is used to reduce the data to a one-hot latent vector. The Coordinate-VAE model encodes input signals through convolutional blocks to a latent vector, which is then used for reconstruction. The Gumbel-Softmax activation is employed in the latent space, with parameters doubling in each convolutional block. The temperature of the Gumbel layer is annealed during training and fixed at 0.1 during inference. The loss function combines mean squared error and Kullback-Leibler divergence. Training was done in Tensorflow on a Nvidia Tesla K80. The Coordinate-VAE model encodes input signals using Tensorflow on a Nvidia Tesla K80. Hyperparameter tuning was conducted with a Tree-structured Parzen Estimator. Data was split into training/validation/test sets. A small latent space (L=20) in a standard VAE cannot reconstruct signals, while a larger latent space (L=50) retains noise and signal artefacts. Information leakage from the original signal to the decoder bypasses the latent space to address this issue. Time-coordinates closest to zero are identified for each channel to prevent memorization.

Information leakage from the original signal to the decoder bypasses the latent space to address this issue. Time-coordinates closest to zero are identified for each channel to prevent memorization. A 1-d convolutional network is applied to a subset of these coordinates, providing a 'coordinate encoding' concatenated to the upsampled layers in the decoder, allowing for signal identification and noise removal. Reducing the latent space further while maintaining signal identification is also possible. The Coordinate-VAE model effectively de-noises peripheral neural data by reducing input signals from multiple cuffs into a simple latent space. This allows for reconstruction of the original signal while removing noise. The model can be applied across different subjects, as shown with vagus nerve recordings from a second subject. The trained Coordinate-VAE model effectively de-noises vagus nerve recordings from a second subject taken sixty days post surgical implantation, despite increased noise levels. The reconstructed signal shows clear correlation with respiration modulation events, indicating the latent space captures meaningful physiological signals. Significant differences in latent values within regions of respiration modulation suggest the model's ability to characterize neural activity. The latent space representation from the Coordinate-VAE model captures physiological signals, showing correlation with respiration modulation events. Simulation studies demonstrate the de-noising ability of the technique by combining noise and signal from Morlet wavelets. The reconstructed waveform's power ratio within impulse regions varies with the amplitude of the noise signal. The recent development of chronic neural interfacing implant systems allows recording neural signals over months or years, generating unlabelled data with signals occurring over various time-scales. Previous work used an adversarial auto-encoder to project neural data to labels, incorporating one-hot encoding and Gaussian vectors for reconstruction. The Coordinate-VAE approach restricts information available to the encoder, allowing unsupervised characterization of signals in timeseries data and denoising the signal. Transferable models suggest pre-training large models for latent space representations. Latent space representations from auto-encoders can be informative for physiological features, allowing for rapid training of classifiers for patient monitoring or control. Pandarianth et al used an auto-encoder for dimension reduction on neural spiking data from macaque motor cortices, followed by mapping the latent space to spiking activity using GLM."
