    "content": "The Act titled \"Marine Corps 230th Anniversary Commemorative Coin Act\" is cited in Section 1. Section 2 provides findings related to the Act. The Congress recognizes the 230th anniversary of the United States Marine Corps, highlighting its history of defending the nation and leadership in amphibious warfare. The Marine Corps embodies a warrior ethos and Americans are encouraged to commemorate its legacy for its significant contribution to national security. The Congress authorized the construction of the Marine Corps Heritage Center in 2001, which is set to open on November 10, 2005. A commemorative silver dollar coin should be minted to pay tribute to the 230th anniversary of the United States Marine Corps, with proceeds from its sale funding the construction of the center. The Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to mint and issue up to 500,000 $1 silver coins, each weighing 26.73 grams, with a diameter of 1.500 inches, and containing 90% silver and 10% copper. These coins will be legal tender. The design of coins minted under this Act shall symbolize the warrior ethos of the US Marine Corps, with specific inscriptions and values. The design will be chosen by the Secretary in consultation with relevant bodies and reviewed by the Citizens Coinage Advisory Committee. SEC. 5. ISSUANCE OF COINS. Coins minted under this Act shall be issued in uncirculated and proof qualities at a single US Mint facility within a 1-year period starting January 1, 2005. The coins issued under this Act will be sold by the Secretary at a price equal to the face value, a $10 surcharge per coin, and the cost of designing and issuing the coins. Bulk sales will be offered at a discount, and prepaid orders will be accepted with a reasonable discount on sale prices. No surcharge may exceed the $10 limit. The Act limits surcharges for coin issuance to prevent exceeding the annual commemorative coin program limit. The Secretary of the Treasury may provide guidance for this limitation. SEC. 7. DISTRIBUTION OF SURCHARGES. Surcharges from coin sales will be paid to the Marine Corps Heritage Foundation for the construction of the Marine Corps Heritage Center. The Foundation will be audited for the amounts received."
