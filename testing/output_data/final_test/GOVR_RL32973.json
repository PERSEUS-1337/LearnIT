    "content": "Churches can qualify for tax-exempt status under IRC \u00a7 501(c)(3) but are prohibited from participating in political campaigns. Any campaign activity can lead to revocation of their tax-exempt status or taxation on political expenditures. The line between campaign intervention and other political activities can be blurry. Churches can engage in activities like voter education, hosting candidate forums, and inviting candidates to church events as long as they remain unbiased. Religious leaders can also participate in campaign activities as individuals, endorsing or opposing candidates. Religious leaders can endorse or oppose candidates in their personal capacity, but not as representatives of their church. They cannot use church resources for campaign-related activities. The Federal Election Campaign Act prohibits corporations from using treasury funds for campaign contributions, but allows unincorporated organizations to do so. The Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA) prohibits corporations from funding \"electioneering communications\" and requires disclosure reports for contributions and expenditures. Political committees are defined as groups receiving or making over $1,000 in a calendar year. FEC regulations allow exceptions for \"qualified nonprofit corporations.\" The Federal Election Campaign Act prohibits corporations from funding \"electioneering communications\" and requires disclosure reports for contributions and expenditures. The Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of this prohibition but later found it unconstitutional as applied to certain ads. The Court ruled that ads not explicitly advocating for or against a specific candidate cannot be regulated. Bills introduced in Congress would have allowed churches to engage in electioneering communications. The bills introduced in the 110th, 109th, 108th, and 107th Congresses aimed to permit churches to participate in political campaign activities without losing their tax-exempt status. These bills showcased different approaches Congress could consider to amend the tax code's restrictions on churches' campaign involvement. Despite this, no similar legislation has been proposed in the 111th Congress. While the bills would have allowed churches to engage in campaign activities, they would not have altered the reporting requirements for tax-exempt organizations, as churches are not mandated to file annual information returns with the IRS. H.R. 2275 would have repealed the political campaign prohibition for churches and other tax-exempt organizations, allowing them to engage in campaign activities without risking their tax-exempt status. While there was no explicit limit on campaign activity, organizations would still be subject to taxes on political expenditures. The Houses of Worship Free Speech Restoration Act, under H.R. 235, would have allowed churches and other tax-exempt organizations to establish separate segregated funds for election-related activities without risking their tax-exempt status. Churches would not be considered as participating in campaign activity for certain purposes, and members or leaders could express personal views on political matters during religious services. The bill H.R. 235 would have allowed churches to endorse candidates and request contributions during religious services without risking their tax-exempt status. It would not have permitted disbursements for electioneering communications or political expenditures prohibited by FECA. The bill did not allow churches to set up separate segregated funds or change existing campaign finance laws. The earlier version of the Houses of Worship Free Speech Restoration Act, H.R. 235, did not reference certain IRC sections or include a clarification concerning church leaders. The provision in H.R. 4520, Safe Harbor for Churches, was briefly in the bill before being struck by the House Ways and Means Committee. It would have prevented churches from being treated as participating in campaign activity solely based on their religious leaders' private statements. The proposed bill would have imposed new restrictions on churches regarding political campaign intervention, including a new excise tax for unintentional violations of the \u00a7 501(c)(3) prohibition. The tax amount would vary based on the number of violations, with a maximum tax rate applied to churches with three or more violations. The bill under \u00a7 4955 was more restrictive, targeting unintentional violations of campaign prohibition to prevent churches from losing tax-exempt status. H.R. 2357 and S. 2886, the Houses of Worship Political Speech Protection Act, allowed churches to engage in campaign activity as long as it was not a substantial part of their activities. S. 2886 clarified that disbursements for electioneering communications not permitted under FECA were not allowed. H.R. 2357 received a floor vote on October 2, 2002. The bill H.R. 2357, which aimed to allow churches to engage in campaign activities as long as it was not a substantial part of their activities, failed to pass by a vote of 178 to 239 on October 2, 2002. The bill would have required each church to be judged on a case-by-case basis regarding their campaign activities, potentially leading to confusion about the extent of permissible activities. Additionally, churches would still be subject to applicable campaign finance laws under this bill. Under H.R. 2931, the Bright-Line Act of 2001, churches could engage in campaign activities as long as their expenditures did not \"normally\" exceed certain limits, allowing for almost unlimited low-cost campaign activities. The bill did not clearly define \"normally,\" leaving some ambiguity about the extent of permissible activities. Under the Bright-Line Act of 2001, churches could engage in campaign activities as long as their expenditures did not normally exceed certain limits. It was unclear how a church could establish a separate segregated fund under the bill and still comply with the 5% limit, with any campaign activity subject to campaign finance laws."
