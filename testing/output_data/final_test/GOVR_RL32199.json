    "content": "Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE or \"mad cow disease\") is a fatal neurological disease in cattle caused by an abnormal protein called a prion. It is part of a group of diseases known as transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs), which also affect sheep, goats, deer, elk, and humans. BSE is believed to be spread through contaminated feed and has been found in over 187,000 animals in around two dozen countries, with the majority of cases in the United Kingdom. The number of cases has declined since its peak in 1992. The number of BSE cases has declined since 1992 in the UK. BSE can be transmitted to humans through contaminated beef, causing vCJD. Almost 200 cases of vCJD have been diagnosed since 1986, mostly in the UK. In North America, BSE has been reported in 14 cattle, with some cases born locally and others imported from the UK. The effectiveness of feed controls in preventing BSE cases in North America has raised concerns. Several BSE cases have been reported in Canada, with some animals born after the implementation of feed controls in 1997. Canada has confirmed multiple cases of BSE in cows from various provinces between 2005 and 2007. The United States also reported its first case of BSE in a Holstein dairy cow in Washington state in 2003. In 2003, the USDA announced the first U.S. case of BSE in a Holstein dairy cow from Washington state, born in Alberta, Canada in 1997. In 2005, the second U.S. BSE case was confirmed in a 12-year-old Brahma cross cow from Texas. The third U.S. BSE case was confirmed in a nonambulatory cow from Alabama in 2006. USDA conducted a voluntary beef recall and epidemiological investigation. The investigation into the second U.S. BSE case in a cow from Texas concluded in 2005. Over 700 cattle were destroyed at 11 facilities, with 255 tested for BSE, all negative. The epidemiological investigation traced animals that left the Texas ranch after 1990, with 67 animals on the farm tested negative for BSE. 200 animals of interest had left the farm, with 143 slaughtered and only two found alive. In the investigation of the third U.S. BSE case, USDA and Alabama State officials were unable to trace the cow's herd of origin or find any related animals of interest, except for the two most recent calves of the infected animal. Officials conducted investigations into the source of feed consumed by the infected animals, as feed containing infective ruminant material is considered the likely source of BSE infection. Concern arose over Canadian BSE cases born after 1997, when feed bans were implemented in the US and Canada. Some questioned the effectiveness of the feed ban and its implementation in Canada. The U.S. had an \"atypical\" BSE case, different from European or other North American cases. The implications of this finding are unclear, and there are no plans to change existing controls. The North American BSE cases sparked debate over the effectiveness of U.S. and Canadian safeguards against BSE, implemented over years in response to scientific evidence. Many experts believe these regulatory developments have not been sufficient. Health experts assert that regulatory developments have created a unified system of safeguards against BSE, with some critics questioning their adequacy. Concerns include the justification of costs, scientific defensibility, and restoration of foreign markets' confidence in U.S. cattle and beef safety. The \"three firewalls\" were established in the late 1980s to prevent and contain the disease in the United States. The \"three firewalls\" were established in the late 1980s to prevent and contain BSE in the United States. Critics questioned the adequacy of these measures, but government officials defended them as scientifically defensible and effective in minimizing the risks of BSE to both agriculture and human health. The Harvard study supported the system's soundness in preventing the spread of isolated BSE cases. The Harvard study used a mathematical model to assess the effectiveness of the firewalls in preventing BSE in the U.S. Despite initial reassurances, the first case of BSE in the U.S. sparked a debate on the country's safeguards. In response, the USDA announced new actions to strengthen BSE protections, including holding carcasses of tested animals until BSE-negative results are obtained. On January 12, 2004, new rules were implemented to improve BSE safeguards, including banning nonambulatory cattle, keeping high-risk animal parts out of the food supply, and prohibiting certain meat plant practices. Additionally, efforts were made to establish a national system for animal tracking and an international scientific panel was named to review the government's BSE response. FDA announced further changes to its BSE safeguards on January 26, 2004. On January 26, 2004, FDA announced changes to its BSE safeguards, including banning certain bovine materials from human foods and cosmetics, tightening feed manufacturing procedures, and proposing to remove Specified Risk Material from all animal feed. FDA later published a proposed rule on October 6, 2005, to ban higher-risk cattle parts from all animal feeds. The FDA proposed tightening feed restrictions by banning higher-risk cattle parts from all animal feeds. Critics have questioned the pace and adequacy of these changes, while FDA officials defend their rulemaking process. The international panel of BSE experts suggested that material from infected animals imported from Canada and Europe may have caused indigenous infection in U.S. cattle. The international panel of BSE experts recommended further tightening animal feeding rules by FDA and more extensive testing of cattle to understand the prevalence of BSE in the US. Some stakeholders welcomed the findings, while others criticized the report for exaggerating risks and not distinguishing between the BSE situation in North America and Europe. The USDA advisors recommended a review of the subcommittee's report on BSE risk analysis. Actions were taken to reassure consumers and foreign markets after the finding of BSE in North America. Beef exports are slowly recovering, with Korea remaining closed in 2006. Import controls to prevent BSE are discussed. The United States implemented import controls to prevent BSE, following internationally accepted standards. By early 2007, 24 countries, including the US, had reported cases of BSE. The UK had the majority of cases, with the rest mainly in Europe. The USDA's APHIS began imposing import restrictions in 1989, starting with live ruminants. The USDA implemented import controls to prevent BSE, banning the importation of live ruminants and ruminant products from countries where BSE has been diagnosed. This included a ban on importing ruminants and most ruminant products from all of Europe. Additionally, USDA prohibited imports of all rendered animal protein products from Europe due to concerns of potential cross-contamination with the BSE agent. The OIE recommends disease risk assessments for international trade transparency and consistency. Guidelines for managing BSE are outlined in the OIE Terrestrial Animal Health Code, allowing countries to interpret and implement them to prevent foreign disease introduction. Trade conditions become stricter as a country's BSE risk status increases. Trade conditions for ruminant products become more restrictive as a country's BSE risk status increases. Most countries ban products from any country with a single case of BSE, although discussions are ongoing to resume trade under certain conditions. The OIE agreed to new BSE trade guidelines on May 26, 2005, which include a simplified hierarchy of risk categories for exporting ruminants and ruminant products. Countries with strong safeguards should not be penalized for low BSE cases, while those with inadequate protections may not be testing or reporting the disease. The OIE updated BSE trade guidelines in 2005, introducing a simplified risk category system. Countries with strong safeguards should not be penalized for low BSE cases, while those with inadequate protections may not be testing or reporting the disease. In a guideline change, OIE deemed boneless muscle beef from cattle under 30 months safe for trade, regardless of exporting country's BSE risk profile, if appropriate controls are in place. APHIS announced U.S. approval as a Category 2 \"controlled risk\" country, pending final OIE General Assembly approval in May 2007. Importing countries must be convinced by exporting countries that their beef and cattle are safe. The U.S. officials expect other countries to recognize the OIE designation for beef safety. Disputes over BSE safeguards may go to international panels, but resolution can be lengthy and unsatisfactory. Canada has been involved in testing the U.S.-supported approach to BSE and trade. Canada has been expanding its ruminant exports to the United States, causing disagreements among U.S. producer groups. The U.S. is working to rebuild confidence in its beef supply and ensure its safeguards meet international standards. The U.S. banned imports from Canada after their first case of BSE in 2003. In 2003, the US announced the use of permits to import boneless beef from cattle under 30 months of age from Canada. Proposed changes to BSE rules would allow importation of live ruminants and products from \"minimal risk\" regions, including Canada. APHIS had been gradually expanding eligible Canadian products without formal rules. In 2004, a lawsuit by U.S. cattlemen challenged USDA actions allowing imports of beef and veal from Canada. A federal judge issued a restraining order citing safety concerns, leading to an agreement that only products listed in August 2003 could be imported. Additional Canadian products were not permitted until a final rule was issued. The final rule published in January 2005 created a new category of \"minimal risk\" BSE regions, including Canada. A federal judge issued a preliminary injunction in March 2005, halting the implementation of the rule due to concerns about the introduction of BSE-infected Canadian cattle and beef into the U.S. meat supply. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit overturned a preliminary injunction against the importation of Canadian cattle into the U.S. The appeals panel cited the low incidence of BSE in the Canadian herd, numerous safeguards against BSE in the U.S., and the lack of any cases of vCJD from Canadian beef as reasons for allowing the imports to resume. Live cattle began crossing the border from Canada in July 2005, with approximately 563,000 cattle imported by the end of the year. Approximately 563,000 cattle were imported from Canada by the end of 2005, with 1 million head imported in 2006. Issues arose with the trade, such as a recall of beef due to a Canadian heifer being processed, violating age regulations. Some imported Canadian cattle were also found to be pregnant, sparking criticism of the border reopening. Despite these errors, the U.S. Court of Appeals allowed the imports to resume citing low BSE incidence in Canada and safeguards in the U.S. Despite recent findings of Canadian cattle with BSE born after feeding restrictions, US officials express confidence in Canadian beef safety. A proposed rule to allow older cattle imports from Canada was delayed due to a BSE case in a four-year-old cow. APHIS announced a proposed rule to permit older cattle imports from Canada, born on or after March 1, 1999, including breeding animals and bovine products like blood and casings. Critics question the effectiveness of the Canadian feed ban after a BSE case in a four-year-old cow. The proposed expansion of cattle imports from Canada includes older cattle born after March 1, 1999, and certain bovine products. The import eligibility of additional meat products, as long as specified risk materials are removed, may also be allowed. If finalized, USDA will permit the importation of these meat products, even from animals born before March 1, 1999. APHIS chose this date as the cutoff for live cattle shipment based on the effective enforcement of the Canada feed rule. Some U.S. cattle groups expressed discomfort about the proposal to expand cattle imports from Canada, citing recent cases of BSE in Canadian cattle as evidence of ineffective safeguards. Despite assurances from authorities, analysts speculated that the latest case might delay the final rule publication. Analysts speculated that the latest Canadian case could delay the final rule publication, impacting imports of cull cattle from Canada and leading to price declines in processing beef. U.S. and Japanese negotiators made progress in resuming two-way beef trade, with the U.S. agreeing to certify beef from cattle 20 months or younger. Verifiable age records for cattle are estimated to be available for only 10-25%. The United States and Japan made progress in resuming beef trade, with the U.S. agreeing to certify beef from cattle 20 months or younger. Japan had reported cases of BSE in its own cattle herd, leading to delays in opening its market to U.S. beef. Despite some setbacks, Japan eventually reopened its market in July 2006 after finding prohibited materials in U.S. beef shipments. The United States made concessions to Japan in order to reopen its beef market in July 2006. Japan continued to inspect 100% of U.S. beef shipments, making it difficult to rebuild the market. Agriculture Secretary Johanns announced in April 2007 that Japan promised to ease testing after audits of U.S. processing plants. Japanese consumers turned to other beef sources like Australia and New Zealand. The U.S. made concessions to Japan to reopen its beef market in 2006. Japan started substituting other proteins and beef sources for U.S. beef, which once accounted for 25-30% of beef consumed in Japan. USDA allowed the importation of Japanese beef under certain conditions. Japan exported less than 9 tons of specialty beef annually before the U.S. ban on Japanese beef imports. Some in Congress were frustrated with the U.S. favoring Japanese beef producers despite Japan's BSE problem. The United States faced challenges in regaining the South Korean beef market due to strict import inspection requirements. South Korea initially rejected U.S. beef for bone fragments and dioxin levels but later passed a 6.4-ton beef shipment, raising hopes for further clearances. After the first Canadian BSE case in May 2003, USDA officials asked for a reassessment of the potential for BSE outbreak in the US. The reassessment concluded that the likelihood of BSE introduction from Canada was low, but infectivity may have been introduced into the cattle feed supplies before the 1997 feed ban. The feed ban was implemented in both countries, with the possibility of infected animals or contaminated feed being imported to the U.S. from Canada. The close link between the American and Canadian beef industries makes imports a plausible source of BSE introduction. The International Review Team noted that the number of infected cattle in Canada was likely small, suggesting that the first U.S. BSE case may have been the only surviving infected animal from the Canadian herd. The USA may have imported infected animals from Canada and Europe, leading to indigenous infection in cattle. The International Review Team commended the USA for its science-based approach to policy formulation and highlighted the impact of non-compliance with international trade rules on exporting countries. The United States should lead by example in following international trade rules and encouraging the discontinuation of trade barriers related to BSE. Risk materials must be safely disposed of to protect human and animal health. Federal actions have not completely prevented BSE-infected animals or products from entering the US. The GAO identified weaknesses in import controls for beef and cattle from countries with BSE, recommending a coordinated strategy to strengthen inspections. The USDA's OIG criticized the department's actions on opening the border to Canadian cattle and beef products. The USDA's OIG criticized the department's actions on opening the border to Canadian cattle and beef products, citing arbitrary decisions, poor communication, and inadequate regulatory controls. APHIS issued 1,155 permits for importing ruminant products from Canada without proper internal controls, using a system originally designed for research quantities. APHIS did not have adequate procedures for processing a high volume of permit requests for large quantities of commercial use beef, leading to inconsistent application of risk mitigation measures. Some permits issued for bovine liver did not include required measures, and onsite monitoring requirements were not implemented, resulting in reduced assurance of low-risk Canadian beef entering the United States. This led to questionable eligibility products entering U.S. commerce. The OIG recommended that APHIS establish procedures for better oversight. The OIG recommended that APHIS improve communication of policy changes to importers and the public, strengthen controls for issuing permits for commercial products, and implement monitoring procedures. FSIS was advised to enhance controls for changes in product eligibility and implement an edit check in the import information system. USDA agreed to implement most recommendations. A federal report suggested updating risk assessments, import regulations, and enforcement guidance at ports of entry. The federal report recommended updating import regulations and enforcement guidance at ports of entry to fully implement the Animal Health Protection Act and strengthen FDA's BSE capabilities. Additional authority for FDA and revisions to the Virus-Serum-Toxin Act were also suggested to enforce import rules on animal biologics products. The USDA and FDA have not recommended any statutory changes in import safeguards, but Congress has shown interest in trade-related aspects of the BSE situation. The Senate approved a resolution to disapprove USDA's Canada import rule, but it did not advance in the House. Attention to this issue is likely to persist in the 110th Congress. The Senate approved a resolution to disapprove USDA's Canada import rule, but it did not advance in the House. Other bills addressing the Canada rule also did not advance, including ones related to country of origin labeling. The slow pace of Japanese negotiations frustrated the beef industry. The Senate's frustration with slow Japanese negotiations led to a floor amendment attached to H.R. 2744, calling for Japan to open its market to U.S. beef. Other proposals included economic sanctions against Japan and trade sanction bills introduced in June 2006. The Senate proposed trade sanctions against Japan for not opening its market to U.S. beef. A bill was introduced in June 2006 for this purpose, and a nonbinding amendment recommending sanctions was included in the FY2007 USDA appropriation bill. Another comprehensive proposal, the \"BSE and Other Prion Disease Prevention and Public Health Protection Act,\" aimed to prohibit the importation of animal-derived material without proper labeling. The proposal aimed to require labeling on imported items, specify country of origin, and prohibit certain materials. It also addressed the risk of BSE in cattle due to feeding practices, with theories on its emergence. In 1988, the UK banned feeding ruminant by-products to prevent the spread of BSE. In 1996, a link between BSE and vCJD was announced, leading the US to implement similar controls on cattle feed. The FDA's \"feed ban\" in 1997 prohibited mammalian protein in ruminant feeds to prevent disease spread. The GAO noted in 2002 that US surveillance and import controls were strong, but the feed ban was more lenient compared to other countries. The Harvard study concluded that the feed ban was the main protective measure against BSE, even if other controls failed. Failure of the feed ban resulted in the highest increase in BSE cases. Some practices may still lead to the feeding of ruminant materials to cattle, such as feeding rendered cattle to poultry. Recommendations included improving enforcement of the feed ban or changing regulations for better protection against BSE. The study found that potential feed contamination in the United States could come from cattle that died on the farm and were rendered. If a BSE-positive cow was rendered, infectivity could enter the feed supply, leading to new cases. Noncompliance in the feed chain, like commingling feeds on farms, poses detection challenges. Prohibiting high-risk materials in all animal feeds could eliminate cross-contamination and breaches in feeding practices. Livestock industry representatives have differing views on regulatory oversight. Livestock industry representatives have concerns about potential lost income if certain beef by-products lose commercial value. Others worry about environmental impacts of designating these by-products as waste. FDA announced plans to expand feed ban restrictions after the first U.S. BSE case in 2004. Proposed rulemaking variations were published in 2004 and 2005, with no alterations as of mid-May 2007. The FDA implemented a feed ban on ruminant material in animal feeds, requiring labeling and separation of prohibited feeds. Certain bovine by-products were exempted, but concerns were raised about using rendered bovine blood in milk substitutes. FDA also considered barring blood donation from individuals who resided in the UK to prevent transmission of vCJD. In 2002, FDA considered revising feed regulations after finding the first U.S. BSE case in 2004. The new interim rule aimed to strengthen the feed ban by eliminating exemptions for blood and plate waste, prohibiting poultry litter in cattle feed, and preventing cross-contamination of ruminant feeds. The IRT recommended stricter animal feed restrictions, extending the ban to exclude all mammalian and poultry protein from ruminant feeds, and removing high-risk tissues from cattle older than 12 months. The panel also emphasized the exclusion of specified risk material from all animal feed, including pet food. In 2004, concerns were raised about inconsistencies between IRT recommendations and findings from a Harvard study regarding BSE circulation. The committee emphasized the need for a robust nationwide surveillance system to understand the extent of BSE spread. FDA published an ANPR seeking feedback on the proposal to remove SRM from all animal feed to control cross-contamination risks. The FDA proposed removing specified risk materials (SRM) from animal feed to control contamination risks. This would eliminate the need for other protections like a ban on feeding poultry litter. However, final decisions on bans for feeding bovine blood and plate waste were not made. Consumer groups criticized the FDA for delays in implementing feed ban modifications. The FDA proposed removing specified risk materials (SRM) from animal feed to control contamination risks. Consumer groups criticized the FDA for delays in implementing feed ban modifications, including the removal of exemptions for blood and plate waste due to concerns about BSE transmission and vCJD risks associated with blood transfusion. The FDA proposed a rule to modify the feed ban by banning higher-risk materials from all types of animal feeds, including brains and spinal cords of cattle, tallow with more than 0.15% insoluble impurities, and mechanically separated beef from higher-risk materials. Comments were accepted until December 20, 2005, for evaluation before the final rule publication. The FDA proposed rule defines SRM more narrowly for animal feeds than USDA-FSIS for human food. It allows certain parts of cattle 30 months and older, and does not ban blood products, plate waste, and poultry litter in ruminant feed. FDA claims that banning certain parts would remove 90% of BSE infectivity without burdening the industries. The FDA's proposed rule aims to remove 90% of BSE infectivity in animal feeds by targeting specific parts of cattle. While compliance with existing feed rules is high, concerns about cross-contamination persist due to resource constraints. The FDA's proposed rule aims to protect cattle by removing high-risk materials from non-ruminant feed, citing concerns about intentional misfeeding. Financial incentives may drive misfeeding when cheap prohibited protein sources are available locally. The agency considered options like dedicated facilities, bans on certain feed ingredients, and expanding the list of prohibited materials in all feeds. The FDA's proposed rule aims to remove high-risk materials from non-ruminant feed to protect cattle from BSE infectivity. Initial reactions to the proposal were mixed, with the AMI supporting it as a science-based policy and the NCBA seeing it as enhancing existing safeguards. The rendering industry expressed concerns about the cost implications of the proposed measures. Consumer advocacy groups criticized the FDA's proposal for not being strong enough, as it did not ban specified risk materials (SRMs) from all animal feed and allowed exemptions for certain materials. The FDA had not finalized any changes to the feed ban as of mid-May 2007, with concerns raised about the potential impacts on the rendering industry. The FDA's proposal to ban specified risk materials (SRMs) from all animal feed has been delayed, with publication of a final rule pushed back. Proper rendering practices can reduce BSE infectivity and comply with regulations, but concerns exist about the need for safe disposal routes for these products. Some argue that a broader SRM ban could lead to unsafe disposal methods with negative health, economic, and environmental impacts. The FDA's proposal to ban specified risk materials (SRMs) from all animal feed is causing concerns about safe disposal options for cattle by-products. SRM removal from cattle over 30 months old is already in place, but banning SRMs from animal feed could impact rendering practices and require new carcass-handling arrangements. Outdated economic analyses and lack of comparable assumptions have hindered the assessment of FDA's current proposals. The FDA's proposed ban on specified risk materials (SRMs) in animal feed could have substantial impacts on the rendering industry, beef and cattle markets, and alternative livestock feed markets. The total costs of the proposed changes to rendering and slaughtering firms are estimated to be between $14.4 million and $23.8 million per year over seven years. Disposal costs, estimated at $7.7 million to nearly $10 million per year, are the largest expense for slaughterers and renderers due to the need to dispose of cattle parts no longer eligible for feed. The FDA's proposed ban on specified risk materials (SRMs) in animal feed could result in the disposal of 64.3 to 83.1 million pounds of cattle parts and 26,000 to 64,000 cattle carcasses annually, costing cattle producers $1.02 million to $2.53 million per year. Analysts argue that the proposed rule would remove 90% of potential remaining BSE infectivity from the feed supply at a lower cost compared to a broader SRM ban, which could cost the industry $195 million to $240 million and have major environmental implications. The National Renderers Association (NRA) commissioned an economic analysis of the FDA's proposed ban on specified risk materials (SRMs) in animal feed. The analysis estimated direct economic losses of more than $127.7 million annually for the rendering industry and livestock producers, with an aggregate impact exceeding $150 million annually when slaughter plants' costs are included. The NRA argued that the ban would have immediate and profound impacts on the livestock sector, particularly on the rendering industry and livestock producers. The NRA sponsored analysis concluded that the FDA underestimated the impact of the proposed ban on specified risk materials in animal feed. The analysis estimated that livestock producers' disposal costs could increase by $112 million per year, with reduced sales from deadstock for rendering exceeding $15.7 million yearly. Additionally, the ban could create more potential environmental problems and severely reduce the number of dead cattle and calves rendered in the United States. The NRA/APPI study estimated that a broader SRM ban could result in a total economic loss of $166.3 million annually for the industry. They also found that limited disposal options could have a major environmental impact. The NRA/APPI comment highlighted concerns about the potential discouragement of renderers picking up dead animals and the lost value of processing dead or condemned animals for food. The National Grain and Feed Association (NGFA) estimated the cost of removing and disposing specified risk materials (SRM) at $10.70 per animal. A study by Kansas State University showed that the average price of ruminant meat and bone meal (MBM) was discounted after the 1997 feed ban, with the discount increasing after the discovery of BSE in the US. The study reported that banning animal consumption of all SRM would result in a revenue loss of $1.63 for animals under 30 months and $5.11 for older animals. Disposal costs would be an additional $2.16 per head for fed slaughter cattle and $6.77 per head for older animals. For dead and downer animals, the total cost would be $76.50 per head, with $57.75 lost in MBM revenue and $18.75 in disposal costs. The FDA Center for Veterinary Medicine has provided updates on feed ban enforcement since 2001. The FDA has provided updates on feed ban enforcement since 2001, reporting on 19,492 establishments. 30% handled prohibited materials, with 0.1% classified as \"Official Action Indicated\" and 3.2% as \"Voluntary Action Indicated.\" Examples of issues found include lack of procedures to prevent contamination and minor recordkeeping lapses. The FDA reported instances of non-compliance with the feed ban, including cross-contamination and mislabeling issues. Despite past claims of 99% compliance, inspections found problems in 0.4% of cases. The FDA is seeking test methods to detect prohibited material in animal feed. In 2004, FDA requested information on detecting SRM in animal feed. GAO reported issues with FDA's oversight of the feed ban in 2002 and 2005, highlighting problems with administrative procedures, inspection, and enforcement. GAO criticized FDA's compliance rate calculation and recommended reporting enforcement information in context. Despite improvements since 2002, GAO stated that FDA lacked sufficient information to calculate a compliance rate accurately. The FDA has made improvements in managing the feed ban since the 2002 GAO report, but various program weaknesses still undermine the nation's firewall against BSE. GAO identified issues such as the lack of a uniform approach to identify all additional feed manufacturers and the agency not always alerting USDA and states about cattle given prohibited feed. FDA started a discreet feed testing program in 2003, evaluated by GAO in 2005. The FDA started a discreet feed testing program in 2003, evaluated by GAO in 2005, which found weaknesses in the program including lack of documentation for follow-up reviews and extended periods to complete sample testing. The Canadian Food Inspection Agency proposed to strengthen the country's feed ban by prohibiting specified risk materials (SRMs) in all animal feeds and fertilizer, effective July 12, 2007. This expansion is more stringent than the FDA's 2005 proposal, raising concerns about potential trade implications. Congress may need to review the feed ban's effectiveness in preventing the spread of BSE, considering the impact of banning \"downer\" animals from slaughter and the oversight of the feed ban amidst changing market conditions. The FDA is considering changes to feed ban restrictions to prevent the spread of BSE, including a potential ban on specified risk materials (SRMs) in animal feeds. Concerns exist about the economic implications and enforcement strategies of these proposed changes. In the 109th and 110th Congress, proposals were made to define and restrict the introduction of specified risk materials (SRMs) into commerce to prevent the spread of BSE. BSE surveillance aims to determine disease prevalence and ensure timely detection and response, which may or may not involve laboratory tests. BSE surveillance involves testing due to the disease's unique nature, as it cannot be diagnosed from noninvasive samples. Testing is only possible post-mortem, and current tests have limitations in early detection. BSE testing supports surveillance, not food safety. The USDA argues that a BSE surveillance program does not need to test every animal for food safety but can use targeted sampling to determine overall prevalence. Critics have raised concerns about the program not testing enough animals or properly targeting high-risk ones after the first report of BSE in a U.S. cow in 2003. The International Review Team noted uncertainty about domestic BSE prevalence affecting decisions about the program's scope. The USDA argued that their BSE surveillance program did not need to test every animal for food safety but could use targeted sampling to determine overall prevalence. Some observers suggested increasing surveillance to match European or Japanese standards, while the issue was complicated by Japan's demand for all cattle to be tested for BSE before accepting U.S. beef. Individual firms tried to offer testing to regain access to Japanese markets, despite most U.S. government resistance. In 1990, APHIS started surveillance for BSE in cattle following the British outbreak. The program expanded over the years, testing about 20,000 animals annually by 2002-2003 out of 35 million slaughtered. The first BSE-positive cow in Washington state was detected through this program, targeting high-risk groups like farm deaths, neurologic signs, and non-ambulatory animals. Following the detection of BSE in December 2003, USDA revised its surveillance program, including a ban on downer cattle in the human food supply. This decision was influenced by advisory committee recommendations and negotiations with trading partners. Some concerns were raised about the economic impact of the downer ban on the testing program. The ban on downer cattle in the human food supply following the detection of BSE in December 2003 raised concerns about economic incentives compromising BSE surveillance. USDA officials planned to increase surveillance to 38,000 animals tested per year after the discovery of BSE in Canada in May 2003. The USDA planned to increase surveillance to 38,000 animals tested per year after the discovery of BSE in Canada. The Administration's FY2005 budget proposed testing 40,000 animals. The International Review Team recommended testing high-risk animals over 30 months old, estimating it at 600,000 per year. The advisory committee urged expanded surveillance but did not recommend testing all animals, focusing on high-risk animals showing symptoms of central nervous system disease. The USDA announced an expansion of BSE surveillance activities to focus on high-risk animals such as cattle showing symptoms of central nervous system disease, non-ambulatory cattle, and cattle that die on farms. The enhanced surveillance was expected to test between 200,000 and 300,000 animals over a 12 to 18 month period. The department aimed to test all animals in the high-risk groups to increase the certainty of identifying BSE in the United States. USDA expanded BSE surveillance to focus on high-risk animals like cattle showing CNS symptoms, non-ambulatory cattle, and farm deaths. APHIS tested 21,216 normal adult cattle, all negative for BSE. Enhanced surveillance began in 2004, with state sampling goals and rapid testing for quick results. FSIS veterinarians collect brain samples from animals at slaughter for rapid testing, allowing APHIS staff to focus on sampling high-risk animals at farms and rendering plants. Positive screening tests for BSE are followed up with confirmatory testing at USDA's NVSL in Ames, Iowa. The OIE recognizes the IHC test or Western blot test for confirmatory purposes. Most official USDA and cattle industry statements refer to the IHC test as the \"gold standard\" confirmatory test. In 2004, news reports highlighted initial delays in setting up the national laboratory network and educating stakeholders about the new testing program. USDA officials and rendering industry representatives mentioned obtaining animals through voluntary incentives, especially at facilities that process animals into non-human food uses. USDA has agreements with these facilities to pay for storage of carcasses until BSE test results are complete and cover costs for sample collection and processing. After more than two years of enhanced surveillance through late August 2006, USDA completed testing of about 788,000 animals. Four animals tested \"inconclusive\" on screening; two were later determined to be negative, one was the first native-born U.S. case, and the fourth tested positive on subsequent testing. USDA made public its analysis of BSE surveillance data in April 2006. The USDA conducted enhanced surveillance for BSE in the United States, covering a total of seven years. The analysis showed a prevalence of less than one case per million adult cattle, with an estimated four to seven infected animals out of 42 million. The program, which tested 23,818 cattle from September 2006 to April 2007, received criticism initially but was later scaled back to 40,000 tests per year. The House Committee on Government Reform questioned USDA officials about the testing of a Washington state cow in 2003. They raised concerns about the surveillance program's effectiveness in detecting BSE in apparently healthy cows. In 2004, a cow with signs of a neurological disease in Texas was condemned for human consumption by FSIS. The FSIS condemned a cow in Texas for human consumption, but a higher-level APHIS official decided not to test it for BSE. Critics accused the department of covering up a possible case of BSE, leading to an investigation by the USDA's Inspector General. The IG found procedural errors and inconsistent descriptions but no intentional misconduct by USDA personnel. The USDA's Inspector General found procedural errors and inconsistencies in the handling of the BSE-positive cow in Texas. While no intentional misconduct was found, officials had misunderstandings about BSE sampling and carcass handling procedures. A new joint policy was announced to clarify these procedures. Additionally, inconsistencies were found in the department's expanded surveillance plan, raising concerns about the reliability of surveillance findings. The final OIG report in August 2004 highlighted issues with the USDA's surveillance program for BSE, including the lack of testing healthy-looking animals, inadequate geographical representation, and insufficient testing in the high-risk cattle population. USDA officials defended the program, stating that improvements had been made and that the sampling was representative and statistically sound. Officials asserted that the statistical basis for the sampling was sound and adjustments were made as a result of ongoing assessments. The OIG continued to assess the testing program, leading to re-testing of tissue from a cow initially determined negative, then positive for BSE. In June 2004, USDA announced two inconclusive findings for BSE, later confirmed negative. Carcasses of affected animals were held pending test results and later destroyed. Carcasses of two affected animals were destroyed after inconclusive test results. Cattle market prices initially fell but recovered after conclusive negative results were announced. USDA received criticism for both releasing too much and too little information, but some industry groups felt the balance was right. USDA officials emphasized the potential damage of rumors during inconclusive tests and acknowledged the possibility of false positive screening tests. APHIS changed its policy regarding inconclusive results after the incident. APHIS changed its policy on inconclusive test results after market uncertainties. The agency would now only announce an inconclusive result if a second screening test on the sample were also positive. Despite speculation, details on the animal's age or location were not provided. Confirmatory testing later found the sample to be negative. The Ames NVSL facility confirmed that the sample was negative for BSE after running the IHC test twice. This announcement led to a significant increase in live cattle prices, benefiting cattle producers but causing losses for meat packers. The USDA did not conduct further confirmatory tests after the negative IHC result. In Weybridge, England, the USDA confirmed a BSE-positive result in December 2003. In 2005, USDA retested samples from 2004 due to concerns about original testing. The Secretary of Agriculture announced a \"weak positive\" for BSE in June 2005. Further testing was conducted by Weybridge and USDA labs. The Weybridge lab conducted additional testing on the BSE sample, detecting BSE in all but one test. Different IHC test procedures were used by Weybridge and USDA labs, leading to concerns about test comparability. USDA found possible BSE using an experimental IHC test in 2004 but did not report it as the test was not validated. This information, along with Weybridge's positive BSE confirmation, sparked criticism. Consumer groups and Members of Congress criticized the USDA's testing methods and procedures following the positive BSE confirmation by Weybridge. Secretary Johanns announced the implementation of two confirmatory tests - IHC and Western blot - for inconclusive screening results. He defended USDA's surveillance program, stating that science is constantly evolving. USDA is reviewing testing methods to align with latest science. Bio-Rad ELISA test used in inconclusive cases, with reports of false positives. Variety of BSE testing schemes and conflicting statements noted. The USDA is evolving its BSE testing methods, with conflicting statements on accuracy. APHIS approved five test kits for surveillance, restricting testing to USDA labs. Creekstone Farms sought to test all slaughtered animals for BSE but was denied by USDA. The USDA denied Creekstone Farms' request to test all slaughtered animals for BSE, stating that approved tests were only for animal health surveillance. Creekstone sued USDA, and a court ruled in their favor, allowing private BSE testing. Critics viewed USDA's actions as interference with free-market and missed opportunities for additional BSE testing. The cost of BSE surveillance and testing has been a topic of discussion, with individual rapid BSE test kits ranging from $7 to $25 per animal. A study by Kansas State University estimates the variable cost of testing to be around $15 to $20 per head, including the cost of the test itself and labor. The cost of BSE surveillance and testing can range from $25 to $50 per animal, including overhead costs. The USDA's enhanced surveillance program involves various activities beyond testing, such as outreach, transportation of carcasses, sample collection, storage, record-keeping, and investigating results. Per-head cost comparisons are challenging without knowing the scope of activities included. The USDA funded an enhanced surveillance program for BSE with $152.4 million from the Commodity Credit Corporation. Annual congressional appropriations for BSE surveillance increased to $17 million from $2 million in FY2001. The weekly cost of testing 5,000 to 7,000 animals was estimated at $1 million. The 108th and 109th Congress closely monitored the program's progress. The 109th Congress showed renewed interest in BSE testing after concerns were raised about the surveillance program in 2004. Congressional hearings and bills were limited, but a proposal in S. 2002 suggested a comprehensive prion disease surveillance program with industry compensation for tested animals. During the 109th Congress, there was a focus on BSE testing and surveillance programs, with discussions on funding for APHIS. Proposed amendments aimed at maintaining BSE testing levels and restrictions on private testing were considered. The USDA (FSIS) oversees meat safety in federally inspected facilities, with potential for similar proposals in the 110th Congress if more BSE cases are found in the US. State-regulated safety measures for meat inspection must be equivalent to federal standards, including BSE prevention measures. USDA's announced food safety measures for controlling BSE apply to both state and federal meat inspection facilities. FSIS considered policy options to protect the food supply from BSE contamination, including designating certain cattle parts as unfit for human consumption and restricting the use of certain meat recovery systems. The USDA announced new preventive measures for ensuring the safety of meat products, particularly in response to the discovery of the first U.S. BSE cow in 2003. These measures included removing designated high-risk material from the food supply, regardless of test findings or BSE prevalence nationwide. These actions were considered the strongest steps taken to protect against BSE contamination. The USDA implemented new measures in response to the first U.S. BSE cow discovery in 2003, including a ban on non-ambulatory cattle in the food supply due to concerns about BSE transmission. Opponents of the ban on non-ambulatory cattle in the food supply have raised concerns about BSE surveillance integrity and economic impacts, while proponents argue for food safety due to hazards like Salmonella. USDA estimated that up to 200,000 \"downer\" cattle were slaughtered annually in the U.S., with 25% deemed unfit for human consumption. The USDA estimated that there were around 465,000 nonambulatory cattle in 2003 and 450,000 in 2004 at U.S. beef and dairy operations. Some in the cattle industry argue for a distinction between animals unable to walk due to BSE or other diseases and those that are simply lame. The USDA observed that nonambulatory disabled cattle can be categorized into those with CNS disorders, including BSE, and those that appear lame. The USDA decided to prohibit all \"downer\" cattle from the food supply due to concerns about disease infectivity. Prior to the emergence of North American BSE cases, downer cattle were associated with humane slaughter issues. Additional measures announced in 2003 included holding meat from animals tested for BSE until results are known and banning air-injection stunning. The USDA implemented measures to prevent the spread of brain matter in meat, including a ban on mechanically-separated meat and restrictions on high-risk materials in the food supply. One rule redefined \"Specified Risk Materials\" as inedible parts of a carcass where prions concentrate, ensuring they are not passed as human food. The USDA implemented measures to prevent the spread of brain matter in meat by banning mechanically-separated meat and restricting high-risk materials in the food supply. One rule designates certain tissues as Specified Risk Materials (SRM), such as brain and spinal cord in cattle older than 30 months, to be inedible. However, materials from younger animals can still be inspected and passed as human food. The GAO recommended that USDA continue evaluating the safety of meat, improve enforcement to keep prohibited nervous system tissue out, and consider labeling for consumer awareness. The USDA implemented measures to prevent the spread of brain matter in meat by banning mechanically-separated meat and restricting high-risk materials in the food supply. The USDA expert panel recommended expanding the definition of Specified Risk Materials (SRM) to exclude high-risk tissues from animals older than 12 months. The full advisory committee reported that banning SRM from animals over 30 months removed the highest-risk tissues from the food supply and was in line with international standards. The Harvard risk assessment concluded that SRM removal would reduce potential human exposure by 95%. The FDA and FSIS issued a joint advance notice of proposed rulemaking seeking public comments on additional measures to mitigate BSE risks, including the removal of the entire intestine from cattle to prevent infective material from entering the food chain and preventing cross-contamination between cattle carcasses. In establishments slaughtering cattle 30 months and older, additional sanitation requirements are needed to prevent carcass contamination with SRM. FSIS and FDA published interim rules in 2005 allowing removal of distal ileum to prevent BSE infectivity in meat products and cosmetics. In response to industry comments, measures were proposed in the 109th Congress to remove the distal ileum from cattle (30 months and older) to prevent BSE infectivity in meat products and cosmetics. These measures aimed to address food safety concerns related to BSE, with some bills focusing on keeping higher-risk cattle parts out of animal feeds and prohibiting the introduction of prohibited materials into commerce. Other measures targeted the \"downer\" issue in meat plants. During debates on the FY2004 agriculture appropriations bill, lawmakers considered amendments related to the Downed Animal Protection Act, which aimed to euthanize downed animals at various facilities. The Senate included a provision in its version of the bill, but it was ultimately dropped in the final measure. In the 109th Congress, an amendment was adopted to prohibit nonambulatory livestock from being used for human food during consideration of the FY2006 USDA appropriation bill. In the 108th Congress, Senator Akaka introduced a bill to prohibit nonambulatory livestock from being used for human food, but the amendment was deleted during the House-Senate conference. The provision would have applied to various animals unable to stand or walk unassisted. Another bill in the same Congress aimed to define \"non-ambulatory\" for cattle in the Federal Meat Inspection Act. In the 110th Congress, proposals were introduced to address food safety and animal welfare issues related to nonambulatory livestock. Senator Akaka and Representative Ackerman introduced bills to ban downed animals from human food and require humane euthanization. These proposals could be debated in the House and Senate Agriculture Committees and the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Agriculture. The chairwoman of the Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies committee aims to review food safety issues and federal program effectiveness. Funding for BSE-related activities has significantly increased in recent years, reaching $90 million in FY2006 and a requested $98 million in FY2007. USDA's BSE spending has risen from less than $500,000 in FY2000 to $60 million in FY2006, with a requested $68 million in FY2007. $7 million is allocated for research by USDA's Agricultural Research Service. The USDA's Agricultural Research Service has a budget of $7 million for research, with a request for an increase to $15 million for FY2007. APHIS has $17 million for ongoing surveillance and $3 million for FSIS meat safety activities. Additionally, APHIS includes $33 million annually for a national animal ID system. FDA spending for BSE-related work has increased from less than $4 million in FY2001 to nearly $30 million in each of FY2005-FY2007. This includes $16 million for federal feed inspections, over $3 million for state feed inspections, and about $10 million for regulatory, educational, and research activities. The 110th Congress was considering FY2008 USDA and FDA appropriations requests. Efforts to constrain the federal budget deficit and the perception that BSE is a reduced threat could impact future spending decisions. The Secretary of Agriculture pledged to implement an animal ID program after the first U.S. case of BSE in 2003. Many animal producers support a nationwide animal identification system to track animals from birth to slaughter. Despite some individual animal identification for disease programs, a comprehensive U.S. system is lacking. This was evident in the limited tracing exercise needed to identify imported cows with BSE in 2003. The international panel of experts reported in 2004 that a more extensive tracing exercise was needed to identify cattle for culling according to international standards. Despite efforts on an animal ID program, unresolved issues include whether it should be mandatory or voluntary, what information to collect, and who should manage it. The USDA has allocated $85 million through FY2006 for the program, with an additional $33 million requested for FY2007. All states now have systems for registering animal premises, and a new implementation plan aims for full producer participation by 2009. The USDA unveiled a draft \"user guide\" in November 2006 outlining steps towards full producer participation in the NAIS by 2009. The guide reassures producers that participation is voluntary and their private information will be protected. The three steps include premises registration, animal identification, and selecting an animal tracking database for reporting movements. Some industry groups and lawmakers criticize USDA for slow progress in establishing a universal animal ID program. Livestock producers, especially smaller-scale ones, oppose broader programs due to cost and privacy concerns. The 108th and 109th Congresses addressed animal ID issues, with the House Agriculture Committee exploring a privately held system in 2005. A provision in the House-passed USDA appropriation for FY2007 required a detailed plan for the next $33 million in animal ID spending. The 109th Congress addressed animal ID issues, with bills such as H.R. 1254, H.R. 1256, and H.R. 3170 proposing various measures related to farm animal identification. The Senate committee requested a GAO review of USDA's efforts, while S. 2002 aimed to establish a ruminant ID program. Differences over animal ID continued into the 110th Congress, with hopes of resolution in the next omnibus farm bill. The 109th Congress addressed animal ID issues with various bills proposing measures related to farm animal identification. The House and Senate Agriculture Committees aim to complete the next omnibus farm bill in 2007. Two animal ID bills have been introduced, one to prohibit USDA from implementing a mandatory program and another to establish a producer-governed program. U.S. law requires most imports, including food items, to bear labels informing the \"ultimate purchaser\" of their country of origin. The 2002 farm bill required retailers to provide country-of-origin labeling on certain products, with past delays in implementation. The omnibus FY2004 appropriation delayed the effective date for mandatory COOL for two years. The FY2006 appropriation for USDA postpones mandatory COOL for an additional two years, until September 30, 2008. Debate over the pros and cons of COOL continues in the 110th Congress, with some Members opposing the delay and others working to make COOL a voluntary program. Supporters argue that consumers have a right to know where their food is from, while critics claim COOL is a trade barrier that increases import costs and undermines U.S. agricultural trade reform efforts. The mandatory COOL program for industry is criticized for being expensive and potentially holding them legally accountable for minor mistakes in records. Industry leaders had initially sought a voluntary program for labeling beef of U.S. origin. After the Canadian BSE discovery in 2003, Japanese officials required proof of U.S. origin for beef shipments. In response, the USDA unveiled a \"Beef Export Verification\" program to meet Japanese and Korean demands. In August 2003, the USDA introduced the \"Beef Export Verification\" (BEV) program for exporters to certify their beef is from U.S. cattle. BEV is seen as a minimum requirement for accessing foreign markets like Japan. Various bills in Congress proposed making COOL labeling voluntary or mandatory for meats and other commodities. The House-passed USDA appropriation for FY2006 aimed to block funds for COOL implementation for meats. In FY2006, H.R. 2744 aimed to block funds for COOL implementation for meats, while S. 1331 sought to accelerate mandatory COOL to January 30, 2006. New proposals in the 110th Congress, such as H.R. 357 and S. 404, aimed to accelerate implementation to September 30, 2007. Additionally, S. 1308 would prohibit USDA from allowing the importation of certain Canadian cattle until COOL requirements are met. The National Organic Program prohibits the feeding of certain slaughter by-products to animals labeled as \"organic\" for safety reasons. News reports suggest safety benefits from beef grown using organic practices in light of domestic BSE cases. The National Organic Program (NOP) was developed to ensure labeling claims reflect verifiable production practices. USDA does not endorse claims that organic food is safer or more nutritious than conventional food. Chronic Wasting Disease (CWD) is a fatal neurological disease in deer and elk, similar to BSE but with differences in transmission and tissues involved. CWD has been detected in captive cervid herds in nine states since 1997. Chronic Wasting Disease (CWD) has been detected in captive cervid herds in several states in the United States and in wild cervids in 11 states. Federal and state policy is to depopulate these herds. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) advises against consuming food from animals with evidence of a TSE, including CWD. There is no strong evidence of CWD transmission to humans under natural conditions. The possibility of Chronic Wasting Disease (CWD) transmission to humans is still being assessed through epidemiologic and laboratory studies. Ongoing national surveillance for Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD) and other neurological cases is crucial to evaluate the risk of CWD transmission to humans. There is no evidence of CWD transmission to domestic cattle under natural conditions. CWD can be transmitted to domestic cattle under natural conditions, but ongoing experiments have not resulted in infection. FDA prohibits feeding rendered deer and elk to ruminants and using known-CWD positive animals in animal feeds. USDA and DOI conduct activities related to CWD control. In 2002, a national CWD Task Force was formed to address the increasing spread of CWD and inconsistencies among states in managing the disease. The task force, involving USDA, DOI, and state agencies, developed a strategic plan focusing on research, surveillance, disease management, testing, technology, communication, education, and funding for state programs. Despite concerns about delays, the task force aims to coordinate federal and state efforts effectively. The USDA had published a final rule in 2006 for a captive herd certification program for CWD and rules on interstate movement of cervids. The effective date was delayed due to concerns raised about federal interstate movement regulations and the scientific basis underlying them. A revised rule had not been published as of mid-May 2007. Feline Spongiform Encephalopathy (FSE) was first identified in domestic cats in Britain in 1990, believed to result from eating BSE-affected beef. FSE in cats was first identified in Britain in 1990, with over 100 cases in Europe, mostly in the UK. No cases reported in the US. Concerns raised about BSE-contaminated pet food, but the risk is deemed very small by the Cornell Feline Health Center. FDA feed ban allows beef by-products in US cat food. Products prohibited from cattle feed but intended for pet food must come from BSE-free countries; imported pet foods cannot contain mammalian-derived material."
