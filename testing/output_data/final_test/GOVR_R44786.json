    "content": "Science and technology (S&T) are crucial for economic growth, human health, and national priorities. Federal policies impact S&T advancement through funding R&D activities and establishing regulatory frameworks. This report provides an overview of key science and technology policy issues. The report provides an overview of key science and technology policy issues for the 115th Congress, including federal funding of research and development, the America COMPETES Act, oversight of academic research, technology transfer, and the adequacy of science and engineering. Contact information for authors is included at the end of the report. The federal S&T policymaking enterprise involves various stakeholders in the executive, legislative, and judicial branches, focusing on advancing scientific knowledge, STEM education, and using S&T for economic and national security benefits. Congressional responsibilities include funding S&T programs and enacting laws related to S&T policymaking. The federal S&T policymaking enterprise involves various stakeholders in the executive, legislative, and judicial branches. Congressional authorities related to S&T policymaking are diffuse, with many House and Senate committees having jurisdiction. The President formulates budgets, policies, and programs for consideration by Congress, while the Office of Science and Technology Policy advises on S&T issues. Executive agency responsibilities for S&T policymaking are also varied. The federal government supports scientific knowledge and technological development through R&D investments. Various agencies have S&T responsibilities, and federal court decisions impact S&T policy and industries. Federal R&D funding supports national interests such as defense, health, and innovation. Funding has fluctuated, with a recent decline from $147.3 billion to $146.1 billion between FY2009 and FY2016. This reduction has raised concerns about the long-term impact on U.S. technological advancement. The reduction in federal R&D funding has sparked debate about its impact on U.S. technological leadership, innovation, competitiveness, economic growth, and job creation. Concerns have been raised about the increasing R&D investments of other nations, globalization of R&D and manufacturing activities, and trade deficits in advanced technology products. Members of Congress are also worried about federal funding levels given the current fiscal condition and differing perspectives on the government's role in advancing science and technology. Congress faces two main issues in the appropriations process regarding the direction of federal R&D investment. The direction of federal R&D investment is a key concern due to increased pressure on discretionary spending. Congress plays a central role in defining R&D priorities and funding allocation. Low or negative growth in R&D investment may require resource reallocation across disciplines, programs, or agencies. The COMPETES Act (P.L. 110-69) was enacted in 2007 to address concerns about U.S. competitiveness by authorizing federal research, education, and innovation activities. The America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2010 (P.L. 111-358) extended and modified provisions of the 2007 law. The American Innovation and Competitiveness Act (AICA, P.L. 114-329) reauthorized and modified certain provisions from previous acts. Congressional appropriations have generally been below authorized levels, and specific authorizations in the 2010 act have expired. The 115th Congress may consider additional provisions from the COMPETES acts. The 115th Congress may consider additional provisions from the COMPETES acts, addressing expired authorizations for NSF and NIST. The COMPETES acts aim to maintain U.S. leadership in scientific and technological innovation, with concerns about slipping leadership and inadequate federal funding for research and production of scientists and engineers. The COMPETES acts were designed to increase funding for NIST, NSF, and Department of Energy's Office of Science, as well as authorize federal STEM education activities and prize competitions. Critics question the need for programs to increase STEM workers, debate whether the government should address a STEM labor shortage, and suggest alternative approaches to enhance U.S. competitiveness, such as research tax credits or reducing regulatory costs. The federal government and academic research institutions have been partners in supporting American innovation, competitiveness, and economic growth through funding provided by more than two dozen federal agencies. Critics raise concerns about the financial cost associated with the COMPETES acts, given worries about the federal budget deficit and debt. The federal government, through agencies like NIH and NSF, provides significant R&D funding to U.S. colleges and universities. Congress and federal agencies have established requirements to ensure transparency and prevent misuse of federal research grants. Academic institutions acknowledge the need for regulations but express concerns about potential negative impacts on research productivity and return on investments. Legislation in the 114th Congress addressed concerns about administrative tasks, federal funding agency requirements, and stakeholder engagement in federal regulations. Enacted provisions in the 21st Century Cures Act, American Innovation and Competitiveness Act, and National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 addressed conflicts of interest disclosure, financial reporting, and established advisory committees for research policy and interagency working groups on federal research regulations. Congressional oversight is crucial for monitoring the implementation of provisions enacted in the 114th Congress regarding federal research regulations. It is important for Congress to consider the balance between supporting academic research while maintaining oversight, transparency, and accountability. Approximately one-third of the federal government's R&D spending goes to federal laboratories. The federal government's R&D spending is allocated to federal laboratories to support agency missions. Technology transfer from federal labs to the private sector is facilitated by legislation like the Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act of 1980. This transfer can take place through partnerships and agreements, allowing for further development and commercialization. Congressional interest in promoting technology transfer from federal laboratories to the private sector is driven by the desire to meet social needs, promote economic growth, and enhance national welfare and security. Economic benefits are realized when technology is brought to the marketplace for sale or use, increasing productivity. Collaboration with the private sector allows federal scientists to access more advanced technical information. Despite efforts to improve technology transfer, the utilization of federal technologies remains limited. The use of federal technologies by the private sector remains restrained, with critics citing difficulties in working with federal laboratories. Proponents argue that federal laboratories are open to interested parties, but it is up to the private sector to utilize them. The need for additional legislative initiatives and incentives to encourage technology transfer from federal laboratories is debated. The importance of scientists and engineers in U.S. technological leadership, innovation, and economic strength is recognized by Congress through various programs. Efforts are made to improve STEM skills and increase the number of foreign scientists and engineers in the U.S. There is no definitive definition of the S&E workforce, and the policy debate on its adequacy continues. The policy debate on the adequacy of the U.S. S&E workforce focuses on professional-level computer, mathematical, engineering, and physical science occupations. Key indicators for assessing labor shortages include employment growth, wage growth, and unemployment rates. Differing views exist among policymakers, business leaders, and analysts regarding the existence of a shortage of scientists and engineers in the United States. The policy debate on the shortage of scientists and engineers in the United States focuses on professional-level STEM occupations. Policymakers are considering whether federal intervention is needed to address any shortages in this labor market. STEM education is a key factor in this discussion, with ongoing interest in improving student performance in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields. Previous estimates have shown a range of efforts in federal STEM education initiatives. The federal STEM education effort has decreased by half from 254 to 125 activities between FY2010 and FY2016. Total federal funding for STEM education remained around $3 billion annually. The national conversation on STEM education revolves around concerns about the science and engineering workforce in the U.S. Some argue for a shortage of STEM workers while others believe an increase in STEM abilities among the workforce would benefit the nation. Some scholars oppose using education policy to increase STEM workers, citing concerns about overemphasizing economic outcomes at the expense of other values. Opinions vary on the scope of federal STEM education policy, with some advocating for broad initiatives to improve STEM achievement for all students, while others prefer targeted programs for specific needs. The 115th Congress may consider federal policies to promote technological innovation and address concerns about inadequate growth in high-paying jobs. Possible pathways include entrepreneurial business formation, increased domestic R&D investment, production of research-derived products, and employer spending on worker training. Congress can influence job creation through tax incentives for innovation and worker education. Under current federal tax law, provisions affect entrepreneurial business formation and R&D investment, including expensing allowance for research expenditures, tax credit for research increases, and exclusion for capital gains from qualified small business stock. There is no tax incentive for employer investment in worker training. The tax credit and expensing allowance encourage companies to invest more in research by lowering the cost of capital and boosting cash flow. Some argue that the current credit's incentive effect is weak. The research tax credit and expensing allowance aim to boost R&D investment by lowering costs and increasing cash flow. Critics argue that the current credit's incentive effect is weak due to flaws in its design, making it difficult for small startup companies to benefit. Section 1202 allows non-corporate investors to exclude 100% of capital gains on qualified small business stock to encourage equity investment in startups. Recent research shows that startup firms account for most U.S. job growth, but access to financial capital is a barrier. Small entrepreneurial firms can become large job creators. Industries using intellectual property make up 30% of U.S. jobs with higher earnings. The 115th Congress passed legislation cutting tax rates for corporations. The 115th Congress passed legislation (P.L. 115-97) in late 2017 that significantly reduced tax rates for corporate and non-corporate business income, starting in 2018. The new law also made changes to various tax provisions affecting business profits. Some believe that the tax cuts alone should lead to more high-paying domestic jobs across industries, while others doubt that large companies will use the tax savings to expand production and increase worker wages. One potential option not included in the legislation is the creation of a tax incentive like a patent or innovation box to encourage job growth. A patent box incentive lowers tax burden on income from qualified intellectual property, encouraging investment in U.S. R&D. Drawbacks include budgetary costs and justifying subsidies for successful patented innovations. Another option for job growth is a tax incentive for employer investment in worker training and education. The U.S. economy benefits from high-paying jobs if there are workers to fill them. Potential drawbacks to a tax subsidy for employer investment in worker training include rewarding employers for existing practices and a lack of evidence of underinvestment. The federal government supports billions of dollars in agricultural research annually, with funding issues likely to arise in the 115th Congress. Congress may face funding issues related to agricultural research and challenges from advances in biotechnology and antibiotic use in food-producing animals. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) is responsible for advancing scientific knowledge in agriculture through research spanning various sciences. USDA's research program is funded through federal grants and delivers outcomes through academic and applied research, publications, and education. USDA's research program receives nearly $2.9 billion per year in funding and faces reauthorization with the expiration of the 2014 farm bill. The 115th Congress is considering the next farm bill, which may involve changes to agricultural research programs and potential requests for additional funding. The 115th Congress may address issues related to bioengineered foods labeling and regulatory changes for genetically engineered plants and animals. Currently, labeling GE food products is not mandatory, but a bill was passed in the 114th Congress to establish a national bioengineered food disclosure standard. The USDA has two years to implement the labeling law, allowing food manufacturers to use text, symbols, or electronic links to identify bioengineered foods. The labeling bill requires identification of bioengineered foods through electronic links like QR codes, raising concerns about access for those without smartphones or high-speed internet. USDA must study technological factors affecting consumer access within a year of enactment. The development of new gene-editing technologies for genetically engineered plants raises regulatory issues for USDA, which currently regulates GE plants under the Plant Protection Act. New technologies may fall outside USDA's jurisdiction, prompting questions on how to regulate these plants. As these varieties become more common, Congress may need to revisit biotechnology regulation. The 1986 framework governs U.S. biotechnology regulation. Information on labeling genetically engineered foods and genetically engineered salmon is available. The use of medically important antibiotics in food-producing animals may interest the 115th Congress. Bills such as the Preservation of Antibiotics for Medical Treatment Act of 2017 and the Preventing Antibiotic Resistance Act of 2017 are relevant. The 115th Congress introduced bills to restrict the use of medically important antibiotics in food-producing animals. The Presidential Advisory Council on Combating Antimicrobial Resistant Bacteria (PACCARB) initiative was launched in 2014 to address antibiotic resistance. In 2017, the council focused on animal health and antibiotic challenges. In 2018, a resolution expressed concern about underfunding for antibiotic resistance activities by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). The USDA released its Antimicrobial Resistance Action Plan in 2014. The USDA released its Antimicrobial Resistance Action Plan in 2014, focusing on research and data collection on antibiotic use in animals. In 2017, the FDA expressed concerns about antibiotic resistance in food animals and issued guidance on judicious antibiotic use. The FDA issued Guidance for Industry #213 in December 2013, requiring the withdrawal of antibiotics for production uses by January 1, 2017. Medically important antibiotics can now only be used for treatment and prevention under veterinary supervision, with a Veterinary Feed Directive required for antibiotics used in feed since 2017. The FDA issued regulations requiring a valid veterinarian-client-patient relationship for the use of antibiotics in food animals. Producers now need prescriptions for non-feed antibiotics that were previously available over-the-counter. The FDA also expanded reporting on antibiotic distribution and use, while the Government Accountability Office highlighted the need for better data collection to evaluate antibiotic resistance policies. FDA Administrator Gottlieb announced plans to issue a new strategy in a \"couple months\" to regulate antibiotic use in farm settings. The 115th Congress may face challenges related to biomedical research and development, including budget oversight for the National Institutes of Health and advancements in precision medicine and genomic editing. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) received $37 billion in funding for FY2018 for biomedical research. The extramural research program provides grants, contracts, and training awards to support individuals at universities and research facilities. Budget growth has decreased since FY2003, with the highest funding level in FY2003. The 21st Century Cures Act authorizes $4.8 billion for NIH over a 10-year period. The 21st Century Cures Act authorizes $4.8 billion for NIH over a 10-year period for specific projects, including the Precision Medicine Initiative, BRAIN Initiative, cancer research, and regenerative medicine using adult stem cells. The Act also includes policy changes to modify NIH strategic planning, reporting requirements, and reduce administrative burden for researchers. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulates the safety of foods, cosmetics, drugs, biologics, and medical devices. FDA's total program level is composed of direct appropriations and user fees paid. The FDA's total program level includes direct appropriations and user fees. The 21st Century Cures Act made changes to drug, biologic, and device approval pathways, aiming to accelerate development and review of medical products. The 21st Century Cures Act established an FDA Innovation Account with $500 million authorized for funding FDA activities over nine years. The Act aims to expedite the development and approval of targeted drugs for rare diseases, incentivize treatments for national security threats, and accelerate the review process for life-threatening infections. The FDA is implementing activities required by the 21st Century Cures Act and has issued its own policy priorities for medical product innovation. Their roadmap focuses on promoting innovation in manufacturing to improve product reliability, safety, and lower costs. For more information, refer to CRS reports on FDA budget, the Cures Act, and FDA User Fee Programs. In vitro diagnostic (IVD) devices, including laboratory-developed tests (LDTs) and genetic tests, provide crucial information for healthcare decisions. LDTs, also known as \"home-brew tests,\" are manufactured within a single laboratory. Most genetic tests fall under the category of LDTs. The regulation of LDTs, including genetic tests, has been a topic of debate, with the FDA traditionally exercising enforcement discretion and not requiring premarket review for most tests. The FDA has not reviewed most LDTs and genetic tests for marketing approval. There has been a debate on regulating LDTs, with the FDA considering issuing guidance on the matter. The finalization of the draft guidance has been postponed until the new Administration is in place. The FDA has not reviewed most LDTs and genetic tests for marketing approval. There has been a debate on regulating LDTs, with the FDA considering issuing guidance on the matter. The agency summarized comments on guidance documents in a 2017 \"Discussion Paper on Laboratory Developed Tests\" but has taken no further action. The White House hosted a Precision Medicine Initiative Summit in February 2016 to mark the one year anniversary of the initiative's launch. The Precision Medicine Initiative (PMI) aims to advance medicine through research, technology, and policies that empower patients, researchers, and providers to collaborate on individualized care. It involves federal agencies like NIH, FDA, and ONC, focusing on personalized healthcare based on unique characteristics like genetic profiles. NIH has funded projects to build a biobank, establish Health Provider Organizations (HPOs), and recruit participants for the All of Us Research Program. The Precision Medicine Initiative (PMI) aims to advance personalized healthcare through research and technology. NIH received funding for the PMI in FY2016, FY2017, and FY2018, with additional appropriations from the 21st Century Cures Act. NIH is collaborating with HRSA to establish Health Provider Organizations (HPOs) for the All of Us Research Program. FDA has developed precisionFDA to support data sharing and validation of genomic assays. The 115th Congress may consider policies to support investments in precision medicine. Researchers are exploring CRISPR-Cas9, a gene editing tool with potential for significant advancements in precision, efficiency, and cost compared to previous technologies. This tool could lead to revolutionary changes in genetic modifications for humans, animals, plants, and microorganisms. CRISPR-Cas9 is expected to bring revolutionary advances in various fields like medicine, agriculture, and environmental science. The National Academy of Sciences predicts a rapid growth in biotechnology products enabled by CRISPR-Cas9 in the next 5 to 10 years. This technology has accelerated crop development and is being used in clinical trials for cancer treatment. However, ethical concerns arise from studies using CRISPR-Cas9 in human embryos. The Chinese studies and other research on human embryos have sparked ethical debates. CRISPR-Cas9 is being considered to combat Zika virus and malaria. Existing mechanisms may be inadequate to assess the environmental and public health impacts. The 115th Congress may need to examine the benefits, risks, and ethical implications of CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing technology. Congress could also play a role in regulating, researching, and developing CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing and future biotechnology products. The federal government oversees workplace safety, including for laboratory personnel working with infectious microorganisms through guidance like Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories (BMBL). BMBL sets Biosafety Levels for high-risk pathogens and compliance is required for federal grant recipients. Biosecurity requirements to prevent pathogen releases were mandated by Congress in 1996 and expanded through subsequent reauthorizations. The Federal Select Agent Program, jointly administered by CDC and USDA, also plays a role in biosecurity. The Federal Select Agent Program, overseen by CDC and USDA, regulates the possession of select agents - biological pathogens and toxins with potential harm. Labs must register and follow best practices, with personnel undergoing FBI background checks. Recent incidents of mishandling select agents in federal labs have raised concerns. The CDC had incidents involving select agents like anthrax, avian influenza virus, and Ebola. Lapses in protocol or human error were attributed to each incident. Recommendations for improving safety culture, standardized practices, and incident reporting were made. The House Committee on Energy and Commerce conducted investigations on these lapses. The Select Agent Program authorizations expired in 2007, but Congress continues to fund implementation and enforcement. The 115th Congress may revisit program authority or regulations due to recent incidents. The 115th Congress may review program authority and regulations in response to recent incidents involving pathogens to ensure safety and security measures are adequate. Science and technology are crucial for national defense, with the Department of Defense spending over $80 billion annually on research and development. Issues for Congress may include budget concerns and the effectiveness of transitioning research results into military systems. The Department of Defense (DOD) spends over $80 billion annually on research and development, with a focus on designing, developing, and testing military systems like aircraft carriers, fighter jets, and tanks. A portion of the funding goes towards the Science and Technology Program, which includes activities from basic science to field demonstrations. The goal is to maintain U.S. military superiority through technological advancements. Congress provides oversight and may adjust funding based on justification and program needs. The Department of Defense (DOD) focuses on research and development, including the Science and Technology Program, to maintain U.S. military superiority. Congressional attention is on funding for basic research, technology transition, and S&T personnel supply. Budget constraints and the need for a third offset strategy are key concerns for the 115th Congress. The Department of Defense emphasizes research and development to uphold U.S. military superiority, requiring increased investment in RDT&E. Energy-related science and technology issues may arise in the 115th Congress, including nuclear fuel reprocessing and advancements in nuclear energy and biofuels. Advances in nuclear energy technology, biofuels, and ocean energy, along with international fusion research, are key areas of focus. The debate over reprocessing spent nuclear fuel to extract plutonium and uranium for new reactor fuel is a fundamental issue in nuclear policy. Proponents argue that reprocessing could recover substantial energy from spent fuel, but critics are concerned about the potential misuse of reprocessed plutonium in nuclear weapons. The commercial viability of reprocessing or recycling is also a significant consideration. In the 1950s and 1960s, the federal government planned to reprocess commercial spent fuel using \"breeder reactors\" to convert uranium into plutonium. President Carter halted commercial reprocessing in 1977 due to weapons proliferation concerns. President Reagan funded a breeder demonstration project but stopped funding in 1983. President Clinton largely halted nuclear energy reprocessing research, while some work continued for waste management. The George W. Bush Administration saw a renewed interest in reprocessing. The George W. Bush Administration renewed federal support for reprocessing, proposing a pilot plant by the early 2020s. The Obama Administration redirected DOE's Fuel Cycle Research and Development Program towards various nuclear fuel cycle approaches. The Trump Administration proposed reductions in Fuel Cycle R&D, but funding was increased in FY2018. The Mixed Oxide Fuel Fabrication Facility (MFFF) is under construction at the Department's Savannah River Site in South Carolina. The Mixed Oxide Fuel Fabrication Facility (MFFF) is being constructed at the Department's Savannah River Site in South Carolina to produce fuel for commercial nuclear reactors using surplus nuclear weapons plutonium. Critics argue that MFFF could undermine U.S. nonproliferation efforts. The Obama and Trump administrations proposed halting the MFFF project due to rising costs, with the FY2018 budget calling for its termination. The FY2018 National Defense Authorization Act authorized DOE to pursue alternative disposal options if costs were lower than completing MFFF. The United States operates commercial nuclear power plants based on light water reactor technology. The Department of Energy conducts research on non-LWR nuclear technologies for safety, waste management, and cost advantages. Private-sector firms are also working on commercializing these technologies. Advanced nuclear energy technologies, such as high-temperature gas-cooled reactors, liquid metal-cooled reactors, and molten salt reactors, are being pursued by private-sector firms. These technologies involve nuclear chain reactions using fast neutrons and research is being conducted by the DOE's Advanced Reactor Technologies program. Funding for the program saw a significant increase in 2018, with $60 million allocated for engineering and design of non-LWR and advanced LWR technologies. Private-sector nuclear technology companies are pushing for a regulatory framework that can apply to all nuclear concepts, including advanced reactors. They recommend a staged review process for NRC approval of advanced reactor designs. NRC and DOE are working on adapting existing design criteria for advanced reactor license applications. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is supporting industry efforts to develop guidance for technology-neutral reactor licensing. Legislation promoting advanced nuclear power technologies is being considered in Congress, with bills authorizing DOE national laboratories to host reactor demonstration projects and grants to help pay for NRC licensing of advanced reactor designs. The Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources reported on advanced nuclear technology research being conducted at national labs under DOE's GAIN program. The Consolidated Appropriations Act for 2018 allocated $35 million for DOE to assess the need for a fast neutron test reactor. Biofuels, derived from biomass feedstock, are seen as an alternative to conventional fuels with potential benefits for reducing oil dependence, boosting rural economies, and lowering greenhouse gas emissions. The debate over biofuels includes concerns about environmental harm, land use, and production costs. Policymakers must consider factors like feedstock costs and commercial-scale production. Congress has long been interested in biofuels, focusing on \"first-generation\" options like cornstarch ethanol. Farm bills have influenced biofuel research since 2002. The farm bills since 2002 have had a significant impact on biofuel research and development. Congress expanded the Renewable Fuel Standard in 2007 to support advanced biofuel production, but it has faced scrutiny, including EPA waivers reducing required renewable fuel volumes. The Renewable Fuel Standard has faced scrutiny due to EPA waivers reducing required renewable fuel volumes, creating uncertainty for stakeholders and hindering advanced biofuel targets. Policy may require more biofuel production than can be used given existing infrastructure and limited vehicles for higher biofuel blends. Congress may need to consider the necessity of a domestic biofuel industry for national defense and potential modifications to biofuel promotional efforts. Technological innovations drive U.S. ocean energy development, enabling exploration of new resources, cost efficiencies, safety measures, and addressing environmental concerns. Industry, universities, and government collaborate on ocean energy R&D, with support from DOE and DOI. Deepwater oil and gas operations are a key focus for industry expansion. The oil and gas industry has been focusing on expanding deepwater activities, improving efficiency, and reducing costs through advancements in drilling technologies and automated monitoring. Safety improvements have also been a priority to prevent catastrophic oil spills in deep water. In 2016, final safety regulations were released by the DOI to tighten requirements for offshore blowout preventer systems and other well control equipment. President Trump ordered a review of these regulations in 2017. The industry is concerned about the cost and time required to meet the rule's technological requirements. Congress may also address technology issues related to offshore drilling in the Arctic due to challenges posed by sea ice and infrastructure gaps. The oil and gas industry has been focusing on expanding deepwater activities and improving safety regulations. In the Arctic, challenges like sea ice and infrastructure gaps affect mineral exploration. Industry R&D is focused on technology to extend the drilling season, with regulations being reviewed for cost and safety concerns. Some argue that current regulations are too costly and do not prioritize available safety technologies. Concerns remain about drilling safety in the Arctic due to environmental risks. Wind energy is the only renewable ocean energy source poised for commercial application in the U.S. In December 2016, the first U.S. offshore wind farm off Rhode Island began operations, focusing on increasing turbine efficiency and reducing costs. Research is also exploring improvements to electrical infrastructure for offshore wind development. Congress is considering how to support offshore wind and other ocean renewables. ITER, an international fusion energy research facility in France, aims to be the world's largest fusion reactor capable of producing more energy than it consumes. The project is a collaboration between the United States, the European Union, China, India, Japan, Russia, and South Korea. The United States withdrew from the initial design phase of ITER in 1998 due to concerns about cost and scope but rejoined in 2003. The project was approved in 2006, with the European Union responsible for 45% of construction costs. U.S. funding for ITER, mainly in-kind contributions, has led to debates in Congress about potential impacts on domestic fusion research programs. The U.S. participation in the ITER project is uncertain as funding details are still to be determined. The construction phase is set to be completed by 2027, with a 13% U.S. cost share during operation and decommissioning. Science and technology are increasingly important in environmental issues, including climate change, carbon sequestration, and water science. The 115th Congress discusses federal government actions on climate change, with science confirming human impact on warming since the mid-20th century. The latest U.S. assessment, the Climate Science Special Report (CSSR), highlights the consensus among climate scientists on the effects of greenhouse gas emissions. The 115th Congress discusses federal government actions on climate change, with science confirming human impact on warming since the mid-20th century. There is a strong consensus among scientists that human influence has been the main cause of observed warming, with no convincing alternative explanation. Continued greenhouse gas emissions are expected to lead to adverse impacts, with a focus on improving climate projections and addressing uncertainties for better impact assessment and risk management decision making. Congress may shift focus to managing risks of climate change, including technology for emission abatement, geoengineering, and adaptation. The U.S. Global Change Research Program coordinates research across government agencies, with priorities on climate, water cycle extremes, and methane cycling. The current Administration has not reported priorities or budget proposals to Congress as required by law. Federal funding for climate change is mainly directed towards advancing clean energy. Advancing clean energy is a key focus for reducing human-related greenhouse gas emissions, particularly from fossil fuels in electricity generation and transportation. Decarbonization of the energy economy is seen as crucial to combatting climate change, with options like carbon capture technologies and geoengineering being considered. International governance regimes may also play a role in addressing climate change risks. Congress has provided billions of dollars in federal support for advancing and deploying new energy technologies, including tax incentives. The programs range from basic research to commercial deployment, focusing on technologies that lower greenhouse gas emissions and offer public health benefits. The 115th Congress may consider legislation regarding federal expenditures for climate change, tax incentives for cleaner energy technologies, and proposals for GHG emission fees or \"carbon taxes\" to promote cleaner technologies and assist workers and communities affected by energy sector transitions. The 115th Congress may also consider federal programs for technologies supporting adaptation to climate change and incorporating climate change projections into federal agency management. Federal agency management of federal resources, infrastructure, and operations, as well as requirements and incentives in federal programs that may impact adaptation decisions. Adequate use of scientific information and available technologies is crucial for effective decision-making. For more information, refer to various CRS reports on climate change, carbon capture, carbon tax, and climate change adaptation by federal agencies. Carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) is a process that captures manmade carbon dioxide (CO2) at its source and stores it to reduce emissions. It allows the use of fossil fuels while mitigating CO2 release. The integrated CCS system involves capturing, purifying, compressing, and transporting CO2 for sequestration. Carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) involves capturing, purifying, compressing, and transporting CO2 to subsurface geological reservoirs for storage. The process includes monitoring for leakage and ensuring long-term underground storage. CCS has evolved to include carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) for various applications. The U.S. Department of Energy has been researching and developing integrated CCS systems since 1997. Since 2010, CCS-focused R&D has been a priority in the coal program area of DOE Fossil Energy Research and Development. Over $4 billion has been allocated for CCS-related RD&D at DOE's Office of Fossil Energy from FY2012-FY2018, excluding funds from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. Despite global examples like the Boundary Dam plant in Canada and the Petra Nova plant in Texas, no commercial ventures in the U.S. have successfully implemented large-scale CO2 capture and sequestration. The Petra Nova plant in Texas and the Boundary Dam plant in Canada retrofitted post-combustion capture technology to existing plants. The Kemper County Energy Facility in Mississippi faced cost overruns and delays, leading to the suspension of its CCS component in 2017. Congress provided $727 million for CCS R&D in FY2018, a 9% increase from FY2017. The Trump Administration's FY2019 budget request would reduce funding for CCS R&D and overall FER&D budget by $225 million compared to FY2018. The Trump Administration's FY2019 budget request focuses DOE resources on early-stage R&D, with a shift towards private sector funding for later-stage research. Specifically, the carbon capture and storage subprograms would see a significant reduction in funding, facing potential opposition from Congress. The federal government supports diverse research activities and facilities related to water supplies and aquatic ecosystems. Recent efforts include sponsoring prize competitions and developing cooperative arrangements with various entities to address drinking water contamination incidents. The 115th Congress may consider various water research and technology topics, including water quantity, quality, and aquatic ecosystems. Science and research agencies use traditional and new technologies to collect data for water-related decisions in infrastructure, agriculture, and drinking water services. The 115th Congress may consider water research topics such as water monitoring infrastructure, coastal water conditions, reservoir operations, invasive species management, and access to water data. The federal water science and research portfolio includes coordination and direction, infrastructure research for coastal and inland water systems, and next-generation technologies. Research topics focus on efficient water use, infrastructure technologies, and materials for monitoring and rehabilitating aging infrastructure. Technologies for water efficiency, infrastructure resilience, and water quality are important for public health and environmental protection. Research topics include detecting and managing contaminants like cyanotoxins and PFASs in surface water, groundwater, and tap water. Technologies for preventing and managing water contamination issues, such as cyanotoxins and PFASs, are crucial for public health and environmental protection. This includes real-time monitoring, treatment to minimize disinfection byproducts, and lead pipe corrosion control. Innovative water protection technologies like nature-based stormwater management and watershed approaches are also important for safeguarding drinking water sources. The federal government invests billions in research and development to protect the homeland, including reports on environmental policy, drought, desalination, sea-level rise, hurricanes, water efficiency, and harmful algal blooms. The government invests billions in research and development to protect the homeland, focusing on issues such as Department of Homeland Security R&D, new medical countermeasures, and core missions like preventing terrorism and securing borders. The Directorate of Science and Technology oversees DHS R&D activities, while the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office handles nuclear and radiological threats. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) oversees R&D activities, with the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office (DNDO) focusing on nuclear and radiological threats. Coordination of DHS R&D has been a long-standing congressional interest, with GAO highlighting challenges in department-wide oversight. In response, DHS was directed to implement new policies for R&D prioritization and review, although policy guidance for DHS-wide R&D oversight is still pending. The Department of Homeland Security lacks policy guidance for DHS-wide R&D oversight and coordination. The Consolidated Appropriations Act highlighted the need for a mechanism to capture and understand R&D activities across DHS. The introduction of the Common Appropriations Structure in the FY2017 budget request includes a Research and Development account for each DHS component. The establishment of the Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction Office in December 2017 aimed to streamline R&D-related activities within DHS. The federal government responded to the anthrax attacks of 2001 by increasing efforts to protect against CBRN terrorism. Policymakers identified a lack of medical countermeasures as a challenge, leading to the creation of programs to encourage private sector involvement. The 115th Congress may consider legislation to authorize the establishment of the Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction Office (CWMDO), which continues to conduct R&D activities. The federal government created programs to encourage private sector development of CBRN medical countermeasures, including BARDA and Project BioShield. These programs fund the advanced development and procurement of countermeasures to address CBRN threats like Ebola. Congress has made modifications to improve the efficiency and transparency of these programs, but some key issues remain. Some unresolved issues in the oversight of programs like BARDA and Project BioShield include appropriations, interagency coordination, and countermeasure prioritization. Congress may need to decide on funding methods and assess if new requirements have improved coordination. The prioritization process should balance traditional threats like anthrax with emerging infectious diseases like Ebola. The rapid advancements in information technology pose various challenges for congressional policymakers, including cybersecurity, artificial intelligence, broadband deployment, net neutrality, public safety networks, emergency alerting, Internet of Things, cryptography, and federal networking R&D.

Broadband technologies, such as cable modem, wireless, and satellite, are key in telecommunications services. Deployment has been led by private sector providers, including telephone, cable, wireless, and satellite companies. Congress and Administrations focus on improving broadband availability, especially in rural and tribal areas. In rural and tribal areas, low population densities and high costs hinder telecommunications providers from investing in broadband infrastructure. Broadband adoption challenges persist, with certain demographics like low-income individuals, seniors, minorities, and the less-educated lagging behind. The 115th Congress is considering various broadband-related issues, including infrastructure legislation, reauthorization of the broadband loan program, new wireless spectrum policies, and regulatory barriers to broadband deployment. The 115th Congress is looking into barriers faced by private sector providers in deploying broadband infrastructure and considering revising the regulatory framework. Policymakers believe that the transition to an IP-based network necessitates changes to the current regulatory structure to incentivize investment in broadband infrastructure. Congress is exploring options to enhance broadband deployment and increase availability and adoption through federal policies. The 115th Congress is examining barriers to broadband infrastructure deployment and considering regulatory framework revisions to incentivize investment. Policymakers are debating the need for unfettered internet access amidst federal policies aimed at increasing broadband availability and adoption while minimizing negative effects of government intervention on competition and private sector investment. The debate over \"net neutrality\" focuses on ensuring equal and non-discriminatory internet access for consumers and content providers. Policymakers are discussing the need for regulatory guidelines to protect unfettered access to the internet. The debate over \"net neutrality\" centers on the need for regulatory guidelines to protect internet access. Some policymakers argue for specific regulations to prevent potential abuses, while others believe existing laws are sufficient. The FCC's authority in broadband regulation is a key issue in the policy debate. The FCC's 2017 Order reversed the 2015 regulatory framework for internet services, shifting oversight to the FTC and DOJ. This move has reignited the debate on how to ensure an open internet, with differing views on the regulatory approach needed. Some support the less regulatory 2017 Order to stimulate broadband investment, while others advocate for the stricter 2015 Order to protect content and services. The debate on net neutrality continues, with some advocating for a more stringent regulatory framework to protect content providers and consumers. Others support specific behavioral rules to address anticompetitive practices but do not agree with the classification of telecommunications services. The future actions of Congress to provide guidance and stability to FCC authority remain uncertain. The First Responder Network Authority (FirstNet) was created by Congress to establish a nationwide broadband network for public safety with $7 billion in funding. This network aims to address communication problems faced by first responders during 9/11. AT&T was selected as the partner for deployment. Congress has provided oversight for the past five years to ensure the network is deployed as intended. The 115th Congress may need more detailed information on the FirstNet network, including deployment, federal funds usage, spectrum utilization, and rural coverage agreements. Concerns exist about the lack of transparency in network deployment and federal resource utilization, making it challenging for Congress to ensure compliance with the law. With a significant federal investment of $6.5 billion and 20 MHz of broadband spectrum, congressional oversight of the FirstNet project is crucial for the safety of first responders and citizens. The 115th Congress may address subscriptions to the FirstNet network, ensuring sustainability and improvement over time. Some agencies are hesitant to join due to security, reliability, and cost concerns, as well as the lack of mission critical voice features until 2019. AT&T offers specialized features to entice users, but some agencies are waiting for improvements before subscribing. Congressional oversight of the project is crucial for the safety of first responders and citizens. The establishment of the FirstNet network aims to provide a nationwide interoperable network for public safety users during emergencies. State and local agencies need to subscribe to FirstNet, integrate its capabilities into response plans, and use the network regularly for enhanced coordination and communication. The 115th Congress may address the integration of FirstNet capabilities into state and local response plans. The false missile alert in Hawaii prompted Congress to reexamine alerting roles and responsibilities. Bills like the ALERT Act of 2018 aim to restrict the authority to issue missile threat alerts to the federal government. The ALERT Act of 2018 aims to restrict the authority to issue missile threat alerts to the federal government, specifically the Department of Defense, to ensure validated alerts and reduce false alarms. In contrast, the recent wildfires in California highlighted issues with county alerting systems that required residents to sign up for alerts, resulting in only a fraction of residents receiving notifications. County officials considered using the federal IPAWS system to reach all residents. County officials considered using the federal IPAWS system to issue alerts but were concerned about the lack of precise targeting for wireless emergency alerts (WEA). In January 2018, the FCC adopted rules to improve geo-targeting of WEA alerts, requiring carriers to deliver alerts in a more geographically precise manner to the communities impacted by an emergency. The FCC adopted rules in January 2018 to improve geo-targeting of Wireless Emergency Alerts (WEA), requiring providers to reach target areas with minimal overshoot. Smaller carriers must deliver alerts to the best approximation of the target area by November 30, 2019. The 115th Congress may address state and local investment in training for alert response. The 2018 California wildfires emphasized the need for backup communications in areas where infrastructure is destroyed. The 115th Congress may address supporting state and local investment in back-up communications and alerting capabilities in case of system failures. The Internet of Things (IoT) will be a key topic of debate, involving networks of objects with unique identifiers and Internet connectivity for automated control of processes.

Concerns exist that the cost of human spaceflight activities could impact funding for other NASA missions like unmanned science satellites and space technology. NASA missions include unmanned science satellites, aeronautics research, and space technology development. Congressional interest is focused on NASA's Earth Science program, particularly in climate research. There are debates in Congress regarding the priority of NASA activities and the potential transfer of Earth Science responsibilities to other agencies. Supporters argue that space-based Earth observations are essential to NASA's science mission. The Department of Commerce found that U.S. companies had $62.9 billion in space-related sales in 2012, with a quarter coming from the commercial sector. An emerging \"new space\" sector focuses on private spaceflight at low cost, driven by NASA's reliance on commercial providers for access to the ISS. These companies also target markets like launching national security satellites, commercial satellites, and space tourism, with the FAA licensing commercial space activities. The U.S. Commercial Space Launch Competitiveness Act extends indemnification policy for launch providers and a moratorium on FAA's safety regulation authority for crewed spaceflight. NASA's plans for commercial crewed flights to the ISS have raised concerns about human spaceflight safety regulations. Other federal agencies involved in the commercial space industry include NOAA for licensing commercial remote sensing satellites and the FCC for licensing commercial satellites and assigning locations for satellites in geostationary orbits. The Department of Commerce Office of Space Commerce supports and promotes U.S. space commerce, overseeing export controls on commercial satellites. The National Space Council made regulatory reform recommendations in 2018, likely resulting in legislative proposals. The 115th Congress is expected to address the commercial space regulatory framework. The United States government operates Earth-observing satellites for various data collection activities, including monitoring polar ice sheets, ocean wind speeds, land cover changes, and atmospheric parameters for weather forecasts. Satellite observations aid in short-term seasonal forecasts, wildfire detection, and long-term climate data used in predictive models. Congress remains interested in the performance of NASA, NOAA, and the U.S. Geological Survey in building and operating Earth-observing satellites to assess current and future climate change. Concerns about budget and schedule adherence have been raised to avoid data gaps in polar-orbiting weather satellite coverage. The successful launch of JPSS-1 has alleviated near-term concerns, with full funding provided for JPSS-2 in FY2018. The GOES-R weather satellite, now known as GOES-16, was launched on November 19, 2016, and is equipped with advanced sensors to improve hurricane tracking, severe weather prediction, and flood warnings. It also carries the first operational lightning mapper in geostationary orbit and monitors space weather. GOES-S, launched on March 1, 2017, has the same instruments as its predecessor. Both satellites, GOES-R (now GOES-16) and GOES-S, are part of a series of four Earth-orbiting weather satellites planned by NOAA through 2036."
