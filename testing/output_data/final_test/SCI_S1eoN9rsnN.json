A meta-reinforcement learning (MRL) method with an adaptive neural network (NN) controller is proposed for efficient policy iteration in changing task conditions, aiming to extend RL application to urban autonomous driving in the CARLA simulator. Inspired by animal behaviorist psychology, RL is widely used in artificial intelligence research for goal-oriented optimization. Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms have shown significant progress in various fields such as games and robotic manipulations, surpassing human performance. However, despite years of research, RL strategies still face challenges in dealing with high-dimensional and non-stationary environments. The industrial application of autonomous driving remains a complex and unsolved problem due to the variability in driving tasks caused by human behavior uncertainty and scene complexity. The observed vulnerability in scene perception due to learning environment changes is addressed in context-aware research, highlighting the need for adaptation in various tasks such as weather forecasting, speech recognition, and industrial control processes. To tackle this variability, researchers are exploring human-like learning approaches to improve artificial agents' generalization capabilities and overcome data inefficiency in machine learning and reinforcement learning methods. In this paper, the focus is on extending RL application to urban autonomous driving in CARLA simulator using a meta-reinforcement learning (MRL) method. The MRL method integrates a neural network (NN) controller for policy evaluation and improvement, reducing variance and accelerating convergence in policy-based RL.

The MRL method integrates a neural network (NN) controller for policy evaluation and improvement, reducing variance and accelerating convergence in policy-based RL. The term meta-learning involves learning awareness based on prior experience, allowing for acquiring new skills with less data and trial-and-error effort. Meta-learning in machine learning research involves training over a series of tasks with similarities to generalize to new situations. It addresses model inaccuracies by acquiring prior biases for fast adaptation from few additional data. The learning operates at two scales: a base-level system for rapid learning within each task, and a meta-level system for gradual learning across tasks. The classical Algorithm Selection Problem (ASP) is one of the first contributions to meta-learning, considering the relationship between problem characteristics and suitable algorithms. The No Free Lunch (NFL) theorem demonstrated that the generalization performance of any learner is equal to 0 across all tasks, making the universal learner a myth. Meta-learning involves understanding the relationship between data characteristics (meta-features) and base-learners' performance to predict the best model for a specific task. Shallow algorithms like decision trees, k-Nearest Neighbors, and Support Vector Machines are commonly used in meta-learning. Neural network models, including deep learning, have seen a resurgence in interest due to large datasets and computational resources. Meta-learning with neural networks involves learning from base-model structures rather than explicit task characteristics. Different types of meta-learners have been developed, such as recurrent models, metrics, and optimizers, with applications in classification, regression, and reinforcement learning. Meta-learning algorithms in reinforcement learning (RL) can be categorized into two main types. The first type uses recurrent neural networks (RNN) or LSTM as the meta-learner, focusing on RL optimization with RNNs for policy representation. The second type utilizes learner gradients for meta-learning, making them adaptable to any model trained with gradient descent. Meta-learning algorithms in reinforcement learning (RL) can be categorized into two main types. The second type utilizes learner gradients for meta-learning, making them adaptable to any model trained with gradient descent. Such methods, like MAML, aim to generate a model initialization sensitive to changes and reach optimal results on a new scenario after just a few gradient updates. Other approaches, like Meta-SGD and Reptile, also focus on efficient adaptation in RL settings. The proposed model in this work involves a gradient-based Meta Reinforcement Learning (MRL) framework with an adaptive neural network (NN) controller for autonomous driving in the challenging CARLA simulator environment. The RL task is defined as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) with sets of states and actions, state transition distribution, rewards, discount factor, initial state distribution, and horizon. The text discusses a Reinforcement Learning (RL) setting where a policy \u03c0 is learned to maximize the return R of a trajectory \u03c4. The approach involves using gradient descents like the REINFORCE algorithm to optimize the policy parameters \u03b8. The goal is to estimate the current state return using a state value function V(s) and update the policy parameters in the direction that improves the return. The text discusses a meta-learning approach in a Reinforcement Learning setting where a neural network controller is used for continuous adaptation of the policy parameters \u03b8. The approach combines a gradient-based meta-learner with a convolutional neural network (CNN) to quickly adapt to new tasks through few-shot generalization. The metaobjective is formulated for tasks sampled from a distribution, with inner and outer loops for base and meta-learning processing. Policy iteration is used to reduce disturbances in complex domains like autonomous driving. The RL scheme integrates policy evaluation and improvement using temporal difference learning with Monte Carlo method and dynamic programming. Multi-step TD error is calculated to bootstrap returns and gather more environment information before estimating the value function with a CNN. The continuous-adapting MRL model improves policy through TD error in policy gradient. Policy parameters are updated using gradient descent for each task. Meta-gradient update is performed on model parameters based on previous rewards. Iterations continue until acceptable performance is achieved for fast driving adaptation. The continuous-adapting MRL model is evaluated for urban autonomous driving, demonstrating the effectiveness of meta-level learning with a NN controller to optimize the RL policy. Preliminary results show the agent adapts faster at training and generalizes better in unseen environments. Experiments are conducted in the CARLA simulator with varying task complexities to induce nonstationary environments. The study evaluates a continuous-adapting MRL model for urban autonomous driving in the CARLA simulator. The model optimizes the RL policy using meta-level learning with a NN controller. Tasks include selecting towns, start/end positions, traffic density, and weather/lighting conditions. The reward is based on distance traveled, speed, collisions, and overlaps. The methodology involves comparing results due to the absence of state-of-the-art work on the simulator. In the recent CARLA simulator study, the continuous-adapting MRL model is compared with pre-trained and randomly initialized RL algorithms. The average episodic reward is used to evaluate performance, with results showing faster adaptation in \"unseen\" environments. The meta-learning approach outperforms standard RL strategies after 10000 steps. Further tests are needed to determine a specific threshold for few-shot learning. Further tests are required to establish a specific threshold for few-shot learning in high-dimensional settings like autonomous driving tasks. The comparison between \"seen\" and \"unseen\" environments shows the robustness of the continuous-adapting MRL model, outperforming pre-trained standard RL in the latter. However, it is too early to draw definitive conclusions at this preliminary evaluation stage. The episodic reward indicator should be complemented with the percentage of successfully completed episodes to demonstrate effective learning and allow comparison with state-of-the-art methods. In this paper, the proposed approach based on gradient-based meta-learning addresses the limits of RL algorithms in solving high-dimensional and complex tasks, specifically in autonomous driving. The approach showed higher performance and faster learning capabilities compared to conventionally pre-trained and randomly initialized RL algorithms when evaluated using the CARLA simulator. The paper proposes a gradient-based meta-learning approach to improve RL algorithms for high-dimensional tasks like autonomous driving. Future work will focus on refining the reward function, CNN architecture, and incorporating vehicle characteristics for task complexity."
