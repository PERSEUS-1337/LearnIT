    "content": "According to the U.S. Department of Education data, public education spent $36.8 billion on construction and $3.3 billion on land and structures in FY2012. Colleges and universities completed $12.0 billion in construction in 2014. The federal government plays a role in financing school construction through indirect and direct support. This report examines school infrastructure needs. The report discusses the federal role in financing school infrastructure for K-12 public schools and higher education facilities. Data on school infrastructure condition and investment needs are limited and outdated, making it difficult to assess. There is no ongoing federal data collection on school conditions, but a one-time study in 2000 estimated costs for modernizations, renovations, and repairs for K-12 public school buildings. The estimated cost of repairs, renovations, and modernization required to bring 2012-2013 public school facilities into good condition was approximately $197 billion or $4.5 million per school. School infrastructure needs are affected by the age, physical condition, student population shifts, changes in school policies, expectations, technology, and instructional practices. For example, smaller class sizes may require additional space, computers may need rewiring, and science curriculum changes may necessitate new facilities. Increased science curriculum requirements may necessitate new laboratory facilities and rewiring classrooms. Postsecondary education institutions rely on land and facilities as tangible assets to support enrollment growth and technological advancements. Regular maintenance and renovation of facilities are essential for research and educational missions. Research universities may need an endowment equal to construction costs to maintain facilities. The National Science Foundation's biennial study shows that a significant portion of research space at colleges and universities required renovation or replacement in recent years. The costs for new construction, repair, and renovation of science and engineering research space in academic institutions increased from $9.9 billion in FY2010/FY2011 to $10.5 billion in FY2014/FY2015. Deferred projects costs rose from $21.3 billion in FY2011 to $22.0 billion in FY2015. The Educational Facilities Clearinghouse, supported by the Department of Education since 1997, provides resources for planning, designing, and maintaining educational facilities. Congress allocated $1 million for the clearinghouse in the FY2015 appropriations conference agreement. The federal government has historically played a role in financing school facilities through tax-exempt bonds. State and local governments issue these bonds to fund public projects, and certain private activities, allowing them to be issued at lower interest rates. Additionally, tax credit bonds are available, providing holders with a federal tax credit for a percentage of the bond's value for a limited time. During the Great Depression, the federal government funded school infrastructure through programs like the Works Progress Administration, which built and renovated thousands of schools. Impact Aid programs were also established to fund school construction in federally affected areas, areas impacted by federal activities, and facilities damaged by disasters. These programs provided equitable services to private school students from FY1989 to FY2001 in response to Supreme Court rulings. In the 1990s, efforts were made to increase federal assistance for school infrastructure improvements. The Education Infrastructure Act of 1994, part of the Improving America's Schools Act, aimed to provide federal aid for school renovation and construction but was never funded. FEMA has managed disaster assistance programs since 1992, with Congress enacting additional legislation for temporary programs in response to natural disasters. The Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2001 allocated $1.2 billion for school renovation, repair, and technology activities. Most of the funding went towards school facilities in specific LEAs, but the program was not permanently authorized and did not receive funding in subsequent years. In 2009, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act authorized a one-time $54 billion for state renovation and construction. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 authorized a $54 billion State Fiscal Stabilization Fund for education, including the restoration of public school facilities. States were required to allocate a portion of the funds for K-12 construction but not for higher education facilities. Federal support for higher education facilities dates back to the 1857 Act for the Deaf and Blind institution, with subsequent appropriations for Howard University and the National Technical Institute for the Deaf. Various loan and grant programs have been authorized by Congress to aid in the construction, reconstruction, and renovation of educational facilities. The Higher Education Facilities Act of 1963 authorized loans for construction of academic facilities, with a revolving loan fund established by P.L. 89-429. The Education Amendments of 1972 provided annual interest grants and academic facilities loan insurance to assist in procuring loans for academic facilities. The Public Health Service Act, as amended by the Health Professions Educational Assistance Act of 1963, authorized grants for teaching facilities for health personnel and schools of nursing. The Higher Education Facilities Act of 1963 authorized grants for teaching facilities for health personnel and schools of nursing. Loan guaranties and interest subsidies were provided for construction, rehabilitation, and replacement of teaching facilities. Federal support for nursing school facilities was repealed by the Nurse Education Amendments of 1985. The Higher Education Facilities Act of 1963 authorized grants for undergraduate and graduate academic facilities to increase enrollment capacity at institutions of higher education. If a facility funded by these grants ceases to be used for academic purposes within 20 years, the federal government can recover a share of the grant. The Education Amendments of 1972 established a program for the establishment and expansion of community colleges. The Education Amendments of 1976 and 1980 amended programs for community colleges, providing funds for reconstruction, renovation, and modernization of facilities. The 1980 amendments repealed three existing facilities programs. The Higher Education Amendments of 1986 expanded grant funds for postsecondary institutions to improve facilities, comply with hazardous waste disposal requirements, enhance energy efficiency, provide advanced skill training programs, and preserve significant architecture. It also authorized the establishment of the College Construction Loan Insurance Association (Connie Lee). Connie Lee, a private corporation, succeeded the Academic Facilities Loan Insurance program to guarantee bonds, debentures, and loans for education facilities. Congress was concerned about deteriorating facilities affecting higher education quality and lack of access to capital for financially sound institutions. The U.S. Department of Education and Sallie Mae became significant shareholders of Connie Lee. The 1986 Amendments authorized Sallie Mae to finance higher education academic facilities. Connie Lee and Sallie Mae were privatized under the Omnibus Consolidated Appropriations Act, 1997. Reasons for privatizing Connie Lee included declining federal government share, success of other investors in providing loans, statutory limitations on Connie Lee's market expansion, and federal policy encouraging downsizing and privatizing. The Higher Education Amendments of 1992 replaced existing grant and loan programs with new ones, which were never funded. Loan programs have not issued new loans since FY1993, but collections and resolutions may continue through FY2030. The 1992 Amendments also authorized the Historically Black College and University Capital Financing program. The Higher Education Amendments of 1992 replaced existing grant and loan programs with new ones, which were never funded. Amendments also authorized the Historically Black College and University Capital Financing program to provide HBCUs with access to low-cost capital for school construction and renovation.
