    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Neotropical Migratory Bird Conservation Act\". It includes findings related to bird conservation. Congress finds that approximately 500 bird species in the United States migrate among countries, with the majority wintering in Latin America and the Caribbean. These neotropical migratory birds provide valuable benefits to the environment, economy, and recreation. Many of these bird populations are declining due to habitat loss and degradation, putting their long-term survival at risk. Neotropical migratory birds' conservation requires international cooperation due to their range crossing borders annually. Initiatives exist but need increased coordination for stronger conservation efforts. The purposes of this Act are to perpetuate healthy populations of neotropical migratory birds, support conservation initiatives in the United States and Latin America, provide financial resources, and foster international cooperation. The Act defines key terms such as \"Account,\" \"Conservation,\" and \"Secretary\" in relation to the Neotropical Migratory Bird Conservation Account. SEC. 5. FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE. The Secretary will establish a program to provide financial assistance for projects promoting the conservation of neotropical migratory birds. Project proposals can be submitted by various entities including individuals, corporations, government agencies, and international organizations. To be considered for financial assistance under the International Organizations Immunities Act, an applicant must submit a project proposal that includes the name of the project leader, project purposes, qualifications of project staff, estimated funds and time needed, and how the project will enhance neotropical migratory bird conservation in Latin America, the Caribbean, or the United States. The project proposal must ensure local public participation, consult with wildlife management authorities, respect cultural resources, promote sustainable bird conservation programs, and provide necessary information for evaluation. Recipients of assistance must report on project progress. Each recipient of assistance for a project under this Act must submit periodic reports to the Secretary for evaluating progress and outcomes. The Federal share of project costs should not exceed 33 percent, and the non-Federal share must be paid in cash and not derived from any Federal grant program. Projects in foreign countries may have the non-Federal share paid in cash or in kind. The Secretary's duties under the Act include developing guidelines for project proposals, encouraging submissions from wildlife management authorities, selecting proposals that meet requirements and conservation needs, and implementing the Act. Cooperation is also emphasized. The Secretary shall support and coordinate efforts to conserve neotropical migratory bird species by facilitating meetings, exchanging information, entering agreements, and coordinating activities with existing conservation projects. An advisory group is also established. The Secretary may convene an advisory group consisting of individuals representing organizations involved in neotropical migratory bird conservation. The advisory group must hold open meetings and allow public participation by providing opportunities for oral or written statements. Timely notice of meetings must be given to the public. The advisory group must provide timely notice of meetings and keep minutes available to the public. The group is exempt from the Federal Advisory Committee Act. The Secretary is required to submit a report to Congress by October 1, 2002, detailing the program's results and effectiveness under the Act, along with recommendations for improvement and whether the program should continue. Additionally, there is a provision for the Neotropical Migratory Bird Conservation Account. Establishment of the Neotropical Migratory Bird Conservation Account within the Multinational Species Conservation Fund of the Treasury to receive donations and appropriations. The Secretary of the Treasury can use the funds for program activities without further appropriation, with a limit of 6 percent for administrative expenses. The Secretary can accept donations for the Neotropical Migratory Bird Conservation Account and use them for program activities. Donations will be transferred to the Treasury for deposit. Administrative expenses are limited to 6 percent. Authorization of appropriations for the Neotropical Migratory Bird Conservation Account is set at $8,000,000 for each fiscal year from 1999 to 2002, with at least 50 percent allocated for projects outside the United States."
