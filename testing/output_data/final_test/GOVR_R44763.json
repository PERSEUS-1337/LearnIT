Congress determines eligibility and benefits for these programs, with benefits typically paid automatically once eligibility is confirmed. The report discusses the structure and trends of mandatory federal spending programs, including social insurance and other programs established to address economic vulnerability. It highlights the impact of historical challenges on these programs and their role in shaping federal government policies. The growth of health care costs and the aging population are key factors influencing mandatory spending trends. The aging population and rising health care costs have impacted mandatory federal spending, which exceeded discretionary spending in FY2016. Policy makers face choices to increase revenues, change program structures, or reduce spending. Economic conditions have also affected household financial resiliency. In FY2016, federal net interest payments accounted for 1.4% of GDP, with total federal spending representing 21% of GDP. Mandatory spending, including Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, made up about 63% of all federal spending. Mandatory spending, combined with net interest, accounted for over two-thirds of federal outlays in FY2016 and is expected to grow over time. Figure 1 illustrates the evolution of mandatory, discretionary, and net interest outlays since FY1962 as a share of the economy. In 1962, before Medicare and Medicaid, mandatory spending was less than 30% of federal spending. Social Security accounted for about 13% of total federal spending. The growth of mandatory outlays reflects the expansion of Social Security and other programs, as well as the introduction of Medicare and Medicaid in 1965. In the 1980s and 1990s, efforts were made to control the rising costs of medical care for Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries. Initiatives aimed to expand coverage for vulnerable populations and limit financial consequences of serious medical episodes. Economic downturns also increased eligibility for income support programs like unemployment insurance. The effects of recessions in the 1970s and the Great Recession are evident in federal spending trends. Mandatory spending, acting as an automatic stabilization force, offsets the fall in private demand during recessions. Recent years have seen mandatory spending at 12-13% of GDP, projected to rise to 14.9% by FY2026. Concerns arise over funding streams for mandatory programs in the face of aging population and increasing healthcare costs. The funding streams for mandatory programs like Social Security and Medicare are facing challenges due to an aging population and rising healthcare costs. Social Security trust funds are expected to be drawn down as benefit payments exceed collections, with the Disability Insurance trust fund projected to be exhausted by 2023. The Old Age and Survivors Insurance (OASI) trust fund is projected to be exhausted by 2035, with tax collections covering three-fourths of benefits. Medicare faces a financial shortfall, with the Health Insurance (HI) trust fund projected to be depleted by 2028. The Supplemental Medical Insurance (SMI) trust fund for Medicare Part B benefits is not at risk of exhaustion due to its financing structure. Part B costs for Medicare are projected to increase from 1.7% of GDP in FY2016 to 2.7% by 2090. Mandatory spending is controlled by laws other than appropriations acts and is typically provided in permanent or multi-year appropriations. Funding becomes available automatically each year without further action. The authorizing law allows for automatic funding each year without further legislative action. Discretionary spending is controlled by appropriations acts, while net interest payments are automatically authorized. Net interest costs could be considered part of mandatory spending. The budget categories of discretionary, mandatory/direct, and net interest are often referred to as BEA categories. Most mandatory spending supports social insurance or income security programs like Social Security and Medicare, while discretionary spending supports federal agency operations. Some activities funded by both types of spending may overlap, such as the responsibilities of federal judges. Entitlement spending, like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), is also considered in this context. Entitlement spending, including programs like SNAP and Medicaid, is funded through annual appropriations acts. This type of spending, known as appropriated entitlements, is based on benefit and eligibility criteria set by law. The Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 classified appropriated entitlement spending as mandatory, as it is determined by authorizing legislation. The terms \"entitlement\" and \"entitlement authority\" are often used in relation to mandatory spending, which is based on the government's legal obligation to pay. The federal government's legal obligation to pay for entitlement programs like Social Security and Medicaid is determined by complex legal issues. Mandatory programs like Social Security and Medicare are funded through payroll taxes, beneficiary premiums, and general federal revenues. Medicaid, a joint federal-state program, is funded by a statutory formula. The federal government funds mandatory programs like Medicaid and retirement programs through payroll deductions, contributions, and general revenues. Other mandatory programs, such as veterans' benefits and agricultural subsidies, are also funded by general revenues. Discretionary funding supports the administration of federal benefits programs, with mandatory spending partially offset by fees and payments known as offsetting receipts. Market-like charges, such as Medicare premiums, are considered offsetting receipts, along with federal tax and pension contributions. The Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 (FCRA) changed how federal loan programs are accounted for in the budget. Instead of cash basis, FCRA programs are recorded on a net subsidy basis to reflect the estimated long-term cost to the government. This was done to align the budgetary treatment of federal credit programs with other federal outlays. The Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 (FCRA) changed how federal loan programs are accounted for in the budget by recording them on a net subsidy basis. This aligns the budgetary treatment of federal credit programs with other federal outlays. In the 1970s, Congress enacted the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act to establish new budgetary concepts and rules to control mandatory spending. The Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act (CBA) of the 1970s allowed Congress to have greater control over federal funds by establishing new budgetary concepts and rules. It aimed to regulate aggregate spending, revenue, deficits, and debt levels. The Act addressed issues such as entitlement spending, uncontrollable spending, trust fund programs, and permanent authorizations. This was necessary to regain fiscal control over certain types of spending that had been eroded by previous budget practices. In 1985, Congress established sequestration procedures for spending categories, with exemptions for some accounts. The Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 defined direct spending accounts. OMB retroactively applied these definitions to calculate historical data back to FY1962. The evolution of mandatory programs reflects social forces and events over decades, with key policy responses in the mid-20th century. Historical events like wars and economic depressions influenced federal programs, along with gradual social trends like urbanization. From the early 19th century to the early 20th century, the United States underwent a transformation from an agricultural and rural nation to an urban and industrial one. Social trends such as urbanization, industrialization, migration, rising incomes, and improved longevity, along with changes in federal programs, influenced American society and the role of the federal government. The federal government gained wider legal and regulatory authorities in the post-Civil War decades, with social expenditures becoming a significant portion of the federal budget after World War I. The federal budget includes pensions and benefits, with changes prompted by the Great Depression. Federal responses to national challenges and social forces led to the establishment of mandatory programs. Funds were used for pensions and compensation since the early years of the federal government. In 1798, the Act for the Relief of Sick and Disabled Seamen created a network of hospitals for merchant sailors. After the Civil War, military pensions became a significant part of federal finances, initially for disabled Union veterans and later extended to all veterans and their families. The number of pensioners doubled between 1889 and 1898. Between 1889 and 1898, the number of pensioners doubled from about half a million to a million, funded by rising tariff revenues and falling debt service costs. War pensions accounted for a quarter of federal spending between 1880 and 1910, with veterans' pensions being an appropriated entitlement. Other budget items included Civil War and Reconstruction claims, customs administrative costs, bond service on railroad bonds, mariners' hospitals, education for the blind, and payments to states from land sales proceeds. The Civil War pension system paved the way for social insurance proposals in the early 20th century. Various historical trends, such as the introduction of social insurance programs in Germany in 1883, influenced the development of national insurance systems in other European countries. Social insurance spreads individual risks over larger groups to make costs more manageable. Proponents argued that social insurance was necessary when private insurance arrangements were insufficient to cover certain risks. When private insurance arrangements are inadequate for certain risks, governments can establish mandatory social insurance programs for specific employment or population categories. Mandatory coverage helps prevent adverse selection, where high-risk individuals dominate voluntary plans. However, social insurance may face moral hazard issues, like discouraging employment with disability insurance. It also aids low-income individuals who struggle to afford private insurance, requiring a redistribution of resources from higher income contributors. Progressive-era reforms and research efforts in the early 20th century influenced later federal initiatives for mandatory social insurance programs. These initiatives aimed to address work conditions, unemployment, disability, and old-age pensions at the state level. Progressivism was characterized by a scientific approach to government and social conditions, with social surveys linking poverty and industrial accidents. In the early 20th century, progressive reforms linked poverty and industrial accidents, leading to calls for compulsory social insurance. Federal Employees' Compensation Act of 1908 provided benefits for federal employees in hazardous jobs. Major federal social program changes occurred during the Great Depression and New Deal initiatives. Federal spending on education, public welfare, health, and veterans' services increased after 1933. The Social Security Act of 1935 established old-age pensions and unemployment insurance systems in every state by 1937. It also provided funds for maternal and infant care, children's rehabilitation, and aid for dependent children under 16. The Social Security Act of 1935 established old-age pensions and unemployment insurance systems in every state by 1937, funded by employer and employee contributions. President Roosevelt believed this contributory basis would protect the programs from repeal. The federal government's financial condition in the 1930s, with low revenues and rising deficits, influenced the decision to rely on contributions rather than tax-funded welfare. Social insurance programs were further expanded in the 1950s and 1960s. In the 1950s and 1960s, social insurance programs were expanded, including the extension of Social Security to cover certain medical costs for aged, blind, and disabled beneficiaries. The Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) program was established in 1956, initially providing cash benefits to disabled workers over 50, later expanding to dependents and a broader range of disabled individuals. The Kerr-Mills Act of 1960 supported state programs for healthcare of the elderly and disabled, while a two-year food stamp program was authorized in 1959, with pilot programs starting in 1961. The John F. Kennedy Administration initiated pilot programs in 1961, leading to the establishment of the Food Stamp program (now SNAP) in 1964. In 1965, the Lyndon B. Johnson Administration collaborated with Wilbur Mills to create Medicare, providing health insurance for Americans over 65. The Social Security Amendments of 1965 introduced compulsory hospital insurance (Part A) and voluntary physician services (Part B), along with the establishment of Medicaid as a joint federal-state program. The Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program replaced previous grants-in-aid programs for the blind and those with disabilities in 1974. SSI benefits were funded from federal general revenues, unlike Social Security. Legislation in 1972 also expanded Medicare coverage to include those under 65 with permanent disabilities or end-stage renal disease. Additionally, a temporary earned income tax credit (EITC) was enacted in response to the 1974-1975 recession and made permanent in 1978 to support low-income working households. In the 1960s and 1970s, Social Security saw increased outlays as it served more retirees. The rise in health costs after the introduction of Medicare and Medicaid was not anticipated. Mandatory spending on entitlement programs increased, leading to interest in cost control. Rising outlays for entitlement programs in the 1970s and early 1980s led to interest in cost control measures. By FY1975, mandatory spending accounted for 46% of federal outlays, up from 31% a decade earlier. President Carter's proposals to reform welfare programs and healthcare were not approved by Congress. Under the Reagan Administration, Medicare payment rules were changed to set amounts based on patient diagnoses, resulting in lower outlays than projected. The Reagan Administration and congressional allies enacted sweeping changes in omnibus measures using reconciliation procedures in the early 1980s. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981 made significant cuts in Social Security benefits and income support programs. President Reagan and House Speaker Tip O'Neill formed a commission headed by Alan Greenspan to study the financial condition of the Social Security program. Recommendations of the Greenspan Commission in 1983 aimed to balance Social Security benefits and revenues over the next 75 years. Budget deficits led to measures like the 1985 Gramm-Rudman-Hollings legislation to reduce them. The 1985 Gramm-Rudman-Hollings legislation constrained mandatory program spending through the 1980s, superseded by the 1990 Budget Enforcement Act imposing pay-as-you-go requirements. Trends in mandatory outlays within the Human Resources category from FY1977 through FY2021 are shown in Figure 5. Social Security and income support outlays were affected by the 1981-1982 recession, while Medicare outlays continued to rise in the 1980s. In 1993, the Clinton Administration proposed a national health insurance system that failed to gain congressional approval. In the late 1990s, the Clinton Administration enacted the State Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) and transformed Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) into the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families Program (TANF), which imposed work requirements. Funding to states was converted into block grants, giving states more control over eligibility and program design. In the late 1990s, President Clinton proposed using Social Security surpluses to pay down federal debt. President George W. Bush later proposed tax cuts and a doubling of the Medicare budget. Legislation enacted tax cuts and increased the child tax credit. The Bush Administration proposed adding a pharmaceutical drug benefit option to the Medicare program in 2003 through the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act. The Great Recession prompted Congress to take actions to counteract economic decline and financial distress. During the financial crisis of 2007-2008, mandatory spending increased due to falling incomes and unemployment, financial institution rescue legislation, and ARRA costs. Measures like HERA were implemented to stabilize housing markets and financial institutions. In July 2008, the Housing and Economic Recovery Act (HERA) was enacted to ensure government-sponsored enterprises had enough capital. In September 2008, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were put into federal conservatorship under HERA due to insolvency risks, requiring $188 billion in credit guarantees and capital infusions. The U.S. Treasury received senior equity investments in exchange for special dividends. By June 2016, the Treasury had received $149 billion from Fannie Mae and $99 billion from Freddie Mac. The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act (EESA) was enacted in October 2008 to provide liquidity during the financial crisis following the Lehman Brothers' failure. The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act (EESA; P.L. 110-343) enacted in October 2008 provided $700 billion through the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) for financial sector stabilization. By March 2016, $431 billion was disbursed from TARP, costing the government $30 billion. In February 2009, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA; P.L. 111-5) included funding increases, tax cuts, and support for state and local governments, with $267 billion in mandatory outlays for Medicaid, SNAP, tax credits, unemployment benefits, and infrastructure projects. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) focused on unemployment compensation benefits, bond subsidies for infrastructure projects, and healthcare reforms through the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA). ACA expanded Medicaid benefits, extended CHIP, and established health insurance exchanges to provide coverage for those without insurance. It also included refundable premium credits and cost-sharing subsidies to reduce plan costs for low-income individuals. The Bowles-Simpson Commission was set up in 2010 to improve the fiscal situation and achieve fiscal sustainability. The commission proposed changes in mandatory spending programs, health care payment reforms, Social Security enhancements, and cuts in other mandatory spending. The Budget Control Act of 2011 aimed to achieve $2.1 trillion in savings over a decade through budget enforcement mechanisms. The bipartisan Super Committee failed to develop a deficit reduction plan, leading to backup enforcement mechanisms like sequestration of non-exempt mandatory spending. Medicare patient care expenses face a 2% reduction under sequestration. Sequestration of mandatory spending has been extended through FY2025, with $12.6 billion in Medicare expenses and $6.1 billion in other mandatory spending anticipated to be sequestered in FY2017. Mandatory spending plays a crucial role in fiscal policy by promoting macroeconomic stability through countercyclical fiscal stimulus without the need for new legislative action. The role of \"automatic stabilizers\" in fiscal policy has been a focus of research and discussion for years. Some argue that tax policy is more effective for countercyclical fiscal action due to its speed and simplicity in supporting aggregate demand. However, others believe that government spending multipliers exceed those for tax cuts, and measures targeting vulnerable populations may be justified during a persistent downturn. During the 2007-2009 financial crisis, mandatory spending increased sharply, driven by specific components. Interventions like the conservatorship of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and TARP played a role in stabilizing the economy. Trends in mandatory income security programs and the State Children's Health Insurance Program are shown in Figure 6. During the financial crisis, mandatory spending rose sharply, driven by specific components like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac interventions and TARP. Spending on unemployment insurance increased and later declined, while SNAP funding rose during the recession but decreased slower than unemployment insurance after FY2010. Medicaid outlays increased during the recession due to temporary federal cost share increases. Other programs were less affected by the business cycle. Mandatory spending is projected to rise over the next decade, reaching 15% of GDP in FY2026, while discretionary spending is expected to fall to 5.3% of GDP in the same year. By FY2019, Medicare and Medicaid outlays are projected to exceed all discretionary outlays, with Social Security outlays surpassing discretionary outlays by FY2023. The increase in mandatory spending is mainly due to rising per capita health care costs and the effects of an aging population, as Baby Boomers continue to retire. The rising costs of healthcare for retirees, particularly those aged 85 and older, are increasing federal benefits. While healthcare cost growth has slowed, concerns persist about potential acceleration. The direct fiscal impacts of the Great Recession are no longer prominent in mandatory spending trends. Future recessions could lead to a faster rise in mandatory spending, influenced by the aging Baby Boom generation. The aging Baby Boom generation, born after World War II and before the early 1960s, will shape the extent of demographic changes. Census projections show a growing proportion of people aged 65 or older, with the number of those aged 85 or older projected to double by 2040. This demographic shift will impact economic growth, with some economists predicting lower growth rates in the future. Similar challenges are faced by other advanced economies. Health care sector price trends will also play a significant role in determining future outcomes. The federal government faces significant fiscal imbalances in the coming decades due to demographic challenges and high health care prices in the United States. Mandatory spending aimed at helping vulnerable populations will be affected by trends in income and wealth inequality. According to CBO projections, Social Security and Medicare outlays will account for a significant portion of GDP in the future, with Medicare outlays continuing to grow. Maintaining the current ratio of federal debt to GDP is a concern. The federal government is facing fiscal imbalances due to demographic challenges and high healthcare costs. Maintaining the current federal debt to GDP ratio would require a 1.7% adjustment achieved through spending cuts or revenue increases. Social Security program structure will impact the budget in the future, with payroll taxes invested in Treasury securities. Interest from these securities boosts Social Security revenues. The Treasury's general fund receives cash to offset deficits in the federal government. Social Security's finances are distinct from the rest of the government, with trust fund data historically presented separately. Congress defined Social Security payments and taxes as off-budget in 1985. Trust fund balances grew after changes recommended by the 1983 Greenspan Commission. In the 1990s and following decade, fund balances grew due to Baby Boomers' peak earning years. Social Security payroll taxes exceeded benefits, creating off-budget surpluses that offset deficits. By FY2016, Social Security revenues slightly surpassed outlays. However, future projections show outlays exceeding revenues, leading to a drawdown of reserves. Once reserves are depleted, benefits may be reduced to 75% of previous levels, requiring adjustments through reduced spending, higher taxes, or additional borrowing. The scale and growth of mandatory spending pose challenges for Congress, requiring significant adjustments in household finances. Discretionary spending is projected to shrink, and further reductions could help narrow fiscal imbalances. Net interest costs reflect federal debt levels and interest rates. The remaining federal outlays reflect federal debt levels and interest rates. Policymakers may need to increase tax rates or introduce new taxes like a federal VAT to support higher mandatory spending. However, higher taxes could impact economic performance unless tax system efficiency is improved. Policymakers could also reduce mandatory spending by limiting benefits or controlling cost growth in sectors supplying government goods and services. Providing more support to the elderly is seen as justified for equity reasons due to future economic growth. Future changes in demographics and social structure in the U.S. could impact support for social insurance and mandatory spending programs. Political scientists note increasing social and political polarization, while economists observe rising income and wealth inequality. These trends could complicate future policy decisions on mandatory spending. Budget experts suggest changes in congressional procedures to assess and adjust mandatory spending and tax expenditures regularly. The budget reconciliation process allows adjustments to mandatory spending without procedural hurdles. Congress faces a choice between specific program reforms or a \"grand bargain\" for broader budget and tax policy changes. Previous attempts at sweeping budget changes lacked broad support in Congress. Focusing on a narrower set of programs for reforms may allow for more careful consideration of their impact on various stakeholders. Some argue that Social Security reforms should be separate from broader budget discussions due to its unique funding structure. Mandatory programs vary in difficulty to change, with technical challenges differing between programs like Social Security and others involving state governments. In the 20th century, social insurance programs protected individuals from health, disability, poverty, unemployment, and old age risks. Concerns have been raised about increased household risks since the 1980s and future fiscal imbalances. Congress balances social protection with fiscal responsibility, with debates on expanding mandatory programs or cutting back on social programs. Some argue for reducing social programs to encourage individuals to use their own resources, improving the government's fiscal condition. The choice of how narrowly to target mandatory spending programs is important, as it can affect resource allocation. However, overly strict eligibility criteria can lead to unequal treatment, while benefit phaseouts may discourage work. Gradual phaseouts can help, but may increase costs and benefit those who don't need it. Some researchers suggest that mandatory spending programs like Social Security were designed to minimize income thresholds for broader public support. Congress must decide on the pace of reforms to improve federal finances. Sudden changes in income support or tax policies can disrupt financial plans and impose adjustment costs. Delaying fiscal imbalance solutions may lead to more painful adjustments in the future."
