The 'major rule' is defined as a rule with significant economic impact, cost increase, or effects on competition. The Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs is established under section 3503 of title 44. An agency must publish an advance notice of proposed rule making for a major rule in the Federal Register 90 days before publishing the notice of proposed rule making.

Exceptions to the rule-making process include cases where the agency is not required to publish a notice in the Federal Register, or if complying with the requirements would not serve the public interest or be overly burdensome. The rule-making process may be exempted for agencies under specific circumstances, and the Administrator's determination is not subject to judicial review. Any deviation from agency policies in the final action is not considered arbitrary or capricious. The rule-making process may be exempted for agencies under specific circumstances, and the Administrator's determination is not subject to judicial review, even with the law under section 706(2)(A)."
