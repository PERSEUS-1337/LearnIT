    "content": "Domestic energy policy in the U.S. is driven by two main goals: promoting energy security and addressing environmental concerns. The focus is on developing domestic energy generation capacity to enhance security, especially in the transportation sector heavily reliant on petroleum. Additionally, there is a push to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by utilizing renewable energy sources for electricity and fuel production. Despite these objectives, growth in renewable energy production has been slow. Despite energy policy objectives, growth in renewable energy production has been slow. In 1949, 32 quadrillion btus of energy were produced, with 9% from renewables. By 2009, energy production doubled to 73 quadrillion btus, with 10.6% from renewables. Recent evidence shows renewables are growing, with 39% of new electric generating capacity in 2009 from wind power. Wind power's share in domestic energy production increased by 28%. Wind power's share in domestic energy production increased by 28% from 2008 to 2009, reaching 0.96%. Domestic energy consumption decreased from 99 quadrillion btus in 2008 to less than 95 quadrillion btus in 2009. Renewables accounted for 7.4% of energy consumption in 2008 and increased to 8.2% in 2009. Federal policies could boost renewable energy production. Legislative proposals for a national renewable portfolio standard (RPS) have been discussed in Congress, with goals ranging from 15% to 25% of energy generated from renewable sources by 2020 or 2025. While adoption of a federal RPS is not imminent, there is strong interest in increasing the use of renewables and energy efficiency through current policies like tax incentives and federal grants. Current policies, such as tax incentives and federal grants, aim to promote renewables and energy efficiency to enhance domestic energy security and address environmental concerns. Congress is expected to continue encouraging investments in renewable energy by leveraging private capital and evaluating past initiatives for future energy policy. This report focuses on federally subsidized debt for renewables and energy efficiency, evaluating past initiatives for future energy policy. Government intervention addresses market failures due to externalities, promoting renewables and efficiency through tax policies. Government policy, particularly tax policy, can improve economic efficiency by internalizing externalities in the market. Energy production and consumption, such as burning fossil fuels, create negative externalities like air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. Imposing a tax on polluting activities forces polluters to consider the total costs, leading to a more efficient allocation of resources. Fossil fuel energy production incurs environmental costs not fully borne by producers or consumers, resulting in an overproduction of energy from fossil fuels. Imposing a tax on polluting activities can lead to a more efficient allocation of resources by increasing costs and reducing the quantity of pollution. Alternatively, subsidizing non-externality-generating alternatives like renewable energy sources can also be an effective policy option. Energy tax policy in the United States has leaned towards providing tax credits and preferences for renewable sources. The United States has leaned towards providing tax credits and preferences for renewable energy sources to make them cheaper and increase investments. Critics argue that tax preferences may not be economically efficient as they reduce government revenues and can distort investments towards less cost-effective technologies. Tax subsidies for renewable energy aim to reduce the average cost of energy resources, potentially increasing investment in renewables. However, critics argue that such incentives may distort investments and lead to unintended consequences like increased fossil fuel consumption due to reduced energy costs broadly. Tax incentives for renewables increase investment but may lead to increased fossil energy consumption due to reduced energy prices. Investments in energy projects are capital intensive, and tax incentives historically promote renewable energy investments. Federally subsidized financing offers an alternative to direct tax incentives, reducing the cost of capital for renewable energy projects. In recent years, federally subsidized financing has been available to promote investments in renewable energy and energy efficiency through tax-exempt bonds issued by state and local governments. In 2009, over $2.8 trillion of municipal bonds were outstanding, with state authorities being the largest annual issuer. The federal government provides a tax subsidy for tax-exempt bonds, lowering interest costs for issuers and offering higher returns for high-income investors. Tax-exempt bonds had an average interest rate of 3.87% in 2010, compared to 4.68% for taxable corporate bonds. Investors in the top income tax brackets benefit the most from tax-exempt bond investments. The federal government provides a tax subsidy for tax-exempt bonds, lowering interest costs for issuers and offering higher returns for high-income investors. Tax-exempt bonds had an average interest rate of 3.87% in 2010, compared to 4.68% for taxable corporate bonds. Investors in the top income tax brackets benefit the most from tax-exempt bond investments. In this example, the after-tax rate of return is $40 for the tax-exempt bond and $32.50 for the taxable bond. The amount of the federal subsidy rises with the interest rate. Congress has extended the authority to issue tax-exempt bonds to selected projects whose benefits are more private in nature, known as \"qualified private activity bonds.\" These bonds are categorized as governmental bonds and private activity bonds (PABs). Governmental bonds are used to finance government projects or secured with generally applicable taxes, with the most common type being general obligation bonds (GO) backed by the issuing entity's full faith and credit. Governmental bonds, like general obligation bonds, are backed by the full faith and credit of the issuing entity. Revenue bonds use specific government revenue streams to repay the bond. Tax-exempt bonds are often used to finance government-owned utilities. In 2009, $12.1 billion of tax-exempt debt was issued for government-owned electric power production facilities, with an interest rate spread of 69 basis points between taxable corporate bonds and tax-exempt bonds. The estimated annual federal subsidy for tax-exempt bonds for energy production in 2009 was $83.4 million. The use of governmental bonds for energy production, including renewables and traditional fossil fuels, raises concerns about the loss in tax revenue. Policy makers may need to evaluate the alignment of tax policy with energy policy, as tax-exempt private activity bonds are authorized by Congress to finance projects benefiting private entities. The private entity test is used to assess the status of a bond issue. Bonds are taxable if more than 10% of the proceeds are used for private business purposes and if payment on the principal or interest is secured by property used for private business or payments related to it. Tax-exempt private activity bonds must pass tests related to private business use and loan financing to qualify for tax-exempt financing. Bonds that meet these criteria can still be tax-exempt if identified as qualified private activity bonds in the tax code. The private loan financing test restricts the use of bond proceeds for loans to non-governmental persons. Qualified private activity bonds can be issued for various purposes. Qualified private activity bonds can be issued for energy efficiency improvements and privately operated local electric energy or gas furnishing facilities. These bonds do not commonly finance the construction of energy production facilities, as governmental bonds are typically used for such projects. Tax credit bonds provide bondholders with a federal tax credit determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, reducing net interest payments or attracting investors through limited discounts on bond sales. Tax credit bonds, such as Clean Renewable Energy Bonds (CREBs), provide a subsidy for investments in renewables and energy efficiency. These bonds reduce financing costs for renewable energy projects and allow tax-exempt entities to compete with projects claiming tax credits. CREBs were established under the Energy Policy Act of 2005 to incentivize public entities to invest in renewable energy. Eligible entities include governmental bodies, cooperatives, and public power utilities. Tax credits. Clean Renewable Energy Bonds (CREBs) were established under the Energy Policy Act of 2005 to incentivize investments in renewable energy. The Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006 increased the volume cap on CREBs to $1.2 billion and extended the expiration date for allocation through 2008. The federal government subsidized borrowing costs for CREB issuers by providing tax credits to bondholders, allowing them to borrow at little or no interest. The CREB issuer set credit rates based on market rates for AA-rated corporate bonds to avoid issuing bonds at a discount or paying interest. Municipalities with lower credit ratings had to offer discounts or pay supplemental interest. In the first CREB allocation, 78% of projects were approved, representing 31% of total authority requested. The IRS selection process uses a smallest-to-largest approach. The second round saw 79% of applications approved, allowing 45% of total CREB authority requested to be issued. The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act authorized $800 million in \"New CREBs.\" The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act (EESA; P.L. 110-343) authorized $800 million in \"New CREBs\" with a national limit of $2.4 billion allocated by the end of 2009. The IRS is currently not accepting applications for CREB allocations due to lack of funds. Allocations for government entities and cooperatives were based on smallest-to-largest methodology, while public power providers received allocations on a pro-rata basis. Each eligible project received a portion of the $800 million based on their total request relative to the total CREB volume. New CREBs differ from traditional CREBs in several ways. The tax credit rate for new CREBs is 70% of the rate determined by the Treasury for zero interest. Issuers may need to make supplemental interest payments due to the lower credit rate. The Treasury determines the tax credit rate for new CREBs based on \"single A\" or BBB bonds, reducing the amount of supplemental interest. Issuers can pay the entire principal at bond maturity, providing renewable energy projects with additional capital in the early years. P.L. 111-147 expanded direct support in the 111th Congress. In the 111th Congress, P.L. 111-147 expanded the direct issuer payment option for new CREBs, allowing investors to strip tax credits from principal payments. This change increased liquidity and attractiveness of CREBs as an investment despite a lower 70% credit rate. The Treasury approved 78% of original CREB applications and 43% of new CREB applications. The Hiring Incentives to Restore Employment Act in March 2010 allowed issuers to receive direct payments from the Treasury instead of providing tax credits to bondholders. In the 111th Congress, P.L. 111-147 expanded the direct issuer payment option for new CREBs, increasing liquidity and attractiveness as an investment. However, CREB funding authority is currently unavailable, limiting options for public entities to secure low-cost financing for renewable investments. Tax credits and incentives are available for taxable entities, but not for non-taxable entities, putting them at a financing disadvantage. Some non-taxable entities partner with taxable entities to access tax incentives, but not all can establish such partnerships. CREB financing has been used for 1,727 renewable energy projects totaling $3.4 billion. Uncertainty around additional CREB authority may limit renewable energy investment. Majority of projects financed are solar installations, followed by wind installations. Solar projects are smaller in total dollars spent. In 2007, solar projects accounted for 45% of CREB-financed projects but received only 21% of allocated dollars due to their smaller size and lower cost. In 2009, solar projects made up 88% of financed projects but received 38% of CREB dollars. Hydropower projects, on the other hand, represented 3% of financed projects but received 24% of allocated dollars in 2009. Qualified energy conservation bonds (QECBs) can be issued for energy-efficiency projects in public buildings by state, local, or tribal governments. Eligible projects for Qualified Energy Conservation Bonds (QECBs) include capital expenditures on public buildings to increase energy efficiency, research projects, mass commuting projects, demonstration projects, and public education campaigns. QECBs were authorized under the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, with an issuance of $3.2 billion. The tax credit rate for QECBs is 70% of the market interest rate, allowing for discounted issuance to investors. Qualified Energy Conservation Bonds (QECBs) allow issuers to make limited interest payments to bondholders, with the option to claim the tax credit directly. Unlike CREBs, QECBs are allocated based on each state's population. Build America Bonds (BABs) were created in 2009 to reduce borrowing costs for governmental issuers without specific targeting or volume limitations. Build America Bonds (BABs) can be issued for any purpose eligible for traditional tax-exempt bond financing, excluding private activity bonds like energy production. The BAB credit amount is 35% of the interest rate agreed upon by the issuer and investor. Issuers can choose to receive a direct payment from the Treasury or allow the investor to claim the credit. All BABs issued to date have opted for the direct payment option. BABs have been well received by issuers and investors, with almost $164.1 billion in BABs offered through November of 2010. The U.S. Treasury Department estimated that BABs had saved municipal issuers around $12 billion in interest costs. If the market clearing marginal tax rate rises, traditional tax-exempt bonds may become more attractive to issuers and investors compared to BABs. Increases in statutory marginal tax rates for higher income investors could further reduce the attractiveness of BABs. Since their introduction in 2009, almost $164.1 billion in BABs have been offered for various projects like public improvement, education, and transportation. Only a small percentage has been used for electric and public power projects, with minimal funding for pollution control facilities. BABs also finance solid waste management, water facilities, and gas facilities. Data on renewable energy projects funded by BABs is not available. The Joint Committee on Taxation reports the annual federal revenue loss on tax-exempt bonds, CREBs, QECBS, and BABs. The Joint Committee on Taxation reports annual federal revenue losses on tax-exempt bonds, including CREBs, QECBs, and BABs. The estimates are based on the outstanding stock of bonds, with a substantial amount of forgone tax revenue from interest income exclusion on public-purpose tax-exempt bonds. Tax credits from CREBs are expected to reduce federal tax collections by $500 million over FY2009-FY2013, while QECBs are expected to reduce revenues by approximately $100 million during the same period. No separate estimate is provided for BABs used in energy production. The reduction in federal revenues from QECBs is expected to be around $100 million, while excluding interest payments from private activity bonds for energy production facilities could reduce tax collections by approximately $500 million. BABs, including those for electric power projects, are estimated to result in revenue losses of $12.5 billion between 2009 and 2013. Policymakers can incentivize investment in renewables by providing tax-favored financing. The federal subsidy for bonds involves assessing net benefits for issuers, the government, and investors. Issuers and policymakers aim for issuers to receive most of the subsidy. BABs support state and local governments, while CREBs promote clean energy projects. Tax-exempt bonds were initially tax-exempt for constitutional reasons, not incentives, but still provide subsidies. Taxable and nontaxable investors have different preferences for bond investments based on after-tax rate of return. Tax-exempt bonds are favored by taxable investors only if the additional yield from alternative taxable investments does not fully compensate for taxable interest payments. Multiple marginal tax rates create opportunities for windfall gains for tax-exempt bond investors. Tax-exempt bonds are not advantageous for nontaxable investors, who prefer taxable bonds like BABs and CREBs. An example is the Municipal Electric Authority of Georgia offering Build America Bonds with a 6.655% interest rate, compared to tax-exempt bonds at 4.34%. MEAG chose BAB structure for financing nuclear power expansion due to its 35% credit rate. CREBs have a 70% credit rate but were not eligible for the project. Table 4 compares CREBs, BABs, and TEBs for different investors in varying tax brackets. The issuer chose Build America Bonds (BABs) for financing nuclear power expansion due to their 35% credit rate. BABs would generate a $23.6 million payment to the issuer. Tax-exempt bonds, on the other hand, do not provide a direct payment to the issuer. The after-federal-payment interest cost for issuers would be 4.326% for BABs and 4.34% for tax-exempt bonds. The CREB option, with a 70% credit rate, would generate the largest incentive for the issuer, but it was not available for nuclear power projects. The issuer chose Build America Bonds (BABs) for financing nuclear power expansion due to their 35% credit rate, generating a $23.6 million payment. Tax-exempt bonds do not provide a direct payment. The after-federal-payment interest cost for BABs is 4.326% and 4.34% for tax-exempt bonds. The CREB option with a 70% credit rate would provide the largest incentive for the issuer, but it was not available for nuclear power projects. The investor's after-tax return for the three bonds varies based on different tax brackets, with TEB having the highest rate of return for the 35% bracket investor. Tax credit bonds are a better investment for nontaxable and 28% bracket investors. The implicit tax rate equating the rate of return across the bonds is 34.79%. An economic evaluation of tax-exempt bonds raises concerns about efficiency and equity. Evidence suggests that tax-exempt bonds may be inefficient as a subsidization mechanism, with the implicit tax rate below the top marginal tax rate. Most investors in tax-exempt debt face a marginal tax rate higher than the implied tax rate from the difference in returns on tax-exempt and taxable debt. Tax-exempt bonds may be inefficient for delivering federal subsidy if investors' marginal tax rates exceed the implicit tax rate. There are equity-related concerns as the tax benefits from these bonds are regressive, with the value increasing as tax brackets rise. Eliminating tax-exemptions for state and local bonds is suggested by empirical evidence. Eliminating tax-exemptions for state and local debt would primarily affect high-income taxpayers. Tax credit bonds offer a more efficient subsidy compared to tax-exempt debt, providing equal value to borrowers while reducing federal revenue loss. Tax-credit bonds eliminate debt where federal revenue loss exceeds borrower subsidies. They offer a more equitable subsidy than tax exemptions, as investors receive a dollar-for-dollar tax credit. Higher income taxpayers benefit less from tax-credit bonds due to taxable credits. Federal government supports renewable energy investments through various policy instruments, including direct spending programs and R&D initiatives. The Federal government supports investment through various policy instruments, including Federal loan guarantees and direct loan programs. These programs aim to reduce borrowing costs for projects, such as those in the energy sector with new technologies. ARRA allocated funds to the DOE for loan guarantee programs, initially set at $6 billion but later reduced to $2.5 billion. The DOE's loan guarantee program, authorized under Section 1703 of EPACT05, initially had $6 billion allocated but was later reduced to $2.5 billion. $2 billion was diverted to the \"cash for clunkers\" program in August 2009, and $1.5 billion was rescinded in August 2010 to offset spending in the FAA Air Transportation Modernization and Safety Improvement Act. Additionally, ARRA added Section 1705, allowing loan guarantees for renewable and electric transmission projects. The loan guarantee program under Section 1705 of EPACT05 received its first appropriation in ARRA to cover credit subsidies for renewable and electric transmission projects. The Federal government also provides direct loans for advanced technologies, such as the Advanced Technology Vehicle Manufacturing Program (ATVM) established by EISA. The FY2009 Continuing Resolution allocated $7.5 billion for the ATVM loan program. Matching grant programs like the Smart Grid Investment Matching Grant Program offer federal funds to match non-federal investments. The Smart Grid Investment Matching Grant Program provided up to 50% in matching federal grants for investments in smart grid technologies. Winners were announced in October 2009. On-bill financing programs help overcome barriers to energy efficiency investments by tying costs to utility bills. The Federal government supported on-bill financing programs under ARRA with $3.2 billion provided to the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Block Grant. Under ARRA, $3.2 billion was allocated to the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Block Grant (EECBG) program and $3.1 billion to the State Energy Program (SEP). Some of these funds were used to promote on-bill financing programs, including property assessed clean energy (PACE) financing programs. PACE programs were established by state and local governments to provide loans for energy-efficiency improvements, with the issuing entity floating bonds to provide initial capital. Loans are added to property tax bills through special assessments and paid off over time, modeled after land-secured municipal finance projects. The PACE model, based on land-secured municipal finance projects, involves special assessments on property tax bills to repay loans for energy-efficient improvements. These assessments are senior liens, reducing interest rates for investors and homeowners. However, objections to the senior lien status have halted PACE programs, with FHFA tightening lending standards in PACE districts in 2010. FHFA objected to the senior lien status of PACE loans due to safety and soundness concerns, suggesting subordination of PACE assessments. This could increase investor risks and borrowing costs for energy efficiency improvements. Other policy options for federally supported renewable energy financing are also discussed, including the lack of financing options for tax-exempt entities like CREB and the expiration of BABs by December 31, 2010. Congress is exploring policies to attract private capital to the renewable energy sector, including the proposal for a \"Green Bank\" to provide low-cost financing for renewable energy projects through the issuance of \"green bonds\" by the U.S. Treasury. The idea is that themed bonds attract investors interested in achieving specific societal objectives. The World Bank has issued green bonds to support projects with positive impacts. Tax favored financing, such as green bonds, is being used to support projects with a positive impact on climate change. Congress is considering options like a renewable portfolio standard to drive investment in renewables and energy efficiency. Tax-subsidized financing is another way to promote investment in the renewable sector and address economic efficiency concerns. Tax favored financing aims to reduce borrowing costs for renewable energy projects, attracting investors but potentially rewarding bond issuers at taxpayer expense. Concerns arise over reduced federal revenues and technology-specific subsidies in subsidized financing options. Technology neutrality should be a priority in well-designed tax favored financing. Tax favored financing for renewable energy projects aims to reduce borrowing costs and attract investors. However, there is a risk of \"picking winners\" by subsidizing specific technologies, potentially neglecting other promising alternatives. California received the largest CREB allocation of $822 million in 2007 and 2009, with some states not receiving any allocations. The allocation of CREB financing is not based on population, leading to a more efficient distribution in states better suited for CREB-eligible projects. Alaska and Washington received large per-capita CREB allocations, with Alaska receiving the highest at $202 and Washington at $77. California received the largest overall allocation of $822 million in 2007 and 2009."
