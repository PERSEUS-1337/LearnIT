This led to a temporary standstill in agricultural traffic on the Mississippi River, causing a shift in transport demand to rail and truck systems. This resulted in higher transport prices and congestion within the Mississippi River grain transportation system. Grain elevators reported disruptions in train service as rail cars were diverted to handle grain previously destined for barges. The aftermath of Hurricane Katrina led to disruptions in grain transportation on the Mississippi River, causing a shift to rail and truck systems due to damaged infrastructure. This resulted in higher transport prices and congestion, with rail cars being diverted to handle grain originally meant for barges. Rising fuel costs further impacted farmers' transportation options, affecting farm-gate prices and rural incomes. The shortage of rail cars and storage space is expected to persist into 2006. After Hurricane Katrina, disruptions in grain transportation on the Mississippi River led to a shift to rail and truck systems. The news media reported drops in commodity prices in interior producing regions dependent on the river. Hurricane Rita approached the Gulf coast, causing authorities to shut down transport services. Fortunately, Rita dissipated before landfall, allowing for the resumption of Mississippi River-based agricultural transportation. Grain traffic flows are still below last year's pace, with Gulf vessel loading activity significantly reduced. Agricultural producers are concerned about the slow resumption of barge traffic on the Mississippi River, repair of marketing infrastructure, and rising energy prices post-hurricane damage. USDA is taking steps to alleviate grain transport congestion. New Orleans is a major port with various transportation options. Orleans and Gulf ports serve as a crucial link between inland waterways and international markets, handling a significant amount of U.S. corn, soybean, wheat, and rice exports. The Port of New Orleans alone manages 2 billion bushels of grain annually, with a large portion of corn and soybean exports passing through Louisiana ports. The Port of New Orleans is a major destination for international containers, rubber, steel, plywood, and coffee. It is also a top port for imported natural rubber and the nation's premier coffee-handling port. New Orleans houses modern bulk processing operations like Dupuy Storage and Forwarding Corp. and Silocaf of New Orleans, Inc. When Hurricane Katrina hit in 2005, it disrupted agricultural trade through the Mississippi River System centered on New Orleans and surrounding Gulf ports. Port facilities were halted due to flooding and power outages, impacting the ability to export surplus agricultural production. Other Gulf ports like Gulfport, Biloxi, Pascagoula, Mobile, Pensacola, and Panama City were also affected. After Hurricane Katrina in 2005, ports in Alabama, Florida, and Mississippi were shut down due to damage. Shipping activity was redirected to western Gulf ports to resume trade. Most export facilities were not structurally damaged, but restoring power and clearing channels were challenges. The main concerns for the Port of New Orleans were reopening the river channel and resuming bulk grain operations. Within two weeks, both were back in operation. Hurricane Katrina temporarily closed transportation and shipping activities between the Gulf of Mexico and the Mississippi River, damaging 400 barges. Only one of the ten major grain elevators in New Orleans sustained substantial damage. The U.S. Coast Guard reopened the Mississippi River to tug and barge navigation on August 31, 2005. The U.S. Coast Guard reported that 70% of navigation aids along the Mississippi River were damaged or missing after Hurricane Katrina. The river channel had to be surveyed for possible obstructions. The Port of New Orleans announced the river was open to ships with a draft of 35 feet during daylight hours. The port terminals survived the hurricane in relatively good shape. The Port of New Orleans terminals survived Hurricane Katrina in good shape, with some damage. Commercial vessels were not allowed back until power and manpower were restored. The U.S. Dept. of Transportation provided ships to house port workers. Secretary of Agriculture mentioned existing infrastructure for port activities on the Mississippi River. The Port of New Orleans has export elevators with a storage capacity of 526 million bushels and a loading capability of 970,000 bushels per hour. The U.S. Coast Guard shifted focus to damage assessment and repair of navigation infrastructure after Hurricane Katrina. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers reported all ports were fully open to traffic by September 22, 2005. On September 22, 2005, most major ports along the Texas and Louisiana Gulf coast closed in preparation for Hurricane Rita. The hurricane made landfall as a category 3 near the Texas-Louisiana border, causing minimal damage to export grain elevators. Operations resumed as power was restored and personnel returned after evacuation. By September 27, the Myrtle Grove grain elevator in New Orleans was fully restored, and by September 29, all restrictions on the Lower Mississippi River were lifted by the USACE. On September 29, 3005, the USACE lifted all restrictions on the Lower Mississippi River through the Southwest Passage, allowing both day and nighttime traffic. Additionally, major Texas Gulf ports were open to vessels with restricted depths of 40 to 45 feet, with some restrictions on the Calcasieu River to Lake Charles. Barge transportation is highlighted as the lowest-cost transport mode. Barge transportation is the lowest-cost mode for moving bulk commodities long distances, providing significant cost savings to the economy. Economists agree that it helps keep rates in check for rail and truck transportation. Low internal transport costs have also helped U.S. products compete in international markets. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers notes that barge capacity increases with channel depth, limiting Panamax vessels to 60,000 metric tons due to draft requirements. Grain moves through a complex network of storage, trucks, railroads, barges, and elevators, with price changes affecting transport modes. Events like hurricanes can disrupt barge traffic, leading to higher freight rates for corn and soybeans. Higher barge freight rates for corn and soybeans due to supply exceeding demand may lead to a shift in commodities to alternate uses, transport modes, or trade routes. Hurricane damage to barge transportation, such as during Hurricane Katrina, can further disrupt the transportation network, raising costs for moving grain. The aftermath of Hurricane Katrina caused significant damage to the transportation network in the New Orleans area, leading to the displacement of barges and vessels. The primary issue for barge-based agricultural transportation on the Mississippi River system is the challenge of synchronizing the entire transportation system, including trains, trucks, barges, ports, and ocean-going boats. As of September 30, 2005, the transportation network remained out of sync, with waterways and rail lines congested and backed up. Approximately 140 barges with hurricane-damaged corn were left in the region, requiring off-loading. The aftermath of Hurricane Katrina caused significant damage to the transportation network in the New Orleans area, leading to the displacement of barges and vessels. Approximately 140 barges with hurricane-damaged corn were left in the region, needing off-loading. The poor condition of the cargo led to a slowdown in barge traffic on the Mississippi River, causing a sharp decline in grain elevator bid prices for corn and soybeans in interior grain markets. Many grain elevators were near maximum storage capacity and had to reduce bid prices to avoid buying grain they couldn't store. The approaching harvest has led producers to sell last year's remaining supplies to make space for new crop harvests. USDA officials are concerned about a price decline due to delays in barge traffic, which could persist for at least three months. Elevator bids are expected to strengthen when barge traffic returns to normal levels. During harvest time, surplus agricultural production is moved through marketing channels due to abundant supplies exceeding storage capacity. Inland waterways like the Upper Mississippi River and St. Lawrence Seaway close in winter, increasing the urgency to export before freezing conditions. This influx of surplus production at harvest time often lowers commodity prices, providing buying opportunities for foreign markets. The region's agriculture is dominated by Louisiana's sugar cane crop, with significant contributions from poultry in Alabama and Mississippi, rice in Louisiana, and cotton in Mississippi. Broilers and eggs are major players in Alabama's agricultural sector. USDA has taken steps to address weak commodity prices and grain transport congestion. In 2003, broilers and eggs were significant in Alabama's agricultural sector, accounting for over 62% of the state's output value. Broilers represented 42% of Mississippi's agricultural economy. Hurricane Katrina caused $882 million in losses in the Southeast, with aquaculture, sugarcane, and cotton being the most affected crops. Timber losses in Gulf states were not included in this estimate. Hurricane Katrina caused significant losses in the Southeast, including damage to sugarcane crops in Louisiana. The storm flattened the crop, but analysts believe much of it can still be harvested. USDA estimates a 9% decrease in Louisiana's sugarcane production, resulting in a processed value loss. Other agricultural products were also affected by electricity shortages, fuel shortages, and infrastructure damage, disrupting the flow of goods to markets. Hurricane Katrina caused damage to Louisiana sugar refineries, leading to a $50 million loss in processed value. USDA increased sugar supplies to address the tight market. Cotton production in Mississippi and Alabama decreased by 2.4% and 4.3% respectively, with total losses estimated at $40 million. Minor rice losses were also reported. The impact of Hurricane Katrina on the agriculture industry included quality losses in rice, minor losses in corn and soybeans, and production and processing losses in the dairy industry. Estimated regional losses were $14 million for corn and $17 million for soybeans. The dairy industry was affected by power outages and hurricane-strength winds, with 60,000 dairy cows in affected counties. The dairy industry in the region was impacted by power outages, damaged roads, and loss of refrigeration and retail markets. Alabama, Louisiana, and Mississippi account for less than 1% of U.S. milk production, limiting market effects. USDA also reported losses in cattle and broiler production. Poultry is significant in the region, with Mississippi experiencing concentrated broiler losses. Approximately 6 million chickens were killed in the region. According to USDA, Hurricane Katrina caused significant damage to poultry production in Mississippi and Alabama, with 6 million chickens killed and $15 million in broiler losses. Analysts predict a short-term increase in broiler prices, but market effects are expected to be minimized by the end of the year. The Gulf Coast states, known for forestry and wood products, also suffered losses, with 1.3 million acres of forest estimated to be affected. The Mississippi Forestry Commission estimated that 1.3 million acres of forest land in the state were damaged, with commercial timber valued at $1.3 billion. Urban tree damage in Mississippi was estimated at $1.1 billion. The USDA Forest Service estimated 19 billion board feet of timber damaged on over 5 million acres in Mississippi, Alabama, and Louisiana. The dead and damaged trees can become hazardous fuels for wildfires and a haven for forest insects and diseases. Forestry assistance programs, like the Emergency Reforestation Assistance program, exist to help landowners recover forest lands. The Emergency Reforestation Assistance program, established after Hurricane Hugo in 1989, has not been funded since FY1993 due to Hurricanes Andrew and Iniki. Other forestry assistance programs are available to aid landowners and states with forest activities and protection. The impact of hurricanes on wood products is uncertain, with a surge in demand for plywood for temporary repairs. Rebuilding post-hurricane will increase the demand for wood products, but the long-term effects are unclear. Dead and damaged trees may boost wood product supplies. The impact of hurricanes on wood products is uncertain, with a surge in demand for plywood for temporary repairs. Dead and damaged trees may boost wood product supplies, but salvage operations are hindered by fragmented ownership of forest land and rising fuel costs. The net effect on wood product prices is indeterminate. Energy prices rose sharply after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, with uncertainty surrounding the longevity of the price rises and implications for U.S. agriculture. The surge in energy prices post-Hurricanes Katrina and Rita could significantly impact U.S. agriculture, with fuel costs steadily rising over the past few years. This increase in energy prices may alter farm income outlook and affect rural economies. Natural gas prices surged post-Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, reaching $12.70 per mcf in August 2005 before settling around $11 per mcf in September. Natural gas prices spiked to over $14 per mcf ahead of Hurricane Rita but dropped after the storm made landfall. Prices at Louisiana trading locations decreased by $1.35 per MMBtu, with an average price of $13.45 per mcf on September 28, 2005. The impact of these price fluctuations on U.S. agriculture depends on their long-term stability. The relative importance of energy costs in agriculture varies greatly by activity and region. Mechanized field work, marketing, and management activities rely on petroleum fuels. Dairy and poultry production, needing constant energy for refrigeration, are vulnerable to supply disruptions, as seen in hurricane-affected areas. Higher diesel and gasoline prices will increase costs in the short term. Higher diesel fuel and gasoline prices due to Katrina's impact on the region will raise harvesting and post-harvest treatment costs for crops. This will also increase marketing expenses, making rail and truck transport more costly than barge transport. The higher costs will widen the farm-to-market basis, leading to lower prices received at the farm gate and impacting farm income. Sustained high energy prices could result in regional shifts in agricultural activities as early as 2006, particularly affecting nitrogenous fertilizer production due to high natural gas prices. The high natural gas prices have led to a substantial reduction in U.S. nitrogen fertilizer production capacity, with a 25% decline since 1999. This has also caused nitrogen fertilizer prices to increase significantly. The post-Katrina spike in natural gas prices has raised concerns about the future of the U.S. nitrogen fertilizer industry and the potential supply and price of nitrogen fertilizer for crops in 2006. Producers are monitoring fuel and fertilizer prices for crops in 2006, considering shifting away from energy-dependent crops like corn. A rise in energy prices could impact agriculture profitability. USDA is taking steps to alleviate grain transport congestion and marketing grain at distress-level prices. USDA's Commodity Credit Corporation is implementing changes to allow producers to obtain loans for on-farm storage of grain to support local cash prices above distressed levels caused by barge traffic slowdown on the Mississippi River. Secretary of Agriculture, Mike Johanns, announced steps to alleviate grain transport congestion, including incentives for immediate movement of damaged corn and alternative grain storage. USDA provided incentives for alternative grain storage and shipping patterns to alleviate congestion caused by barge traffic slowdown on the Mississippi River. Assistance was offered for storing corn and wheat in alternative facilities, with options for producers with farm-stored commodities under loan to buy back grain at posted prices to avoid forfeiting to USDA. The USDA is offering programs to help crop producers recover from natural disasters, including federal crop insurance, NAP payments, and emergency disaster loans. Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana crop producers purchased over $1 billion in crop insurance coverage in 2005, with high participation rates in the program. However, much of the coverage is at the catastrophic level. In the federal crop insurance program, most coverage is at the catastrophic level, providing indemnity payments for losses exceeding 50% of normal production. Around 90-95% of cotton acreage in the Gulf states is enrolled, but in Louisiana and Mississippi, only half is at the catastrophic level. USDA offers NAP payments for non-insurable crops and low-interest emergency disaster loans for eligible producers in declared disaster areas. Emergency Conservation Program (EM) loans are available for family-sized farmers who have suffered a minimum crop loss of 30% and cannot qualify for a commercial loan. These funds can be used to help farmers, ranchers, and aquaculture producers recover from production or physical losses. Eligible applicants can borrow up to 100% of actual losses, not exceeding $500,000, at a below-market interest rate. In September 2005, USDA allocated $20 million in EM funds to states like Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Tennessee for debris cleanup and restoration projects. Eligible participants can also receive cost-share assistance. Since 1988, Congress has provided emergency aid for farm disaster programs through supplemental appropriations bills. Major ad-hoc programs include direct disaster payments, livestock assistance, tree assistance, and emergency conservation assistance. The FY2005 Military Construction Appropriations Act allocated $3.5 billion for crop, livestock, and tree losses due to drought in the West and hurricanes in the Southeast. Prior to Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, the Midwest experienced significant crop losses due to a prolonged drought in 2005. The combination of the Midwest drought and losses from the hurricanes is expected to prompt Congress to consider emergency crop and livestock assistance for 2005 production losses. Several bills have been introduced in the 109th Congress to provide supplemental agricultural assistance, including disaster payments and livestock assistance for regions meeting loss requirements. Several bills have been introduced in the 109th Congress to provide agricultural assistance for regions meeting loss requirements, including disaster payments and livestock assistance. Congressional leadership has not yet determined the specifics of any agricultural disaster assistance package, but it is likely to be included in a third supplemental appropriations bill for Hurricane Katrina recovery. Other possibilities include attaching agricultural assistance to the pending FY2006 agriculture appropriations bill or having the agriculture committees report on it. The agriculture committees may report emergency agricultural legislation to the floor for consideration."
