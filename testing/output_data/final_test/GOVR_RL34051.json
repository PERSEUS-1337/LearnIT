    "content": "In 2007, the Bush Administration requested $310 million in the FY2008 defense budget for a ground-based midcourse defense system in Europe, including 10 interceptor missiles in Poland and radar installations in the Czech Republic. The deployment was scheduled to be completed by 2013 at a cost of $4 billion, facing opposition in Europe and Russia. Agreements were signed with Poland and Czech Republic in 2008. The Obama Administration announced the cancellation of the Bush Administration's proposed European 3rd site in 2009. Instead, they planned to develop and deploy a regional BMD capability called the Phased Adaptive Approach (PAA) to defend against short- and medium-range Iranian ballistic missiles. Defense Secretary Gates argued that this new capability would be more responsive and adaptable, expanding over the next decade to cover all of Europe. The Phased Adaptive Approach (PAA) is a regional BMD capability developed by the Obama Administration to defend against short- and medium-range Iranian ballistic missiles. It is planned to expand over the next decade in four phases, covering all of Europe. Phase 1 (2011 timeframe) involves using existing BMD systems, while Phase 2 (2015 timeframe) includes deploying enhanced capabilities. Phase 3 (2018 timeframe) aims to improve area coverage in Europe against medium- and intermediate-range threats. The Obama Administration's Phased Adaptive Approach (PAA) aims to defend against Iranian ballistic missile threats in Europe. The plan includes deploying more capable Aegis BMD interceptors in sea- and land-based configurations. Phase 4 (2020 timeframe) involves countering potential Iranian ICBM threats with advanced Aegis BMD capabilities. This decision was made after consultations with U.S. allies in 2009 to address concerns over Iranian missile proliferation more effectively than the previous Bush-proposed European site. The Obama Administration's decision to cancel agreements with Poland and the Czech Republic in 2009 was met with mixed reactions. Critics argued it was to appease Russia, while European leaders praised the policy reversal. NATO Secretary General supported the decision, suggesting a joint NATO-U.S.-Russia missile defense system. The Obama Administration's decision to cancel missile defense agreements with Poland and the Czech Republic in 2009 was met with mixed reactions. Polish and Czech leaders had varying responses, with some expressing concerns of \"betrayal.\" Despite the shift, Poland's Prime Minister stated that it would not affect their security and that the U.S. would still provide a Patriot defense battery as promised. The possibility of basing missile defense facilities in the Czech Republic remained open. The Obama Administration canceled missile defense agreements with Poland and the Czech Republic in 2009. The Polish government expressed willingness to host more advanced missile defenses, while Czech President Vaclav Klaus believed the decision did not signal a cooling of relations. Some ruling party senators were concerned about the shift in U.S. foreign policy, and Czech Foreign Minister Jan Kohout called for concrete projects to replace the scrapped missile plan. The Obama Administration canceled missile defense agreements with Poland and the Czech Republic in 2009, leading to concerns about a shift in U.S. foreign policy. Despite initial support, Czech and Polish officials faced challenges in finalizing agreements for hosting missile defense facilities. President Dmitry Medvedev of Russia initially praised the decision but later raised objections to the Obama Administration's actions. The Obama Administration canceled missile defense agreements with Poland and the Czech Republic in 2009, leading to concerns about a shift in U.S. foreign policy. Moscow objected to the PAA as a bargaining chip in arms treaty negotiations with the United States. The Bush Administration had proposed the European BMD initiative to defend against long-range ballistic missile threats from Iran. The Obama Administration canceled the European GMD element program in 2009, which had funding from the FY2009 defense budget. The proposed silo-based GMD capability in Europe raised international security and foreign policy questions, especially regarding U.S.-European-Russian relations. Congress eliminated funding for the European site pending international agreements with Poland and the Czech Republic. Congress largely supported the Administration's request for FY2009, but restricted funding for site construction until after the Polish and Czech Parliaments ratified the agreements. Funding for deployment of ground-based interceptor missiles was withheld until certification of their effectiveness by the Secretary of Defense. Senator Obama and Michele Flournoy expressed support for reviewing plans for missile defense in Europe during the 2008 presidential campaign and nomination hearings. The plans for missile defense in Europe should be reviewed as part of the QDR and in the broader security context of Europe, including relations with Russia. Cooperation between Washington and Moscow on missile defense is in the interest of the United States. William Lynn supports making the MDA's processes more open and similar to military services, with any exceptions rare and fully justified. Close consultations between the Administration and Congress are necessary for final decisions. Representative Ellen Tauscher predicted changes in missile defense under the new administration. The Obama Administration aimed to support missile defense in a cost-effective manner without diverting resources from other national security priorities. Defense Secretary Robert Gates announced recommendations for the FY2010 defense budget, with little detail on the European 3rd site. Gen. James Cartwright mentioned sufficient funds for BMD programs in 2009. The Obama Administration conducted a major BMD Review and the Quadrennial Defense Review in summer 2009. After extensive consultations with U.S. allies, the proposed European 3rd site was cancelled, and a new European BMD initiative was announced based on expanding current capabilities. Defense Secretary Gates recommended addressing the major strategic threats posed by North Korea and Iran, citing North Korea's nuclear testing and missile programs, as well as Iran's development of ballistic missiles and nuclear weapons. The Bush Administration viewed both countries as unpredictable and dangerous. The Bush Administration considered North Korea and Iran as unpredictable and dangerous, with concerns about their nuclear and missile capabilities. Secretary of State Rice reaffirmed plans for a European missile defense system despite these threats. Undersecretary of State John Rood emphasized the ongoing missile threat from Iran, highlighting the need for missile defense against various types of payloads. U.S. intelligence assessments suggested Iran could test an ICBM by 2015. Many in Congress and the international security community believe it is prudent to deploy a long-range missile defense system in Europe to defend against potential Iranian ballistic missile threats. Despite limited evidence of an Iranian ICBM program, concerns persist about Iran's missile capabilities and the need for defense measures. Iran continues to test ballistic missiles capable of reaching NATO's Southern Flank. Iran's successful test of a short-range ballistic missile using solid rocket motors indicates interest in longer range missiles. The Obama Administration cited these developments as reasons to address Iranian threats with current BMD capabilities. Some Europeans question the need for a European 3rd site for defense against Iran. In December 2008, the European Council approved a study on ballistic missile proliferation trends. MDA Director Gen. O'Reilly testified in 2009 that MDA's threat projections were off by a factor of 10-20. Secretary Gates and the Obama Administration noted Iran's shift towards short- and medium-range missiles, leading to reconsideration of deploying long-range interceptors in central Europe. Iran's focus on short-range missiles and lack of progress on long-range ones influenced this decision. The U.S. Department of Defense deployed long-range missile interceptors in Alaska and California in 2004 to address threats from North Korea. The integrated Ballistic Missile Defense System includes silo-based interceptors in Alaska and California, ground-based radars, space-based assets, and command and control networks. The need to expand ballistic missile defense capabilities into southern Europe was driven by the Iranian ballistic missile threat. The Bush Administration emphasized the importance of deploying a Ground-based Midcourse Defense (GMD) capability in Europe to defend against ballistic missiles from Iran. While there have been limited intercept flight tests of the deployed GMD system, confidence in its effectiveness has been expressed. However, further operational testing is deemed necessary by many observers. The Ground-based Midcourse Defense (GMD) program began flight tests in 2002, building on earlier long-range BMD programs with mixed results. Since then, there have been several GMD intercept flight tests with varying outcomes. Some argue for significant improvement in system capabilities based on test results, while others believe the tests are scripted for success. The GMD element of the Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) was deployed in Alaska and California in late 2004. The GMD element of the BMDS was deployed in late 2004 in Alaska and California. Two planned intercept flight tests in December 2004 and February 2005 were unsuccessful. However, in 2005, the interceptor successfully demonstrated a booster fly-out. In September 2006, a successful flight test exercise of the GMD element took place, where a target warhead was successfully intercepted. Additional intercept flight tests were scheduled for 2006 but were postponed. A successful intercept test was completed in September 2007 after a previous attempt was scrubbed in May 2007. The GMD element of the BMDS was successfully tested in September 2007. A test in December 2008 faced criticism for not deploying decoys, while a January 2010 test failed due to radar issues. Supporters believe in the system's effectiveness, but further successful testing is needed. The Bush proposal for the European element of the BMDS included deploying up to 10 Ground-based Interceptors in Poland, with differences from the GBIs in Alaska and California. The European GBIs would have a two-stage configuration, raising questions about their effectiveness compared to the three-stage system. The Bush Administration proposed deploying up to 10 Ground-based Interceptors in Poland to counter the Iranian ballistic missile threat to Europe. The Missile Defense Agency argued that other U.S. systems like Patriot, THAAD, or Aegis would not be adequate for this purpose. Deployment was scheduled to start in 2011, but the timeline was uncertain due to delays in ratifying the BMD agreement. The interceptors were to be deployed at Redzikowo near Slopsk in northern Poland. The Bush Administration proposed deploying up to 10 Ground-based Interceptors in Poland to counter the Iranian ballistic missile threat to Europe. The interceptors were to be deployed at Redzikowo near Slopsk in northern Poland. The area of supporting infrastructure would have been similar to a small military installation. A U.S. X-Band radar was planned to be refurbished and transported to a fixed site at a military training base in the Czech Republic. The X-Band radar with its large, ball-shaped radome is several stories in height. A second, transportable forward acquisition radar would have to be deployed closer to Iran, but the location was never publicly indicated by the Bush Administration. The Bush Administration proposed deploying Ground-based Interceptors in Poland to counter the Iranian ballistic missile threat to Europe. Discussions on the radar's location were undisclosed. The European GMD capability would have included a communications network and support infrastructure. The estimated cost for the European site was $4 billion. The FY2008 request for the proposed European missile defense system was a significant commitment, costing $712 million in FY2009. However, most of the funds remained unspent due to lack of ratification in Poland and the Czech Republic. The Obama Administration's FY2010 request was for $50.5 million, considering unspent appropriations from previous years. Alternative systems like sea-based Aegis SM-3 and land-based PAC-3 and THAAD were suggested as options. MDA Director General Henry Obering argued that the cost of defending Europe with the current Aegis fleet would be higher than the Bush Administration proposal. Assessments showed that 24/7 coverage increased costs, while contingency deployment reduced them. A report by the EastWest Institute criticized the effectiveness of the European 3rd site against Iranian ballistic missiles, sparking a technical debate on collaboration between Iranian and North Korean missile programs. The Bush Administration proposed establishing missile defense facilities in Poland and the Czech Republic in 2002. Formal negotiations began in 2007, agreements were made with both countries in 2008 and 2009, but the program was cancelled by the Obama Administration before ratification. The Obama Administration cancelled the missile defense program after agreements were made with Poland and the Czech Republic. In Poland, discussions focused on security guarantees in exchange for hosting American GMD facilities. Concerns were raised about Russia's response, leading to requests for Patriot missiles to shield against missile threats. Formal negotiations began in 2007 under the Law and Justice party. In early 2007, discussions in Poland under the Law and Justice party focused on integrating the missile defense system into NATO. The Civic Alliance opposition party raised concerns about command and control aspects and urged transparency. After snap elections in October 2007, a center-right coalition led by PO took power, with Donald Tusk as prime minister, signaling a shift in policy towards the United States. The new Polish government under Prime Minister Tusk was cautious about the missile defense proposal, stating that they would be open to negotiations if it clearly enhanced security. However, Defense Minister Klich suggested reevaluating the project's benefits and costs, while Foreign Minister Sikorski hinted at a possible shift in policy. Foreign Minister Radek Sikorski indicated that the new Polish government would discuss the missile defense project with Russia. Talks between Warsaw and Washington resumed in early 2008. U.S. Secretary of State Rice voiced support for strengthening Poland's air defenses during a visit by Sikorski to Washington, DC in February 2008. However, an accord on missile defense was not signed during Prime Minister Tusk's visit to the United States the following month. The main sticking point in negotiations was U.S. assistance for Poland's military modernization, particularly in PAC-3 air and missile defense. President Bush declared support for Poland's defense during Tusk's visit to Washington, DC in March 2008. During a visit to Washington, DC in March 2008, President Bush declared support for Poland's defense and discussed a modernization plan. However, no deal was struck, and Poland was cautious about linking the missile defense projects to avoid upsetting Russia. The Polish Ambassador suggested that the project would likely continue under Bush's successor. The MDA Director mentioned the possibility of stationing the radar in the Czech Republic even without an agreement with Poland. Some suggested that the radar in Poland could be useful in conjunction with other BMD systems like Aegis. Bush Administration officials discussed interceptor basing with Lithuania. After stalled negotiations, an agreement was signed in August, possibly influenced by Russia's actions in South Ossetia. In early August, U.S. Defense Secretary Gates commented on the increased incentive for Russia's neighbors to align with the U.S. following the events in Georgia. Poland received enhanced security guarantees from the U.S., including modernizing their armed forces with Patriot air and missile defenses. Despite majority disapproval among Poles, concerns over sovereignty and the establishment of a missile defense base in their country persisted. Most objections to the missile defense system in Poland were based on sovereignty concerns and fears of diminished national security. However, Russian military actions in Georgia and threats to place missiles in Kaliningrad increased support for the missile shield and Patriot missiles. The Polish legislature delayed ratifying the agreement, waiting to see how the U.S. election would impact the program. Prime Minister Tusk discussed missile defense with both U.S. presidential candidates. President Kaczynski's office criticized Prime Minister Tusk for postponing ratification of the missile defense system agreement until after elections. Despite the delay, U.S.-Polish negotiations on the project continued. President-elect Obama's phone call with President Kaczynski caused confusion over the future of the GMD plan. U.S. Ambassador Ashe mentioned the project would be on hold until the Obama Administration formulated its policies. Foreign Minister Sikorski estimated the chances of the project moving forward in a mid-November 2008 interview. Foreign Minister Sikorski expressed optimism about the continuation of the GMD project, citing budgetary pressure as a potential obstacle. He highlighted the importance of transatlantic cooperation and the security benefits for Poland. President Kaczynski and Sikorski hoped for the Obama Administration's support. Some Polish MPs were hesitant to approve a treaty due to uncertainty about US commitment. The US planned to transfer 96 Patriot missiles to Poland by the end of the year, regardless of the treaty status. There was debate over the installation and arming of the missiles, but Foreign Minister Sikorski later confirmed their deployment after discussions with Washington. After discussions with Washington, it was confirmed that the Patriots would be armed near the border with Kaliningrad, sparking protests by Russia. Poland announced participation in the Phased Adaptive Approach BMD program by hosting SM-3 BMD systems. The Czech defense minister offered the US the opportunity to deploy the missile defense system on Czech soil in 2002. The CSSD government was replaced by a coalition led by the ODS in 2006, which also supported GMD. In mid-2006, only the ODS was unambiguously backing the deployment of GMD in the Czech Republic. The United States requested official negotiations to start in January 2007, and the Czech government agreed to launch talks in March. In October 2007, U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates visited Prague to discuss the planned radar installation, proposing that Russia be allowed to station personnel at the radar site for transparency. President Bush emphasized the urgency of the missile defense project, while some analysts believed that involving Russia could complicate Czech approval. The Czech Republic agreed to propose reciprocal inspections of missile defense radar facilities to Russia, but Foreign Minister Schwarzenberg stated that Russian inspections would require approval. Czech Foreign Minister Schwarzenberg stated that Russia would need to consult with them before conducting any checks on Czech soil regarding the radar facility. Despite the U.S. intelligence community's conclusion on Iran's nuclear program, Prague remained committed to hosting the radar due to the potential threat. Opposition leader Paroubek suggested delaying negotiations due to public resistance, while Prime Minister Topolanek indicated progress in talks with the U.S. in early 2008. In 2008, Czech media reported an agreement between Prague and Washington over a U.S. radar base, with the signing postponed to July. The U.S. agreed to provide ballistic missile defense for the Czech Republic. Approval from parliament was uncertain, with the Green party's support hinging on NATO summit conclusions. The Green Party leadership called for opposition to the radar project, but some members planned to support it. Czech Deputy Foreign Minister expressed confidence in ratifying the treaty by early 2009. The Czechs later announced ratification would occur after the inauguration of the next U.S. President to assess their attitude. In mid-November, Miloslav Vlcek, chairman of the lower house of parliament, expressed doubts about ratifying the missile defense treaty until after Barack Obama's inauguration. The Czech Senate ratified the agreement, but approval in the chamber of deputies was uncertain. A scheduled vote on the treaty was postponed, awaiting the Obama Administration's decision. The missile defense issue was further complicated by a crisis and hopes were high for validation from the new U.S. government. The Czech political crisis in March 2009 led to the resignation of Prime Minister Mirek Topolanek, resulting in the installation of an interim government to complete the Czech EU presidency. Jan Fischer, head of the caretaker government, discussed the Czech decision on the U.S. radar with NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer. The Czech political crisis in March 2009 led to the resignation of Prime Minister Mirek Topolanek, resulting in the installation of an interim government. Jan Fischer, head of the caretaker government, discussed the Czech decision on the U.S. radar with NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer. The future of the missile defense agreement was uncertain due to opposition from the CSSD and strong public opposition among Czechs. In October 2009, the Czech Republic expressed readiness to participate in the new NATO-based missile defense system. Discussions on the Czech Republic's role are ongoing and awaiting resolution after the 2010 elections. The proposed missile bases would be part of a defensive system, not offensive, with non-explosive payloads launched only in response to actual attacks. Critics argue that Europe currently faces no significant threat from Iran or its allies. Some proponents in Poland and Czech Republic believe that joining the American missile defense system would strengthen bilateral relations with the United States. They argue that historical experience shows the U.S. as a reliable ally. Additionally, they see participation as a way to enhance their partnership with the U.S. and view the missile defense sites as prestigious symbols. Some in Poland and Czech Republic view the missile defense sites as prestigious symbols and a way to enhance their partnership with the U.S. Former Prime Minister Kaczynski highlighted Russia as a threat, while opponents argue that NATO already provides security guarantees. Polish skeptics believe their loyalty is shown through contributions to military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. Some Polish and Czech leaders supported the missile defense bases despite public opposition. Concerns were raised about the impact on national sovereignty and the potential loss of political support. There were debates on whether it was worth investing political capital in the project, with fears of becoming an international laughingstock if it was discontinued. Some believed that if the U.S. Congress did not fund the European arm of missile defense, the issue would be resolved for them. The Czech government argued that the proposed missile defense base would be under their jurisdiction, raising questions about command and control. Concerns were also raised about the brief window for interception and the potential for deadly debris if a nuclear-tipped missile was intercepted over Polish or Czech territory. Supporters argued that any debris would be burnt upon reentry, while skeptics doubted the effectiveness of interception over Eastern Europe. The proposed U.S. missile defense systems faced resistance in some European countries and beyond, with critics calling it a manifestation of American unilateralism. Supporters argue it would protect both Europe and the United States. Some European leaders criticized the lack of consultation by the Bush Administration with affected countries and Russia on its GMD plans. Former French President Chirac warned against creating new divisions in Europe. Critics accused the Bush Administration of disregarding consultations with European governments and Russia on the establishment of a European GMD base to counter Iranian missiles. Concerns were raised about the assumption that diplomatic efforts to curb Iran's nuclear ambitions would fail, and doubts were expressed about the technical feasibility and cost-effectiveness of the program. Additionally, there were speculations that the U.S. missile defense system was being built to enable a first strike capability. European leaders have differing opinions on the U.S. missile defense plan, with Luxembourg's Foreign Minister criticizing it as a waste of money while others, like Denmark and Britain's former prime ministers, support it for protecting Europe from rogue states. Some allies are open to the concept but lack the technological know-how. NATO has also been discussing strategic missile defenses, with a feasibility study completed in 2005 and leaders stating that long-range BMD is technically feasible in their 2006 summit. NATO leaders concluded that long-range Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) is technically feasible and called for further study on the political and military implications. There are differing opinions on whether the U.S. missile defense plan should proceed under NATO auspices or bilaterally with just two NATO partners. Some observers believe the Bush Administration chose not to work primarily through NATO due to the unlikely consensus agreement on the system. In mid-June 2007, alliance defense ministers agreed to study a complementary anti-missile capability to protect the southeastern part of alliance territory. The move was seen as an endorsement of the U.S. GMD plan by Bush Administration officials. Former NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer stated that the roadmap on missile defense was clear and agreed upon by all. The Bush Administration hoped for NATO's endorsement of missile defense at the 2008 summit meeting in Bucharest, Romania. The declaration affirmed that missile defense is part of a broader response and the proposed U.S. system would contribute substantially to alliance protection. It mentioned exploring ways to link U.S. assets with current NATO efforts and developing options for anti-missile defense by 2009. The document also supported NATO-Russia missile defense cooperation and readiness to link U.S., NATO, and Russian systems in the future. Alliance members expressed deep concern over proliferation risks. The members expressed deep concern over proliferation risks posed by Iran and North Korea's nuclear and ballistic missile programs, urging compliance with UN Security Council resolutions. The Bush Administration saw the Summit Declaration as endorsing its missile defense project, with Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice calling it a breakthrough. National Security Advisor Stephen Hadley stated the debate on rogue state ballistic missiles ended. Representative Ellen Tauscher welcomed NATO's recognition of the long-range interceptor site's security contribution and proposed cooperation with NATO on missile defense. In December 2008, NATO foreign ministers reiterated missile defense language from the Bucharest summit declaration and highlighted agreements with the Czech Republic and Poland. They called on Moscow to avoid confrontational statements and threats. The 2009 summit in Strasbourg reaffirmed missile defense conclusions but acknowledged more work needed. The Bucharest Summit discussed missile defense and recommended addressing threats in a prioritized manner. The Council in Permanent Session was tasked with studying architecture alternatives, including the Active Layered Theater Ballistic Missile Defense program. NATO foreign ministers in December 2009 supported the Obama Administration's missile defense plan and expressed willingness to cooperate with Russia on linking missile defense systems. The United States and NATO are working on enhancing missile defense capabilities, with hopes of a joint system with Russia by 2020. Some European leaders are skeptical of the need for an extensive missile defense system. The Bush Administration's proposed missile defense program in Europe strained U.S.-Russian relations, with Russia criticizing it as leading to an arms race. Russia criticized the proposed missile defense program in Europe, warning of an arms race and threatening to abrogate treaties. Some U.S. and European officials dismissed Russia's concerns, stating that the interceptors were meant for Iranian missiles, not as a deterrent against Russia. The Czech general staff noted that the missile defenses could not imperil Moscow's arsenal. Some Russians believed the planned GMD facilities in Eastern Europe were just the beginning of a more ambitious project. Russian officials argue that the U.S. missile defense system in Eastern Europe is actually meant to monitor Russian missile sites and naval operations. Some believe Russia's objections are to distract from its own actions and cooperation with Iran. Observers noted that Russia blustered about NATO expansion and offered to partner with the United States on missile defense during the G-8 meeting in Germany. Putin suggested using a Soviet-era radar facility in Azerbaijan to track hostile missiles from the Middle East. President Bush welcomed the proposal, and Putin also suggested placing GMD interceptors in U.S. NATO allies like Turkey or Iraq. Military and political representatives from the US and Russia discussed the proposal to place GMD interceptors in NATO allies like Turkey or Iraq, or on sea platforms. Some experts raised concerns about locating the radar in Azerbaijan due to its proximity to potential Iranian launch sites. Despite Putin's offer to share the Azeri radar, US Defense Secretary Gates stated it would be an additional capability to complement proposed GMD sites in Europe. MDA Director Obering confirmed the US was seriously considering the proposal for early missile detection. At a meeting in Kennebunkport, ME, Putin proposed coordinating missile defense through offices in Brussels and Moscow, using radar in south Russia, and expanding cooperation through the NATO-Russia council. President Bush responded positively but insisted on Eastern European sites. Despite ongoing discussions, Russian criticism of the program continued. In October 2007, during a visit to Moscow by Secretaries Gates and Rice, President Putin suggested the possibility of establishing an anti-missile defense system on the moon. He compared the U.S. placement of missile defense facilities in Europe to the Cuban missile crisis, which was disputed by U.S. officials. Russia rejected a U.S. proposal in November 2007, citing the need for joint threat assessments and Russian experts' presence at missile shield sites. In December, Russia's army chief warned that launching U.S. missile defense interceptors against Iran could provoke a counter launch of Russian ICBMs. Iranian missiles could lead to a Russian counterstrike against the United States. In February 2008, Putin warned that Russia would target ICBMs towards missile defense sites. President Bush and Putin agreed to increase transparency and explore confidence-building measures on missile defense. Russia opposes European bases but agreed to intensify dialogue on missile defense cooperation. Iran's ambassador warned that the US would gain nuclear supremacy if the defense system is installed. Following the U.S.-Poland agreement in August 2008, Russia strongly objected to the missile defense plan, warning that Poland could become a target for a nuclear attack. President Medvedev reiterated Russia's concerns and mentioned the possibility of a military response. Russia and Belarus discussed establishing a joint air defense system in response to the planned U.S. missile defense system. President Medvedev further addressed the issue the day after the U.S. presidential election. President Medvedev announced on November 5, 2008, that Russia would deploy Iskander missiles to Kaliningrad if the \"European Capability\" was built. Plans were later suspended due to the Obama Administration's stance. However, there were hints at the G-8 summit that the deployment was still an option. Vice President Biden mentioned developing missile defenses against Iran in consultation with NATO allies and Russia. The Obama Administration was open to talks with Tehran if it shelved its nuclear program and renounced terrorism. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton stated that any change in U.S. missile defense policy would depend on Iran's behavior. President Obama denied offering a quid pro quo to Russia regarding the European Capability in exchange for cooperation on Iran's nuclear program. In a joint statement, Presidents Obama and Medvedev acknowledged differences on U.S. missile defense in Europe but pledged to explore new cooperation possibilities. Russian Deputy Foreign Minister criticized U.S. missile defense work in NATO format and mentioned conditions for cooperation involving Russian radar installations. In early June 2009, a Russian official suggested that Moscow may not reduce its nuclear weapons arsenal unless the U.S. cancels plans for a missile defense site in Poland and the Czech Republic. The Russian government also mentioned the possibility of deploying Iskander missiles to Kaliningrad if the U.S. transfers Patriot missile batteries to Poland. At the July 2009 U.S.-Russia summit, both presidents agreed to continue discussions on cooperation in responding to ballistic missile proliferation challenges. Experts met to analyze ballistic missile challenges of the 21st century and prioritize political and diplomatic solutions. Russian Foreign Minister warned against unilateral missile defense actions by the Obama administration. President Medvedev praised the U.S. for a responsible approach to missile defense in Europe. Moscow seemed to backtrack on deploying Iskander missiles to Kaliningrad. U.S. ambassador denied discussions with Ukraine on missile defense deployment. The United States denied discussing missile defense deployment with Ukraine, despite rumors. Critics questioned the Obama Administration's decision to cancel the BMD plan, fearing it could be seen as a concession to Russia. Supporters argued that Russia may offer concessions in the future. However, Russia later criticized the new U.S. missile defense plan against Iran, citing concerns about its impact on Russian nuclear forces. In late December 2009, Prime Minister Putin linked discussions on missile defense to the renegotiation of START, stating that Moscow would need to strengthen its offensive nuclear weapons to maintain a strategic balance with the planned U.S. missile defense system. The U.S. rejected any constraints on its ballistic missile defenses, while Russia called for a fresh start in analyzing missile origins and types with the U.S. and NATO in January 2010. Putin's intervention was unlikely to impact disarmament talks. In January 2010, the United States and Poland announced the rotation of U.S. Patriot missiles to Poland near the border with Kaliningrad. Russia questioned the need for Poland to defend itself and hinted at strengthening its Baltic fleet in response. There were doubts about the Patriots being stationed permanently in Poland. Additionally, in February 2010, Romania agreed to host U.S. missiles. In February 2010, Romania agreed to host U.S. short-to-medium-range interceptor missiles as part of the PAA, extending missile defense into southern Europe. The deployment aimed to strengthen bilateral ties and protect Romanian territory. Russian officials believed the system was directed at Russia, causing tensions and potentially delaying arms talks between Russia and the United States. The head of Russia's National Security Council expressed concerns about Iran's uranium enrichment activities, suggesting doubts about Iran's intentions. Russia's Ambassador to NATO criticized the planned deployment of U.S. Aegis BMD ships in the Black Sea, warning that it could be aimed against any country, including Russia. The Ambassador's response on Twitter was confrontational, stating that the deployment could provoke the Russian bear to retaliate against the \"pathetic hunters.\" Some analysts argue that the interceptors planned for Romania may not be able to intercept a Russian ICBM. A Russian military analyst admitted that the proposed SM-3 interceptors in Europe would be ineffective against Russian ballistic missiles. Moscow's objections include lack of consultation and potential system changes. Romania claims to have consulted with Russia on the anti-missile defense system. The decision to deploy SM-3 missiles to Romania raised concerns in Russia about potential upgrades that could affect ICBMs. Bulgaria expressed support for participating in the U.S. missile defense system, with discussions in early stages. Russia objected to lack of consultation and potential system changes. Russia expressed surprise and concern over the U.S. missile defense system extending to Bulgaria and Romania. Despite objections, Moldova supported the U.S. plan. The new focus on southern Europe is seen as less threatening by Russia compared to previous plans involving Poland and the Czech Republic. The Russian Duma criticized the U.S. plans to deploy missile defense facilities, stating it contradicts the 'reset' program in Russian-American relations. Despite objections, Russia sought to link the missile defense issue to nuclear arms talks with the U.S., but the U.S. refused. Eventually, a new START treaty was announced on March 26, acknowledging the relationship between offensive and defensive weapons. The media report that the agreement does not limit missile defense systems or the proposed expanded system by the Obama Administration. The Obama Administration requested $50.5 million for the European 3rd site, in addition to $618 million from FY2009 appropriations pending Polish and Czech ratification. In June 2009, the House Armed Services Committee reserved $343.1 million for missile defense development in Europe. The House approved the FY2010 defense authorization bill (H.R. 2647) which includes the proposed radar and interceptor site in Poland and the Czech Republic pending ratification. The Secretary of Defense may pursue an alternative integrated missile defense system for Europe, conditional on certification that it is consistent with NATO efforts, cost-effective, and operationally available. The FY2010 defense authorization bill (H.R. 2647) was approved by the House, including funding for the European 3rd site. The Senate also approved funding for the site in their version of the bill (S. 1390). The bill was signed into law (P.L. 111-84) in October 2009, with $50.5 million allocated for the European site. The House Appropriations Committee provided the requested funding in their defense appropriations bill (H.R. 3326) and rescinded previous appropriations.

The reported cost for the European GMD Element is $4 billion (FY2008-FY2013), including fielding and Operation and Support costs. The House Armed Services Committee approved $341 million for the proposed European GMD site in the FY2009 defense authorization bill, reducing the total by $371 million. Concerns were raised about the Iranian long-range missile program, GMD system effectiveness, fund spending ability, and lack of agreements with Poland and the Czech Republic.

President Bush signed a continuing resolution into law on September 30, 2008 (P.L. 110-329), which included defense appropriations and authorizing language for FY2009. Military construction funds require European government approval and a report to Congress, while acquisition and deployment funds need certification from the Secretary of Defense for the proposed interceptor's effectiveness. Congress provided $467 million for European BMD sites and interceptor development in FY2009. Funding for Czech and Polish sites is contingent on ratification of agreements with the United States and SOFA approval. Deployment of operational GBIs is prohibited until the Secretary of Defense certifies their effectiveness to Congress. The Director of Operational Test and Evaluation must certify the proposed interceptor's effectiveness through successful testing before deployment. The House Armed Services Committee expressed concerns about premature investment in the European BMD site, emphasizing the need for integrated testing of the system in Alaska and California. They recommended no funds be approved for FY2008 construction without formal agreements with Poland and the Czech Republic. The Committee recommended no funds for FY2008 construction of the European GMD site but approved $42.7 million for ten additional interceptors. Concerns were raised about the testing plan and risk reduction strategy for the proposed GMD interceptor for Europe. Two studies were directed to be conducted regarding NATO's support for the European GMD proposal and the contribution of other missile defense capabilities like Aegis and THAAD. The Senate defense authorization bill recommended limiting funding for the European GMD site until bilateral agreements with Poland and the Czech Republic are completed and an independent assessment of European missile defense options is conducted. The Committee also reduced funding for site activation and construction activities by $85 million and limited funding for operational interceptor missiles until the Secretary of Defense certifies the proposed interceptor for deployment. The Secretary of Defense certified to Congress that the proposed interceptor had demonstrated high probability of working effectively through successful testing. The Committee noted delays in testing the 2-stage version and stated that construction and deployment of the European GMD site would not happen before 2009. They also mentioned near-term missile defense options for Europe. The Senate approved an amendment to develop a defense system against an Iranian nuclear missile attack. President Bush signed the FY2008 Defense Appropriations Bill, eliminating funding for a European missile defense site construction but allowing for studies on the proposed European GMD.
