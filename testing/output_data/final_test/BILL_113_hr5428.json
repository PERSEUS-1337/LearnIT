    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Return of Certain Lands At Fort Wingate to The Original Inhabitants Act\". Congress finds that the Former Fort Wingate Depot Activity in New Mexico ceased its active mission in 1993 and was closed. The lands were originally ancestral lands of the Zuni Tribe and Navajo Nation, with significant archaeological and cultural sites. The Secretary of the Interior, with support from the tribes and concerned parties, determined the need for environmental remediation. Upon completion of environmental remediation at Former Fort Wingate Depot Activity, lands not needed by the Department of the Army would be transferred to the Secretary of the Interior for the benefit of the Zuni Tribe and Navajo Nation. The tribal leaders met with Congressmen for final discussions on dividing the area fairly. The tribal leaders informally agreed to property divisions outlined in a map prepared by the Army Corps of Engineers. This Act aims to fairly divide Former Fort Wingate Depot Activity for the benefit of the Zuni Tribe and the Navajo Nation. SEC. 3. Division and treatment of lands of Former Fort Wingate Depot Activity in New Mexico to benefit the Zuni Tribe and Navajo Nation. The lands of Former Fort Wingate Depot Activity in New Mexico are to be held in trust by the Secretary of the Interior for the Zuni Tribe and Navajo Nation, unless they elect to have the parcel conveyed to them in Restricted Fee Status. The Secretary of the Interior holds the Map in trust for the Navajo Nation as part of the Navajo Reservation, unless the Nation elects to have the parcel conveyed in Restricted Fee Status. Upon completion of remediation, jurisdiction over the land is transferred to the Secretary of the Interior. Upon assuming administrative jurisdiction over a parcel of land at Former Fort Wingate Depot Activity, the Secretary of the Interior notifies the Zuni Tribe and Navajo Nation. The Secretary holds each transferred parcel in trust for either the Zuni Tribe or Navajo Nation based on the Map's color depiction. Alternatively, the parcel can be held in Restricted Fee Status. The Zuni Tribe and Navajo Nation may choose to have land conveyed to them in restricted fee status instead of held in trust by the Secretary of the Interior. They must notify the Secretary within 45 days of the transfer of administrative jurisdiction over the land at Former Fort Wingate Depot Activity. The Zuni Tribe and Navajo Nation can opt for land conveyance in restricted fee status instead of trust by the Secretary of the Interior. They must notify within 45 days of the transfer of jurisdiction over the land at Former Fort Wingate Depot Activity. The Secretary of the Interior must convey the land covered by the notice within 6 months to the Zuni Tribe or Navajo Nation in restricted fee status. Restricted fee status means land conveyed under this Act. The land conveyed to Indian tribes must be owned in fee, part of the tribe's Reservation, not sold without Congress' consent, not taxed by other governments, and not subject to Interior Secretary's review or approval. The Secretary of the Interior must approve land use by Indian tribes, conduct surveys, and establish legal boundaries for lands taken into trust or conveyed in restricted fee status for the Zuni Tribe or the Navajo Nation. The Secretary of the Interior consults with the Zuni Tribe and the Navajo Nation to prioritize land surveys. Regulations in Part 151 of title 25, Code of Federal Regulations, do not apply to taking lands of Former Fort Wingate Depot Activity into trust. SEC. 4. RETENTION OF NECESSARY EASEMENTS AND ACCESS. The lands of Former Fort Wingate Depot Activity held in trust or conveyed in restricted fee status shall have easements reserved by the United States for access, cleanup, and remediation purposes. The Zuni Tribe and Navajo Nation will receive written copies of these easements. Parcel 1 will have a shared easement for cultural and religious purposes for both tribes. The Zuni Tribe and Navajo Nation have unhindered access to their cultural and religious sites within Parcel 1. They must exchange detailed information within 1 year to document these sites. The Secretary of the Interior will also receive this information. Shared access to other lands for religious and cultural sites is possible with consent. The access road for the Former Fort Wingate Depot Activity, originating at the I-40 frontage road, will be shared by the Zuni Tribe and Navajo Nation for equal access. Lands held in trust or conveyed in Restricted Fee Status will have easements for Department of Defense access to the Missile Defense Agency facility. SEC. 5. ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION. The Zuni Tribe and the Navajo Nation are not liable for damages from Department of the Army activities at Former Fort Wingate Depot. They shall be held harmless from any claims or costs related to such activities. The Zuni Tribe and the Navajo Nation are not liable for damages from Department of the Army activities at Former Fort Wingate Depot. They shall be held harmless from any claim, suit, demand, judgment, cost, or fee arising from activities on or off the site, regardless of when contamination is discovered. After land transfer, they must notify the Secretary of the Army of any contamination found. The New Mexico Environment Department has fully remediated a parcel of land at Former Fort Wingate Depot Activity to meet Federal environmental requirements for the transfer or conveyance of the parcel by the Secretary of the Army and the Secretary of the Interior under section 3."
