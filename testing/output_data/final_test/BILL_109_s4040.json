    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Public Research in the Public Interest Act of 2006\". The purpose and findings are outlined in the following section. The Act aims to promote global public health and national security by ensuring innovations from federally-funded institutions are available in eligible developing countries at low cost. Congress recognizes the importance of funding academic research for public interest and the growth of the pharmaceutical industry. The pharmaceutical industry benefits from technology, improving longevity and quality of life in the US. Public research has led to the development of important drugs. Millions in developing countries need antiretroviral drugs for HIV/AIDS, while infectious diseases like malaria and tuberculosis are major concerns. The World Health Organization reports that a third of the global population lacks access to essential medicines. The World Health Organization recommends universities adopt licensing practices to increase access to essential medicines in developing countries. The Department of State highlights the cost savings potential of generic drugs compared to branded versions. Allowing generic versions of essential medicines in impoverished regions will have minimal impact on sales of brand-name versions, saving countless lives. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.
