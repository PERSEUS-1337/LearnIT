    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Great Ape Protection Act\" and its purpose is to provide findings related to great apes. Congress finds that great apes, our closest living relatives, have a strong genetic connection to humans. They are intelligent and social animals, and research involving invasive methods cannot meet their complex needs, leading to harmful stress and suffering. This includes behaviors like depression, self-mutilation, and other traumatized or psychotic behaviors. Invasive research on great apes for economic purposes significantly impacts interstate commerce. The majority of this research aims to develop products for the interstate market, with high costs associated with care in research laboratories. The regulation of animals and activities in this Act is necessary to regulate interstate and foreign commerce. Several countries have banned or limited experiments on great apes, with more considering similar bans. The National Research Council report emphasizes the moral responsibility for the ethical care of chimpanzees in research. The Chimpanzee Health Improvement, Maintenance, and Protection (CHIMP) Act, signed in December 2000, mandates the retirement of chimpanzees no longer needed for research. It emphasizes the moral responsibility for long-term care, calls for a moratorium on breeding, rejects euthanasia for population control, and advocates for sanctuaries with high standards of care, enrichment, and development. The CHIMP Act, signed in December 2000, mandates the retirement of chimpanzees no longer needed for research. In May 2007, the National Institutes of Health's National Center for Research Resources decided to permanently end funding for breeding Government-owned chimpanzees for research. The purpose of this Act is to prohibit invasive research on great apes, their funding, transport, breeding, and require the retirement of federally owned great apes. SEC. 3. PROHIBITIONS.\n\nNo invasive research on great apes allowed. Federal funds cannot be used for invasive research. Prohibits transport, breeding, and sale of great apes for invasive research purposes. Individualized medical care by licensed veterinarians exempted.\n\nSEC. 4. RETIREMENT. SEC. 4. RETIREMENT. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will retire all great apes owned by the Federal Government used for invasive research, with an exception for euthanasia if deemed necessary by veterinarians. The term \"great ape\" includes chimpanzees, gorillas, bonobos, orangutans, or gibbons. \"Invasive research\" refers to experimental research that may cause harm to great apes, such as testing drugs, physical manipulations, or social deprivation. The term \"permanent retirement\" refers to placing a great ape in a sanctuary for lifetime care without further invasive research or euthanasia. The term \"person\" is defined as... The term \"person\" includes individuals, entities, and government officials. A \"suitable sanctuary\" is a designated facility for great apes approved by the Secretary of Health and Human Services. SEC. 6. EFFECTIVE DATE. This Act will be effective 3 years after its enactment."
