    "content": "The Medicare Part D prescription drug benefit began in 2006 under the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act. It serves as the primary source of drug coverage for dual eligibles. Part D coverage is provided through private insurance plans or Medicare Advantage plans. Subsidies are provided for retiree drug plans. The Medicare Part D program provides subsidies for retiree drug plans to incentivize employers to continue offering them. Employers and unions are also offering Part D benefits through employer-group waiver plans. As of July 2018, 44.2 million Medicare beneficiaries were enrolled in Part D plans, with a focus on providing subsidized coverage to low-income beneficiaries through the low-income subsidy (LIS). The LIS helps reduce out-of-pocket spending by covering part of the monthly premium, annual deductible, and co-payments. The Low-Income Subsidy (LIS) for Medicare Part D helps low-income beneficiaries by covering part of the monthly premium, annual deductible, and co-payments. The ACA made changes to Part D to improve coverage, including requiring higher-income beneficiaries to pay more. Starting in 2011, higher-income enrollees had to pay a monthly surcharge. The ACA also phased out the \"doughnut hole\" by requiring drug manufacturers to provide discounts for brand-name drugs purchased by beneficiaries in the coverage gap. The ACA modified Medicare Part D subsidies to cover 75% of generic drugs and 25% of brand name drugs in the coverage gap. Private insurance plans in Part D bear financial risk and offer varying benefit designs. In 2018, there were 782 PDPs nationwide, with beneficiaries having 23 PDPs and 17 MA-PDs to choose from. In 2017, 72.5% of eligible Medicare beneficiaries were enrolled in a Part D plan, with 2.7% having prescription drug coverage through other means. Joining Part D is voluntary for most, but dual-eligible beneficiaries are automatically enrolled. Preexisting health conditions or high drug utilization cannot result in denial of Part D coverage. In 2017, 72.5% of eligible Medicare beneficiaries were enrolled in a Part D plan, with 2.7% having prescription drug coverage through other means. About half of the remaining beneficiaries had drug coverage as generous as Part D through other sources, while 12.5% had less generous coverage or no drug coverage. Low-income Medicare beneficiaries may qualify for assistance with Part D premiums and out-of-pocket expenses, with 12.9 million beneficiaries receiving low-income subsidies in 2018. Certain groups automatically qualify for full low-income subsidy. Low-income Medicare beneficiaries may qualify for assistance with Part D premiums and out-of-pocket expenses. Those who qualify for Medicaid based on income and assets are automatically eligible for Medicare prescription drug low-income subsidies. Additionally, individuals receiving premium and/or cost-sharing assistance from Medicaid through the Medicare Savings Program, as well as those eligible for Supplemental Security Income cash assistance, are automatically deemed eligible for full low-income subsidies. Eligibility is based on income and resources below specific limits, which are adjusted annually. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services deems individuals automatically eligible for low-income subsidies effective as of the first day of the month they qualify. Low-income Medicare beneficiaries may qualify for assistance with Part D premiums and out-of-pocket expenses. Eligibility for the Low-Income Subsidy (LIS) is effective from the first day of the month of qualifying status, with an end date through the end of the calendar year. Beneficiaries deemed LIS-eligible from July to December are eligible through the following calendar year. CMS may change deemed status mid-year for reduced co-payment obligations. LIS eligibility is not continuous yearly, and beneficiaries losing Medicaid or SSI eligibility must reapply for LIS. CMS notifies individuals in September if their LIS-deemed status ends on December 31. The ACA changed the method for determining eligibility for low-income beneficiaries in Part D plans, reducing reassignments. Individuals with limited incomes can apply for the low-income subsidy through SSA or state Medicaid agency. 279,419 LIS beneficiaries in PDP plans and 91,419 in MA-PDs were reassigned for the 2017 plan year. The low-income subsidy (LIS) is available for individuals enrolled in PDP or MA-PD plans with incomes below 150% of the federal poverty level and assets below certain thresholds. Eligible individuals can receive retroactive benefits once approved for the LIS, including reimbursement for premiums and cost sharing. The LIS subsidy is available for individuals with incomes below 150% of the federal poverty level and assets below certain thresholds. Initial LIS eligibility determinations last for up to 12 months and can be reviewed for changes throughout the plan year. The ACA introduced new rules for LIS redeterminations after the death of a spouse. After the death of a spouse, the surviving spouse of an LIS-eligible couple receives a grace period for benefit redetermination. If the widow qualifies for a more generous subsidy or has more favorable resources, the change takes effect the following month. If no change, no redetermination form is sent the next year. If a reduction in LIS is needed, redetermination is postponed. New Medicare beneficiaries can sign up for Part D in three ways. A Medicare beneficiary signing up for Part D for the first time can choose from three enrollment periods: Initial Enrollment Period, Annual Open Enrollment Period, or Special Enrollment Period. Those eligible for LIS can enroll at any time. Coverage for new enrollees starts the month after enrollment, but no earlier than the first month of Medicare entitlement. Individuals with \"creditable\" coverage have options upon becoming eligible for Medicare. Individuals eligible for Medicare with \"creditable\" coverage, such as employer-based or military-related coverage, may delay signing up for Part D during the initial enrollment period. However, they could face a penalty if their creditable coverage lapses before enrolling. Enrollment in Part D is typically during the annual open enrollment period from October 15 to December 7, with coverage starting the following January 1. During the annual open enrollment period from October 15 to December 7, beneficiaries can change their Part D plans for various reasons like health status changes or plan modifications. Changes to plan benefits usually take effect at the start of each calendar year. Special enrollment periods (SEPs) allow individuals to enroll, disenroll, or switch Part D plans in specific situations like moving to a new area or losing creditable coverage. A late enrollment penalty in Part D is imposed on individuals who lack creditable drug coverage for 63 continuous days or more after their initial enrollment period ends. This penalty aims to promote broader enrollment and prevent adverse selection, where healthier individuals delay purchasing insurance while those with higher prescription drug costs immediately enroll. If the program mainly attracts sicker individuals or those with higher costs, it can lead to increased per-capita program costs and potentially cause healthier enrollees to drop coverage, making program costs unsustainable over time. The Part D late penalty is calculated based on the number of months without creditable coverage, multiplying 1% of the national base premium by the eligible months without coverage. The penalty is rounded to the nearest $0.10 and is applied permanently to Part D premiums. The penalty amount increases annually with the recalculated base premium. Dual-eligible and other LIS beneficiaries are exempt from this penalty. Sponsors can make changes to plan benefits annually, including drug formulary and cost sharing. They must send an Annual Notice of Change (ANOC) by September 30, detailing any modifications for the upcoming benefit year. Beneficiaries receive other enrollment materials like Summary of Benefits and Evidence of Coverage documents. Each year, Medicare beneficiaries need to review the cost of their current drug and health plans, including premiums, co-payments, and deductibles, and compare them to other plans in their area. They can also check for price tiers, preferred pharmacy options, and utilization management requirements. CMS provides information on its website to help with plan comparisons. The Medicare drug plan finder helps beneficiaries find Part D plans that cover their medications by entering information on dosages and preferred pharmacy. Quality ratings are provided for easy plan comparison based on cost and performance. Beneficiaries in low-quality plans are encouraged to switch to higher rated plans. Plan availability and characteristics can be obtained from various sources including the Medicare toll-free number and State Health Insurance Assistance Programs. CMS uses a star-rating system to assess the quality of Part D plans. Plans in the Medicare Part D program are rated on quality and performance measures, with ratings ranging from one to five stars. Plans with ratings below three stars for three consecutive years may be terminated by CMS. Plans with five-star ratings are recognized as high-performing. Plans with five-star ratings in the Medicare Part D program may display a special icon, and enrollees have a special enrollment period to switch to these high-performing plans. Plan sponsors must provide accurate marketing information, and starting in 2019, fewer plan materials will be subject to CMS prior review. Marketing activities will be classified as communications, with marketing defined as activities likely to influence enrollment decisions. In Medicare Part D, plan sponsors must provide accurate marketing information to ensure beneficiaries have complete and accurate information when making enrollment decisions. Marketing materials must include information about a plan's benefit structure, costs, and star ratings, and must adhere to standardized names and materials. Plans with high star ratings may display a special icon and have a special enrollment period for beneficiaries to switch to these high-performing plans. Starting in 2019, fewer plan materials will be subject to CMS prior review, with marketing activities classified as communications. Plans in Medicare Part D must adhere to standardized names and materials, obtain prior agreement from enrollees for certain information formats, and refrain from unsolicited marketing. Plan sponsors must provide interpreters in call centers, offer specific documents upon request, and may give nominal gifts to potential enrollees. Beneficiaries can join a Part D plan through various methods such as paper applications, online enrollment, or using the Medicare website. In Medicare Part D, beneficiaries can enroll in a plan through various methods such as paper applications, online enrollment, or by calling the company offering the drug plan. A PDP sponsor must acknowledge receipt of the application within 10 days and may request more information if needed. They cannot deny a valid enrollment request from any Part D-eligible individual in their service area. In Medicare Part D, a PDP sponsor must provide necessary information about being a member, including rules, rights, and responsibilities. They must also submit required information to CMS within seven days of receiving an enrollment request. Special enrollment rules apply to low-income individuals for gaining Part D coverage. Starting in 2019, LIS enrollees in Medicare Part D will have limited opportunities to change plans, with an SEP once per calendar quarter during the first nine months of the year. Additional SEPs are available within three months of coverage start, enrollment notification, or a change in LIS/Medicaid status. Limits on SEPs also apply to at-risk opioid abuse individuals. CMS automatically enrolls full-benefit, dual-eligible individuals into a Part D plan if they have not elected one. Beneficiaries are randomly assigned to a plan with basic drug coverage and premiums below the low-income subsidy amount. If ineligible for a PDP due to being in a Medicare Advantage plan, other SEPs may apply. CMS automatically enrolls full-benefit, dual-eligible individuals into a Part D plan with basic drug coverage and low premiums. Beneficiaries can change enrollment if the plan does not meet their needs, with new coverage effective the following month. Enrollees in Medicare Savings programs, SSI enrollees, and low-income subsidy recipients are eligible for facilitated enrollment. If an enrollee selects a plan with a premium above the low-income benchmark, they must pay the difference. CMS facilitates enrollment for dual-eligible individuals by identifying eligibility through SSA and/or Medicaid data and randomly assigning them to plans with premiums below the low-income benchmark. Drug plans may increase premiums at the start of a plan year, prompting CMS to reassign certain LIS recipients to different plans to ensure continued benefits without paying Part D premiums. LIS beneficiaries who voluntarily changed plans in the past are not automatically reassigned by CMS. The ACA made changes to Part D to reduce automatic reassignment of LIS beneficiaries. About 1.16 million LIS beneficiaries were enrolled in benchmark PDPs in 2016 that had terminated or did not qualify as benchmark plans in 2017. CMS reassigned 279,419 beneficiaries to different PDPs, while 879,260 were not reassigned because they had voluntarily switched plans. LIS beneficiaries in MA-PD plans are automatically reassigned to PDP plans if their current plan ceases operations or if there is a reduction in the plan's service area. PDPs with premiums above LIS-eligible levels no longer have LIS beneficiaries reassigned if they voluntarily agree to waive a portion of the premium above the benchmark. The MMA set out a standard prescription drug benefit structure, with beneficiaries responsible for paying a monthly premium, an annual deductible, and co-payments for drug purchases. The ACA included provisions to eliminate the coverage gap, where beneficiaries face increased out-of-pocket costs. Actual costs vary depending on the benefit structure offered by different plans. Actual costs for Part D beneficiaries vary depending on the benefit structure, coverage, drug usage, and additional assistance like low-income subsidies. Beneficiaries pay monthly premiums, which on average represent 25.5% of a standard Part D plan cost. Premiums do not cover federal reinsurance or low-income subsidies. Premium amounts vary by plan and are based on average bids submitted by drug plans. The base beneficiary monthly premium for Medicare Part D plans is 25.5% of the average bid amount, totaling $35.02 in 2018. Premiums vary based on plan costs, with higher-cost plans charging above-average premiums and lower-cost plans charging below-average premiums. Enrollees in MA-PD plans may have lower premiums if their plans choose to reduce the Part D premium. Premiums are paid directly or deducted from Social Security benefits, with higher-income beneficiaries facing a surcharge. Beginning in 2011, the ACA required higher-earning Part D enrollees to pay higher premiums through an income-related monthly adjustment amount (IRMMA). Less than 5% of Medicare enrollees are subject to this surcharge, which is calculated based on income thresholds. The ACA introduced income-related monthly adjustment amounts (IRMMA) for higher-earning Part D enrollees, with less than 5% of Medicare enrollees subject to this surcharge. The surcharge is based on beneficiary income, with higher-income beneficiaries facing a larger surcharge. Starting in 2018, MACRA reduces the threshold levels for the two highest income tiers, and from 2020, income thresholds for all categories will be adjusted annually for inflation. Starting in 2019, a new high-income category will be added for Part D enrollees with annual income of $500,000 or more for individuals and $750,000 or more for couples. These enrollees will pay premiums covering 85% of the average per capita cost of benefits instead of 80%. The top income threshold will be frozen through 2027 and adjusted annually for inflation starting in 2028. The surcharge is calculated using a formula multiplying the base premium by a set ratio. In 2018, the Income-Related Monthly Adjustment Amount (IRMAA) for Part D enrollees is calculated using a formula that multiplies the base premium by a set ratio. Beneficiaries pay the surcharge directly to the federal government, and it may be withheld from their benefit checks if applicable. Part D plan designs may vary, but all plans must offer at least a minimum level of coverage. Part D plans offer a minimum package of benefits, including qualified prescription drug coverage. Plans can offer standard or enhanced coverage, with higher premiums for enhanced plans. MA organizations must offer at least one plan with drug coverage. Beneficiaries pay a deductible and then 25% of prescription drug costs up to the initial coverage limit. In 2018, Part D plans cover 75% of prescription drug costs up to the initial coverage limit of $3,750. Beneficiaries pay a deductible of $405 and $836.25 in prescription costs before reaching the initial coverage limit. After reaching this limit, they enter the coverage gap and are responsible for a larger share of costs until reaching $5,000 in total out-of-pocket costs. The total drug spending needed to reach the catastrophic threshold is estimated at about $8,417.60. After reaching the initial coverage limit of $3,750, beneficiaries enter the coverage gap where they are responsible for a larger share of costs until reaching $5,000 in total out-of-pocket costs. Plans charge a beneficiary the greater of a nominal set co-payment for drugs or 5% coinsurance after the catastrophic threshold has been reached. Medicare subsidizes 80% of each plan's costs for catastrophic coverage, with annual Part D coverage parameters updated using a set formula based on average per-capita spending for covered outpatient drugs. Plan sponsors have flexibility in designing pricing and benefits. Insurers offer various options for Part D plans, including basic plans with modified cost-sharing and enhanced benefits. In 2017, 41% of Part D enrollees were in plans with enhanced benefits, while 59% were in plans equivalent to the standard benefit. Insurers may also provide coverage that exceeds the standard benefit, including reductions in cost sharing. The Part D program includes basic coverage and supplemental benefits such as reductions in cost sharing. A PDP sponsor must offer a standard or actuarially equivalent plan in the same region before offering an enhanced plan to ensure lower-cost options for Medicare beneficiaries. CMS has streamlined the number of Part D plans in each region since the ACA, requiring meaningful differences between plans offered by sponsors. Plan sponsors are limited to offering one basic plan benefit design and no more than two enhanced alternatives in a service area. Beginning in 2019, CMS will no longer require Part D sponsors to demonstrate meaningful differences between enhanced plans in a region. Sponsors must still show differences from the basic plan. This change aims to give sponsors more flexibility in plan design. Medicare Part D includes a coverage gap, where enrollees pay more until reaching catastrophic coverage. This was included in the benefit structure to control total spending. The ACA included provisions to phase out the coverage gap in Medicare Part D by 2020, reducing cost sharing for beneficiaries. Congress accelerated this phase-out for brand-name drugs in 2019 through BBA 2018. Beneficiaries in Medicare Part D may experience varying out-of-pocket costs in the coverage gap based on plan structure, drug usage, and eligibility for the LIS. Strategies to reduce spending include switching to lower-cost drugs and exploring savings options. About 26% of Part D enrollees reached the coverage gap in 2015, with CMS providing tips to avoid or minimize the impact of the gap. The ACA aims to close the Medicare Part D coverage gap by 2020 through manufacturer discounts and government subsidies. Beneficiaries are advised to use their Medicare drug plan cards to access discounted prices and track out-of-pocket expenses towards reaching the catastrophic coverage threshold. Various assistance programs are available to help reduce costs, such as SPAPs and Pharmaceutical Assistance Programs offered by manufacturers or charities. The ACA required Medicare Part D participants to sign agreements for the Coverage Gap Discount Program, providing discounts on brand-name drugs. By 2020, beneficiaries would have 25% cost sharing in the coverage gap, with federal subsidies and manufacturer discounts. Generic drugs received a 75% federal subsidy. BBA 2018 aimed to close the brand-name drug coverage gap in 2019. Beginning in 2019, BBA 2018 accelerates the closure of the coverage gap for brand-name drugs by increasing the manufacturer discount to 70% and including biosimilar drugs. The federal subsidy for brand-name drugs is set at 5%, with beneficiary cost sharing at 25%. ACA requirements for generic drugs remain unchanged, with the coverage gap scheduled to close in 2020. Non-LIS enrollees currently pay 35% of brand-name drug costs and 44% of generic drug costs in the coverage gap. In 2019, the federal government subsidizes 63% of generic drug costs in the coverage gap, with enrollees paying 37%. By 2020, the coverage gap will be closed for both generic and brand-name drugs. The government will then subsidize 75% of generic drug costs, with enrollees paying 25%. Participants in enhanced Part D plans receive required discounts and subsidies. In 2016, over 4.9 million beneficiaries received a 50% discount on brand-name drugs, totaling $5.65 billion in discounts. True out-of-pocket costs (TrOOP) for Part D enrollees include plan deductible, cost sharing up to initial coverage limit, and certain drug costs in the coverage gap. Enrollee spending is considered TrOOP if paid by the enrollee, family members, Qualified State Pharmacy Assistance Program, low-income subsidy, charities, Medicare Coverage Gap Discount Program, Indian Health Service, or AIDS Drug Assistance Program. Premiums and costs for drugs not on the plan are not included in TrOOP. In 2015, 3.6 million Part D enrollees exceeded the out-of-pocket threshold, reaching the catastrophic phase of the benefit, accounting for 65% of gross Part D spending on basic benefits. Medicare covers a larger share of spending for individuals in the catastrophic phase, making reinsurance the largest share of Part D program spending. Medicare Part D provides subsidies to assist low-income beneficiaries with premiums and cost sharing. Around 2.6 million low-income subsidy recipients reached the catastrophic phase in 2015. The number of non-LIS enrollees reaching the coverage gap has been increasing due to higher drug prices, ACA provisions, and higher enrollment growth. LIS cost sharing varies based on assets, income, and care situation. Full-subsidy eligibles have minimal cost sharing during the initial coverage period and coverage gap. Low-income beneficiaries receiving full subsidies do not pay monthly plan premiums if they enroll in lower-cost Part D plans. Partial-subsidy-eligible individuals receive premium assistance based on an income sliding scale. Cost-sharing subsidies for LIS enrollees are linked to income levels. Cost-sharing subsidies for LIS enrollees are linked to income levels and vary based on eligibility. Full-subsidy eligibles have no deductible, minimal cost sharing, and no cost sharing above the catastrophic threshold. Dual eligibles in medical institutions or nursing facilities have no cost sharing. ACA expanded LIS subsidy for beneficiaries receiving home and community-based services. Dual-eligible individuals with incomes up to 100% of FPL pay $1.25 for generic drugs and $3.70 for other drugs up to the catastrophic threshold in 2018. Cost-sharing subsidies for LIS enrollees are linked to income levels and vary based on eligibility. Full-subsidy-eligible individuals with incomes above 100% of FPL have cost sharing for all drug costs, up to the catastrophic limit of $3.35 for a generic drug or preferred multiple-source drug and $8.35 for any other drug. Partial-subsidy-eligible individuals have an $83 deductible in 2018, 15% coinsurance for all costs up to the catastrophic trigger, and cost sharing above this level of $3.35 for a generic drug prescription or preferred multiple-source drug prescription and $8.35 for any other drug prescription. Each year, cost-sharing amounts for full-benefit dual eligibles up to or at 100% of FPL are updated by the annual percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index (CPI). The cost-sharing amounts for all other beneficiaries, and the deductible amount for other subsidy-eligible individuals, are increased by the annual percentage. The Medicare Modernization Act (MMA) incentivizes employers to provide drug benefits to Medicare-eligible retirees through federal retiree drug subsidies (RDS). Employers must offer drug benefits equivalent to standard Part D coverage and apply for CMS approval at least 90 days before the plan year. Medicare provides payments to eligible retirees who are entitled to Medicare benefits and live in a Part D service area. The Medicare Modernization Act incentivizes employers to provide drug benefits to Medicare-eligible retirees through federal retiree drug subsidies (RDS). Employers must offer drug benefits equivalent to standard Part D coverage and apply for CMS approval. Retiree subsidies are designed to encourage employers to maintain drug coverage and are less expensive for Medicare than enrolling beneficiaries in a Part D drug plan. In 2018, sponsors receive a federal subsidy equal to 28% of gross prescription drug costs for each retiree enrolled in a qualified plan. The ACA prohibited companies from claiming a tax deduction for the Medicare drug subsidy, resulting in higher costs for retiree plans. This has led to a decline in the share of beneficiaries covered through the retiree drug subsidy program, from 20% in 2010 to an estimated 2% in 2027. The share of Part D enrollment covered by the retiree drug subsidy program is expected to decline from 20% in 2010 to about 2% in 2027. Employers and unions are increasingly providing retirees drug benefits through Part D employer group waiver plans (EGWPs), which offer coverage to Medicare-eligible retirees and their spouses and dependents. EGWPs may include supplemental benefits and have waivers for certain Part D requirements. The Medicare Trustees predict that the share of individuals enrolled in EGWPs will increase from 6% in 2007. The share of individuals enrolled in EGWPs is expected to rise from 6% in 2007 to about 15% in 2018. For a drug to be paid by Medicare's prescription drug benefit, it must be covered under Part D and included in the formulary of an individual's plan. Covered Part D drugs include outpatient prescription drugs approved by the FDA, biological products, insulin, and vaccines licensed under the PHS Act. Certain drugs are excluded from Part D coverage by law. Certain drugs are excluded from Part D coverage by law, including those used for anorexia, weight loss, fertility, cosmetic purposes, coughs and colds, vitamins, and minerals. Drugs for sexual or erectile dysfunction are also excluded unless approved for another condition by the FDA. Some previously excluded drugs, like benzodiazepines, are now covered since January 1, 2013. The ACA removed certain drugs from the list of exclusions for Medicaid coverage, including smoking cessation agents, barbiturates, and benzodiazepines. Part D restrictions on barbiturate coverage were also ended, allowing Medicaid to cover these drugs for beneficiaries. Dual eligibles may receive coverage for excluded drugs from Medicaid if deemed medically necessary. Part D sponsors can choose to include these drugs in enhanced plans, but without federal subsidy. Part D drug plans do not cover drugs already covered by other parts of Medicare, such as those provided during hospital stays paid for by Part A or when Part B covers prescription drugs. Part B covers drugs not usually self-administered, necessary for durable medical equipment, immunosuppressive drugs for transplant recipients, erythropoietin for end-stage renal disease, oral anticancer drugs, drugs requiring special administration, and certain vaccines. Prescription drug plans have formularies listing covered drugs. Prescription drug plans have formularies listing covered drugs, which are chosen by the plan and can include some FDA-approved drugs. A CMS-approved Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee, consisting mainly of practicing physicians or pharmacists, reviews and develops the formulary. The committee considers scientific evidence, standards of practice, and therapeutic value when making decisions. The Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee reviews and develops formularies for prescription drug plans, considering scientific evidence and therapeutic value. Formulary drugs are grouped into categories and classes, with the requirement to include at least two chemically distinct drugs in each category or class used to treat the same medical condition. The MMA mandated the development of these classifications by the USP and periodic revisions. Under CMS guidelines, Part D drug plans must cover at least two drugs in each drug class, including specific categories like immunosuppressant and antipsychotic drugs. Plan sponsors cannot require prior authorization or step-therapy mandates for certain protected classes of drugs to ensure uninterrupted therapy for vulnerable populations. This policy was established by the Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act of 2008 and the ACA. The Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006 and the ACA established protected drug classes and categories, allowing HHS to specify criteria for drug identification. Part D sponsors can exclude or restrict access to certain drugs. Medicare Part B covers vaccines for influenza, pneumonia, Hepatitis B, and immunizations for injuries or diseases. Part D covers vaccines and their administration costs, which are billed on one claim and paid by the insurance provider. Unlike Part B vaccines, Part D claims are not billed directly to Medicare. Starting in CY2019, Part D plans may alter their formularies from year to year and make changes within a plan year in limited circumstances. If drugs are removed from formularies or cost-sharing requirements change, timely notice must be provided to CMS, affected enrollees, physicians, pharmacies, and pharmacists. Plans are allowed to change therapeutic categories and classes of drugs within a plan year for new therapeutic uses or newly approved Part D drugs. Starting in CY2019, Part D sponsors can make formulary changes during a plan year without prior notice, as long as they replace brand-name drugs with therapeutically equivalent generics on the same or lower cost-sharing tier. Plans must inform enrollees about any substitutions that occur. Other formulary changes can be made under specific circumstances. Plans may make changes to their formularies without prior notice if drugs are deemed unsafe by the FDA or pulled from the market. Maintenance changes can be made after March 1 each year, such as replacing brand name drugs with generics. Plans can also remove drugs, change tier status, or add utilization management requirements with CMS approval and 30 days advance notice. Transition standards are in place to prevent abrupt loss of drug coverage when switching plans. Transition policies ensure continuity of drug coverage for beneficiaries during plan changes. Beneficiaries can request exceptions for medically necessary drugs not covered by the new plan. Plans must continue previous prescriptions for the first 90 days of the year, with refills for approved month supplies. This applies to drugs not on the formulary or requiring prior authorization. CMS regulations require Part D plans to have drug utilization management programs that include incentives to reduce costs and prevent over- or under-utilization of medications. Plans may assign formulary drugs to tiers with different cost-sharing levels, encouraging the use of generic drugs. In recent years, CMS has imposed stricter requirements on plans to combat fraud and abuse in prescription drug programs. Part D plans use structured pricing with different tiers to encourage the use of generic medications and discourage expensive drugs. Plans have flexibility in tier structure, with different cost-sharing requirements. For example, a five-tiered formulary may include preferred generics in Tier 1 and very expensive drugs in Tier 5. In 2018, most PDPs had five cost-sharing tiers with varying co-payments and coinsurance. Part D plans can have a specialty tier for expensive drugs, with coinsurance based on drug cost. CMS sets conditions to prevent discouraging enrollment, including limits on coinsurance percentages and drug prices for the specialty tier. Specialty drugs make up a small percentage of Part D prescriptions but a significant portion of costs. Specialty drugs account for a small percentage of Part D prescriptions but a significant portion of costs. Best practices dictate that drugs are placed in a nonpreferred tier only when therapeutically similar drugs are in more preferable positions on the formulary. Utilization restrictions include prior authorization and step therapy. Since 2014, Part D plans require approval for specific drugs, utilize step therapy, and impose quantity limits to reduce waste. Beneficiaries can request a waiver with a physician statement justifying medical necessity. Daily cost-sharing rates are applied to prescriptions for less than a 30-day supply. Specialty drugs, though a small percentage of Part D prescriptions, contribute significantly to costs. Utilization restrictions like prior authorization and step therapy are in place. Since 2013, CMS has implemented measures in Part D plans to combat inappropriate opioid utilization, including enhancing formulary controls, retrospective claims review, and case management for at-risk beneficiaries. The daily cost-sharing requirement incentivizes shorter prescriptions to reduce costs and drug waste. CMS has implemented measures in Part D plans to combat inappropriate opioid utilization, including the Overutilization Monitoring System (OMS) to verify effective opioid management programs. The Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act of 2016 allows Part D sponsors to limit pharmacies and prescribers for at-risk beneficiaries to reduce fraud and abuse. Beginning in 2019, Part D plan sponsors can limit an at-risk beneficiary's access to opioids and benzodiazepines through prescription safety edits and requiring them to use specific pharmacies or prescribers. These measures aim to reduce fraud and abuse by controlling opioid use, following CMS guidelines. Low-income beneficiaries at risk for drug abuse will have limited access to Special Enrollment Periods. Exceptions apply for those receiving cancer-related pain treatment, palliative care, or end-of-life care. The final rule aims to reduce opioid fraud and abuse by barring Part D plans from covering prescriptions written by providers on a special CMS preclusion list. CMS can revoke Medicare enrollment for providers with abusive prescribing patterns or revoked DEA registration. Part D plans must include a Medication Therapy Management program. Part D plans must include a Medication Therapy Management (MTM) program, which provides coordinated pharmacy care for patients with multiple medical conditions. The program includes medication reviews, patient consultation, and education. Beneficiaries are automatically enrolled if they have multiple chronic diseases, take at least two to eight Part D drugs, and are likely to have annual drug costs exceeding $3,967 in 2018. Part D sponsors may target beneficiaries with specific chronic diseases, including Alzheimer's Disease, Chronic Heart Failure, Diabetes, Dyslipidemia, End-Stage Renal Disease, Hypertension, Respiratory Disease, Bone Disease-Arthritis, and Mental Health. Beneficiaries enrolled in a MTM program must undergo medication reviews, interventions with prescribers, and quarterly medication reviews. In 2015, CMS announced a five-year MTM pilot program. In 2015, CMS announced a five-year MTM pilot program to test additional payment incentives and regulatory flexibility for Part D sponsors. 11 states are eligible to participate in the program. Medicare Part D participants obtain coverage through private insurers or entities contracting with Medicare. PDPs are available region-wide in 34 designated regions, while MA-PDs operate on a countywide basis. Medicare Part D sponsors in the United States offer plans in multiple regions, submitting separate coverage bids for each. Payments are determined through competitive bidding, with enrollee premiums linked to plan bids. Plans assume some risk for enrollees' drug spending. CMS issues a call letter annually to potential sponsors, with bids due by the first Monday in June for the following year's plan. Bids must include coverage details, actuarial value of prescription drug coverage, and bid information. Medicare Part D sponsors submit separate coverage bids for each region, including details on actuarial value, coverage portions, and service area. CMS reviews bids for negotiation and approval based on requirements such as actuarial determinations and beneficiary protections. The plan must exclude certain costs and meet specific criteria for approval. The Part D sponsors submit coverage bids for each region, which are reviewed by CMS for approval based on actuarial determinations and beneficiary protections. PDP sponsors enter into 12-month contracts with CMS if their bids are approved, agreeing to comply with Part D requirements. Starting in 2016, CMS imposed a two-year application ban on sponsors who withdraw their bids after the annual LIS benchmark amounts are announced. The MMA prohibits the HHS Secretary from interfering in drug price negotiations and setting plan formularies to promote competition. For the 2018 plan year, Part D sponsors offered 782 PDPs and 2,003 MA-PDs, with 19 to 26 PDPs per region and about 10 MA-PD options for beneficiaries. The number of PDPs increased by 5% and MA-PDs by 16% compared to 2017. A Part D plan qualifies as a LIS benchmark plan if it offers basic coverage and charges premiums equal to or lower than the regional low-income benchmark premium. In 2018, there are 216 LIS benchmark PDPs, with Florida having two benchmark plans and other regions having 3 to 10 plans. LIS beneficiaries in a plan losing benchmark status must enroll in a new plan to avoid additional costs. LIS enrollment, like non-LIS enrollment, has become more concentrated over time. In 2017, CVS Health had 2.4 million LIS enrollees in its Part D plans, accounting for 20% of all LIS enrollees. Medicare provides subsidies for non-LIS Medicare enrollees in Part D plans, with payments based on plan bids and risk-adjusted for health status. Medicare also covers most cost sharing and premiums for LIS beneficiaries in PDP or MA-PD plans. The subsidy amount for Part D plans in 2018 is risk-adjusted based on the health status of enrollees, with sicker individuals receiving higher subsidies. Additional costs for LIS enrollees are also covered. Medicare subsidizes 80% of catastrophic coverage costs for drug plans. Payments are made monthly, with final reconciliation at the end of the year. Reinsurance subsidies are now the largest and fastest-growing component of Part D. Reinsurance subsidies are the largest and fastest-growing component of Part D under the Medicare Modernization Act. Risk corridors limit plan sponsors' potential losses or gains by financing higher-than-expected costs or recouping excessive profits. Allowable costs include expenses directly related to drug dispensing, excluding administrative costs, and costs for benefits beyond the Part D basic amount. The costs for Part D plans are reduced by reinsurance and low-income subsidy payments. CMS compares a plan's allowable costs to its target amount at the end of each year, sharing gains or losses within a predetermined range. Plans with higher costs must cover a percentage of the excess, with CMS covering the rest. Since 2012, CMS has widened the risk corridors for Part D plans, increasing the share of insurance risk borne by the plans. Plans with spending below certain thresholds can keep a percentage of the savings, with the rest rebated to CMS. CMS has kept the corridors at 2011 levels through the 2018 program year. CMS adjusts direct subsidy payments to plans based on actual plan experience, including beneficiary health status and enrollment data. Payments for reinsurance and low-income subsidies are compared to actual costs, with adjustments made as needed. Part D plans have tended to overestimate costs, resulting in net risk corridor payments to CMS each year. Part D plans show variation in risk-sharing, with some making significant payments to CMS. MedPAC questions if risk assessment in plan bids is adequate. Budget Control Act of 2011 reduces Medicare payments by 2%, except for reinsurance, risk-sharing, and low-income subsidy. Part D plans cannot increase beneficiary costs. The sequestration of Medicare benefit spending is scheduled to continue through FY2027, with Part D plans required to maintain access to covered drugs for all enrollees through a sufficient pharmacy network. Pharmacies willing to accept standard terms must be allowed to participate in the plan's network. Beginning in 2019, Part D plans must provide standard pharmacy contract terms and conditions by September 15 each year for contracts effective on January 1 of the following year. They must also give a copy of the standard contract to a requesting pharmacy within seven business days. Any qualified pharmacy can join a plan network, except for plans offering defined, standard coverage. In a Part D plan network, preferred pharmacies offer lower cost sharing for beneficiaries. These pharmacies may have a smaller subset of pharmacies in their network. The cost difference between preferred and nonpreferred pharmacies should not discourage enrollees from certain locations. Preferred pharmacy networks must not increase overall CMS payments to the plan. CMS requires Part D networks to have a sufficient number of pharmacies for enrollees to access covered drugs conveniently. This includes urban areas where 90% of beneficiaries should live within 2 miles of a participating pharmacy, suburban areas within 5 miles, and rural areas within 15 miles. A new definition of retail pharmacy will be implemented in 2019 to help Part D plans meet these access standards. The definition of retail pharmacy for Part D plans includes pharmacies open to the public for prescription drugs. Mail-order pharmacies can be included in networks but not for meeting retail pharmacy access requirements. Part D plans offering mail-order benefits must ensure reasonable access to the same benefits at retail pharmacies. Part D plans may designate certain pharmacies as specialty pharmacies for restricted drug distribution, with cost-based tier designation. CMS does not define specialty pharmacy, allowing plans to set their own definitions and fee structures. Part D plans can establish specialty pharmacies and networks with their own definitions and fee structures. They must provide LTC pharmacy access and offer standard LTC pharmacy network contracts to all LTC pharmacies in their service area. Part D sponsors cannot rely on out-of-network pharmacies to meet LTC convenient access standards. Part D also covers home-infusion drugs administered intravenously in a home setting. Home-infusion drugs given intravenously in a home setting must be delivered to Part D plan enrollees within 24 hours of their release from an acute care setting. Part D plans are responsible for stocking easily usable drugs, providing necessary supplies, and ensuring professional assistance for home infusion therapy. Enrollees are required to visit a pharmacy within their Part D network for these services. Part D plans must ensure adequate access to out-of-network pharmacies for enrollees in special circumstances, such as when traveling or during a federal disaster. Guidelines for out-of-network drug usage must be reasonable, with conditions like ordering maintenance drugs from a mail-order pharmacy for extended travel. Plans cannot routinely allow more than a month's supply of medication. Part D plans may not routinely allow more than a month's worth of medication to be dispensed at an out-of-network pharmacy. Enrollees may have to pay more for drugs purchased out of the plan network. Plan sponsors negotiate with pharmacies for network inclusion and reimburse them for drug costs and dispensing fees. Pharmacies set their own rates but may offer discounts to plans. Payment for claims must be made promptly according to law requirements. Part D enrollees have rights to request coverage determinations, file grievances, and appoint representatives during the appeals process. PDPs and MA-PDs must provide written information about enrollees' rights and have procedures for addressing coverage issues. Enrollees can appoint a representative to act on their behalf in coverage determinations. Physicians or prescribers can also request coverage decisions without being named representatives. Coverage determinations involve decisions on covered benefits, such as approving or denying Part D drugs. Enrollees, their representatives, or physicians can request coverage determinations for Part D drugs, including decisions on payment tiers, formulary coverage, cost-sharing levels, and prior authorization requirements. Expedited decisions can be requested for urgent cases, with a 24-hour response time if the enrollee's health is at serious risk. Expedited determination for Part D drugs must be made within 24 hours for urgent cases. If denied, a standard determination must be made within 72 hours. Failure to notify the beneficiary results in an automatic denial and appeal rights are provided in a written notice. An appeal is a request for a further review of a coverage determination, with five levels of appeals available. The first level involves a redetermination by the plan, which can be requested by the enrollee, their representative, or prescribing physician. Requests must be filed within 60 days, and expedited appeals can be requested if waiting could harm the enrollee's health. Plan sponsors must provide immediate access to the redetermination process through their websites. The sponsor must provide an enrollee or physician with a chance to present evidence for a redetermination. Results must be given within 7 days for a standard request or 72 hours for an expedited one. Plans have 14 days to respond to a standard redetermination starting in 2019. At the second level of appeal, an enrollee can request reconsideration by an Independent Review Entity (IRE) within 60 days of a redetermination. The IRE must decide within 7 days for a standard reconsideration. The IRE must make a decision within 7 days for a standard reconsideration and 72 hours for an expedited reconsideration. Plans will have 14 days to respond to a standard reconsideration starting in 2019. Medicare received 35,414 reconsideration cases in CY2016, with about 30% resulting in the plan sponsor's decision being overturned. If appeals are unfavorable, additional levels of review can be pursued, including a hearing with an administrative law judge (ALJ) at the third level. A request for an ALJ hearing must be made within 60 days of the IRE decision letter, with a minimum dollar amount required for denied coverage to qualify for the hearing. The fourth level of appeal in Medicare is the Medicare Appeals Council (MAC), where a beneficiary can request a review within 60 days of the ALJ decision. The MAC can grant or deny the request, issue a final decision, dismissal, or remand the case to the ALJ. The final appeal level is a federal district court, where a beneficiary can request a review within 60 days of the MAC decision notice if the denied coverage value meets certain criteria. To request a review by the court, the denied coverage value must meet a minimum dollar amount. Grievances are complaints other than coverage determinations, such as issues with customer service or prescription filling times. Beneficiaries have 60 days to file a complaint, and plan sponsors must respond promptly, within 24 hours for certain grievances. The Part D plan must respond to an enrollee grievance within 24 hours if it involves a refusal to grant an expedited coverage determination. Quality of care complaints may be resolved by the plan sponsor or through the QIO process, which aims to improve healthcare quality for Medicare beneficiaries. Enrollees have the right to file a QIO grievance when responding to a grievance. The Medicare Part D program is vulnerable to fraud, waste, and abuse, with examples including drug diversion and inappropriate plan denials. CMS oversees compliance and conducts various oversight activities to prevent fraud and abuse. CMS conducts routine program audits to ensure compliance with Medicare Part D requirements, including enrollment, marketing, pharmacy access, claims processing, and grievances. These audits are part of CMS's oversight strategy to prevent fraud and abuse in the program. CMS conducts routine program audits to ensure compliance with Medicare Part D requirements, including financial audits to check the accuracy of reported data by plans. These audits may identify issues such as overpayments, misrepresentation of bids, and inaccurate prescription drug event data. If problems are found, CMS may recalculate payments, issue warnings, impose penalties, or remove sponsors from the program for noncompliance. Plan sponsors are required to monitor and correct their behavior and that of their contractors to prevent fraud and abuse. Part D sponsors must have an effective compliance plan to prevent fraud and abuse, as outlined in CMS's Prescription Drug Benefit Manual. This plan includes written policies, designated compliance officers, training, communication, disciplinary guidelines, monitoring, and prompt response to offenses. Sponsors must also provide fraud, waste, and abuse training to relevant entities. CMS contracts with Health Integrity Inc. as the NBI MEDIC for Part D plans, responsible for investigating complaints, data analysis, case referrals to law enforcement, audits, and fraud prevention efforts. They collaborate with other entities like Part D sponsors, Medicare contractors, OIG, DOJ, and state agencies. Rainmakers Strategic Solutions LLC is contracted for outreach and coordination efforts. CMS has contracted with Rainmakers Strategic Solutions LLC as the Outreach and Education Medicare Drug Integrity Contractor (O&E MEDIC) to provide education on waste, fraud, and abuse. They maintain a website with relevant information. Additionally, CMS has contracted with ACLR Strategic Business Solutions for the Part D RAC audit functions to review Medicare payments and prevent improper payments. Medicare's financial operations are managed through two trust funds, the Hospital Insurance (HI) trust fund for Part A and the Supplementary Medical Insurance (SMI) trust fund for Parts B and D. SMI relies on general tax revenues and beneficiary premiums. In 2018, total Part D expenditures were around $100 billion, covering prescription drugs, Medicare payments to employer-sponsored retiree health plans, and administrative expenses. In 2018, total Part D expenditures were around $100 billion, funded by general revenues, beneficiary premiums, and state contributions. The Part D account has flexibility in using general revenues for benefit payments without requiring congressional approval, resulting in low assets that are quickly used. The Part D account is financially stable with low beneficiary premiums based on national average bid amounts. Premiums are defined annually and can be deducted from Social Security payments. Since 2011, beneficiaries with higher incomes pay income-related monthly premium adjustments in addition to their Part D plan premiums. The extra amounts are credited to the Part D trust fund account, reducing the need for general revenue funding. The additional amount paid is calculated as a percentage of the base beneficiary premium and is usually deducted from monthly Social Security payments. In CY2017, $5.0 billion in premium amounts were withheld from Social Security benefit checks or other federal benefit payments, while another $10.5 billion in premiums were paid directly to the plans by beneficiaries for the Part D program. Premiums for Part D are generally set at 25.5% of standard benefit costs, making up about 15.5% of total program revenues in 2017. General revenues are transferred from the Treasury to the Part D Account as needed to cover expenses. In CY2017, contributions from the general fund of the Treasury amounted to $73.2 billion, or about 73% of total Part D revenue. Medicaid is no longer the primary payer of drug costs for full-benefit dual-eligible beneficiaries after the availability of Part D drug coverage and low-income subsidies in 2006. States are required to pay a portion of costs to the Part D account in the SMI trust fund for this population under the \"clawback provision\" in the MMA. In CY2017, state payments for full dual-eligible drug costs amounted to $11.4 billion, or about 11.3% of Part D revenues. Actual spending for the Medicare prescription drug benefit has been lower than estimated, with expenditures of approximately $47 billion in CY2006 and close to $70 billion in CY2013. Actual spending for the Medicare prescription drug benefit was approximately $47 billion in CY2006 and nearly $70 billion in CY2013. The difference in projected and actual spending was due to lower than expected enrollment and per capita spending. Part D expenditures have increased by an average annual rate of 7.4% over the past 10 years, mainly driven by enrollment growth. Per capita expenditures increased at a slower annual rate of 3.8%, attributed to a high proportion of low-cost generic drugs and patent expirations of major drugs. In 2017, Part D per capita benefit expenditures were lower than in 2016. The Trustees noted that 2017 Part D per capita benefit expenditures were lower than in 2016, attributed to an increase in plan rebates and a reduction in hepatitis C drug spending. They expect this decline to continue in 2018. Over the next 10 years, Medicare Trustees project more rapid growth in Part D costs, with aggregate benefits increasing by 6.9% annually and per capita expenditures by 3.9% each year. This growth is due to expectations of more enrollees, changes in coverage categories, a slowing trend in generic drug utilization, and an increase in specialty drug use and prices. The Medicare Trustees project a significant increase in Part D expenditures over the next 10 years, with total spending more than doubling from $94.5 billion in 2018 to $195.3 billion in 2027. Per capita benefit expenditures are also expected to rise, from $2,057 in 2018 to $3,293 in 2027. Long-term projections show total Part D spending growing to 1.16% of GDP in 2092."
