Section 108 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 is amended to focus on micro- and small enterprise development credits. The \"Microenterprise Act\" emphasizes the importance of supporting micro- and small enterprises in developing countries through programs providing credit, training, and technical assistance. The \"Microenterprise Act\" authorizes the President to provide assistance to increase credit availability for micro- and small enterprises through loans, guarantees, training programs for lenders, and training programs for entrepreneurs. SEC. 129 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 introduces Microenterprise Development Grant Assistance. SEC. 129 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 authorizes the Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development to provide grant assistance for microenterprises in developing countries through various organizations. Approximately half of the credit assistance is designated for poverty lending programs. The Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development should support mechanisms that provide technical assistance, strengthen intermediary organizations, and share information to maximize the impact of assistance for microenterprises in developing countries, particularly targeting very poor members of society, especially women, with loans of $300 or less in 1995 USD. The Administrator should establish a monitoring system with performance goals and indicators for assistance to enhance sustainable development impact, especially for the very poor, particularly poor women. Passed the House of Representatives on July 29, 1996. Attest: ROBIN H. CARLE, Clerk."
