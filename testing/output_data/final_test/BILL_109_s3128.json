The National Uniformity for Food Act of 2006 allows states to enforce policies based on identical requirements in state law to federal law. If the Secretary rejects a proposal for regulation or guidance, states cannot enforce any requirements that were rejected.

States can establish requirements to address imminent health hazards if certain conditions are met. The State must enforce requirements within 30 days of establishment, and the Secretary must take final agency action on petitions within 7 days. Failure to comply can lead to judicial review.
