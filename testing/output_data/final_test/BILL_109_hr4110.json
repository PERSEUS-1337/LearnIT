    "content": "The \"American Parity Act of 2005\" is the short title of this Act. The Administration has requested and received funds for ongoing multibillion dollar reconstruction for Iraq. Approximately $21 billion was appropriated to the Iraq Relief and Reconstruction Fund in fiscal year 2003 and 2004. The total projected cost of reconstruction through 2007 is $55 billion. The President has requested funding for fiscal year 2006 to be appropriated to traditional foreign aid accounts, making the total cost of reconstruction less predictable. The Iraq Relief and Reconstruction Fund has allocated resources for education, including rehabilitating schools, training teachers, distributing school supplies, and providing internet access. Additionally, resources have been allocated for medical science. The Iraq Relief and Reconstruction Fund has allocated resources for medical science, including providing potable water, vaccinating children and pregnant women, giving vitamin A supplements, renovating health care centers, and training health educators and community leaders. The Iraq Relief and Reconstruction Fund has allocated resources for infrastructure development, including completing major bridges, constructing new railroad tracks, rehabilitating water systems, refurbishing water treatment plants, and conducting marshland restoration activities. The President's budget has eliminated or reduced domestic spending in various areas, including cutting education programs, reducing student loans, cutting Medicaid, reducing health professions training, cutting funding for Amtrak and the Clean Water State Revolving Fund, and suspending Army Corps of Engineers projects. State and local governments in the United States are facing financial difficulties as funding for infrastructure and social services is being cut. They deserve the same level of federal investment as relief and reconstruction funds provided to Iraq. SEC. 3. FORMULA GRANTS TO STATES AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. The Secretary of the Treasury will provide grants to States and local governments for priority expenditures, including education, public safety, public health, social services, infrastructure, and housing. The Secretary of the Treasury will allocate grants based on factors like unemployment rate, duration of unemployment, median income, population, and poverty rate. At least one-third of the funds will be made available to local governments. The amount appropriated under subsection (f) is available to local governments under State laws. Grants can only be made if the application is submitted to the Secretary in the required form and contains necessary information. An authorization of appropriation is made for fiscal year 2007 to the Secretary for grants, separate from other amounts allocated for Iraq reconstruction. The sentence is an additional appropriation for payments to States and local governments, separate from other funds allocated for Iraq reconstruction."
