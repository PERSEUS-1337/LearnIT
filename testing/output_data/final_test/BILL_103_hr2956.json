    "content": "The \"School Lunch Protection Act of 1993\" may be cited as the short title for this Act. Congress finds an alarming number of instances of price-fixing and bid-rigging in food purchases for school lunch and breakfast programs. The Antitrust Division has filed numerous criminal cases related to bid-rigging conspiracies and similar activities involving dairy products sold to schools or the Department of Defense. Multiple grand juries in States are also investigating these activities. Multiple corporations and individuals have been convicted of price-fixing and bid-rigging in the dairy industry, with fines totaling around $100,000,000. The Secretary of Agriculture has not taken action against convicted companies and individuals participating in school meal programs. Educational and monitoring programs can help reduce such illegal activities. Reducing price-fixing and bid-rigging in school meal programs can save millions of dollars annually. Bid-rigging awareness training is effective in deterring collusion. The Comptroller General's report addresses concerns about bid rigging in the school lunch program. SEC. 25. DUTIES OF THE SECRETARY RELATING TO ANTICOMPETITIVE ACTIVITIES. The National School Lunch Act is amended to include new responsibilities for the Secretary regarding anticompetitive activities. The Secretary is required to provide advice, training, and guidance on preventing anticompetitive activities in acquiring commodities for various food programs. The Secretary must cooperate with authorities on investigations of anticompetitive activities related to acquiring commodities for food programs, provide training and guidance on detecting bid-rigging and price-fixing, and have the authority to debar or suspend individuals involved in such activities. The Secretary may request assistance from the food service management institute to carry out duties related to food programs. The authority provided by this section will terminate on September 30, 1999. SEC. 4. NONPROCUREMENT DEBARMENT. The National School Lunch Act is amended by adding a new section for nonprocurement debarment. The Secretary can debar a person, and their affiliates, from supplying products to schools participating in certain programs if convicted of wrongdoing related to supplying products to schools. If convicted of certain offenses related to supplying products to schools, a person and their affiliates can be debarred for at least 3 years from supplying products to any authority, school district consortium, or Federal agency. The Secretary may waive a debarment if it would negatively impact competition, interfere with procurement for school programs, or be unfair to innocent parties. The Secretary may waive debarment if it would harm competition, school procurement, or innocent parties. Debarment does not limit government agencies or courts from penalizing individuals in civil or criminal actions. Regulations will be issued to implement this section. The Secretary of Agriculture shall amend regulations to conform with the National School Lunch Act. The Secretary will advise Congress on a consistent debarment policy within 120 days of the Act's enactment. The Secretary of Agriculture will advise Congress on a consistent debarment policy regarding Federal financial and nonfinancial assistance and benefits under Federal programs and activities. The Secretary's authority to debar or suspend individuals from such assistance shall not be reduced by this section. The Secretary may debar or suspend a person from Federal assistance based on specified causes in regulations. SEC. 26 of the National School Lunch Act requires the Secretary to provide Congress with information on the administration of nonprocurement debarment and duties related to anticompetitive activities, upon request."
