On December 17, 2010, the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation reported S. 3597 (amended), which includes a provision for identifying critical habitat areas for Coast Guard routing to reduce oil spill risks. On December 10, 2010, the same committee reported S. 1748 (amended) to establish a research program for the recovery of the southern sea otter. The 1973 Endangered Species Act (ESA) is crucial for protecting endangered and threatened species facing possible extinction. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) is controversial due to habitat loss caused by various factors like development, climate change, and invasive species. The law's strict provisions impact federal and nonfederal lands, leading to debates on balancing economic, political, and social interests with species protection. Despite strong support and opposition, the ESA has not been reauthorized. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) has not been reauthorized since 1992 due to strong support and opposition. Congressional efforts in the 110th and 111th Congresses focused on addressing specific controversial features of ESA and oversight concerns. The 1973 ESA aimed to protect species at risk of extinction and their habitats. Species can be listed as endangered or threatened under ESA based on the risk of extinction. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) provides flexible management for threatened species and lists distinct population segments as threatened or endangered. Some populations of salmon in certain states are listed under ESA, while others in Alaska are not. Legal tools are available for species recovery and habitat protection under ESA, administered by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Marine Fisheries Service. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) is managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Marine Fisheries Service. As of November 16, 2010, there were 1,163 animal species and 796 plant species listed as endangered or threatened under the ESA. Majority of these species occur in the United States and its territories, with 83% covered in active recovery plans. 43.8% of U.S. species have designated critical habitat. In FY2009, federal and state expenditures on endangered and threatened species totaled $1,470,755,607, with federal agencies reporting $1,391,246,409 and states reporting $79,509,198. Top species with highest expenditures included steelhead, Pacific salmon, pallid sturgeon, bull trout, and red-cockaded woodpecker. Conservationists focus on ecosystems rather than individual species, as species evolve and fluctuate due to interactions with other species and the environment. Protection and recovery efforts for listed species can be controversial. Listed species are controversial, often serving as indicators of larger resource scarcity and ecosystem issues. Past debates include conflicts over water storage, timber harvest, and water allocation among various users. Species can be listed by the appropriate Secretary or through petition. The Secretary must decide whether to list a species based on scientific information and public participation. Economic effects are not considered in the decision, but may be taken into account for post-listing assistance. FWS and NMFS may identify candidate species at risk. As of November 16, 2010, almost 44% of listed domestic species had critical habitat (CH) designated by FWS. However, CH has not been designated for most species due to resource allocation preferences for listing new species. The FWS consistently loses legal challenges for failing to designate critical habitat (CH) for species. Courts have found the regulation in question to be an erroneous interpretation of the law. Scientists have shown that CH designation enhances species recovery. The Keystone Center's ESA Working Group on Habitat released a report on habitat protection and ESA, concluding that identifying species' required habitat for recovery is better done during recovery planning. The duty to avoid adverse modification of critical habitat (CH) is enforceable for federal agencies and actions, but may impact private landowners only with a federal nexus. Private landowners may face additional procedures and restrictions due to ESA-listed species, but CH designation is not a direct restriction on their authority. In the 111th Congress, S. 3597 proposed prioritizing CH designated under ESA for Coast Guard routing or navigational measures. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) prioritizes risk areas for Coast Guard routing to prevent oil spills and damage to natural resources. The ESA prohibits the \"take\" of endangered species, with penalties for violations. Controversy exists over habitat modification restrictions, with civil and criminal penalties for violations. FWS and NMFS do not initiate permitting processes; agencies and individuals must contact FWS to avoid ESA violations. The permitting process under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) requires consultation with FWS or NMFS to avoid violations. Federal agencies must ensure actions do not harm endangered species or critical habitat. Consultation with the appropriate Secretary is necessary to review potential impacts on listed species and critical habitat. Federal agencies must consult with the appropriate Secretary to review potential impacts on listed species and critical habitat. The Secretary may suggest alternatives to avoid harm and issue a biological opinion allowing incidental take of species under certain conditions. If jeopardy cannot be avoided, an exemption may be sought from the Endangered Species Committee for the action. The appropriate Secretary may issue permits under Section 10(a) of ESA for actions without a federal nexus, allowing incidental take of species. Applicants must submit a habitat conservation plan showing impact, mitigation steps, funding, alternatives considered, and other required measures. Final regulations published in 2008 allow federal agencies to independently assess harm to ESA-listed species in some cases, eliminating consultation with FWS and/or NMFS scientists. Critics questioned the 2008 regulations allowing federal agencies to independently assess harm to ESA-listed species, fearing it gave too much discretion. A lawsuit was filed, leading to the revocation of the rule in April 2009. In Congress, H.R. 5192 aimed to streamline biological assessments for ESA compliance. The GAO reported in May 2009 that FWS lacks a systematic approach to Section 7 consultations. The GAO report found that FWS lacks a systematic method for tracking monitoring reports in BiOps and compliance with reporting requirements. FWS also lacks a systematic approach for tracking cumulative take of listed species and relies on individual biologists for compliance information. The Endangered Species Committee (ESC) can grant exemptions for federal actions that may jeopardize a species, with the requirement that applicants pay for mitigation. The Endangered Species Committee (ESC) can grant exemptions for federal actions that may jeopardize a species. Only one exemption has been granted and carried out so far. The committee must accept the President's determination on an exemption in declared disaster areas and grant an exemption if the Secretary of Defense deems it necessary for national security. The Department of Defense has not requested any exemptions to date. Other statutes may provide waivers of ESA provisions. Statutes and authorities can provide waivers for ESA provisions, allowing for expedited construction of barriers and roads at borders. The Secretary of Homeland Security has the authority to waive ESA for this purpose. Emergency provisions in ESA apply when a species is in danger, with shortened timelines for listing species in emergencies posing significant risks to species' wellbeing. The Emergency provisions of the Endangered Species Act (ESA) allow for expedited construction of barriers and roads at borders, with waivers provided for ESA provisions. The best available scientific and commercial data must be used, and a shortened period for obtaining an exemption or permit is available in cases where the health or life of an endangered animal is threatened with no reasonable alternative. Hurricane-related federal activities in disaster areas trigger emergency consultation provisions of ESA. Legislation in the 111th Congress aimed to require consultation with the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Commerce in emergencies declared by state governors. H.R. 1914 proposed amending the Endangered Species Act to allow for temporary exemptions during emergencies, such as droughts, for actions necessary to address the impact of the emergency. Recovery plans for listed species are developed by the appropriate Secretary to guide survival and conservation efforts, but are not binding on federal agencies or others. Species with recovery plans are reported to Congress every two years. Recovery plans for listed species are reported to Congress every two years. A 1988 amendment prohibited favoring specific taxonomic groups. FWS published guidance in 2008 on using a crediting framework to offset adverse effects on listed species by beneficial actions elsewhere. This allows federal agencies to create conservation \"banks\" by paying private landowners to conserve species, offsetting activities that could harm species on public land. Critics question the accountability of this trade-off. The federal government may acquire land to conserve or recover listed species, and ESA authorizes money from the Land and Water Conservation Fund for land acquisition. The appropriate Secretary must cooperate with states in conserving protected species and enter into cooperative agreements to assist states in their endangered species programs. States may receive federal funds with a minimum 25% match for implementing the program under a cooperative agreement. The Cooperative Endangered Species Conservation Fund provides state grants, with an annual authorization level specified. The Fund was created to provide state grants for endangered species conservation. Spending from the fund requires annual appropriation and there are provisions for exemptions, regulation of subsistence activities, and control of trade in endangered species. ESA is the domestic legislation for international agreements on wildlife preservation. CITES, signed by the United States in 1940, categorizes species based on extinction risk and trade impact. ESA enforces CITES violations within U.S. jurisdiction and regulates import/export with exceptions. Both laws combat illegal wildlife trade worth over $10 billion annually, impacting species decline and disease spread. House Committee on Natural Resources in the 110th Congress addressed effects of illegal wildlife trade on endangered species. The FWS's Multinational Species Conservation Fund supports conservation efforts for endangered species like tigers, rhinoceroses, elephants, marine turtles, and great apes. The 111th Congress authorized a semi-postal stamp for this fund but did not pass bills related to international endangered species protection. The House and Senate held hearings and passed bills related to the Multinational Species Conservation Fund, including creating funds for Great Cats, Rare Canids, and Cranes. Additionally, a resolution was proposed to express the House's stance on US policy. The House and Senate passed bills related to the Multinational Species Conservation Fund, creating funds for Great Cats, Rare Canids, and Cranes. Resolutions were proposed to express the House's stance on US policy at the 2010 Conference of the Parties of CITES and to support international tiger conservation efforts. The Senate Committee on Foreign Relations reported on S.Res. 680 (amended) on December 20, 2010. The Endangered Species Act aims for species recovery, with 47 species delisted in 37 years for reasons including recovery, extinction, and original data errors. Notable recovered species include the American alligator, bald eagle, and brown pelican. The Endangered Species Act aims for species recovery, with 47 species delisted in 37 years for reasons including recovery, extinction, and original data errors. Recovered species include the American alligator, bald eagle, brown pelican, peregrine falcon, and three species of kangaroo. Extinct species include the dusky seaside sparrow, Guam broadbill, and two small fish living in desert springs. It can be challenging to prove whether rare species are extinct or simply hard to find. Only 9 species have been delisted due to extinction, while habitat loss and invasive species continue to threaten species. The Endangered Species Act has led to the recovery of several species, with 35 species downlisted from endangered to threatened. Some species like red wolves and California condors may not exist without ESA protection. A report on the Act's implementation was released in 2005. The oversight report \"Implementation of the Endangered Species Act of 1973\" critiqued the measurement of recovery in species. A 2005 study by the Government Accountability Office found that funding allocation for species recovery is influenced by factors other than priority ranking, with no routine assessment process in place. In 2006, GAO examined federal efforts to recover 31 selected species and found that recovery plans played a crucial role in the recovery of most species. Critics questioned the bias of the study. A 2008 GAO study revealed that some recommendations to strengthen ESA implementation had not been implemented by federal agencies, such as clarifying the role of critical habitat and assessing expenditures on species. The ESA reauthorization has been a legislative agenda since 1992. In the 111th Congress, proposed revisions to Section 7 consultation regulations were issued by FWS and NMFS. The final version was published in December 2008 but was withdrawn in May 2009. The revisions aimed to streamline the consultation process. The revised regulations give agencies more discretion in determining consultation requirements, clarify definitions, and make procedural changes. They also address climate change by stating that consultation on greenhouse gas emissions' impact on species is not required. Critics argue that Critical Habitat designation burdens landowners with little conservation benefit, while others believe FWS and NMFS misinterpret and fail to enforce the statute. Disagreements exist on the value and timing of Critical Habitat designation. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) requires determinations of a species' status to be based on the best available scientific and commercial data. Controversies have arisen in cases such as the Florida panther, Klamath River Basin suckers and coho salmon, gray wolf, and Sonoran Desert bald eagles. Critics argue that the science supporting ESA actions is sometimes insufficient or mishandled. Many rare species facing extinction are understudied due to difficulty in locating them or lack of resources for research. Some suggest considerations other than species conservation should prevail when dealing with species of little known economic importance. The Endangered Species Act emphasizes the importance of using the best available scientific data to protect and recover species, even if complete data is lacking. The FWS/NMFS Endangered Species Consultation Handbook advises giving the benefit of the doubt to species when making prompt decisions based on available information. The Endangered Species Act emphasizes using the best available scientific data to protect species, giving the benefit of the doubt to species when making decisions based on available information. Section 515 of P.L. 106-554 directs the Office of Management and Budget to issue government-wide guidelines. The Office of Management and Budget issued government-wide guidelines to ensure quality information dissemination by federal agencies. The Department of the Interior and FWS have additional guidelines for seeking information correction. FWS and NMFS have a policy for using information from various sources under the Endangered Species Act. Agency biologists are required to impartially review and evaluate a wide range of information for various purposes under the Endangered Species Act. They must ensure that the information used is reliable, credible, and represents the best scientific and commercial data available. Managers are also tasked with verifying and assuring the quality of the science used in official positions and decisions. The Endangered Species Act requires agencies to use reliable and credible science for official decisions. Expert opinions and peer reviews are solicited to ensure the best available biological and commercial information is considered. Independent peer reviews can be used to reduce scientific uncertainty. Agencies are not required to conduct studies for missing data but must consider all available biological information, especially the most current data. The Endangered Species Act mandates agencies to use reliable science for decisions, including peer reviews to reduce uncertainty. Agencies must consider all available biological data, not waiting until a species is near extinction. Judicial review ensures decisions are not arbitrary or capricious. In Arizona Cattle Growers Association v. United States Fish and Wildlife Service, the court emphasized that FWS must provide scientific evidence to justify regulations related to species decline. The agency must show a species is present in an area before regulating it and establish a causal connection between land use and harm to the species. Mere speculation is not enough, and the agency must articulate a rational connection between facts and decisions made. Environmental groups are considering the Endangered Species Act due to the lack of federal action on climate change. Environmental groups are considering using the Endangered Species Act to restrict greenhouse gas emissions in the absence of federal regulatory action on climate change. The Center for Biological Diversity is leading the effort to list animals affected by climate change as endangered or threatened, potentially forcing sources of greenhouse gas emissions to negotiate permits with limiting terms. The Endangered Species Act may require federal agencies to consult on permits for greenhouse gas sources due to potential harm to listed species. Challenges include determining the causal link between emissions and habitat harm. The Act offers tools like special rules for threatened species. The listing of the polar bear in 2008 brought these mechanisms to the forefront. The listing of the polar bear in 2008 brought Section 7, Section 9, and 4(d)-rule mechanisms to the forefront. The exclusion in the 4(d) rule allows for incidental taking of polar bears, and FWS argued that there is no established causal connection between GHG emissions and impacts on polar bears or their habitat. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service proposed protecting over 200,000 square miles of critical habitat for polar bears along the Alaska coast. The 111th Congress authorized the Secretary of the Interior to withdraw or reissue a special rule for polar bear protections. Several bills related to climate change and endangered species were considered but not enacted, including funding for endangered species programs and adaptation to climate change. The 111th Congress considered several bills related to climate change and endangered species, including H.R. 2454 and S. 1733. H.R. 1054 / S. 1395 aimed to allow imports of polar bear trophies taken before the species was listed as threatened. H.R. 5379 sought to delist the polar bear as a threatened species, while S. 724 aimed to amend the Endangered Species Act. Efforts to amend the Endangered Species Act included bills that would have prohibited considering global climate change and greenhouse gases in determining species status. Conservation of species and habitats faces challenges due to dwindling open space and increasing human populations, leading to conflicts between public values and economic interests. Controversy arose in 2001 when the Bureau of Reclamation decided not to release water from the Klamath irrigation project, impacting farm and pasture lands. The change aimed to benefit endangered fish species, leading to conflicts among various stakeholders including tribes, fishermen, farmers, and environmentalists. Upstream farmers argue for their water rights, while others emphasize the importance of the downstream salmon fishery. The controversy surrounding the Bureau of Reclamation's decision not to release water from the Klamath irrigation project in 2001 has led to conflicts among stakeholders. Some argue for water rights for farmers, while others prioritize the downstream salmon fishery. The issue revolves around operating the Bureau's project facilities to meet irrigation obligations without harming the listed fish species. Criticisms and defenses of operation plans and biological assessments have been raised, with allegations of political intervention influencing decisions. A draft agreement was negotiated by 29 Klamath River stakeholders and signed on September 30, 2009, to address conflicting water management objectives, including removal of four dams that block salmon and steelhead from historic spawning areas. Parties seek legislative support from Congress for salmon protection in the Pacific Northwest, facing challenges due to recent droughts and the connection between hydropower facilities and fishery management decisions. NMFS officials are working with various stakeholders to protect 26 distinct population segments of Pacific salmon and steelhead trout listed as threatened or endangered. Recent controversies and litigation have focused on three issues related to the recovery of Pacific salmon: BiOps on operation of dams on the Columbia and Snake Rivers, inclusion of hatchery-produced salmon in listed ESUs, and the role of CH designation. In 2007, NMFS's hatchery listing policy was ruled invalid by a federal court. The federal district court for Oregon invalidated NMFS's approach to evaluating jeopardy to salmon from dam operations on the Columbia and Snake Rivers, ordering increased spills of water to assist juvenile salmon transit to the sea. The Obama Administration is reviewing federal salmon and water management options for the Columbia River Basin before the federal court decides on the most recent BiOp. In the 111th Congress, P.L. 111-11 authorized the San Joaquin River Restoration Settlement for Chinook salmon reintroduction. The House Committee on Natural Resources held an oversight hearing on the California drought and its impacts on lands, fisheries, and water users. In the 111th Congress, several measures were introduced but not enacted to address impacts on lands, fisheries, and water users, including H.R. 1672 and S. 668. These measures aimed to assist in identifying local implications and strategies for the recovery of Puget Sound salmon. Additionally, S. 817 and H.R. 2055 proposed establishing a Salmon Stronghold Partnership program to protect wild Pacific salmon. In the 111th Congress, measures were introduced to address impacts on lands, fisheries, and water users. H.R. 3794, H.R. 3999, and H.R. 3503 focused on sustainable water management in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, ESA consultations on the Central Valley Project, and federal salmon recovery efforts. Delta smelt, a threatened species, is found in the San Francisco Bay and Sacramento-San Joaquin Rivers Delta. The delta smelt, once abundant, was listed as threatened under ESA in 1993. Its abundance has since declined due to factors like entrainment in water pumps, competition from exotic fish, contaminants, habitat changes, and food supply alterations. The decline has significant consequences for water projects in California. The primary cause of the decline is debated, with some pointing to water pump entrainment and others suggesting a combination of factors. The decline of delta smelt is largely attributed to habitat changes caused by water pumps. Changes in pump operations may be necessary to meet ESA requirements, potentially leading to reduced pumping and less water for users. In 2004, the Bureau of Reclamation issued a biological assessment for increased pumping, triggering an ESA Section 7 consultation with FWS. Initially, a no-jeopardy BiOp was issued in 2004, but in 2007, it was found to be non-compliant with ESA regarding delta smelt. Consultation was reinitiated in 2007 based on new information. In 2007, the Bureau and FWS reinitiated consultation due to new information on the delta smelt. Interim protective measures were implemented, and a revised BiOp was issued in December 2008. FWS determined that water project operations in the Bay-Delta could jeopardize the delta smelt's existence. RPAs were outlined to protect the delta smelt's life stages and critical habitat. In the 111th Congress, H.R. 856 proposed support for a fish hatchery program and exemptions for pumping plants. H.R. 2977, H.R. 3105, and H.R. 3999 proposed measures related to water management in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, California. These bills aimed to address restrictions on water exports and initiate ESA consultations on the Central Valley Project and the California State Water Project. ESA regulations at 50 C.F.R. Section 402.30 and Section 402.40 were referenced as counterpart regulations. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued counterpart pesticide regulations under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) to determine potential adverse effects on listed species without consulting the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS). However, a federal court overturned these regulations in 2006 for not aligning with the Endangered Species Act (ESA). The court overturned regulations that did not align with the Endangered Species Act, allowing federal agencies to adopt EPA effects determinations. The National Fire Plan counterpart regulations eliminate the need for informal consultation with FWS or NMFS for actions deemed \"not likely to adversely affect\" listed species. The District Court held that the Alternative Consultation Agreement did not bypass ESA Section 7. The court upheld the Alternative Consultation Agreement, stating it did not bypass ESA Section 7. Reports found deficiencies in projects reviewed by NMFS and FWS. H.R. 585 in the 111th Congress aimed to assess the impact of the Healthy Forests Restoration Act on ESA protection. Economic frustrations arise from prohibitions in Sections 9 and 7 of the ESA. Conflicts between ESA and property owners arise due to concerns about property \"taking\" without just compensation under the Fifth Amendment. The Supreme Court struggles to define government actions that constitute a \"taking,\" typically involving a permanent physical occupation or total elimination of economic use. A three-factor balancing test is used when regulations impact only part of a property's use or value. The balancing test is used to determine if a taking has occurred, requiring severe property impact. Court decisions on ESA restrictions show most cases do not constitute a taking, involving issues like timber cutting, water delivery, and endangered species protection. Some claims failed due to procedural issues or lack of ripeness. Court decisions on ESA restrictions often reject claims due to insufficient economic impact on the property or the government not being responsible for wild animal actions. One decision favored a property owner regarding water diversion for fish, but another decision was overturned. The latter ruling stated that water rights holders are likely to win a taking claim if the government cannot prove that state water laws did not give the plaintiff the right to divert water. The government must prove that state water laws did not grant the plaintiff the right to be free from water diversion. Critics suggest amending the ESA to provide compensation for property impacts. Opponents argue against a specific compensation standard, stating that property rights are not absolute. In the 111th Congress, P.L. 111-11 extended authorizations for endangered fish recovery programs. Senate designated \"Endangered Species Day\" and \"American Eagle Day.\" Other measures related to ESA were introduced but not enacted. The 111th Congress extended authorizations for endangered fish recovery programs and designated \"Endangered Species Day\" and \"American Eagle Day.\" Legislation was introduced to improve federal renewable energy permit coordination and establish regional offices for oil and gas project permits. Amendments were proposed to maintain funding for fish recovery programs through FY2023. The House and Senate committees reported and passed bills related to land patents for desert tortoise recovery and renewable energy permits coordination. The Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources reported a bill on August 5, 2010 regarding special navigational measures to reduce the risk of oil spills and damage to natural resources. Additionally, there were provisions in various bills related to ESA compliance for oil and gas exploration, as well as a research program for the recovery of the southern sea otter. The House and Senate introduced bills to promote international whale conservation, protect the gray wolf, and amend the Endangered Species Act. Several bills were introduced to amend the Endangered Species Act, including removing portions of the Rocky Mountain gray wolf from the list of threatened and endangered species. Other bills aimed to establish a Center for International Wildlife Recovery Partnerships and release water from the Ruedi Reservoir for endangered fish habitat in the Colorado River. Several bills were introduced to amend the Endangered Species Act, including identifying wildlife disease emergencies, studying water management in the Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint River System, enabling federal agencies to rescue species during construction, informing consumers about power administration costs for protecting endangered species, and providing a tax credit in the Internal Revenue Code. Several bills were introduced to amend the Endangered Species Act, including providing a tax credit to individuals for protecting habitats, establishing habitat mitigation zones in the California Desert Conservation Area, conducting aerial assessments of sea turtle populations, restricting military exemptions for taking ESA-listed species, increasing protection for bear species, and expressing support for the International Year of Biodiversity. Appropriations play a crucial role in funding listing, recovery activities, and consultations related to the ESA. The Obama Administration's budget request for FY2011 included $280 million for FWS endangered species programs, slightly less than the previous year. The House Natural Resources Subcommittee held an oversight hearing on the budget, as FWS funding for FY2011 was under a continuing resolution. The House and Senate Committees recommended appropriations for FWS endangered species programs in FY2010, with the House proposing over $283 million and the Senate recommending over $276 million. The House recommendation was higher than the FY2009 enacted level and the Administration request, while the Senate recommendation was lower than the House's proposal. The Senate passed H.R. 2996 (amended) on September 24, 2009, and a conference report was filed on October 28, 2009, recommending about $281 million for FWS endangered species programs for FY2010. President Obama signed H.R. 2996 into law as P.L. 111-88 on October 30, 2009. Earlier in the 111th Congress, P.L. 111-8 provided over $248 million for FWS's ESA programs. Funding for NMFS ESA programs is included in a budget line item for \"protected species research and management.\" The Obama Administration requested $210 million for NMFS protected species programs in the FY2011 budget. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended over $213 million for NMFS protected species programs, which is a 4.7% increase from the FY2010 appropriation. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended $9.68 million more than the FY2010 appropriation and $3.38 million more than the FY2011 Administration request for NMFS. Operating under a continuing resolution, NMFS was allowed to continue funding at FY2010 levels through March 4, 2011."
