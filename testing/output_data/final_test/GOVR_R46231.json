Efforts have been made to reduce fuel consumption, support U.S. vehicle manufacturing, and address environmental concerns. Incentives and grant programs have expired since 2010, with new legislative options proposed. Congressional interests include reducing reliance on foreign petroleum, promoting domestic manufacturing, and encouraging rural development. The electric car was first created in the early 1800s as a quiet and easy-to-use electrified buggy. Electric cars were first created in the early 1800s as a quiet and easy-to-drive alternative to gasoline- and steam-powered vehicles. By the early 1900s, they accounted for one-third of cars on the road but became obsolete due to the availability of gasoline fueling stations and the dominance of the affordable Model T. In the late 20th century, concerns over environmental impact led to a renewed interest in electric vehicles. The late 20th-century concerns over environmental impact sparked renewed interest in electric vehicles (EVs) to reduce petroleum consumption in transportation. Support for EV deployment includes federal and state policies like manufacturing rebates, tax credits, research funding, and fuel economy standards like CAFE and EPA emissions standards. The EPA and NHTSA established standards for greenhouse gas emissions from motor vehicles under the Clean Air Act. The National Program for model years 2021-2026 is currently under reconsideration. The Toyota Prius and General Motors' EV-1 were among the first contemporary hybrid-electric and all-electric vehicles. The DOE supported research and development of EV technology, leading to the emergence of electric vehicles like the Chevrolet Volt, Nissan Leaf, and Tesla's all-electric vehicles. The DOE supported research and development of EV technology, leading to the emergence of electric vehicles like the Chevrolet Volt, Nissan Leaf, and Tesla's all-electric vehicles. EV sales increased from 275,000 to 705,000 from 2010 to 2018, making up 4.2% of all new light-duty vehicles sales in 2018 in the United States. Charging infrastructure has also grown in response to rising electric vehicle ownership. In 2018, worldwide sales of new plug-in electric vehicles totaled 2.0 million, with 362,000 sold in the United States, making up 2.1% of all new vehicle sales. Including hybrid-electric vehicles, EV sales totaled 705,000, accounting for 4.2% of new light-duty vehicle sales. Vehicle electrification aims to reduce emissions by decreasing the use of petroleum products. In 2017, transportation sector emissions reached 1,866 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent, with light-duty vehicles contributing 59% of total emissions. Other sectors showed reductions in carbon dioxide emissions by improving energy efficiency and reducing coal and petroleum consumption. In the electricity generation sector, emissions decreased as natural gas and renewable energy replaced coal consumption. Electric vehicles (EVs) are powered by electric motors and lithium-ion battery packs, different from lead-acid batteries in traditional vehicles. EVs can act as generators, with different categories including hybrids, plug-ins, and all-electric vehicles. Internal combustion engine vehicles are common in the transportation sector, but EVs are becoming more prevalent. Internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs) are the most common passenger vehicles on the road, relying on petroleum-based fuel for power. ICEVs have over 100 moving parts in the powertrain, with some models achieving up to 39 miles per gallon fuel efficiency. Hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) are similar to ICEVs but have higher fuel economy due to a traction battery pack and electric motor. Once running, HEVs supplement gasoline with electric power. Hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) use gasoline to start the engine, but supplement power with an electric motor and battery. They are more fuel efficient than internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs), achieving up to 58 mpg. Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) can charge their battery pack externally, allowing for electric-only operation over a certain range. PHEVs require more electricity and larger batteries for extended electric driving. Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) require up to 42 kWh of electricity storage capacity, offering higher fuel economy of up to 133 mpge. They can operate in parallel or series configurations, with the internal combustion engine generating electricity for the battery. On the other hand, battery-electric vehicles (AEVs) run solely on electricity stored in a large battery pack of up to 100 kWh, requiring external charging. Regenerative braking alone is insufficient for AEVs. AEVs offer the highest fuel economy ratings, up to 136 mpge, and do not use gasoline or have an internal combustion engine. Manufacturing shift towards AEVs may disrupt parts manufacturing and maintenance in the automotive industry. Charging batteries in plug-in electric vehicles takes hours using a standard residential outlet, affecting consumer acceptance of EVs. Consumer acceptance of EVs is influenced by the time it takes to charge compared to filling up a gas tank. Charging options include Level 1 at 120 volts AC, Level 2 at 240 volts AC, and Level 3 (DC fast charging) at 500 volts DC. Most EVs come with a Level 1 cordset with a standard plug for easy charging at home. Level 3 charging offers the highest voltages and fastest charging rates, but is not available for residential installation and can only be accessed at charging stations. Different EV manufacturers use different Level 3 connectors and charge ports, such as CHAdeMO, SAE combined charging system (CCS), and Tesla Supercharger. Level 3 charging is not available for residential installation and can only be accessed at charging stations. Fast charging may impact battery longevity in plug-in electric vehicles, but EVs in 2019 are equipped with systems to address capacity loss, such as cooling systems and battery management systems. Researchers are working on improving fast charging while mitigating potential impacts. Since the 1990s, EV technology and infrastructure have grown, impacting air emissions. Factors affecting emissions reduction and benefits include driving and charging habits. Emissions include greenhouse gases and pollutants contributing to air quality issues, divided into upstream and downstream emissions. Upstream emissions relate to fuel extraction and production, while downstream emissions occur during vehicle use. Charging plug-in EVs and operating PHEVs and AEVs produce emissions, impacted by electricity sources, charging patterns, and vehicle efficiency. Electricity generation in the US has decreased greenhouse gas emissions since 1990 despite increased demand. Since 1990, US greenhouse gas emissions from electricity generation have decreased by 4.8%, despite increased demand. Regional variations in emissions depend on the mix of fuel sources used. Charging plug-in EVs in states like Washington, with a high percentage of hydropower, results in lower emissions compared to states like Hawaii, where oil is the primary source. Emissions also vary based on the time of day and year when charging takes place. An increase in electricity demand from charging electric vehicles (EVs) may require additional generation, leading to a shift in electricity generation sources. Batteries are a crucial component of EVs, impacting the overall vehicle market's material requirements. As EVs gain market share, there is a shift from fuels to minerals and materials for battery production. UBS estimated increased global demand for battery materials like lithium, cobalt, and graphite for a fleet of all-electric vehicles. Conversely, the lightweight body preferred by EV manufacturers is expected to decrease global demand for materials like iron. The shift to electric vehicles is expected to decrease global demand for iron and steel in favor of aluminum. Electric vehicle batteries require a steady supply of minerals and raw materials, manufacturing capabilities, and end-of-life management through recycling. These batteries can last at least eight years in a vehicle, with strategies in place to extend their usable life. The useable life of EV batteries can be extended through reconditioning and repurposing for stationary energy storage systems. Recycling materials from batteries for new uses is also possible, but currently less than 5% of lithium-ion batteries are being recycled. Efforts to improve recycling rates, such as the DOE's Battery Recycling Prize and investment in the Lithium Battery R&D Recycling Center, may help. Federal policies impact the purchase and use of EVs, with vehicle manufacturers using EV sales to meet standards for Corporate Average Fuel Economy. Federal policies impact the purchase and use of electric vehicles (EVs), with programs like the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) and Clean Air Act (CAA) setting standards for automakers. The Safe Affordable Fuel-Efficient (SAFE) Vehicles Rule may lead to changes in these standards. Various programs, such as the Clean Cities Program, promote research and development of EV technologies. Additionally, federal programs during the 116th Congress aim to incentivize EV production and purchase through service and tax credit incentives. The CAFE Program establishes a credit system for automakers selling alternative fuel vehicles to promote production and sale, providing flexibility to comply with fuel economy standards. Credits are unlimited for dedicated vehicles and phased out for dual-fueled vehicles after 2019. Proposed regulatory action in 2018 may change the program for model years 2021 and beyond. The HOV Lane Exemption allows certain alternative fuel vehicles to be exempt from HOV lane requirements until September 30, 2025. States can also allow low-emissions vehicles to pay a toll for HOV lane access, but this authority expired on September 30, 2019. The National Alternative Fuels Corridor directs the Department of Transportation to designate locations for electric vehicle charging and fueling infrastructure by the end of 2020. The Plug-In Electric Vehicle Tax Credit offers up to $7,500 per vehicle and is phasing out for automakers who have sold 200,000 qualifying vehicles. Several bills in Congress may impact existing policies and incentives for electric vehicles. The bills in the 116th Congress aim to expand tax credits for plug-in electric vehicles, increase rebate programs for charging infrastructure, and reinstate tax credits for alternative fuel refueling property. The Driving America Forward Act (H.R. 2256/S. 1094) would raise the cap on vehicle credits to 600,000 per automaker and reduce the credit amount to $7,000. The Electric Credit Access Ready at Sale (Electric CARS) Act of 2019 (H.R. 2042/S. 993) seeks to extend the tax credit for plug-in vehicles. The Sale Act of 2019 would extend the tax credit for electric vehicles through 2029 and repeal the cap for automakers. The Fairness for Every Driver Act would repeal the tax credit for electric vehicles and impose an annual fee on alternative fuel vehicles. The American Cars, American Jobs Act of 2019 would establish a program to encourage the purchase of new US-made automobiles with $3,500 vouchers. The program offers vouchers for new passenger vehicles and plug-in electric drive vehicles assembled in the US with at least 45% domestic parts. The Clean Corridors Act establishes a grant program for electric vehicle charging infrastructure. The Leading Infrastructure for Tomorrow's America Act directs the Department of Energy to develop model building codes for electric vehicle charging. The bills introduced in 2019 aim to promote the deployment of electric vehicle charging infrastructure and advance research and development in vehicle electrification. The Zero-Emissions Vehicles Act proposes a national standard for automakers to increase the sales of zero-emissions vehicles. The Zero-Emissions Vehicles Act mandates that electric vehicles must make up 50% of new car sales by 2030 and 100% by 2040, referred to committee in both chambers."
