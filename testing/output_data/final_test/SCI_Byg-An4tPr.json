    "content": "In this paper, a novel mechanism is developed to preserve differential privacy in adversarial learning for deep neural networks, ensuring provable robustness to adversarial examples. By leveraging sequential composition theory in differential privacy, a new connection is established between privacy preservation and robustness. An original, differentially private, adversarial objective function is designed to address the trade-off among model utility, privacy loss, and robustness. The mechanism tightens the sensitivity of the model, leading to notable improvements in the robustness of deep neural networks. Efforts to prevent attacks on deep neural networks include models preserving differential privacy, adversarial training algorithms, and provable robustness. Private models are trained with existing privacy-preserving mechanisms to enhance security. Private models trained with existing privacy-preserving mechanisms are vulnerable to adversarial examples, while robust models trained with adversarial learning algorithms lack privacy protections. This one-sided approach poses risks as adversaries can exploit both privacy inference attacks and adversarial examples. To be secure, a model should be private to protect training data and robust to adversarial examples. However, research on developing such a model remains an open challenge. Simply combining existing mechanisms for preserving differential privacy and provable robustness conditions has not been explored. Existing sensitivity bounds and designs have not been developed to protect training data in adversarial training, introducing a privacy risk. There is an unrevealed interplay among DP preservation, adversarial learning, and robustness bounds. Current algorithms struggle to address the trade-off between model utility, privacy loss, and robustness, making it nontrivial to bound the robustness of a model. The proposed novel differentially private adversarial learning (DPAL) mechanism aims to preserve differential privacy of training data, be robust to adversarial examples, and maintain high model utility. It injects privacy-preserving noise into inputs and hidden layers to achieve differential privacy in learning private model parameters. Ensemble adversarial learning is incorporated to enhance the decision boundary under differential privacy protections by introducing DP adversarial examples crafted from benign examples in the private training data. A new DP adversarial objective function is proposed to balance model utility and privacy loss, reducing the amount of noise injected into the function. The proposed novel differentially private adversarial learning (DPAL) mechanism aims to preserve privacy of training data by injecting noise into inputs and hidden layers. Ensemble DP adversarial examples with dynamic perturbation size are introduced to improve robustness under different attack algorithms. Privacy is maintained by splitting private training data into disjoint batches, ensuring privacy budget is not accumulated. The connection between privacy preservation, adversarial learning, and provable robustness is established through noise injection in different layers. A novel generalized robustness bound is derived using sequential composition theory in DP. Our mechanism establishes a connection between DP preservation and provable robustness against adversarial examples in adversarial learning. Experiments on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets show enhanced robustness of DP deep neural networks. The database D contains N tuples with data x and ground-truth label y. Each y is a one-hot vector of K categories. A model assigns labels to data tuples based on class scores generated by parameters \u03b8. The class with the highest score is chosen as the predicted label. A loss function penalizes mismatches between predicted and original values. DP-preserving techniques in deep learning are discussed, with a focus on (\u03b5, \u03b4)-DP definition. The text discusses differential privacy (DP) in deep learning, focusing on the introduction of noise into gradients of parameters and objective functions to preserve privacy. It also mentions adversarial learning and the goal of finding adversarial examples. The mechanism proposed in the text achieves better sensitivity bounds compared to existing works. In adversarial learning, the goal is to find adversarial examples that are close to the original input but misclassified by the model. Different l p-norm bounded attacks are considered, aiming to minimize the risk over these adversarial examples through training the model with parameters \u03b8. Single-step algorithms like FGSM are used for efficient gradient computations in finding adversarial examples. Adversarial learning aims to find examples close to the original input but misclassified by the model. FGSM algorithm requires only a single gradient computation, while iterative algorithms compute multiple gradients. Prior work focuses on producing correct predictions on adversarial examples without compromising accuracy on legitimate inputs and detecting adversarial examples. Adversarial training, particularly the algorithm proposed by Kurakin et al., 2016, shows promise for robust model learning. Recent algorithms aim to achieve provable robustness against perturbations, ensuring consistent predictions under specific conditions. The focus is on defending against attacks of l p (\u00b5)-norm by maintaining stability in predictions despite small input perturbations. PixelDP is an algorithm introduced by Lecuyer et al. to ensure robustness of predictions against adversarial examples by randomizing the scoring function f(x) with random noise \u03c3 r. This (r, \u03b4 r)-PixelDP condition guarantees robustness under a predefined budget and broken probability. The proposed algorithm ensures robustness of predictions against adversarial examples by implementing a certified robustness check for each prediction. It introduces a generalized robustness condition with lower and upper bounds derived from Monte Carlo estimation. The new DPAL mechanism is presented to protect training data while preserving differential privacy in learning private parameters. The network architecture involves a feature representation learning model and class scores function. DPAL has three key components: preserving DP in learning the feature representation model, focusing on DP in adversarial learning, and computing robustness bounds at inference time for a deep neural network trained over T steps. Training involves using perturbed and DP adversarial examples. The DPAL model consists of three main components: preserving DP in feature representation learning, focusing on DP in adversarial learning, and computing robustness bounds during inference for a deep neural network. Training includes using perturbed and DP adversarial examples. The approach involves using an auto-encoder to learn DP parameters and ensure DP output. The auto-encoder is chosen for its ease of training and reusability for different predictive models. The DPAL model focuses on preserving differential privacy (DP) in feature representation learning. It involves injecting noise into coefficients to ensure 1-DP in learning \u03b81. Laplace noise is used to perturb the coefficients and reconstruction of x_i, maintaining privacy in the computation of x_i. This process is done as a preprocessing step for benign examples in disjoint batches. The perturbed function is constructed in batches to ensure differential privacy in feature representation learning. By setting the global sensitivity, the privacy budget consumption is tightened, and the computation remains (1/\u03b3)-DP without using additional information from the original data. The perturbation of a batch is used to enhance the robustness of models through differential privacy. Adversarial examples are generated using attack algorithms and random perturbations, preserving (1/\u03b3 x + 1)-DP in learning \u03b8 1. The proposed method enhances model robustness by training an auto-encoder with DP adversarial examples, preserving (1/\u03b3 x + 1)-DP. The objective function combines loss functions for benign and DP adversarial examples to optimize parameters. The proposed method enhances model robustness by training an auto-encoder with DP adversarial examples, preserving (1/\u03b3 x + 1)-DP. In Eq. 10, true class labels are denoted as y i and y j for examples x i and x j. DP is preserved in objective functions to achieve DP in learning \u03b8 2. The optimization of the function L 1Bt \u03b8 2 does not disclose any information from the training data. The sensitivity of the objective function L 2Bt (\u03b8 2) is computed as \u2206 L2 \u2264 2|h \u03c0 |, where |h \u03c0 | is the number of hidden neurons. The perturbed functions are optimized with a privacy budget of (1/\u03b3 + 2) to achieve differential privacy. Our mechanism achieves differential privacy at the batch level by leveraging parallel composition and post-processing properties. It reads perturbed inputs and coefficients across training steps, ensuring privacy guarantees. Disjoint fixed batches prevent additional privacy leakage, extending the result to (1 + 1/\u03b3 + 1/\u03b3 + 2)-DP in learning parameters \u03b8 = {\u03b81, \u03b82} across T training steps. The PixelDP mechanism achieves differential privacy by fixing batches across training steps to prevent additional privacy leakage. It establishes a correlation between its mechanism and provable robustness against adversarial examples. By injecting robustness noise into the scoring function, it ensures privacy guarantees and robustness in the inference time. The mechanism ensures privacy guarantees and robustness by injecting noise into the scoring function, correlating privacy noise with robustness noise to derive a robustness condition against norm attacks. The mechanism injects noise into the scoring function to ensure privacy guarantees and robustness against norm attacks. It achieves robustness conditions against l p (\u03ba)-norm attacks with a confidence level \u2265 \u03b7 x, perturbing h and satisfying r-PixelDP. Additionally, it establishes a robustness bound against l p (\u03d5)-norm attacks. These defensive mechanisms can be implemented as randomization processes during inference time, providing protection against l p (\u03ba) and l p (\u03d5) attacks. The model's general robustness bound is theorized to be \u03b1 \u2208 l p (\u03ba + \u03d5) through the theory of sequential composition in DP. The theory of sequential composition in DP (Dwork & Roth, 2014) is used to answer the question of robustness in the context of multiple independent mechanisms with privacy guarantees. The composition scoring function is defined and its robustness is derived, showing insensitivity to small perturbations in the mechanisms. The composition of robustness theorem states that when combining multiple independent mechanisms with privacy guarantees, the predicted label is robust to adversarial examples with a certain confidence level. Noise injections into the input and its affine transformation can be considered as two mechanisms for applying this concept. The composition of robustness theorem states that by combining multiple independent mechanisms with privacy guarantees, the predicted label remains robust to adversarial examples. Noise injections into the input and its affine transformation are treated as separate mechanisms in this context. The model is trained similarly to typical deep neural networks, with parameters updated independently using gradient descent. Verified inference is implemented as a post-processing step to provide a robustness size guarantee for each example. The robustness size guarantee for each example x is determined by maximizing \u03ba + \u03d5, which controls the robustness epsilon r. The prediction on x is robust to attacks up to (\u03ba + \u03d5) max, with the failure probability 1-\u03b7 decreasing by increasing invocations of f(x). Hoeffding's inequality is used to bound the approximation error in f k (x) and find the robustness bound. Sensitivity bounds for attacks are defined as \u2206 h r = \u03b2 \u03b8 1 \u221e and \u2206 x r = \u00b5d for l \u221e attacks. Our new Monte Carlo Estimation method for drawing independent noise improves model utility without affecting DP bounds or robustness. Extensive experiments on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets show our mechanism's effectiveness against l \u221e -bounded adversaries. DPAL mechanism is compared with state-of-the-art approaches in DP-preserving algorithms and provable robustness. The curr_chunk discusses various mechanisms for preserving differential privacy (DP) and provable robustness in machine learning models. These mechanisms include DP-SGD, AdLM, PixelDP, SecureSGD, and SecureSGD-AGM. These mechanisms inject random noise into gradients of parameters to preserve DP and improve robustness against attacks. Different white-box attacks were used in experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of these mechanisms. The curr_chunk discusses model configurations, accuracy metrics, and validation tasks related to privacy, utility, and robustness in machine learning models. The analysis includes the impact of privacy budget and attack sizes on model performance. The experimental results show that DPAL outperforms AdLM, DP-SGD, SecureSGD, and SecureSGD-AGM on the MNIST dataset under l \u221e (\u00b5 a )-norm attacks. DPAL achieves a 22.36% improvement over SecureSGD, a 46.84% improvement over SecureSGD-AGM, a 56.21% improvement over AdLM, and a 77.26% improvement over DP-SGD. AdLM and DP-SGD exhibit the worst accuracies and show no effect against adversarial examples when the privacy budget is varied. The experimental results demonstrate that DPAL outperforms AdLM, DP-SGD, SecureSGD, and SecureSGD-AGM on the MNIST dataset under l \u221e (\u00b5 a )-norm attacks. DPAL shows a small degradation in conventional accuracy compared to SecureSGD and SecureSGD-AGM when the privacy budget is reduced. Our DPAL mechanism achieves 82.7% accuracy at a privacy budget of 0.2, while SecureSGD-AGM and SecureSGD only achieve 11.2% and 41.64% accuracy respectively. This highlights the ability of DPAL to offer tight DP protections against adversarial attacks compared to existing algorithms. Our DPAL mechanism outperforms baseline approaches in adversarial example attacks on the MNIST dataset. It improves accuracy by 44.91% over SecureSGD, 61.13% over SecureSGD-AGM, 52.21% over AdLM, and 62.20% over DP-SGD. The DPAL model is resistant to different adversarial example algorithms with varying attack sizes, while other models become defenseless. Additionally, there is a significant drop in accuracy across all attacks when the attack size increases, with DPAL showing the smallest decrease compared to other models. Our DPAL model demonstrates superior defense against adversarial attacks on the MNIST dataset, outperforming other models such as SecureSGD, SecureSGD-AGM, AdLM, and DP-SGD. With a privacy budget of 1.0 and a small perturbation parameter \u00b5 a \u2264 0.2, PixelDP achieves better certified accuracies under all attacks. On the other hand, DPAL excels when \u00b5 a \u2265 0.3, showcasing a consistent certified accuracy against different attacks and attack sizes compared to baseline approaches. Incorporating ensemble adversarial learning into DP preservation enhances model consistency, robustness, and accuracy against various attack algorithms. DPAL outperforms baseline algorithms in terms of conventional and certified accuracy. Our DPAL mechanism significantly outperforms baseline models in terms of conventional accuracy and certified accuracy. Results on the CIFAR-10 Dataset show that our model provides strong privacy protections, with improvements ranging from 10.42% to 29.22% over other methods. Additionally, increasing the privacy budget from 2 to 10 results in a 4.74% improvement in conventional accuracy. The model's accuracy under adversarial attacks is low at 44.22% with a privacy budget of 2.0, highlighting the need for better robustness. Compared to baseline approaches, the model shows consistent accuracy under different attacks and perturbations, with a smaller drop in accuracy when attack size increases.

The perturbed affine transformation h1Bt is presented as an (1/\u03b3)-DP affine transformation. The perturbation of the coefficient \u03c6 can be rewritten as \u03c71 and \u03c72 drawn as Laplace noise. The computation of RBt(\u03b81) preserves 1-DP in Alg. 1. The parameter optimization of RBt(\u03b81) only uses the perturbed data Bt. The parameter optimization of RBt(\u03b81) in Alg. 1 only uses perturbed data Bt, preserving (1/\u03b3 x)-DP. The total privacy budget to learn optimal parameters \u03b81 is (1/\u03b3 x + 1)-DP. The perturbations of coefficients h\u03c0i yik can be rewritten with Laplace noise, ensuring robustness against adversarial attacks. The computation of L 2Bt \u03b8 2 preserves (1/\u03b3 + 2)-differential privacy by optimizing for a single draw of noise during training. The perturbed parameters \u03b8 2 derived from L 2Bt \u03b8 2 are (1/\u03b3 + 2)-DP, achieving DP at the dataset level D without consuming additional privacy budget. The algorithm achieves differential privacy (DP) at the dataset level D by computing the first hidden layer. Disjoint and fixed batches ensure DP, with the computation of h1D being (1/\u03b3)-DP for data D. Batches are considered disjoint datasets, maintaining DP across epochs. The computation of h1Bt at each training step does not access original data, only perturbed batch inputs, ensuring (1/\u03b3x)-DP. The optimization of the function R Bt (\u03b8 1 ) is ( 1 /\u03b3 x + 1 )-DP across T training steps, ensuring privacy even with perturbed neighboring datasets. The parallel composition property in DP allows for disjoint batches to maintain privacy guarantees independently. The optimization of R Bt (\u03b8 1 ) is ( 1 /\u03b3 x + 1 )-DP across T training steps, ensuring privacy with perturbed neighboring datasets. The computation of DP adversarial examples x adv j is ( 1 /\u03b3 x )-DP and does not access the original data, maintaining privacy guarantees independently. The data reconstruction function R B adv t is presented as follows: x adv j = \u03b8 1 h adv j. The optimization of R D adv (\u03b8 1) is (1/\u03b3 x + 1)-DP across T training steps, ensuring privacy with perturbed neighboring datasets. The Algorithm 1 ensures (1/\u03b3 + 2)-DP in optimizing the adversarial objective function across T training steps using disjoint batches derived from private training data. The privacy budget used is (1 + 1/\u03b3 + 2) to preserve DP in the objective functions. All computations and optimizations in Algorithm 1 follow the post-processing property in DP by working on perturbed inputs and coefficients. The crafting and utilizing processes of DP adversarial examples are based on perturbed benign examples, preserving (1 + 1/\u03b3 + 1/\u03b3 + 2)-DP in learning private parameters \u03b8 across T training steps. The sequential composition theory in DP ensures the expected output's privacy. Theorem 5 holds with probability \u2265 \u03b7 for \u03b1 \u2208 lp(1). Group privacy is applied, and Proposition 1 holds for Monte Carlo estimation of expected value f(x). Strong privacy protection causes a distribution shift between training and inference with Laplace noise draws. The model converges with noise added to x and h for correct predictions. Distribution shifts due to noise can degrade inference accuracy. Drawing independent noise following the distribution of \u03c7 1 + /\u03c8) is proposed for privacy guarantees. The approach involves drawing independent noise following the distribution of \u03c7 1 + /\u03c8) for the affine transformation h, controlled by hyper-parameter \u03c8. It maintains DP and provable robustness in training, converging to a scoring function f (x). MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets are used for training and testing. The dataset used for training and testing consists of 50,000 training samples and 10,000 test samples. The experiments were conducted on a single NVIDIA GTX TITAN X GPU with 3,072 CUDA cores. The models for MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets have 2 and 3 convolutional layers, respectively. The representation learning model includes both fully-connected and convolution layers. The sensitivity \u2206 R is the maximal sensitivity of a single feature map in the first affine transformation layer. Each hidden neuron reconstructs a unit patch of input units, with d being the size of the unit patch connected to each hidden neuron. The experiments involved using different adversarial attack methods to generate adversarial examples for training. The models had varying numbers of convolutional layers and fully-connected layers, with different batch sizes and parameters set for each model. The experiments involved using different adversarial attack methods to generate adversarial examples for training. The model has 256 neurons and uses data augmentation techniques. The batch size, \u03be, \u03c8, and T \u00b5 were set to specific values. The ensemble of attacks includes I-FGSM, MIM, and MadryEtAl. The learning rate and parameters for the CIFAR-10 dataset were also specified. The mechanism shows computational efficiency and scalability without consuming extra resources compared to existing algorithms. The mechanism discussed in the curr_chunk shows potential for application in larger deep neural networks with larger datasets. Further investigation is needed to evaluate the error incurred by the polynomial approximation approaches. The curr_chunk discusses error bounds and Taylor series adaptation from previous studies (Zhang et al., 2012; Apostol, 1967). It presents a proof involving maximum and minimum error bounds for the approximation. The curr_chunk discusses error bounds and Taylor series adaptation from previous studies, showing that the error depends on the maximum and minimum values of R Bt (\u03b8 1 ) \u2212 R Bt (\u03b8 1 ). This is consistent with previous research. The error magnitude is quantified by rewriting R Bt (\u03b8 1 ) \u2212 R Bt (\u03b8 1 ) as g 1j (x i , \u03b8 1j ) = \u03b8 1j h i and g 2j (x i , \u03b8 1j ) = \u03b8 1j h i. The remainder of Taylor expansion for each j must be in the interval. This can be applied to the autoencoder case with functions F 1j (z j ) = x ij log(1 + e \u2212zj ) and F 2j (z j ) = (1 \u2212 x ij ) log(1 + e zj). By using 2nd-order Taylor series with K categories, Eq. 30 can be straightforwardly proved for each label k."
