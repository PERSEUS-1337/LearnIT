    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Chronic Wasting Disease Financial Assistance Act of 2003\". It includes definitions and findings related to the disease. The term \"chronic wasting disease\" is defined as a transmissible disease affecting deer and elk, characterized by brain lesions and belonging to the group of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies. Congress acknowledges the States' authority in wildlife management, including monitoring chronic wasting disease in animal populations. Chronic wasting disease poses a significant threat to deer and elk populations in the United States, requiring government intervention for management and eradication. Federal support is needed to assist States and tribal governments in their efforts to control the disease and protect non-infected wild cervid populations. SEC. 3. STATE CHRONIC WASTING DISEASE MANAGEMENT CAPACITY BUILDING GRANTS. The Secretary of the Interior will provide grants to State wildlife management agencies for developing and implementing long term strategies to address chronic wasting disease in wild cervids. Eligibility for grants is based on including chronic wasting disease management activities in the State's wildlife conservation plan. Funding priorities will be given to States where the disease has been detected and those that have already invested State funds in disease management. States eligible for grants must have comprehensive policies and programs for chronic wasting disease management, including collaboration between wildlife agencies, agricultural agencies, and tribal governments. Priority will be given to states with rapid response capabilities for disease outbreaks. Authorization of $7,500,000 for containing disease outbreaks in new areas of infection. SEC. 4. Grants for states with chronic wasting disease outbreaks. The Secretary of the Interior will provide grants to State wildlife management agencies to address chronic wasting disease outbreaks in wild cervids. Eligibility for the grant is based on including disease management activities in the State's wildlife conservation plan. Funding priorities for grant allocation include State expenditures on disease management, number of cases detected, and wild cervid population. Authorization of $10,000,000 for State wildlife agencies to address chronic wasting disease in wild cervids. SEC. 5. TRIBAL CHRONIC WASTING DISEASE MANAGEMENT GRANTS. The Secretary of the Interior will provide grants to tribal wildlife management agencies to help Indian tribes develop and implement long term strategies for managing chronic wasting disease in wild cervids. Eligibility for grants is based on including chronic wasting disease management activities in the tribe's wildlife conservation plan. Funding priorities will be given to tribal governments managing lands where cervids with chronic wasting disease have been detected or are in proximity to such lands. Authorization of $3,000,000 for tribal governments managing chronic wasting disease, with funding priorities based on financial commitment and cooperative arrangements with wildlife agencies. The Secretary of the Interior will implement the Act through the Director of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. Funds for the Act will be managed by the Federal Assistance Program within the Service, with a limit of three percent for administrative expenses."
