    "content": "The \"Personal Watercraft Responsible Use Act of 1999\" acknowledges the increased popularity of recreational boating, including personal watercraft, leading to more accidents and diminished user experience. Personal watercraft are highly maneuverable thrill craft that pose safety risks when operated irresponsibly. The Act aims to ensure safe use of personal watercraft, protect shallow water habitats, reduce conflicts among boaters, and assist states in enforcing boating laws. The Act defines terms such as \"coastal state\", \"coastal waters\", \"Secretary\", and \"personal watercraft\" as vessels with specific design and operation characteristics. It also defines \"no-wake speed\" as the speed at which a personal watercraft moves through the water. The Act defines terms related to personal watercraft, including \"no-wake speed\" as the minimum speed to maintain while producing the smallest wake possible. SEC. 5. ENFORCEABLE POLICIES IN THE COASTAL ZONE. The Secretary may withhold up to 10% of a coastal state's assistance under the Coastal Zone Management Act unless enforceable policies on personal watercraft operation are implemented. These policies must prohibit operating at speeds exceeding no-wake in sensitive areas. The Coastal Zone Management Act requires that personal watercraft operation be prohibited from sensitive areas, including designated right-of-ways, navigation channels, and areas closer than 200 feet from the shoreline. Coastal states must designate these sensitive areas in their management programs. The Secretary will issue criteria for designating sensitive areas based on unique aquatic habitat, vegetation, nesting birds, shellfish beds, and area importance for recreational and commercial users. Coastal states with approved programs can comply by amending them to include required policies. The Secretary will issue regulations in consultation with the Secretary of Transportation to implement enforceable policies and provisions required under this section within a year of the enactment of the Act. States can use grants received under the Coastal Zone Management Act to develop and implement these policies. SEC. 6. PERSONAL WATERCRAFT SAFETY PROGRAM. Within one year of this Act's enactment, the Secretary of Transportation must establish guidelines for personal watercraft operation, including mandatory state registration, a minimum operator age of 16 (unless accompanied by a trained passenger over 16), and completion of a mandatory training program for all operators. \n    Personal watercraft operators, including rented vessel operators, must complete a training program with safety and conservation components. States can use funds to develop regulations for user safety, reduce conflicts, and minimize environmental damage. SEC. 7. LAW ENFORCEMENT GRANTS. The Secretary of Transportation may provide grants to States for enforcing recreational boating laws, including equipment purchase and hiring law enforcement. States must have a boating safety program following national guidelines and adopt enforceable policies for coastal states. Allocation of grants is based on the number of recreational vessels in each State. The Secretary of Transportation provides grants to States for enforcing recreational boating laws, with allocation based on the number of registered vessels. States must match funds with a 1-to-1 ratio of Federal-to-State contributions from non-Federal sources, which can be in-kind contributions. SEC. 8. TASK FORCE DEVELOPMENT GRANTS. The Secretary of Transportation may provide grants to States for collaborative task forces to reduce conflicts between personal watercraft and other users. Task forces must be geographically organized and include members representing various stakeholders. Grants will be awarded competitively, with a limit of 25 per State. The Secretary of Transportation may issue regulations for task force development grants. States receiving grants must provide matching funds in a 1-to-1 ratio. Grant funds must be obligated within 2 years, or they revert back to the Secretary for future grants. Authorization of appropriations for law enforcement grants and task force development grants under sections 7 and 8 respectively. $25,000,000 for each fiscal year 2001-2003 for law enforcement grants and $2,500,000 for each fiscal year 2001-2003 for task force development grants. State authority preserved to establish more restrictive limitations on personal watercraft operation."
