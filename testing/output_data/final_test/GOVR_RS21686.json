    "content": "Since FY2001, U.S. aid to Serbia has been conditioned on a presidential certification that Serbia meets three conditions: cooperating with the ICTY, ending support for Bosnian Serb institutions, and protecting minority rights and the rule of law. The certification does not apply to Kosovo and does not affect humanitarian or democratization aid to Serbia. The U.S. aid to Serbia is conditioned on cooperation with the ICTY, ending support for Bosnian Serb institutions, and protecting minority rights and the rule of law. Despite this, Serbia's non-cooperation with the ICTY has not affected its access to international loans. The European Union has not explicitly tied its aid to Serbia to war crimes cooperation. Serbia typically delivers indictees to the ICTY just before or after the certification deadline each year. The Administration certifies Serbia's cooperation with the ICTY annually, urging more efforts such as the surrender of key figures. Serbian leaders cite obstacles but deliver indictees before each deadline. U.S. aid conditions influence the timing of arrests, as seen with Milosevic's arrest one day after a certification deadline. Secretary of State Colin Powell links U.S. support for aid to Serbia with Milosevic's delivery to the Tribunal. The delivery of Milosevic to the Tribunal in The Hague on June 28, 2001, one day before a donors conference, led to decreased Serbian cooperation. Despite missing the FY2002 deadline, Serbia encouraged six indictees to surrender in April and May 2002. The FY2002 certification was made on May 21, 2002. The FY2003 foreign aid appropriations measure included certification provisions for aid to Serbia, requiring the President to certify by June 15, 2003. However, cooperation was threatened by the assassination of Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic on March 12, 2003. Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic was assassinated by organized crime figures fearing prosecution for war crimes. His murder spurred Serbian leaders to fight against organized crime and war criminals. Indictees were handed over to the ICTY in 2003. US aid to Serbia depended on ICTY cooperation, among other conditions. Serbian authorities assured they had stopped supporting Republic Srpska institutions. The FY2004 and FY2005 foreign aid certifications for Serbia were not made due to lack of cooperation with the Tribunal, resulting in the suspension of aid. The United States threatened to withhold $10 million in aid from Serbia due to lack of cooperation with the Tribunal. However, Serbia met the conditions set out in the legislation, leading to the release of the suspended aid. Serbia transferred 14 indictees to the ICTY, but Mladic and Karadzic remained at large. The FY2006 foreign operations appropriations bill conditioned U.S. aid to Serbia on cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for Yugoslavia, including efforts to apprehend Mladic and Karadzic. The FY2006 foreign operations appropriations bill conditions U.S. aid to Serbia on cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for Yugoslavia, including efforts to apprehend Mladic and Karadzic. The Administration should vote for loans and aid for Serbia and Montenegro from international financial institutions after May 31, 2006, if the certification is made. The aid conditions do not apply to Montenegro, Kosovo, humanitarian aid, or assistance to promote democracy. The provision specifically names Karadzic and Mladic as persons Serbia should detain, allowing the Administration to issue a certification even if the two men are not transferred, if it determines that they are not living in Serbia. In January 2006, the Serbian government admitted that Mladic had been drawing a Serbian Army pension as late as mid-November 2005. On May 31, 2006, the Administration suspended $7 million in U.S. aid to Serbia for failing to cooperate with the ICTY. The FY2007 foreign operations appropriations bill includes a provision blocking aid to Serbia's central government unless certification is made by May 31, 2007, omitting specific reference to Karadzic but retaining mention of Mladic. The FY2007 foreign aid bill conditions aid to Serbia's central government on ICTY cooperation by May 31, 2007, including access for investigators, provision of documents, timely information on indictees, and surrender of indictees. The 109th Congress did not complete the bill before adjourning. The FY2007 foreign aid bill conditions aid to Serbia on ICTY cooperation by May 31, 2007. The Administration certified Serbia's compliance in July 2007, releasing $6 million in aid. The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2008 allows U.S. aid to Serbia if certain conditions are met after May 31, 2008. The Administration should vote for loans and assistance for Serbia in international financial institutions after the deadline if it meets aid conditions, including cooperating with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia. Other conditions include ending support for separate Republika Srpska institutions and implementing policies that respect minority rights and the rule of law. The Administration has used aid conditions to extract Serbian cooperation with the ICTY, but is growing impatient with the certification process. There is a push to shift responsibility for prosecuting war crimes cases from the ICTY to Serbian courts, with a deadline set by U.N. Security Council Resolution 1503 in 2003. The United States is assisting Serbia in prosecuting war criminals by providing aid and positive inducements. This includes setting up witness protection programs, training judges, and contributing funds for a new Serbian court. In November 2003, the Administration certified Serbia and Montenegro for Normal Trade Relations with the U.S., which had been suspended since 1992 due to their role in the war in Bosnia. The legislation allows the Administration to restore Normal Trade Relations (NTR) to Serbia and Montenegro if certain conditions are met. Serbian officials are pleased with the restoration of NTR, as it will boost exports to the United States. In June 2005, duty-free treatment was granted to some products from Serbia and Montenegro under the Generalized System of Preferences. The Administration reversed long-standing policy in November 2006 by offering support for Serbia's membership in NATO's Partnership for Peace program, which aims to help countries meet NATO standards and promote cooperation. Serbia joined PFP in December 2006, with certification playing a role in encouraging Serbian leaders to address war crimes issues for a healthier democracy in the long run. The certification process in Serbia has been a domestic political liability for reformers, with Western demands reducing their credibility. Cooperation with the Tribunal has caused tensions among reformers, along with corruption scandals and personal ambitions. Skeptics argue that certification hinders U.S. goals of Euro-Atlantic integration in the region. The U.S. decision to allow Serbia to join PFP without handing over Mladic to the ICTY was seen as a move to support pro-Western parties in Serbian elections. Despite a new government formed in 2007 pledging cooperation with the ICTY, there are still obstacles to full cooperation, including tensions within the government. The United States and its European allies are likely to recognize Kosovo's independence in early 2008, which could lead to Serbia downgrading relations with any country that does so. This could result in Serbia's cooperation with the ICTY ceasing and its prospects for Euro-Atlantic integration suffering a serious blow."
