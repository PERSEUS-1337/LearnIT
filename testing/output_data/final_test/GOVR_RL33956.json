    "content": "The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) began collecting information about homeless individuals in response to a directive from Congress in 1998. This initiative started in 2001 to develop a system for data collection, organization, and storage, as previous attempts to count homeless individuals were not systematic. Homeless Management Information Systems (HMIS) are databases established at the local level for collecting, organizing, and storing information about homeless clients who receive services. HUD implements the HMIS initiative through local \"Continuums of Care\" (CoCs) to process data from all participating service providers. Local boards in cities and counties, consisting of representatives from various organizations, identify and address the needs of homeless individuals by providing a mix of services including preventative assistance, emergency services, transitional housing, supportive services, and permanent housing. Providers submit funding requests to their local Continuums of Care (CoCs), which then submit consolidated applications to HUD. Participation in HMIS is required for organizations receiving funding through the HOPWA program and Homeless Assistance Grants. The HOPWA program, established in 1990, offers housing and support services for individuals with HIV/AIDS. The Homeless Assistance Grants, part of the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act, provide housing and supportive services for individuals with HIV/AIDS. Funding is distributed through formula and competitive grants, with service providers encouraged to participate in HMIS. HUD began collecting information on homeless clients before the congressional directive to implement HMIS. Beginning in the mid-1990s, HUD required applicants for Homeless Assistance Grants to include information about the number of persons receiving assistance and the type of assistance they received. By 2003, applicants had to complete a housing activity chart with a point-in-time count of homeless individuals and families receiving services, categorizing subpopulations served. Some CoCs used database systems similar to HMIS to track homeless individuals served. HUD required CoCs to conduct point-in-time counts of both sheltered and unsheltered homeless individuals, typically during the last week of January every two years. Some CoCs voluntarily conducted counts annually, with approximately 67% participating in 2008. The most recent count involving all CoCs was in January 2009. Results are detailed in the \"CoC Point-in-Time Estimates of Homeless Individuals\" section of the report. The report focuses on HUD's efforts to collect data on homeless individuals, as directed by Congress in 1998. The FY1999 HUD spending bill allocated funds for systems to gather information on homeless persons' characteristics, services received, and outcomes. Congress emphasized the importance of producing an accurate count of homeless individuals and collecting data on various aspects of their lives. Congress directed HUD to collect data on homeless individuals to assess service programs, allocate funds for management information systems, and analyze data within three years. The FY2001 Appropriations Act allocated funds for data collection, setting aside 1.5% of Homeless Assistance Grants for this purpose. HUD has received $1.02 billion for Homeless Assistance Grants. Congress has allocated funds for homeless data collection since FY2002. HUD has issued six annual reports to Congress on progress. Initial report in August 2001 outlined plans for data collection through various means. HUD has initiated activities to assist CoCs in obtaining homeless client-level reporting, including providing funds for information systems, training sessions, national conferences, and a website for HMIS implementation. HUD released final notice on HMIS data and technical standards for CoCs to follow when collecting information on homeless clients. Two levels of data collection are described - universal data and program-specific data. Universal data elements include name, date of birth, race, ethnicity, gender, veteran status, Social Security Number, prior residence, and disabling conditions. Programs receiving certain funding must collect program-specific data. Programs funded under McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Grants and HOPWA are required to provide program-specific data. HUD updated data standards in 2009, including new universal data elements for homeless status to differentiate those at risk from those meeting HUD's definition. The changes allow HMIS to capture information on financial assistance and housing services provided to clients, including recipients of HPRP funds. HUD updated data standards in 2009 to include new universal data elements for homeless status and to capture information on financial assistance and housing services provided to clients, including recipients of HPRP funds. Some organizations raised privacy concerns regarding the inclusion of information about domestic violence victims in HMIS, but HUD included privacy and security standards in the data and technical standards to protect the identity of individuals in the system. President Bush signed the Violence Against Women and Department of Justice Reauthorization Act in 2006, amending the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act to protect victim information in HMIS. HUD confirmed disclosure of non-personally identifying information only after a public notice and comment period. The HEARTH Act contained similar language, requiring the same disclosure process. HUD has instructed domestic violence service providers not to disclose personally identifying information in HMIS. For the Homelessness Prevention and Rapid Re-Housing Program (HPRP), service providers are directed to use a \"comparable database\" instead of entering information into HMIS. The implementation of HMIS at CoC levels varies, with incomplete data entry being a common issue. A comprehensive HMIS network is intended to improve services for homeless individuals. HUD's goal was for every CoC to implement an HMIS by October 2004, but this was not achieved. However, the number of CoCs participating in HMIS has increased each year since 2001. Between 2005 and 2006, the percentage of CoCs implementing an HMIS increased from 72% to 91%. CoCs have various options for implementing and maintaining their HMIS databases. Options for implementing and maintaining HMIS databases vary among CoCs. Some collaborate to create multi-jurisdictional HMIS, while others plan to make individual CoC data accessible at the state level. Local initiatives differ in methods of incorporating service providers, such as using a central HMIS or allowing providers to use different systems with data merging at the CoC level. Coverage of homeless service providers in HMIS may still be incomplete. HUD tracks bed coverage rates in HMIS to measure the participation of local service providers within a CoC. Issues with bed coverage may arise due to confidentiality concerns in reporting data, lack of HUD funding requiring participation, and incomplete client data reporting. HUD monitors bed coverage rates by shelter type and household type to address limitations in data usefulness. The HUD tracks bed coverage rates in HMIS to measure local service providers' participation within a CoC. Bed coverage rates increased from 2005 to 2006 for emergency shelters, transitional housing, and permanent housing serving homeless individuals and families. The bed coverage rates for homeless families and permanent supportive housing increased from 2005 to 2006. Various methods have been used since the 1980s to estimate the total number of homeless persons in the country. The HMIS initiative aims to provide a comprehensive count of homeless individuals by gathering information from all homeless assistance providers each day of the year. HUD releases Annual Homeless Assessment Reports (AHAR) using HMIS data to track homeless populations. The HUD has released four AHARs since February 2007, with the most recent in July 2009. These reports rely on a sample of jurisdictions due to incomplete HMIS implementation. Efforts to estimate homeless numbers include CoC point-in-time counts, AHAR estimates using HMIS data, and previous estimates from the 1980s and 1990s. Demographic information on homeless individuals is also included. HUD mandated CoCs to conduct point-in-time counts in 2005, 2007, and 2009, focusing on both sheltered and unsheltered homeless individuals. Point-in-time counts are conducted by CoCs in the last week of January to estimate sheltered homeless individuals, with 67% of CoCs voluntarily participating in 2008. HMIS is expected to be integrated into these counts in the future. The reliability of data varies by Continuum, especially for estimates of unsheltered homeless individuals living in places like cars and abandoned buildings. HUD provides guidance on conducting street counts, but the task is complex. HUD provides guidance on conducting street counts and technical assistance to CoCs. Not all CoCs can conduct reliable surveys of unsheltered individuals during point-in-time counts. CoCs are asked to collect subpopulation information, but it is not always reliable. Information on homeless subpopulations is available on HUD's website. All CoCs were required to conduct a point-in-time count in January 2009. In 2007, the sheltered homeless population was 391,401, the unsheltered homeless population was 280,487, totaling 671,888 homeless individuals. In 2008, 67% of CoCs conducted point-in-time counts, while the remaining 33% reported counts from the previous year. The 2008 homeless count may not be representative nationwide due to some CoCs not conducting counts. The total homeless population in 2008 was 664,414, with 386,361 sheltered and 278,053 unsheltered individuals. HUD was directed by Congress to create homeless management information systems and issue a report containing an unduplicated count and descriptive profile of homeless individuals. HUD released the first Annual Homeless Assessment Report in February 2007, estimating the number of homeless individuals using HMIS data. Subsequent reports provided estimates for different time periods, with data collected from a sample of communities to derive national-level estimates of sheltered homeless persons. The Annual Homeless Assessment Reports (AHAR) use HMIS data from emergency shelters and transitional housing with at least 50% bed coverage. Data from domestic violence shelters and one-night counts of homeless persons are included. AHARs provide national estimates of demographic characteristics of sheltered homeless persons. The AHARs provide demographic information on sheltered homeless persons, with individual adults making up the majority. Single adult men are the largest group, and African Americans have the highest percentage. Reports on disability and veteran status show improvements in data completeness over time. Estimates of persons using emergency shelters and transitional housing are based on a nationally representative sample of communities. Participation in the AHAR required a minimum level of bed coverage in specific categories. The AHAR sample selection process involved using CDBG jurisdictions as primary sampling units to ensure representation of different geographic areas and reduce sampling variability. Certain jurisdictions were selected with certainty to provide more stable national estimates. The AHAR sample selection process included choosing large population CDBG jurisdictions for inclusion in the sample. 18 certainty sites were selected, while the remaining jurisdictions were divided into 16 strata based on geography and size. 62 sample sites were then randomly chosen, totaling approximately 14% of the U.S. population. For the first AHAR, 55 out of 80 sample communities with HMIS data were analyzed. Nine additional contributing communities also met the standards. In the second AHAR, 58 sample communities provided HMIS data, including 49 from the first AHAR and nine new ones. Five communities from the first AHAR did not meet the standards for the second AHAR. 16 contributing communities not in the sample also provided data for the second AHAR. The fourth AHAR included data from 102 communities, with 87 sample sites implementing HMIS and 135 contributing. Modifications were made to address issues from previous reports, adding 22 rural communities to the non-certainty sample. The fourth AHAR included data from 222 sites, with 135 contributing communities. Year-to-year comparisons showed an increase of 5,200 people using emergency shelter or transitional housing in 2008. The number of sheltered homeless individuals decreased while sheltered homeless persons in families increased. Sheltered homeless individuals as a percentage of all sheltered homeless persons decreased from 70.2% in 2007 to 68.6% in 2008. The percentage of sheltered homeless persons in families increased from 29.8% in 2007 to 32.4% in 2008. The majority of sheltered homeless persons are in urban areas, but there was a noticeable increase in those in suburban or rural areas. In 2008, 32% of sheltered homeless persons were in suburban or rural areas, with a significant increase in families from almost 27% in 2007 to over 38% in 2008. The racial and ethnic makeup of sheltered homeless individuals and families changed from 2007 to 2008. The percentage of White, non-Hispanic homeless individuals increased, while African American individuals increased but decreased in families. White, Hispanic individuals decreased but increased in families. The living situation of sheltered homeless persons also showed a change in pattern. In 2008, there was a change in the pattern of sheltered homeless adults in families compared to 2007. The proportion of adults coming from some type of housing increased, while the proportion of those who had been homeless before entering a shelter decreased. Additionally, the median length of stay in shelters for individuals increased to 18 nights in 2008. In 2008, the median length of stay in emergency shelters increased to 18 nights. Individuals stayed for a total of 107 nights, while persons in families stayed for 161 nights. African Americans were overrepresented among long-term stayers but their proportion decreased by more than 17 percentage points from 2007 to 2008. In 2008, individuals in emergency shelters stayed for a median of 18 nights, while persons in families stayed for 161 nights. African Americans were overrepresented among long-term stayers, but their proportion decreased by more than 17 percentage points from 2007 to 2008. Other racial groups, including those identifying as multiple racial groups, showed increases in proportions for those staying in emergency shelters for more than 180 days. Previous attempts have been made to accurately count and describe the characteristics of homeless individuals in the United States, with estimates ranging from 250,000 to 350,000 individuals homeless at any given point. In March 1987, the Urban Institute estimated that the number of homeless persons ranged from 496,000 to 600,000 during an average seven-day period. They projected that approximately 1 million individuals were homeless at some time during 1987. In 2000, the Urban Institute released a second estimate using data collected in 1996, surveying homeless individuals and service providers in 76 communities. Surveys conducted in 76 communities included clients and staff of various organizations providing homeless services. Researchers estimated that 444,000 clients used homeless assistance services in a seven-day period in the fall of 1996, and 842,000 in the winter. They estimated that between 2.3 million and 3.5 million individuals were homeless at some point in 1996. Attempts have been made to describe the characteristics of the national homeless population through various surveys and reports. These efforts collect demographic information such as age, familial status, race, disability, and veteran status. The National Survey of Homeless Assistance Providers and Clients, Census Bureau, U.S. Conference of Mayors, and Department of Veterans Affairs are involved in gathering data on homeless individuals. The NSHAPC data from 1996 provided insights into the demographic and income status of homeless clients. The 1996 NSHAPC study found that homeless individuals were mostly male (68%) and nonwhite (53%), with 23% being veterans. Nearly half had never married, 38% lacked a high school diploma, and 48% had minor children but only 31% lived with them. Many reported alcohol (38%) and mental health (39%) issues, with 27% having lived in institutional settings as children and 25% reporting childhood abuse. The Census Bureau's 2000 report on emergency housing residents provided additional insights. The 2000 report by the U.S. Conference of Mayors collected data on 171,000 respondents, showing that 74% were adults, 61% were male, and 39% were female. The majority were white (41%), followed by African American (40%) and Hispanic (20%). The organization has been issuing annual reports since 1984, with 27 mayors appointed in 2008 to the Task Force on Hunger and Homelessness. These mayors surveyed social service providers in large cities to combat hunger and homelessness. The 2008 report on hunger and homelessness focused on demographics of the homeless population in 25 cities. Single adults comprised 94% of those living on the streets, while families made up 4% and unaccompanied youth 2%. In emergency shelters, single adults accounted for 67%, families 29%, and unaccompanied youth 1%. Families were the majority in transitional housing at 56%, while single adults were 43%. Single adults represented 60% in permanent supportive housing. In permanent supportive housing, single adults represented 60% of the population, compared to less than 40% in families. Among homeless residents, 26% had serious mental illnesses, 13% had physical disabilities, 2% were HIV positive, 13% were veterans, and 15% were victims of domestic violence. The Department of Veterans Affairs estimates that approximately 131,000 veterans were homeless in 2008. The VA estimated that in 2008, around 131,000 veterans were homeless on one day in January.
