The vehicles come in three categories: Category I for urban operations, Category II for various missions, and Category III for mine and IED clearance. The Army and Marines first used MRAPs in Iraq and Afghanistan in 2003 for route clearance and explosive ordnance disposal operations. MRAP vehicles were first used in Iraq and Afghanistan in 2003 for route clearance and explosive ordnance disposal operations. They quickly gained a reputation for superior crew protection, with a casualty rate of 6% compared to 15% for the M-1 Abrams tank and 22% for up-armored HMMWVs. The acquisition objective is 25,700 MRAP vehicles, including 8,100 MRAP-All Terrain Vehicles (M-ATV) for rugged terrain in Afghanistan, with a possibility of increasing based on operational needs. Reports in September 2010 indicated discussions for a new contract for additional M-ATVs beyond the original 8,100, with the possibility of developing new variants. By July 21, 2011, 14,749 MRAPs had been delivered to Afghanistan, including 6,980 M-ATVs. Older model MRAPs in Afghanistan are often unused due to their size. Plans were made to redistribute earlier versions of MRAPs as U.S. forces withdrew from Iraq, but the increase in forces deploying to Afghanistan led to a reevaluation of MRAP usage. Currently, plans for deploying MRAPs to Afghanistan have been adjusted. Approximately 15,000 Army MRAPs will be assigned to various combat teams and support units. The Marines are still developing their ground vehicle strategy. Outgoing Secretary of Defense Robert Gates noted that MRAPs are significantly safer than HMMWVs during IED attacks. The Pentagon's MRAPs have been proven to be 10 times safer than HMMWVs in protecting soldiers during IED attacks, saving an estimated 40,000 lives. Secretary Gates highlighted the morale value of MRAPs for service members. A lighter-weight MRAP variant, the M-ATV, was developed for Afghanistan's terrain challenges. The M-ATV, a lighter-weight MRAP variant, weighs 12 tons and offers better off-road mobility with adequate armor protection. However, insurgents in Afghanistan have increased the size of IEDs, leading to higher U.S. casualties. To address this threat, additional Israeli-made armor plates are being added to the M-ATVs, enabling them to withstand larger explosions. The DOD has signed a $245 million contract with Oshkosh to acquire armor kits for 5,100 M-ATVs, with plans to outfit all nearly 7,000 vehicles in Afghanistan. The DOD has allocated $38.346 billion for MRAPs in Afghanistan, with concerns about balancing armor and mobility. Funding for MRAPs in previous years totaled $38.346 billion, with no procurement funds requested in the FY2012 DOD budget. The DOD requested $3.195 billion for the MRAP vehicle program for FY2012 to support CENTCOM operations. This included funding for operations, sustainment, upgrades, and testing. Concerns were raised about older MRAPs in Afghanistan not being used effectively, questioning why they were shipped there in the first place. The Pentagon loaned 300 MRAPs to 15 allied nations in Afghanistan, with 85 already on loan to countries like Poland and Romania. Borrowing countries are responsible for maintenance costs. This initiative aims to reduce allied casualties and recoup procurement costs. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) highlighted potential overlap in capabilities between MRAP, M-ATV, and JLTV programs, questioning the need for three distinct tactical wheeled vehicle programs amidst anticipated defense budget cuts. Defense officials justify the JLTV program by citing 450 additional requirements that MRAPs and M-ATVs cannot meet. Some analysts raise concerns about the proliferation of tactical wheeled vehicle programs. If the services continue to prioritize new tactical wheeled vehicles over the M-ATV and JLTV programs, they risk redundancy and may struggle to afford replacing the HMMWV fleet. The use of larger IEDs in Afghanistan has led to added armor on M-ATVs, potentially making them less maneuverable and prone to rollovers. Congress should assess the modified M-ATVs' performance to ensure a balance between protection and operational utility. Consideration should also be given to the unused MRAPs and their maneuverability. Consideration should be given to using unused MRAPs on Afghan routes that can accommodate their weight, as they may be a more timely and cost-effective option compared to uparmoring M-ATVs."
