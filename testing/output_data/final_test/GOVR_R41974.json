    "content": "A common concern among proponents of regulatory reform is that the costs of regulations may outweigh their intended benefits. They suggest using tools like cost-benefit analysis to improve the quality and effectiveness of federal rules and minimize burden. Cost-benefit analysis evaluates regulatory requirements based on the distribution of costs and benefits across society. It aims to justify a regulation if its benefits outweigh the costs. Cost-effectiveness analysis focuses on achieving a goal at the least cost, without assessing the goal's merits. Estimating benefits and costs before issuing rules is uncertain and relies on assumptions, especially for long-term or uncertain effects. Cost-benefit analysis is controversial for quantifying value trade-offs, especially for non-market benefits like health or lives. Congress mandates cost-benefit analysis in some statutes, prohibits it in others, and leaves it optional in some. Despite challenges, economists believe it can aid regulatory decision-making. Many federal agencies must conduct cost-benefit analyses for rules before publication, but proposed legislation may change this requirement. Proposed legislation in the 113th Congress aims to expand requirements for cost-benefit analysis in federal rulemaking. The current set of regulatory analytical requirements has been established over the last 40 to 50 years through various presidential and congressional initiatives. The report identifies bills to enhance these requirements but does not address the quality of agency analyses or their use in decision-making. Over the past 40 years, various presidential initiatives have required regulatory analysis before agencies' rules are published in the Federal Register. This includes mandates from Presidents Nixon, Ford, and Carter for agencies to develop summaries of regulatory proposals, consider alternatives, and assess costs. The current regulatory analytical requirements have evolved through presidential and congressional initiatives, with proposed legislation in the 113th Congress aiming to expand cost-benefit analysis in federal rulemaking. President Carter required agencies to prepare a regulatory analysis for major rules, tracing back to President Reagan's Executive Order 12291 in 1981. Covered agencies were mandated to prioritize regulatory objectives that maximize net benefits to society and select the least costly regulatory alternative. This requirement included preparing a \"regulatory impact analysis\" for each major rule. President Reagan's Executive Order 12291 required covered agencies to prepare a \"regulatory impact analysis\" for major rules with significant economic effects. This order was replaced by President Clinton's Executive Order 12866 in 1993, which established similar analytical principles and requirements for regulatory analysis. Executive Order 12866 requires covered agencies to assess costs and benefits of regulatory alternatives, including not regulating. Agencies should choose approaches that maximize net benefits, considering economic, environmental, public health, safety, distributive impacts, and equity. The order also outlines principles of regulation that agencies should adhere to. The Executive Order 12866 requires agencies to assess costs and benefits of regulatory alternatives, including not regulating, to maximize net benefits. Agencies should design regulations in a cost-effective manner, consider incentives for innovation, and tailor regulations to impose the least burden on society. The heart of economic analysis requirements in Executive Order 12866 differentiates between \"significant\" and \"economically significant\" rules based on their impact on the economy and other factors. The order requires agencies to consider costs and benefits of regulatory alternatives to maximize net benefits and design regulations in a cost-effective manner. Rules that alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs, or raise novel legal or policy issues are considered \"economically significant\" regulatory actions. Executive Order 12866 requires agencies to provide an assessment of the potential costs and benefits for each significant regulatory action, and for economically significant actions, agencies must also provide an assessment of benefits. OIRA requires an assessment of anticipated benefits and costs from regulatory actions, including quantification where feasible. This includes promoting the efficient functioning of the economy, enhancing health and safety, protecting the environment, and reducing discrimination or bias. The Executive Order 12866 requires agencies to assess costs and benefits of regulatory actions, consider feasible alternatives, and comply with the order's requirements in emergency situations or when quick action is needed. It aims to improve the internal management of the Federal Government without creating any new rights. The best practices document published by OIRA in January 1996 outlines guidelines for preparing economic analyses required by Executive Order 12866. It emphasizes the need for clear justification of proposed actions, consideration of alternative approaches, and assessment of incremental costs and benefits. Cost-effectiveness analysis is recommended where possible. The 2003 OMB Circular A-4 on \"Regulatory Analysis\" replaced the 1996 best practices document, emphasizing the importance of cost-effectiveness analysis and defining good regulatory analysis. It outlines the three basic elements of a good regulatory analysis: the need for the proposed action, examination of alternative approaches, and evaluation of benefits and costs. The circular also requires agencies to describe the statutory or judicial directives authorizing the proposed action. The 2003 OMB Circular A-4 emphasizes cost-effectiveness analysis and defines good regulatory analysis. It requires agencies to describe statutory or judicial directives authorizing the action and the problem it aims to address, such as market failures or social purposes like combating discrimination. Agencies must consider alternative regulatory approaches before determining the need for federal regulation, including state or local options. The circular mandates agencies to evaluate a \"reasonable number\" of regulatory approaches within their statutory authority, such as different compliance dates, enforcement methods, and performance standards. The 2003 OMB Circular A-4 emphasizes cost-effectiveness analysis and defines good regulatory analysis. It requires agencies to consider alternative regulatory approaches before determining the need for federal regulation. Agencies should use cost-benefit analysis when all benefits and costs can be expressed in monetary units, but in cases where this is not possible, analysts should attempt to quantify benefits or costs as much as possible. The 2003 OMB Circular A-4 emphasizes cost-effectiveness analysis and defines good regulatory analysis. Agencies should use cost-benefit analysis when all benefits and costs can be expressed in monetary units. Agencies have developed methods to monetize certain benefits, such as determining the number of \"statistical lives\" saved and multiplying it by a \"value of a statistical life\" (VSL). The Department of Transportation's VSL was $6.0 million in 2009, while the Environmental Protection Agency's VSL was nearly $7.9 million. The OMB Circular A-4 describes cost-effectiveness analysis as a way to compare regulatory options based on achieving the most effective use of resources. It discusses measuring costs and benefits against a baseline, discounting, and handling uncertainty. The OMB Circular A-4 provides guidance on conducting cost-effectiveness analysis for regulatory options, including measuring costs and benefits against a baseline, discounting, and handling uncertainty. It also instructs agencies to present a formal quantitative analysis of uncertainties for large rules with annual economic effects of $1 billion or more, including estimating probability distributions of regulatory benefits and costs. Executive Order 13563 further outlines analytical requirements in statutes and executive orders. Executive Order 13563, issued by President Obama in January 2011, reiterated the principles of regulation in Executive Order 12866. It requires covered agencies to propose regulations with benefits justifying costs, minimize burdens on society, and maximize net benefits. Agencies must use the best available techniques to quantify benefits and costs accurately. The order also mandates agencies to periodically review their significant rules. President Obama's Executive Order 13579 in July 2011 encouraged independent regulatory agencies to comply with principles from Executive Order 13563, such as public participation and periodic review of rules, while respecting their independence. This order does not directly apply cost-benefit principles from Executive Orders 12866 or 13563 to independent regulatory agencies. The Executive Orders 12866 and 13563 do not apply cost-benefit principles to independent regulatory agencies, and they are not required to conduct economic analysis before issuing rules. Executive Order 13045 requires agencies to address disproportionate risks to children from environmental health or safety risks in their regulations. The agency must provide OIRA with an evaluation of the environmental health or safety effects of a planned regulation on children and explain why it is preferable to other feasible alternatives. Executive Order 13132 requires agencies to prepare a federalism summary impact statement for rules with significant federalism implications, including consultation with State and local officials. The executive order mandates consultation with State and local officials and requires agencies to ensure meaningful input from tribal officials in developing regulatory policies with tribal implications. Agencies must consult with tribal officials before promulgating regulations that preempt tribal law, provide a tribal impact statement to OMB, and submit a Statement of Energy Effects to OMB as required by Executive Order 13211. The executive orders mandate agencies to consult with State, local, and tribal officials when developing regulatory policies. Agencies must also submit a \"Statement of Energy Effects\" to OMB for significant energy actions, detailing adverse effects on energy supply and reasonable alternatives. Executive orders give agencies discretion to define key terms, and OMB has published a checklist for regulatory impact analyses. The checklist provided by OMB for regulatory impact analyses includes detailed requirements such as describing the need for the action, quantifying costs and benefits, justifying the action, and considering alternatives. OMB also published a document in 2011 with FAQs on Regulatory Impact Analysis. OMB provided guidance on what constitutes an \"economically significant\" rule, emphasizing the importance of clear regulatory impact analyses in plain language. Agencies are advised to consider regulatory alternatives, including deferring to state or local levels before federal intervention. In August 2011, OMB issued a primer to assist agencies in developing regulatory impact analyses for economically significant rules. The primer outlines nine steps for conducting a proper analysis, including describing the need for the regulatory action, defining the baseline, setting the time horizon, identifying regulatory alternatives, quantifying benefits and costs, and evaluating consequences. The primer issued by OMB in August 2011 outlines nine steps for conducting a proper regulatory impact analysis, including quantifying and monetizing benefits and costs, discounting future benefits and costs, evaluating non-quantified benefits and costs, and characterizing uncertainty. Congress has also mandated federal agencies to analyze the effects of certain rules before issuance, with requirements applicable to various agencies and regulations. Some requirements are specific to certain agencies or types of rules, such as those impacting the environment or small businesses. The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA) of 1995 requires covered agencies to prepare a written statement before implementing a rule that may result in significant expenditures. This includes a qualitative and quantitative assessment of costs and benefits, as well as the impact on health, safety, and the environment. The statement must also include estimates of future compliance costs and any disproportionate budgetary effects. The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA) of 1995 requires agencies to prepare a written statement before implementing a rule with significant expenditures, including cost and benefit assessments. OIRA monitors compliance with UMRA and provides an annual report. Judicial review is limited, allowing courts to compel agencies to prepare required statements. However, UMRA's analytical requirements do not apply to most economically significant rules. UMRA's requirements do not apply to most economically significant rules, giving agencies discretion in implementation. The statute does not trigger if a final rule is issued without prior notice, and only applies to expenditures over $100 million. Agencies are not required to estimate certain effects if deemed unfeasible. GAO reported in 1998 that UMRA's Title II had little impact on agencies' rulemaking. Title II of UMRA had little impact on agencies' rulemaking actions during its first two years of implementation. GAO reported that UMRA's written statement requirements did not apply to most major or economically significant final rules issued in 2001 and 2002. GAO reiterated these conclusions in February 2011, noting that there are at least 14 reasons why a rule would not be considered a \"mandate\" under UMRA. Other statutory analytical requirements have been enacted for specific issues or constituencies, such as the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. Federal agencies must include a detailed environmental impact statement in recommendations or reports for major Federal actions affecting the human environment. The statement should cover direct, indirect, and cumulative effects, adverse environmental effects, alternatives, and resource commitments. The definition of \"major Federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment\" has been a topic of dispute. The Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) of 1980 requires federal agencies to assess the impact of their regulations on small entities, including small businesses, governmental jurisdictions, and not-for-profit organizations. Agencies must prepare a \"regulatory flexibility analysis\" for proposed and final rules, detailing reasons for the regulatory action, small entities affected, compliance requirements, and more. The Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) of 1980 mandates federal agencies to evaluate the effects of their regulations on small entities. Agencies must conduct a \"regulatory flexibility analysis\" for proposed and final rules, outlining reasons for the regulatory action, impacted small entities, compliance requirements, and more. The RFA allows agencies discretion in determining when analytical requirements are necessary, and exemptions apply to final rules without a proposed rule. Initially, the RFA did not allow judicial review of agencies' actions. The Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act (SBREFA) in 1996 allowed judicial review of agencies' regulatory flexibility analyses for final rules impacting small entities. Small entities can seek judicial review within one year of the final agency action if they are adversely affected. Courts have ruled that agencies are not required to prepare regulatory flexibility analyses if the rule's effects on an industry are minimal. The Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act (SBREFA) in 1996 allowed judicial review of agencies' regulatory flexibility analyses for final rules impacting small entities. Agencies need not prepare regulatory flexibility analyses if the effects of a rule on an industry are indirect. GAO has found a lack of clarity in the act and variability in its implementation over the past 20 years. In a series of reports, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) highlighted the varying interpretations of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act (SBREFA) by different agencies. GAO recommended that Congress clarify the act's requirements and consider assigning the Small Business Administration (SBA) or another entity to develop criteria for agencies to conduct regulatory flexibility analyses. GAO also emphasized the need for defining terms like \"significant economic impact\" and \"substantial number of small entities\" for effective rulemaking under the RFA. The Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) aims to reduce paperwork burden for individuals and small businesses by defining \"collection of information\" as obtaining facts or opinions by 10 or more nonfederal persons for federal agencies. The Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) requires agencies to justify information collections from the public by establishing need, burden estimation, and least burdensome methods. OIRA oversees government-wide efforts to reduce paperwork burden and agencies need OIRA approval for each collection request. The Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) mandates agencies to justify information collections by obtaining OIRA approval for each request, renewed every three years. Failure to secure approval or its lapse triggers the PRA's public protection provision, exempting non-compliance if no valid OMB control number is displayed. OIRA can disapprove collections inconsistent with PRA requirements, but multi-headed agencies can override OIRA disapprovals. Executive order and statutory analytical requirements vary in analysis types, amounts, and applicable agencies and rules. The Executive Order 12866 and OMB Circular A-4 have detailed requirements for rules affecting the economy over $100 million annually, but do not apply to independent regulatory agencies. The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act has similar analytical requirements but applies to a smaller percentage of rules due to limitations. The Regulatory Flexibility Act is broader in coverage. The Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) is broader in coverage than Executive Order 12866 and UMRA, as it applies to independent regulatory agencies. However, the RFA does not apply to rules issued without a notice of proposed rulemaking or to rules that agencies certify will not have a significant economic impact on small entities. The Paperwork Reduction Act covers independent regulatory agencies but only pertains to collections of information, not the rules themselves. The Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) and the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) have more limited analytical requirements compared to Executive Order 12866 and OMB Circular A-4. Independent regulatory agencies may not be covered by these requirements, but individual statutes may mandate cost-benefit or economic analysis. A report examines the analytical requirements in statutes for selected independent regulatory agencies, with a focus on concerns related to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. The five banking agencies, including the Federal Reserve and SEC, responded to Senators' inquiries about economic analysis requirements for rulemaking. The OIG for the Federal Reserve stated that statutes do not mandate economic analysis for rulemaking, but the PRA and RFA require limited evaluations. The SEC OIG report identified statutory provisions requiring the commission to analyze the impact of its rules, such as the National Securities Market Improvement Act and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These provisions mandate considerations like promoting efficiency, competition, and capital formation, as well as assessing the impact on competition when making rules and regulations. The SEC and the Secretary of the Treasury must consider the impact on competition when adopting rules or regulations under this chapter. They should not impose unnecessary burdens on competition, and must justify any burden imposed in the statement of basis and purpose. The SEC OIG report highlighted the importance of conducting cost-benefit or economic analyses in SEC rulemaking, despite certain regulations not applying. The SEC OIG report emphasized the importance of conducting cost-benefit analyses in SEC rulemaking activities, aligning with executive order requirements. While the SEC chairman confirmed the practice, another commissioner noted the lack of analysis in rulemakings dictated by law. The FDIC OIG report highlighted the need for cost-benefit analyses in regulatory actions, noting specific requirements and guidelines for the FDIC. The Riegle Community Development and Regulatory Improvement Act requires Federal banking agencies to consider administrative burdens and benefits of new regulations on insured depository institutions. The CFTC OIG report highlighted the need for cost-benefit analysis before issuing certain regulations under the Commodity Exchange Act. The CFTC must consider costs and benefits when promulgating regulations under the Commodity Exchange Act. In 2010, a template for cost-benefit analysis was created for Dodd-Frank Act proposed rules, stating that the Commission is not required to quantify costs and benefits but must consider various factors such as market protection, efficiency, and public interest. The CFTC is required to consider costs and benefits when creating regulations under the Commodity Exchange Act. In 2010, a template for cost-benefit analysis was established for Dodd-Frank Act proposed rules, emphasizing the need to weigh the benefits against the costs. The Commission is not obligated to quantify costs and benefits but must take into account factors like market protection, efficiency, and public interest. Additionally, in May 2011, the CFTC developed \"Staff Guidance on Cost-Benefit Considerations for Final Rulemakings under the Dodd-Frank Act,\" instructing staff to consider costs and benefits in a manner consistent with the statutory mandate. The guidance allows for choosing quantitative analysis to address comments on costs and benefits. Section 315 of the Dodd-Frank Act designated OCC as an independent regulatory agency, exempting it from certain requirements. The Treasury OIG report noted requirements in the Riegle Act for Federal banking agencies to consider administrative burdens and benefits of new regulations on insured depository institutions. The OCC is no longer subject to certain requirements due to its designation as an independent regulatory agency under the Dodd-Frank Act. The Riegle Act requires the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Office of Thrift Supervision, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to consider costs and benefits in their regulations. The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System is also covered by this requirement. However, the statutory requirements are not as detailed as those in Executive Order 12866 or OMB Circular A-4, only requiring agencies to \"consider\" costs and benefits without a detailed analysis. The National Securities Market Improvement Act, Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Riegle Act, and Commodities Exchange Act all require regulatory agencies to \"consider\" various factors such as efficiency, competition, capital formation, administrative burdens, costs, and benefits in their rulemaking processes. However, the lack of specificity in these requirements raises questions about how agencies will conduct systematic economic analysis of proposed regulations. The U.S. Court of Appeals emphasized the SEC's obligation to assess the economic impact of its rules. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, created under the Dodd-Frank Act, is expected to issue regulations affecting financial institutions. The Dodd-Frank Act requires the CFPB to consider potential benefits and costs to consumers and covered persons before issuing regulations. Unlike other banking agencies, the CFPB is not specifically required to prepare detailed cost-benefit analyses. The Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) testified about their response to Executive Order 13563, highlighting their extensive cost-benefit analysis requirements when issuing safety rules since 1981. Commissioner Adler emphasized the stringent provisions in their organic statute for regulatory analysis before rule issuance. The CPSC has issued only nine mandatory safety rules in the last 30 years, preferring to work with voluntary standards and negotiate individual Corrective Action Plans for hazardous products. Commissioner Northup stated that most regulations mandated by the CPSIA do not require cost-benefit analysis, and the commission has never conducted a full analysis of any regulation under the CPSIA. An analysis found that many regulations required by the act may not be justified. Executive Order 12866 mandates cost-benefit analyses for rules with significant economic impact. A 2011 report examined 100 rules from 2010, with 37 involving $100 million transfers and 10 expected to prompt $100 million in consumer spending. The analysis found that many regulations required by Executive Order 12866 may not be justified. In 2011, a report examined 100 rules from 2010, with 37 involving $100 million transfers and 10 expected to prompt $100 million in consumer spending. Thirty-nine rules were considered major due to their expected impact on annual consumer spending or establishing fees for federal functions. In 20 of these rules, estimated costs and benefits were both expected to exceed $100 million, with regulatory benefits often outweighing compliance costs. OMB's annual reports on regulations also show how federal agencies estimate the costs and benefits of their rules. In the 2013 report, OMB indicated that executive agencies issued 47 major final rules during FY2012. Of these, 22 were \"transfer\" rules involving monetary transfers, with costs estimated between $14.8 billion and $19.5 billion, and benefits between $53.2 billion and $114.6 billion. Independent regulatory agencies issued 23 major final rules, with 17 providing information on costs and benefits. The SEC, CFTC, and CFPB issued rules in FY2012 with monetized costs, but no monetized benefits. OMB highlighted the lack of transparency in cost-benefit analyses by independent regulatory agencies. The lack of transparency in cost-benefit analyses by independent regulatory agencies is a continued obstacle to transparency and may have adverse effects on public policy. Previous OMB reports show patterns of analysis, such as in the 2012 report where executive agencies issued major final rules with quantified costs and benefits. Independent regulatory agencies issued rules without monetized benefits in FY2011. In FY2010, executive agencies issued 66 major final rules, with 18 rules having monetized costs and benefits totaling between $18.8 billion and $86.1 billion. Independent regulatory agencies issued 17 major final rules, with none including monetized benefits. The information from September 30, 2012, shows that 64% of agency rules included details on costs or benefits. The reports from CRS and OMB draw conclusions on regulatory analysis, indicating that economic analyses may not significantly reduce compliance costs or increase regulatory benefits. Cabinet departments and independent agencies are more likely to provide cost-benefit analyses with monetized estimates compared to independent regulatory agencies. However, not all rules from these agencies contain such estimates. In December 2013, GAO published a report on regulatory analyses conducted for rules issued under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. Most agencies completed required analyses, with estimated benefits generally exceeding costs. Independent regulatory agencies like the SEC and NRC were more likely to estimate costs compared to agencies like the FCC and Federal Reserve System. In the 113th Congress, bills were introduced to modify requirements for regulatory impact analysis. H.R. 899, the Unfunded Mandates Information and Transparency Act of 2014, aimed to broaden analysis requirements under UMRA. Several bills introduced in the 113th Congress aimed to modify requirements for regulatory impact analysis. H.R. 2122, the Regulatory Accountability Act of 2013, would require agencies to conduct cost-benefit analysis when issuing rules. H.R. 2542, the Regulatory Flexibility Improvements Act of 2013, would amend and expand current analysis requirements. H.R. 3863 and S. 2099, the Sound Regulation Act of 2014, would also amend the APA to require cost-benefit analysis. H.R. 5184 and S. 2153, the National Regulatory Budget Act of 2014, would establish an Office of Regulatory Analysis for independent cost-benefit analysis. S. 1173, the Independent Agency Regulatory Analysis Act, would also impact regulatory analysis. The Independent Agency Regulatory Analysis Act of 2014, S. 1173, would authorize the President to subject independent regulatory agencies to cost-benefit analysis requirements that currently do not apply to them. Various statutes and executive orders over the past 40 to 50 years have incrementally added requirements for agencies to conduct cost-benefit and other types of analysis before issuing proposed or final rules. The Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) and the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA) require agencies to consider costs and benefits, effects on the economy, and alternative options when issuing rules. Both acts allow agencies to combine their written statements with other analyses. There are exclusions and exceptions in the requirements, giving agencies discretion on when an analysis is needed. For example, the RFA does not apply to rules issued without prior notice, and agencies can avoid flexibility analyses with certification. UMRA provides exemptions for economically significant rules that do not impact a substantial number of small entities. Executive orders on children, federalism, and energy allow agencies to avoid analytical requirements if certain conditions are met. Executive Order 12866 and OMB Circular A-4 have extensive analytical requirements but do not apply to independent regulatory agencies or non-economically significant rules. Congress may choose to maintain the current analytical framework. Congress may choose to maintain the current analytical framework or enact bills that could result in more detailed analyses. Some bills would bring substantial changes to existing requirements, while others may not significantly alter the regulatory analysis landscape. Consolidating all analytical requirements into one place could be a more comprehensive approach, potentially expanding the scope of agencies or types of analysis required. The current analytical framework for regulatory analysis may be expanded by adding elements to Executive Order 12866 and OMB Circular A-4. This could include ensuring that certain agencies and types of economic effects are included, such as effects on small entities or state, local, or tribal governments. Changes could potentially be made by amending the executive order and circular without congressional action. Obtaining better information on the costs and benefits of independent regulatory agencies' rules has been deemed desirable, with the absence of such information seen as an obstacle to transparency. Expanding cost-benefit analysis requirements to independent regulatory agencies and having them submit their rules for review by OIRA may face resistance from those who want these agencies to remain independent. Sally Katzen, a former OIRA Administrator, supports this expansion and suggests a \"sense of the Congress\" resolution to address concerns. Another option is to amend the executive order to mandate this review process. One option to address concerns about expanding cost-benefit analysis requirements to independent regulatory agencies is to establish a \"congressional office of regulatory analysis\" or give agencies the authority to override objections from OIRA. Alternatively, Congress could enact legislation to cover independent agencies under the executive order's requirements. Supporters of codifying cost-benefit analysis principles include Susan Dudley and Professor Peter L. Strauss. They believe legislation could emphasize certain types of analyses and make compliance with requirements judicially reviewable. Dudley also suggests that codification could signal congressional support for these principles and apply them to independent regulatory agencies. However, some observers oppose the codification of these requirements. Some observers oppose codification of cost-benefit analysis requirements in Executive Order 12866, citing concerns about the effectiveness of existing regulations and the potential loss of flexibility for future administrations. One option to subject independent regulatory agencies to Executive Order 12866 requirements is for Congress to amend the statutory definition of such agencies referenced in the order. This could include designating certain agencies as subject to the order for cost-benefit analysis. The proposal suggests amending Executive Order 12866 to include certain agencies under its analytical and rule submission requirements. This would not prevent future Presidents from changing the order. Any consolidation or reform of rulemaking requirements should consider existing laws that mandate cost-benefit analysis in some statutes, prohibit it in others, and leave it optional in others. Executive Orders 12866 and 13563 emphasize adherence to authorizing statutes and the principles of rulemaking. Congress should enact legislation superseding existing law with full recognition of consequences. Cost-benefit analysis requirements for the President and Congress should consider data availability and potential need for additional resources. The cost of conducting regulatory analyses can be in the hundreds of thousands of dollars, and more detailed analyses for more rules would likely require agencies to allocate more resources. The agencies may argue that they need additional resources to prepare detailed analyses for more rules."
