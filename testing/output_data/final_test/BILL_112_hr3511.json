Congress finds that establishing a nationally uniform baseline of protection from civil liability for persons using automated external defibrillators (AEDs) in perceived medical emergencies will encourage the deployment of additional AEDs and ultimately save lives lost to cardiac arrest. The current State \"Good Samaritan\" laws are incomplete, inconsistent, and inadequate in providing protection for entities acquiring or deploying AEDs. Concerns about liability are inhibiting the widespread deployment of AEDs, especially for entities with operations in multiple states. A nationally uniform baseline of protection is needed for persons using AEDs in medical emergencies to encourage their deployment and save lives lost to cardiac arrest. SEC. 3.
