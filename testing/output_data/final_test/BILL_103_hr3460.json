    "content": "The Act titled \"Hazardous Materials Transportation Act Reauthorization Amendments of 1993\" defines packaging in certain sections and amends regulations. SEC. 3 of the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act amends regulations related to the transportation of hazardous materials, including requirements for packaging. SEC. 4 addresses registration. SEC. 4 of the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act amends registration requirements, allowing the Secretary to waive filing and fee obligations for non-US domiciled persons offering hazardous materials for transportation to the US from abroad. SEC. 5 amends inspection requirements by changing \"packages\" to \"packagings\". SEC. 6 updates penalties by replacing \"package\" with \"packaging\". SEC. 7 authorizes appropriations for the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act. SEC. 8 focuses on training. The Hazardous Materials Transportation Act is amended to include Supplemental Training Grants for national nonprofit employee organizations solely engaged in firefighting to train individuals responding to hazardous materials incidents. Grants can be used to identify areas needing hazardous materials training. Fire departments require hazardous materials training to prioritize needs, develop evaluation methods, train instructors, purchase equipment, and disseminate data nationwide. The Secretary can only grant funds to organizations that agree to use the training courses in the fiscal year. The Secretary can grant funds for hazardous materials training courses to individuals with statutory responsibility to respond to accidents. Additional terms and conditions may be imposed on grants as necessary. A report on the allocation and uses of training grants must be submitted to Congress by September 30, 1997. The Secretary can grant funds for hazardous materials training courses to individuals with statutory responsibility to respond to accidents. A report on the allocation and uses of training grants must be submitted to Congress by September 30, 1997. Training grants authorized for fiscal years 1993 through 1996 and grants authorized for fiscal years 1995 and 1996 must include detailed accounting of expenditures, number of employees trained, and evaluation of training programs. Amendments to funding section 117A(i)(2) include a general program and a supplemental program funded from fees. The Secretary is authorized to allocate funds for hazardous materials training programs. Funding sources include fees and appropriations from general revenues for fiscal years 1995-1998. Amendments to section 118 of the Act address hazmat employee training programs. Amendments were made to section 118 of the Act, including changes to subsections (a), (b), and (c), as well as the addition of subsection (d) for funding allocation. Conforming amendments were also made to section 117A(h) by removing references to section 118. Amendments to the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act include changing \"package\" to \"packaging\" in section 120 and introducing computerized telecommunication data center pilot projects in section 10. The Secretary of Transportation may make grants for a pilot project to establish a reporting system for hazardous materials transported by motor carriers. The project must involve multiple carriers and provide information for responses to accidents. The Secretary of Transportation may impose terms and conditions on grants for a pilot project involving motor carriers transporting hazardous materials. The project must include carriers specializing in hazardous materials and less than truck-load shipments, and may involve multimodal movements. Coordination with existing government and private projects is required. The Secretary of Transportation may require pilot projects to be carried out in conjunction with similar government and private projects. The Federal share of the project cost is typically 100%, but can be lower if agreed upon by the grantee. A report on the project results must be submitted to Congress by December 31, 1997. $1,000,000 is authorized for each of fiscal years 1995 and 1996 to carry out these projects. SEC. 11. STUDY OF HAZARDOUS WASTES TRANSPORTATION NEAR FEDERAL PRISONS. The Secretary of Transportation will conduct a study on the safety considerations of transporting hazardous wastes near Federal prisons, especially those with maximum security prisoners. The study will assess the ability to evacuate prisoners in emergencies and identify any necessary training, equipment, or personnel. A report with recommendations for legislative or regulatory changes to improve transportation safety will be submitted to Congress within one year of this Act's enactment. Regulatory changes are being considered to improve the safety of transporting hazardous wastes near Federal prisons, with a focus on maximum security facilities. SEC. 12. STUDY OF RADIO MICROWAVE TECHNOLOGIES AND HIGHWAY SAFETY. The Secretary of Transportation will conduct a study with the National Academy of Sciences on the safety of radar detectors and radio microwave technologies in commercial motor vehicles, including warning drivers of road hazards. The study will focus on accident sites, high accident rate road segments, and conditions affecting visibility. Consultation with various stakeholders will be conducted, including the commercial motor vehicle industry, radar detector manufacturers, users, and highway safety advocates. The study will also explore the use of radio microwave technologies in intelligent vehicle highway systems. The Secretary of Transportation will provide necessary information to the entity conducting the study on accident sites and road conditions. The entity must report its findings and recommendations to the Secretary and Congress by September 30, 1995. Upon receiving the report, the Secretary will begin a review and report process. The Secretary of Transportation will review Federal policies on radar detectors and radio microwave technologies in commercial motor vehicles, including those transporting hazardous materials. Within 120 days of receiving the report, the Secretary will report to Congress and outline any planned administrative actions. The term \"radio microwave technology\" refers to devices emitting or detecting radio microwaves, such as radar detectors. The Secretary of Transportation will allocate up to $500,000 from funds under section 104(a) of title 23, United States Code, for the implementation of policies regarding radar detectors and radio microwave technologies in commercial motor vehicles. This section does not affect the Secretary's existing authority or discretion in administrative actions. SEC. 13 prohibits billboards on scenic byways by amending Section 131(s) of title 23, United States Code. SEC. 14 allows the use of fibre drum packaging. The Secretary of Transportation must start a rulemaking process within 60 days to determine if openhead fiber drum packaging can meet requirements for transporting liquid hazardous materials. This is in relation to classifications of liquid hazardous materials transported by such drums under regulations from September 30, 1991. The standards for packaging may differ from the current performance-oriented standards. The Secretary of Transportation must start a rulemaking process to determine if alternative packaging standards can provide equal or greater safety for transporting liquid hazardous materials. The rulemaking must be completed by October 1, 1995, and does not apply to packaging for materials regulated as poisonous by inhalation. The Materials Transportation Act allows the Secretary of Transportation to issue regulations for international transportation of hazardous materials. HR 3460 IH is a bill related to the international transportation of hazardous materials."
