    "content": "The \"Protect Women's Health From Corporate Interference Act of 2014\" ensures that employers providing health benefits cannot deny specific health benefits, including contraception coverage, to employees or their dependents entitled by Federal law. Congress finds that access to the full range of health benefits and preventive services is crucial for all Americans to lead healthier lives. Birth control is identified as a critical health service for women, with a high percentage of women using it for various health benefits in addition to preventing pregnancy. Access to birth control pills is crucial for women's health and economic success. More than 1,500,000 women use birth control pills for noncontraceptive purposes. The Institute of Medicine recommends that women's preventive health, including contraceptive methods, be covered by health plans with no cost-sharing to promote optimal health. This recommendation is considered one of the most important for women. Affordability has been a barrier for women to access birth control and preventive health services. Studies show that cost concerns lead women to switch to less effective contraception methods. Lack of health coverage is linked to reduced use of prescription contraceptives. Cost-sharing requirements can significantly decrease preventive health care utilization, especially among lower-income women. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act removed cost-sharing barriers for women's preventative services, including contraception. This provision has successfully increased access to contraception, with 47 million women covered by the requirement as of 2013. In 2013, 47 million women benefited from the Affordable Care Act's removal of cost-sharing barriers for preventive services, saving $483 million in out-of-pocket costs for oral contraceptives. 76 million people, including 30 million women, are newly eligible for expanded preventive services coverage. The most suitable contraception method varies based on individual needs and medical history. The full range of FDA-approved contraceptive methods should be available to women based on their individual needs and medical history. Providing contraception coverage has been shown to lower healthcare spending and improve health outcomes. Studies have shown that not providing contraceptive coverage can cost employers 15 to 17 percent more in employee health plans. The Supreme Court ruled in Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc. that some for-profit corporations can remove birth control coverage from their employees' health plans. Employers have filed cases to take away this benefit, citing direct and indirect costs related to pregnancy. In the Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc. case, Justice Ginsburg criticized the decision for allowing employers to deny contraceptive coverage based on religious beliefs, potentially leading to objections to other health services like blood transfusions and vaccinations. This ruling could impact women's access to essential healthcare services. Legislation is needed to prevent discrimination against employees and dependents in women's health services. Congress must reinstate contraception coverage and protect employees' entitlement to other health benefits under Federal law. SEC. 4. ENSURING COVERAGE OF SPECIFIC BENEFITS. An employer must provide coverage for specific health care items or services required by Federal law in their group health plan, regardless of any other provisions. This includes coverage mandated by the Public Health Service Act, such as section 2713. The provisions of this Act apply to plan sponsors, group health plans, and health insurance issuers, with regulations from specific sections of the Code of Federal Regulations. Enforcement for non-compliance is through existing laws related to employee benefits and healthcare. The provisions of this Act can be enforced through various existing laws related to employee benefits and healthcare."
