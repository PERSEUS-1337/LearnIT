It aims to certify products that are at least 20% more efficient than standard ones in the market. The WaterSense program, created by the EPA in 2006, certifies highly efficient water products that are at least 20% more efficient than standard ones in the market. EPA has issued performance-based water-use specifications for various product categories, with manufacturers submitting their products for testing to obtain a WaterSense label. Legislative proposals have been introduced to establish the program in law to facilitate its expansion. Establishing the WaterSense program in law would give it official status and address funding issues. Several bills in the 114th Congress aimed to codify the program, set water-efficiency standards, promote the WaterSense label, and provide public information. One such bill, S.Amdt. 3221 to S. 2012, was approved by the Senate in April 2016. The WaterSense program may be codified into law to establish official status and address funding issues. Various bills in the 114th Congress aimed to set water-efficiency standards, promote the WaterSense label, and provide public information. Legislation such as S. 2012 and S. 2848 included provisions to achieve additional water savings, with proposed appropriations ranging from $5 million to $50 million over four years. Several bills in the 114th Congress aimed to codify the WaterSense program, with proposed appropriations ranging from $5 million to $50 million over four years. Bills such as H.R. 291, S. 1894, S. 2533, H.R. 5247, H.R. 8, and H.R. 3720 all included provisions to establish the program in law and allocate funding for its implementation. Several bills in the 114th Congress focused on research and development of technologies to improve water use efficiency. S. 653 proposed reauthorizing the Water Resources Research Act and providing grant funding for water supply research. Other bills like H.R. 291, S. 176, and S. 2848 also included similar provisions. Additionally, bills addressed the western U.S. drought by directing the U.S. Geological Survey to establish a water data system. The U.S. Geological Survey is tasked with establishing a water data system to improve water management, research, and monitoring. Bills like H.R. 291, S. 176, S. 1837, and S. 1894 aim to enhance water data availability. S. 1485, the Water Efficiency Innovation Act, focuses on advancing energy-water efficiency research. H.R. 4653 addresses financial and technical aspects related to water and wastewater treatment facilities. H.R. 4653 addresses financial and technical management of water systems under the Safe Drinking Water Act. It proposes EPA criteria for water loss technology and leak control. Buildings consume 13% of US water daily, with 26% by commercial buildings and 74% by homeowners. EPA's WaterSense program focuses on water efficiency in residential and commercial buildings. The federal government directs federal agencies to use water-efficient products and services in buildings. Executive Orders mandate water and energy evaluations, efficiency measures, and reduction of water consumption intensity. Executive Order 13693 focuses on federal environmental and energy initiatives. Executive Order (May 25, 2015) extends water consumption reduction requirements for federal buildings to FY2025, including potable water reduction, water meter installation, and green infrastructure features. New federal buildings over 5,000 sq ft must aim to be \"water net-zero\" by FY2030. Agencies are directed to prioritize water conservation and management practices. The 114th Congress introduced bills to improve water use efficiency in federal buildings, including giving preference to WaterSense-certified products and services. Bills like H.R. 3720 and S. 869 aimed to promote energy and water savings measures in federal buildings. The 114th Congress introduced bills to improve energy and water efficiency in federal buildings. Bills like S. 720 / H.R. 2177 and H.R. 614 aimed to direct federal building energy managers to adopt energy and water conservation measures. Other bills, such as H.R. 568 and H.R. 8, focused on the impact of thermal insulation on energy and water use systems in federal buildings. Additionally, S. 535 addressed energy and water use efficiency in commercial buildings. The bill requires the General Services Administration (GSA) to develop model leasing provisions for energy and water efficiency in commercial buildings. It also mandates GSA to create policies for federal agencies and share them with state and local governments. The 114th Congress introduced bills to promote water efficiency through technical and financial assistance for water conservation practices. Several bills proposed establishing a Smart Energy and Water Efficiency Pilot Program to award grants for innovative technologies in energy and water efficiency. Separate legislation aimed to provide grants for technical assistance and financing of innovative technologies for water and wastewater systems. Authorized funding for this program would be $50 million per year. The legislation proposed funding of $50 million per year for various grant programs aimed at improving water efficiency in manufacturing, increasing resilience of water systems, and addressing drought conditions in the western U.S. The legislation proposed funding for grants to support innovative stormwater management projects, including green infrastructure techniques to reduce and treat stormwater at its source. Other bills aimed to authorize assistance for incentive programs promoting residential water efficiency. The legislation proposed to authorize EPA to provide assistance for consumer incentive programs promoting residential water efficiency and establish a federal financing program for water infrastructure projects in western states. The Reclamation Infrastructure Finance and Investment Act (RIFIA) aims to fund projects focused on water and energy efficiency in water supply development. In 2014, Congress enacted the Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (WIFIA) to be implemented by EPA and the Army Corps of Engineers nationwide, while the Reclamation Infrastructure Finance and Investment Act (RIFIA) would be implemented by the Bureau of Reclamation in western states. Several bills in the 114th Congress proposed federal credit assistance for projects in western states and incentives for improved water use efficiency through the federal tax code. This included bills for a refundable federal tax credit for water-harvesting systems like rain barrels to reduce water usage. In the 114th Congress, bills were introduced to amend the tax code for water conservation measures, similar to energy efficiency rebates. States like Arizona and Texas offer tax exemptions for water-saving systems. Multiple bills addressed water use efficiency and conservation policies in Congress. In the 114th Congress, multiple bills were introduced to address water use efficiency and conservation policies. Several bills proposed establishing the WaterSense program in law and authorizing grants or financial assistance. One bill, H.R. 3720, touched on various aspects of water efficiency, including WaterSense, water use in buildings, financial assistance, and tax incentives. Other proposals included water efficiency as part of comprehensive policy proposals on topics like energy policy. In the 114th Congress, various bills were introduced to address water use efficiency and conservation policies, including proposals to establish the WaterSense program in law and provide financial assistance. Legislation on energy policy also included considerations for water efficiency, but there is currently no federal policy specifically addressing water use efficiency or conservation. Interest in addressing pressures on water resources has increased due to population and economic growth, pollution, and other challenges. Some analysts believe this issue is as important as energy at a national level."
