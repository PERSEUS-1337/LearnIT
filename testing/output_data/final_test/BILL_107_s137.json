    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Americas Free Trade Act\". Congress finds that the peaceful relations and economic prosperity in the Western Hemisphere are enhanced by reducing trade barriers. The establishment of a North American Free Trade Area serves as a model for decreasing trade barriers and promoting prosperity throughout the region. The reduction of government interference in the economy, promotion of economic freedoms, and observance of free trade policies can alleviate poverty and promote economic, social, and political development. SEC. 3. The President will negotiate trade agreements in the Western Hemisphere to eliminate trade barriers and establish a free trade area. Agreements will be reciprocal to promote economic growth. Agreements can be bilateral or multilateral. SEC. 4. Free trade with Cuba. The provisions of this Act will only apply to Cuba if the President certifies to Congress that freedom has been restored and US citizens' claims for expropriated property have been addressed. The President must also ensure that Cuba has a democratic government, protects private property rights, and has a convertible currency before certifying freedom restoration. Cuba has a fully convertible currency domestically and internationally, all political prisoners have been released, and free speech and press rights are guaranteed. The President will prioritize negotiating a free trade agreement with Cuba upon certification of freedom restoration. SEC. 5. INTRODUCTION AND FAST-TRACK CONSIDERATION OF IMPLEMENTING BILLS.
