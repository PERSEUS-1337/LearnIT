    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Preserving Employee Wellness Programs Act\". Congress recognizes the importance of workplace wellness programs, including health risk assessments and biometric screenings, to promote healthier lifestyle choices and reduce chronic illness. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act allows employers to offer incentives for participation in wellness programs, such as discounts on insurance premiums. Congress has struck a balance to protect privacy in wellness programs, offering rewards for healthier lifestyle choices. SEC. 3. Nondiscriminatory employee wellness programs. Workplace wellness programs offered by employers shall not violate certain acts if they provide rewards to participants in compliance with regulations. The subsection applies to workplace wellness programs or health promotion programs offered by employers if the rewards are within specified limits set by regulations. The collection of information about a family member's disease or disorder in workplace wellness programs is not considered unlawful acquisition of genetic information. This does not violate the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008. The Act does not limit the application of the Americans with Disabilities Act. Employers offering wellness programs can set a deadline of up to 180 days for employees to request alternative standards. A reasonable alternative standard is provided for in section 2705(j)(3)(D) of the Public Health Service Act for wellness programs. The Act will be effective as of March 23, 2010, and will apply to the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 and the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008, including any amendments."
