    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Protecting Older Workers Against Discrimination Act\" and its purpose is outlined in the findings and purposes section. Congress reaffirmed the difficulty in detecting and proving unlawful discrimination in the Civil Rights Act of 1991. The Act approved \"mixed motive\" claims, where a protected characteristic was a motivating factor for any employment practice. Amendments were made to other civil rights statutes, including the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967. In 2009, the Supreme Court ruled in Gross v. FBL Financial Services, Inc. that mixed motive claims were not available under the ADEA, shifting the burden of proof to the complainant to show that a protected characteristic was the \"but for\" cause of an unlawful employment practice. This decision narrowed the scope of protections under statutes not amended in 1991 to address mixed motive claims. The Act aims to clarify that mixed motive claims are available under the ADEA and similar civil rights provisions, rejecting the Supreme Court's reasoning in the Gross decision. It also clarifies that complaining parties can rely on any admissible evidence.
