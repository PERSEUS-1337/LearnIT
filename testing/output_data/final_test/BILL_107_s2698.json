    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Building Our Children's Future Act of 2002\" and includes findings and purpose. According to findings, there is a significant unmet need for school construction and renovation in the United States, with a total of $112 billion required. The average age of public school buildings is 42 years, leading to deterioration. Additionally, an estimated 2,400 new public schools will be needed by 2003 to accommodate the \"baby boom echo\". Annual school construction expenditures increased by 39 percent from 1990 to 1997, reaching $24.7 billion. Studies show a positive link between school conditions and student learning. Rural schools often struggle with modernization due to limited financial resources. In 2000, the General Accounting Office reported that areas with high enrollment growth rates have the highest construction expenditures per pupil. Schools in smaller areas struggle to pay for bond financing costs due to low tax bases. Providing access to technology for students and teachers is crucial for school improvement in the 21st century. The Federal Government supports the education of students with disabilities. The purpose of this Act is to provide grants for school renovation, repair, and construction, with priority given to schools that have been damaged by natural disasters or are high poverty or high growth schools. This is to support the education of students with disabilities, which may require increased construction costs. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. This Act defines terms such as \"local educational agency,\" \"outlying area,\" \"Secretary,\" and \"State.\" From funds appropriated under subsection (c) for a fiscal year, the Secretary reserves 7.5 percent to award grants to local educational agencies that meet specific criteria regarding student enrollment. The Secretary reserves a percentage of funds for grants to local educational agencies for school construction, renovation, or repair. Additionally, a portion is reserved for grants to outlying areas for high-need school renovation or repair. The Secretary allocates funds to each State based on their previous year's funding under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. States must receive a minimum grant amount of half a percent. States must use 75 percent of the allotted funds to award grants to local educational agencies for school construction, renovation, or repair. The Secretary allocates funds to States based on previous year's funding under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. States must use 75 percent of the funds for grants to local educational agencies for school renovation or repair, prioritizing schools damaged by natural disasters or high poverty/growth schools.

Authorization of Appropriations: $1,000,000,000 is authorized for this Act for fiscal year 2003 and the following 4 years."
