Prot\u00e9g\u00e9s receive assistance in obtaining contracts, while mentors benefit from incentives. Four federal agencies have SBA-approved programs: Department of Energy, DHS, NASA, and SBA. In 2018, three federal agencies were awaiting SBA approval for their mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 programs: Department of Health and Human Services, Department of Transportation, and Department of the Treasury. These programs aim to assist small businesses, such as the 8(a) Mentor-Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Program for socially and economically disadvantaged individuals participating in the SBA's Minority Small Business and Capital Ownership Development Program. The DOD Mentor-Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Program supports small businesses as subcontractors on DOD contracts, while other agency-specific programs offer incentives for prime contract subcontracting with small businesses. Congressional interest has grown due to concerns about large businesses misusing federal contracting assistance meant for small businesses. Reports of fraud in SBA programs have also fueled this interest. During the 111th and 112th Congress, legislation authorized the SBA to establish mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 programs for various small businesses, modeled on the 8(a) Mentor-Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Program. GAO assessed the effectiveness of mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 programs, and the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013 expanded the program to include all small businesses. The SBA published a proposed rule in 2015 to establish a government-wide mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 program for small businesses, aligning with the 8(a) Business Development program. The SBA decided not to implement separate mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 programs for specific small business categories, as they would be included in the overall program. The SBA established a new government-wide mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 program for all small businesses, aligning with the 8(a) Business Development program. The program aimed to streamline and simplify the process, allowing 8(a) small businesses to participate in either program. Applications for the new program were accepted starting October 1, 2016. The new small business mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 program applies to all federal small business contracts and agencies, potentially eliminating the need for agency-specific programs. Procuring agencies can offer subcontracting incentives to mentor firms participating in the program. Various federal mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 programs aim to assist small businesses in federal contracts, but differ in scope and operations. The Small Business Administration (SBA) administers three mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 programs for different types of small businesses. These programs aim to assist small businesses in federal contracts by enhancing their capabilities and competitiveness. Amendments to the Small Business Act in 1978 directed the SBA to develop a program specifically for socially and economically disadvantaged small businesses eligible for contracts under Section 8(a) of the act. This mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 program was established on July 30, 1998. The 8(a) Mentor-Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Program aims to help 8(a) firms compete for contracts by providing various forms of assistance such as technical, management, and financial aid. The program is government-wide, allowing firms to benefit while working on contracts for any federal agency. The SBA's 8(a) Mentor-Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Program, administered by the SBA's Office of Business Development, differs from agency-specific programs. As of February 27, 2018, there were 493 active agreements. SBA regulations govern mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 qualifications, written agreements, and evaluation. Any for-profit concern can act as a mentor, including large firms, small businesses, and graduates from the 8(a) program. The SBA's 8(a) Mentor-Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Program allows for mentorship between approved firms, including large firms, small businesses, and graduates from the 8(a) program. Mentors must meet specific criteria, while prot\u00e9g\u00e9s must be small businesses owned by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals in the 8(a) program. The SBA's 8(a) Mentor-Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Program allows mentorship between approved firms in good standing. Prot\u00e9g\u00e9s must qualify as small businesses and demonstrate how mentorship will advance their business plans. Mentors can have up to three prot\u00e9g\u00e9s, while prot\u00e9g\u00e9s are generally expected to have one mentor at a time. The SBA's Mentor-Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Program requires mentors and prot\u00e9g\u00e9s to enter a written agreement approved by the SBA. The agreement obligates the mentor to provide assistance for at least one year, with the option to terminate with 30 days' notice. The SBA reviews the agreement annually to decide on its continuation based on the prot\u00e9g\u00e9's reports on the benefits received. The mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 agreement includes technical or management assistance, loans or equity investments, subcontracts, and federal contracts. The agreement automatically renews annually and can last up to three years, with a possible extension. The SBA can terminate the agreement if the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 is not benefiting adequately. Participation in the 8(a) Mentor-Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Program benefits mentors and prot\u00e9g\u00e9s by fulfilling subcontracting requirements and allowing for joint ventures. Mentor firms can assist prot\u00e9g\u00e9s in securing contracts set aside for small businesses. The 8(a) Mentor-Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Program allows mentor firms to participate in contracts set aside for small businesses and acquire up to 40% equity in prot\u00e9g\u00e9 firms. This program enables prot\u00e9g\u00e9s to receive assistance while retaining their status as \"small businesses.\" The SBA determines firm size by combining gross income or number of employees with affiliates. The 8(a) Mentor-Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Program has faced scrutiny for fraud and lack of oversight. The GAO conducted a study on the 8(a) program and mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 relationships to assess their effectiveness in increasing small business participation in government contracting. The report highlighted similarities and differences in mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 programs across federal agencies. The GAO found differences in mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 programs across federal agencies, with varying guidance on agreement length and number of mentors allowed. Only a few agencies collect information on prot\u00e9g\u00e9 progress post-agreement termination. GAO recommended all agencies consider collecting this data to assess program success. The GAO recommended that federal agencies collect information on prot\u00e9g\u00e9 progress post-agreement termination to assess program success. The SBA made revisions to its regulations for the 8(a) program, including changes to the 8(a) Mentor-Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Program. These changes tied assistance to the prot\u00e9g\u00e9's business plan, allowed mentors to have up to three prot\u00e9g\u00e9s, and permitted prot\u00e9g\u00e9s to have a second mentor in certain circumstances. The SBA made revisions to the 8(a) Mentor-Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Program, allowing mentors to have up to three prot\u00e9g\u00e9s and permitting a second mentor for prot\u00e9g\u00e9s in certain circumstances. The program also included provisions for reconsideration of denied agreements, a waiting period for resubmission after rejection, and consequences for mentors failing to provide agreed-upon assistance. The SBA implemented changes to the regulations governing joint ventures between 8(a) mentors and prot\u00e9g\u00e9s to protect non-sophisticated 8(a) firms. This includes requirements for profit sharing, work performance percentages, and reporting to the SBA. Under the amended regulations, non-8(a) firms forming joint ventures with 8(a) firms for sole-source contracts over $4 million are generally prohibited from being subcontractors. This provision mainly affects joint ventures with 8(a) firms owned by Alaska Native Corporations. The new SBA small business mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 program clarified joint venture partnership conditions and aimed to standardize agency-specific mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 programs. The SBA requires approval for mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 programs to enhance prot\u00e9g\u00e9s' competitiveness for federal contracts. Regulations issued in July 2016 outline eligibility, assistance types, relationship length, mentor benefits, and reporting requirements. DOD's Mentor-Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Program and mentoring in SBIR and STTR programs are exceptions. Effective August 24, 2016, federal agencies (excluding DOD and exempt programs) must submit a plan to the SBA Administrator for approval to continue mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 programs. Approval depends on assisting prot\u00e9g\u00e9s in competing for federal contracts and compliance with SBA regulations. Four agencies have SBA-approved programs, while DOD and exempt programs have their own programs. In 2018, three federal agencies were awaiting SBA approval for their mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 programs. Agency heads must submit a plan and receive SBA Administrator's approval before starting a new program. Agencies must report specific information annually to the SBA for agency-specific programs. Congress amended the Small Business Act in 2000 to establish the FAST Partnership Program to enhance small businesses' technological competitiveness. The FAST program aims to strengthen the technological competitiveness of small businesses by providing mentoring and other forms of assistance. SBA is authorized to make grants and agreements with states and nonprofit organizations to enhance outreach, financial support, and technical assistance for technology-based small businesses participating in SBIR programs. This includes establishing a Mentoring Network within the FAST program to provide business advice and counseling to identified candidates for the SBIR and STTR programs. The SBA awarded 24 FAST partnership awards in FY2018 to provide mentoring networks for small businesses participating in SBIR and STTR programs. The program received funding of $2 million each year from FY2010 to FY2015 and $3 million each year from FY2016 to FY2018. P.L. 114-88 directed the SBA Administrator to enhance support for small entities after disasters. The RISE After Disaster Act of 2015 directed the SBA Administrator to give special consideration to FAST applicants in disaster-affected areas. The Trump Administration proposed eliminating funding for the FAST program during the 115th Congress. The SBA's small business mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 program is similar to the 8(a) Mentor-Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Program, with necessary modifications for different types of small businesses. The program requires prot\u00e9g\u00e9s to qualify as small businesses based on their NAICS code and be socially and economically disadvantaged. The SBA's small business mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 program allows small businesses owned by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals to receive contracts under Section 8(a) of the Small Business Act. Applicants can now self-certify as small, with size protest procedures in place to prevent ineligible businesses from benefiting. The SBA's Office of Business Development administers the 8(a) Mentor-Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Program. The SBA established a separate unit within the Office of Business Development to process mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 applications and agreements efficiently. This dedicated staff aims to reduce delays in processing applications and eliminate the need for open and closed enrollment periods. As of December 1, 2018, there were 644 active small business mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 agreements. Congress authorized a pilot mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 program for DOD in 1990 to enhance capabilities. The DOD's Mentor-Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Program, established in 1990, aims to enhance the capabilities of disadvantaged small businesses as subcontractors and suppliers under Department of Defense contracts. It differs from other mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 programs by focusing on small businesses performing subcontracts. The program was initially set to expire in 1994 but has been extended multiple times, most recently through FY2021 for reimbursement of costs under existing agreements. The DOD Mentor-Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Program focuses on small businesses as subcontractors and suppliers on federal contracts. Mentors can provide unique assistance such as advance payments, progress payments, noncompetitive subcontract awards, investments in prot\u00e9g\u00e9 firms, lending money, and general business management support. The DOD Mentor-Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Program allows prime contractors to assist small businesses by providing advance payments, progress payments, noncompetitive subcontract awards, investments, lending money, and general business management support. Eligible prot\u00e9g\u00e9s include businesses owned by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, Indian tribes, Alaska Native Corporations, Native Hawaiian Organizations, organizations employing severely disabled individuals, women-owned businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned businesses, and HUBZone small businesses. The DOD Mentor-Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Program allows prime contractors to assist small businesses, including HUBZone small businesses. Mentors can rely on prot\u00e9g\u00e9s' eligibility representations, but DOD approval is required. Prot\u00e9g\u00e9s are selected by mentors, but SBA can determine ineligibility. Each mentor can have multiple prot\u00e9g\u00e9s, with agreements outlining assistance programs. As of January 1, 2018, there were 63 active agreements involving 39 mentors and 63 prot\u00e9g\u00e9s. The DOD Mentor-Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Program requires mentors to provide assistance to prot\u00e9g\u00e9s, assess progress, estimate subcontract awards, and have a program term of up to three years. The mentor firm must submit semiannual progress reports, while the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 must provide data on progress annually. The Defense Contract Management Agency conducts annual performance reviews of all mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 agreements. The Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA) conducts annual performance reviews of all mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 agreements in the DOD Mentor-Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Program. The reviews play a major role in determining the reimbursement eligibility of mentor firms for specified assistance costs and credit for unreimbursed costs towards subcontracting goals. Additionally, DOD may reimburse mentors for advance or progress payments made to assist prot\u00e9g\u00e9 firms, or credit the mentor's subcontracting plan for unreimbursed assistance provided to prot\u00e9g\u00e9s. The National Defense Authorization Act for FY2016 extended the DOD Mentor-Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Program through FY2018 for new agreements and through FY2021 for reimbursement of costs. Eligibility requirements were changed for prot\u00e9g\u00e9s to participate in the program within a five-year period, be less than half the SBA size standard, and be nontraditional defense contractors or provide critical goods/services to enhance defense capabilities. The National Defense Authorization Act for FY2016 extended the DOD Mentor-Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Program through FY2018 for new agreements and through FY2021 for reimbursement of costs. Changes aligned DOD's program with SBA's 8(a) Mentor-Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Program, ensuring assistance to mentors and prot\u00e9g\u00e9s meeting DOD needs. The act specified mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 agreement approval before affiliation, disallowed reimbursement for business development activities, and prohibited fees for certain services provided by mentors. The DOD Mentor-Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Program was extended through FY2018 for new agreements and FY2021 for cost reimbursement. Changes were made to align the program with SBA's 8(a) Mentor-Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Program, including approval before affiliation, disallowing reimbursement for business development activities, and prohibiting fees for certain services. Reporting and review requirements were added to ensure mentors were not paid to help prot\u00e9g\u00e9s bid on contracts and to stop reimbursing mentors for sending prot\u00e9g\u00e9s to other federal resources. A 2007 analysis found that most former prot\u00e9g\u00e9 firms valued their experience in the program. The DOD Mentor-Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Program has been beneficial for participants, with 93% reporting enhanced firm capabilities, 87% noting support from mentors aiding in business development, and 84% mentioning mentor support improving engineering expertise. Overall, 71% of prot\u00e9g\u00e9s were satisfied with the program, citing reasons such as increased capabilities and business growth. However, 15% expressed dissatisfaction and 21% felt they did not receive expected mentoring levels. DOD has allocated $401.4 million to mentor firms since the program's inception. The DOD Mentor-Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Program has received funding from DOD since its inception. In FY2016, $28.3 million was provided, followed by $23.2 million in FY2017. Anticipated funding for FY2018 is $33.5 million, and $29.8 million for FY2019. Other agencies like DHS have their own mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 programs to encourage prime contractors to work with small businesses. These programs rely on existing authorities or publicity to incentivize participation. DHS's program allows non-8(a) firms and other entities to participate. The DHS Mentor-Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Program, established in 2003, allows non-8(a) firms and other entities to participate. The program may undergo changes in accordance with the National Defense Authorization Act for FY2013. This legislation requires agency-specific mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 programs to address eligibility, developmental assistance, relationship length, mentor benefits, and reporting requirements. The DHS Mentor-Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Program, established in 2003, aims to encourage large businesses to provide developmental assistance to small businesses. As of August 1, 2018, there were 44 active mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 agreements involving 36 mentors and 43 prot\u00e9g\u00e9s. Mentors offer various types of assistance such as personnel training, facility/equipment use, business management, financial support, and technical assistance. The program does not have a separate funding appropriation. Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 firms eligible for the DHS Mentor-Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Program include small businesses, veteran-owned small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, HUBZone small businesses, \"small disadvantaged businesses,\" and women-owned small businesses. The mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 agreement must be approved by the DHS Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization (OSDBU) and evaluated based on the mentor's developmental assistance plans. The program typically lasts for 36 months, with progress reports due at 18 months and a final report at the end. The DHS Mentor-Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Program requires mentors to submit a final report and a \"lessons learned\" evaluation separately. Participation in the program can be a source selection factor in certain procurements, giving mentors an advantage. Mentors can credit costs towards subcontracting goals and are eligible for an annual award for providing effective support to prot\u00e9g\u00e9s. DOT regulations allow mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 programs for federal transportation funding recipients. Mentor-Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Programs provide business development assistance to DBE firms, helping them expand into new areas and compete in the marketplace. Mentors offer support in setting targets, business strategies, evaluating outcomes, and monitoring key business indicators. These programs can be a source selection factor in procurements and allow mentors to credit costs towards subcontracting goals. The Illinois Department of Transportation Mentor-Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Program offers training, technical assistance, financial support, and equipment to DBE firms. Data on DBE mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 agreements is kept at the state level. DOT is seeking SBA approval for its program. DBEs can participate as mentors or prot\u00e9g\u00e9s, but all involved must be independent DBE-certified entities. The relationship is based on a written development plan. The mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 relationship in the Illinois Department of Transportation program is based on a written development plan that outlines objectives, roles, duration, and services to be provided. Mentor firms may receive credit towards contracting goals for assisting prot\u00e9g\u00e9s, but there are limitations on the amount of credit allowed. Non-DBE mentor firms cannot receive DBE credit for meeting more than half of their goal on any contract using their own prot\u00e9g\u00e9. The regulations for mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 programs prohibit a non-DBE mentor firm from receiving DBE credit for using its own prot\u00e9g\u00e9 on consecutive contracts. Congressional interest in these programs has grown due to concerns about large businesses misusing them for federal contracts. The SBA suspended a mentor for fraud in the 8(a) Mentor-Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Program. The SBA's oversight issues with the 8(a) Mentor-Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Program, including fraud cases and lack of proper monitoring, have led to congressional interest. New regulations have been implemented to prevent waste, fraud, and abuse in the program. GAO recommends collecting post-completion information to ensure small businesses benefit as intended. Congressional oversight or proposed legislation may continue due to these developments. Federal agencies sponsoring agency-specific mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 programs must report annually to the SBA on small business participants, assistance provided, and prot\u00e9g\u00e9s' progress in competing for federal contracts. This information is crucial for congressional oversight and may lead to additional reporting requirements for federal agencies. The annual reporting requirements for federal agencies sponsoring mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 programs include the number of agreements, total reimbursements to mentor firms, details of agreements exceeding three years, justifications for reimbursements exceeding limits, and progress trends in employment, revenues, and agency contract participation by prot\u00e9g\u00e9 firms."
