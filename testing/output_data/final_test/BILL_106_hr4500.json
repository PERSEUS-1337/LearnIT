Funds shall not be used to employ more than 75 full-time equivalent positions in the Office of the Director for fiscal year 2001 or 2002. SEC. 3. PLANT GENOMICS. The National Science Foundation can provide grants for regional plant genome and gene expression research centers to develop basic plant genome research, extend genomics research through breeding programs, and serve as scientific information hubs. Grant awards will be given through a competitive process to ensure representation of various agronomic environments. The National Science Foundation will not provide more than 50% of the cost for establishing any research and development center. They may use up to $3,000,000 for fiscal year 2001 and $3,100,000 for fiscal year 2002 to carry out this section. SEC. 4. RESEARCH ON LEARNING. The National Science Foundation will provide grant awards for research on learning in four key areas: brain research, behavioral and cognitive aspects of learning, STEM learning in formal and informal settings, and learning in complex educational systems. The research aims to integrate scientific disciplines, understand the connection between research and education, and test hypotheses across disciplines. The National Science Foundation will provide grants for the establishment of research centers on learning to support multidisciplinary teams of researchers. $25,000,000 for fiscal year 2001 and $29,000,000 for fiscal year 2002 will be available for this purpose. Additionally, $6,000,000 for fiscal year 2001 is allocated for the establishment of these centers through a peer-reviewed competition. The National Science Foundation will sponsor a conference on human learning and education research within 6 months of the enactment of this Act. $25,000,000 for fiscal year 2001 and $28,000,000 for fiscal year 2002 will be available for the Interagency Education Research Initiative. The National Science Foundation will sponsor a conference on human learning and education research to review past research, assess current efforts, and develop recommendations for outstanding research issues across various disciplines. SEC. 5. TECHNICAL AMENDMENTS. The National Science Foundation Act of 1950 is amended to make technical changes. SEC. 6. REPORTS ELIMINATION. Section 3003(a)(1) of the Federal Reports Elimination and Sunset Act of 1995 does not apply to reports required under specific provisions of various laws related to science and engineering, including the National Science Foundation Act of 1950 and the High-Performance Computing Act of 1991.
