    "title": "SB 124",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 208.3 of the Welfare and Institutions Code defines \"juvenile facility\" and \"minor\" for the purpose of the section. A juvenile facility includes various types of facilities for the confinement of minors, while a minor is defined as a person under 18 years of age or under the maximum age of juvenile court jurisdiction confined in a juvenile facility. Solitary confinement in correctional facilities involves isolating an incarcerated person in a locked room with minimal contact with others, excluding brief periods for necessary operations or medical reasons. In juvenile facilities, solitary confinement is only allowed for individuals who pose an immediate risk to security or safety, after all other options have been exhausted. A \"voluntary time out\" can be requested by the confined person, and wards of the court are also included in these regulations. (2) All other less-restrictive options to address the risk have been attempted and exhausted. The performance of solitary confinement is done in accordance with specific guidelines. The guidelines for solitary confinement state that it should only be used for the minimum time necessary to address the risk, not exceeding four hours, and should not compromise the mental and physical health of the individual. After being in solitary confinement, the person should either return to regular programming or be placed in individualized programming without solitary confinement. If there is an immediate risk of harm upon release, the person may be placed back in solitary confinement following specific protections and requirements. Solitary confinement in juvenile facilities should not be used for discipline, punishment, coercion, convenience, or retaliation by staff. Consecutive periods of solitary confinement exceeding four hours are prohibited. Monitoring by custody staff is required for individuals at risk of harm to themselves. Documentation of each use of solitary confinement must include details such as the person's demographics, entry and release times, and the authorizing staff member's information. The use of solitary confinement in juvenile facilities must be justified and documented according to specific guidelines. Staff names, incident details, alternative actions attempted, check-in records, and public inspection availability are key requirements. Duplicative documentation is not necessary if facilities meet the specified criteria. In juvenile facilities, a person can request a voluntary time out for up to two hours within a 24-hour period. They can participate in programming and meals during this time and can end the time out by notifying staff. The request must be documented with the person's name, signature, start, and end time. This section does not limit the use of single-person rooms for housing individuals in juvenile facilities and does not apply to minors in court holding or adult facilities. It also does not conflict with laws providing greater protections for minors. In each county, a juvenile justice commission must consist of 7 to 15 citizens, including youth aged 14 to 21, parents of previously incarcerated youth, and a mental health expert. Members of the probation committee before September 15, 1961, automatically become part of the commission. Vacancies are filled by the presiding judge of the superior court with the juvenile court judge's approval. The presiding judge of the superior court, with the concurrence of the judge of the juvenile court, appoints members to the juvenile justice commission for a term of four years. Vacancies are filled by the presiding judge for the unexpired term of the predecessor. Appointments to increase commission membership to a maximum of 15 members in counties with less than 15 members can be made by the presiding judge of the superior court. In counties where the commission exceeds the maximum number, no additional appointments will be made until the number is reduced. The commission's membership in such counties shall not exceed the maximum number permitted by the section after January 1, 1974. Section 226 of the Welfare and Institutions Code is amended accordingly. The regional juvenile justice commission consists of at least 10 citizens from adjacent counties, with members including youth aged 14 to 21, parents of previously incarcerated youth, and a licensed mental health professional. Appointments are made by the presiding judge of the superior court with equal representation from participating counties. The regional justice commission is composed of members appointed by participating counties for a four-year term. Initially, members serve either two or four years based on the number appointed. Vacancies are filled by the presiding judge of the superior court with the concurrence of the judge of the juvenile court. When a vacancy occurs in the regional justice commission, it is filled by the presiding judge of the superior court with the concurrence of the judge of the juvenile court. The appointee will hold office for the unexpired term of their predecessor. Section 229 of the Welfare and Institutions Code is amended to give juvenile justice commissions the duty to inquire into the administration of the juvenile court law in their county or region. They have access to publicly administered institutions, can inspect them annually, and may hold public hearings. Juvenile court judges can issue subpoenas for witnesses and documents at commission hearings. A juvenile justice commission is required to annually inspect any facility used for confining minors for more than 24 hours, including reviewing records on solitary confinement. The commission must report findings and recommendations to the juvenile court, county board of supervisors, and Board of State and Community Corrections. The report is presented at a public meeting of the county board of supervisors and may be published online. The juvenile justice commission can recommend beneficial changes to the administration of provisions in the Welfare and Institutions Code. Recommendations can be publicized on the county government's website. The Legislature acknowledges limitations on public access to meetings and writings of public officials under Section 208.3 of the Code. To protect the privacy of individuals in juvenile facilities, identifying information must be kept confidential. If the state mandates costs, reimbursement to local agencies will be provided according to the Government Code."
