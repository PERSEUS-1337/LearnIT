The Act may be cited as the Agricultural Bioterrorism Countermeasures Act of 2001. Congress finds that the events of September 11, 2001, have raised concerns about bioterrorism threats, including attacks on the food supply and agriculture. Evidence suggests terrorists may be interested in using biological or chemical weapons, posing risks to human health, public confidence in food safety, and the economy. Developing strategies and technology is crucial to address these challenges effectively. The Act aims to strengthen research and development capacity in the US to respond to agricultural bioterrorism threats, promote collaboration between Federal, academic, and private sectors, and enhance regulatory agency capacity.

SEC. 5. CONSORTIUM FOR COUNTERMEASURES AGAINST AGRICULTURAL BIOTERRORISM. The Secretary of Agriculture will establish a Consortium for Countermeasures Against Agricultural Bioterrorism, comprised of institutions of higher education focused on research and development to enhance biosecurity in US agriculture. Membership will include 3 national centers and up to 7 additional institutions with programs related to agricultural bioterrorism. The national centers for agricultural bioterrorism will be selected based on criteria such as co-location with Department of Agriculture facilities, expertise in plant and animal diseases, affiliation with Land Grant Institutions, and coordination with State cooperative extension programs. Authorization of $50,000,000 for fiscal years 2003-2007 for national centers for agricultural bioterrorism selected based on specific criteria. The Secretary of Agriculture will award grants for research on protecting against bioterrorism in agriculture, with $30,000,000 authorized for each fiscal year from 2003 to 2007. Additionally, there will be an expansion of activities by the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service. The Secretary of Agriculture will enhance the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service by increasing inspection capacity at international points of origin, improving surveillance at ports of entry, and adopting new strategies and technology to protect against plant and animal disease organisms introduced by terrorists.
