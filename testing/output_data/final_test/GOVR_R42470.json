    "content": "Federal policy makers have a strong interest in STEM education due to its impact on the national science and engineering workforce, economic competitiveness, and national security. The U.S. STEM education system is a key source of scientists and engineers, with a significant portion of the workforce employed in STEM fields holding at least a bachelor's degree. Federal efforts in STEM education are extensive, with numerous programs and activities aimed at supporting this critical sector. Analysts have identified 105 to 252 STEM education programs at 13 to 15 federal agencies, with annual appropriations ranging from $2.8 billion to $3.4 billion. The Department of Education, National Science Foundation, and Department of Health and Human Services are key agencies in this effort, with NSF having the most funding and programs. NSF is the only agency supporting education in all science and engineering fields, making it a crucial component of federal STEM education. Funding for STEM education at NSF decreased as a percentage of the total budget between FY2003 and FY2012. The report analyzes funding trends for the NSF's main education account from FY2011 to FY2013, comparing current plan funding levels. It also examines historical funding trends at the NSF and addresses selected STEM education policy issues to provide a broader context for the conversation about federal funding for STEM education. The report looks at actual funding for the NSF from FY2003 to FY2012 in current and constant dollars, providing insight into purchasing power and inflation effects. This report analyzes the distribution of total NSF funding by appropriations account and character class, adjusting for inflation. It also notes the terms used for major appropriations accounts at NSF. This report analyzes NSF funding distribution by appropriations account and character class based on budgetary data from FY2005 to FY2014. It uses terms like \"R&D\" for research activities, \"E&T\" for education activities, and \"NIA\" for non-investment activities. Non-investment activities include administrative tasks like travel and compensation costs for proposal review panelists. The analysis is derived from NSF's annual budget requests to Congress and information provided to CRS. Funding data is adjusted for inflation and transfers between major accounts. The analysis focuses on NSF funding distribution by appropriations account and character class from FY2005 to FY2014. EPSCoR is treated as a research account program, with FY2003-FY2012 data analyzed. Funding levels for FY2009 and FY2010 exclude AR&RA funds. Constant dollar data in FY2005 dollars is generated using OMB deflator. The NSF's budget breakdown includes research and development (R&D), education and training (E&T), and non-investment activities (NIA). The character class perspective provides insight into total funding for these activities, adjusting for co-funding. Funding for E&T and R&D activities changed over time. Between FY2003 and FY2012, NSF funding for R&D increased by $1.762 billion, while funding for E&T decreased by $95 million. E&T funding fluctuated, ranging from $941 million in FY2004 to $783 million in FY2006, with a median of $840 million. In constant dollars, R&D funding remained flat from FY2005 to FY2008, with a sharp increase between FY2009 and FY2010. Between FY2003 and FY2012, NSF funding for R&D increased by $1.762 billion, while funding for E&T decreased by $95 million. Constant dollar R&D funding remained flat from FY2005 to FY2008, with a significant increase between FY2009 and FY2010 under the America COMPETES Act. Funding for E&T generally trended downward during this period. Total NSF funding in constant dollars increased by $447 million, with R&D funding growing more than the total increase, suggesting some growth in R&D funding came from E&T. Between FY2003 and FY2012, NSF funding for R&D increased while funding for E&T decreased. The distribution of NSF funding by character class changed during this period, with more funding going towards R&D activities. Congressional appropriations for R&RA and E&HR accounts are the primary sources of support for NSF mission activities. Between FY2003 and FY2012, NSF funding increased from $5.369 billion to $7.105 billion. The majority of the increase went to R&RA, while E&HR funding decreased slightly. Both R&RA and E&HR experienced fluctuations in funding levels over the observed period. Between FY2003 and FY2012, NSF funding increased by $447 million in constant dollars. R&RA funding increased by $583 million (13%), while E&HR funding decreased by $179 million (-20%). The percentage of the NSF budget dedicated to R&RA activities increased, while the percentage for E&HR decreased since FY2003. Congress reduced funding for NSF's main education account during this period. Funding trends at NSF show Congress reduced funding for NSF's main education account in FY2011 and FY2012, following years of fluctuating funding for E&HR. Changes in the budget distribution reduced education funding as a percentage of the total NSF budget. The growth in NSF research funding may have come from education-related activities, but it's unclear if this reflects evolving policy priorities or a prioritization of research over education at NSF. The NSF's historical funding trends raise questions for Congress regarding funding for the foundation and federal STEM education efforts. Key questions include the policy rationale behind STEM education funding at NSF, NSF's STEM education activities, its role within the federal STEM education portfolio, and the potential impact of changes in NSF funding. Advocates support increased funding for STEM education programs at NSF due to their perceived contribution to the U.S. science and engineering workforce. This is believed to address national workforce shortages and enhance global economic competitiveness and national security. Increasing funding across the STEM education pipeline is recommended to improve the workforce. Advocates argue that investments in STEM education will enhance U.S. student performance and increase the number of STEM graduates. They support programs to improve teaching, offer scholarships, and attract students to STEM fields. However, some analysts believe that there is no shortage of STEM graduates and that the focus should be on demand rather than supply. They argue that the U.S. produces more science and engineering students than there are jobs available. Analysts debate the shortage of STEM workers in the U.S., suggesting demand-side policies, improved labor market signaling, and addressing root problems like poverty. Some argue that the disagreement can be resolved by the fact that many people with STEM talent divert from STEM occupations. Analysts argue that the economy values STEM competencies in both STEM and non-STEM fields, leading to workforce shortages. They recommend focusing on personal interest in STEM, integrating STEM skills into various disciplines, and increasing funding for STEM education. Funding for STEM education at NSF primarily supports postsecondary students and research on teaching and learning in STEM fields. Most funding goes to programs like GRF and IGERT for graduate students, as well as programs like Discovery Research K-12 and Mathematics and Science Partnership for K-12 STEM education improvement. Other objectives receive smaller portions of the budget. The federal STEM education effort lacks program evaluations, but the NSF conducts evaluations for its programs. The GAO recommended improvements for federal STEM education program evaluations, including better survey response rates and outcome measurement criteria. The NSF plays a significant role in federal STEM education funding, with a portion of $1.2 billion out of a total of $3.4 billion in FY2010. The NSF plays a significant role in federal STEM education funding, with a portion of $1.2 billion out of a total of $3.4 billion in FY2010. NSF's primary mission includes education across all fields of science and engineering, making changes at the NSF impactful on the federal STEM education effort. NSF focuses on STEM education research and development, identifying effective practices through research and small-scale testing. Additionally, NSF provides scholarships, fellowships, and financial support to STEM students and institutions of higher education. Since its establishment in 1952, the NSF's Graduate Research Fellowship program has supported researchers and students in STEM fields, providing financial and educational incentives for students to pursue STEM careers. NSF estimates it supports about 5% of science and engineering graduate students in the US, in addition to funding programs to increase diversity in STEM fields. The NSF funds programs to increase diversity in STEM fields and provide out-of-school STEM education. There is a debate about the necessity of NSF STEM education programs within the federal STEM education portfolio. The Obama Administration proposed a reorganization of federal STEM education. The Obama Administration proposed a reorganization of the federal STEM education portfolio in the FY2014 budget request, with a prominent role for NSF. Policy makers are concerned about duplication in federal STEM education efforts and the dissemination of NSF-funded research. Some suggest consolidating or eliminating NSF's STEM education programs due to perceived lack of coordination. Preliminary findings from a 2011 GAO report indicated potential duplication in federal teacher quality programs. The December 2011 NSTC inventory found little overlap and no duplication in federal STEM education programs. A 2012 GAO report stated that 83% of federal STEM education programs overlapped to some degree but not necessarily duplicative. Policy makers debate federal program consolidation to reduce duplication and potentially save costs. Some policy makers propose program consolidation to transfer control to states and reduce costs, but others object due to concerns about shifting power between branches. The GAO found that consolidation may be more expensive in the short term and not lead to long-term savings if workloads are not reduced. Consolidation opponents raise concerns about merging programs, particularly STEM education programs needing specified funding streams to avoid being overlooked. The impact of federal STEM education program consolidation at the NSF will depend on the programs consolidated, how it is done, funding stream effects, and duplication with other federal STEM efforts. Congress could consider full or partial consolidation of STEM programs at NSF or across the federal STEM portfolio, leading to varying savings and impacts. Another policy issue in the STEM education governance debate is the perceived lack of control. The federal STEM education governance debate revolves around the lack of coordination and overarching strategy in the current portfolio. While some see the distributed approach as responsive to agency needs, others believe a cross-agency strategy could improve efficiency. Efforts are being made by Congress and the Administration to develop a federal STEM education strategy. The America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2010 directed the NSTC to develop a federal STEM education strategy, with a focus on STEM workforce development and literacy. The strategy identified priority policy areas including K-12 teacher education, undergraduate STEM education, and serving underrepresented groups in STEM fields. The NSTC published a five-year strategic plan for federal STEM education investments in May 2013, focusing on priority areas chosen to meet national needs and Presidential priorities. Agencies have the authority to establish their own STEM education priorities. The strategic plan aims to create a diverse STEM workforce, provide quality STEM education opportunities for students, and coordinate federal STEM programs for maximum impact. The strategic plan for federal STEM education investment, published in May 2013, identifies five priority areas: improve STEM instruction, increase youth engagement in STEM, enhance undergraduate STEM experiences, better serve underrepresented groups in STEM fields, and design graduate education for the future STEM workforce. Specific goals include preparing 100,000 new K-12 teachers by 2020 and increasing the number of U.S. youth with STEM experiences by 50%. Congressional response to the plan is part of the broader conversation about the FY2014 Administration budget request. The Obama Administration released its FY2014 budget request, which included a proposal to reorganize federal STEM education. Some policy makers believe the strategic plan was modified to align with the budget proposal, while others see it as a starting point for discussion on potential changes. The adoption of a federal STEM education strategy could impact STEM education at the NSF. The America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2010 granted the executive branch the authority to develop and implement a federal STEM education strategy, with implementation dependent on appropriations and congressional decisions. The NSF's role in the national STEM education strategy will be influenced by the actions of the 113th Congress, which may adopt the NSTC strategy or a different approach. The Obama Administration's FY2014 budget proposal includes a plan to reduce the number of. The Obama Administration's FY2014 budget request proposes to reduce federal STEM education investments by half, increase total funding by 6%, and consolidate programs at nine federal agencies. Priority programs at NSF, ED, and the Smithsonian Institution would see increased funding, with a focus on improving undergraduate STEM education and federal graduate fellowships. The reorganization aims to cut lower-priority programs to make room for targeted increases. The Administration proposes reorganizing federal STEM education efforts to decrease fragmentation, improve coordination, and consolidate programs. Some policymakers support the consolidation to address duplication concerns, while others object to the proposed changes. Congress has a mixed response, with some accepting certain changes and others seeking to prevent implementation. Some policymakers object to the proposed reorganization of federal STEM education programs, citing concerns about the development process and timing. Congress has expressed reservations about the release of the proposal before the publication of the strategic plan mandated by the America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2010. The Senate Appropriations Committee has deferred action on the reorganization until further information is provided. The Senate Appropriations Committee defers action on the proposed reorganization of federal STEM education programs until the Office of Science and Technology Policy finalizes STEM program assessments as required by America COMPETES. Concerns are raised about transparency in the development process, lack of stakeholder consultation, and doubts about the effectiveness of the reorganization in program evaluation. Some policymakers question the capacity of lead agencies to take on new roles and express support for programs at ceding agencies like NASA. The Administration's proposed reorganization of federal STEM education activities at the NSF is uncertain, with potential wide-ranging consequences. Congress has not received a detailed implementation plan or impact analysis, and approval from multiple committees is required. Dissemination of NSF's STEM education research to other agencies and stakeholders remains a policy challenge, prompting calls for improved collaboration between federal agencies. The NSTC's federal STEM education strategy aims to share evidence-based approaches at both portfolio and program levels. The Administration's FY2014 budget request seeks funding for STEM education collaborations between NSF and ED, contingent on program managers' willingness to collaborate and executive branch support. Strategies to address dissemination challenges include policies directing NSF to distribute STEM education research independently. The H.Rept. 112-169 directed NSF to distribute research on best practices in STEM education independently to stakeholders and develop methods to track implementation. NSF funded a National Research Council study on successful STEM education and held workshops on promising practices. Changes in NSF education programs may impact research accounts, with an 85% increase in R&RA contribution to E&T activities between FY2003 and FY2012. The R&RA contribution to E&T activities increased by 85% between FY2003 and FY2012, potentially due to policy changes. NSF's funding dynamics impact its research capacity, with R&RA funding for E&T activities reaching $264 million in FY2012. This accounted for less than 5% of the total R&RA budget that year. The R&RA contribution to E&T activities increased by 85% between FY2003 and FY2012, reaching $264 million in FY2012, less than 5% of the total R&RA budget. This could indicate a deeper integration of the foundation's research and education missions. Congress may need to consider the purpose of the R&RA account in serving education and training, and whether the main education account is adequate for congressional priorities. One option is to maintain the NSF budget as it is. Increase funding for STEM education at NSF by providing additional funding for STEM education activities. Increase funding for E&HR by either shifting funding from other accounts or providing additional funding directly to the main education account. This would not necessarily result in a real increase to NSF's STEM education programs. Decrease funding for STEM education at NSF to capture savings or prioritize other federal activities. Increasing R&RA contributions to E&T activities may deepen integration of NSF missions but could impact research activities. Congress has options to capture savings from the NSF budget by reducing funding for STEM education programs. Prioritization of certain programs could result in savings, but may challenge the foundation's autonomy. Options for prioritizing NSF's STEM education programs include portfolio role and performance. Congress could separate NSF's STEM education R&D programs from its student and institutional aid programs and establish differential funding rates. They could also direct NSF to develop a framework for evaluating its STEM education programs. NSF's mission is to prioritize funding for STEM education programs through a performance approach, which could increase effectiveness but may unintentionally terminate effective programs. Congress could decrease funding for E&HR and limit R&RA funds for E&T, prioritizing NSF's research activities over education activities. The NSF's mission is to prioritize funding for STEM education programs through a performance approach, which could unintentionally terminate effective programs. Congress could decrease funding for E&HR and limit R&RA funds for E&T, prioritizing NSF's research activities over education activities. Congress could use mechanisms other than the NSF to achieve federal STEM education goals, such as increasing funding for Advanced Placement or other gifted student programs at ED. Some policy makers may prefer to leave such matters to state and local governments to decide. Congress may choose to decrease funding for STEM education across the federal enterprise, leading federal agencies to limit STEM education activities. It may be helpful for Congress to consider the short-, medium-, and long-term impacts of funding choices on the federal STEM education portfolio and the missions of the NSF. Guidance from Congress to federal agencies can ensure that legislative priorities are maintained."
