    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Decennial Census Improvement Act of 1996\". The Congress finds that the Constitution requires a decennial census to apportion Representatives, determine district boundaries, and allocate funds. The 1990 decennial census used mail questionnaires, personal interviews, and over 350,000 enumerators to collect data. The census undercount varied by race and geography, with 5.7% of blacks and 1.3% of others not counted. Lawsuits challenged the census accuracy, but the Supreme Court upheld the decision not to adjust the enumeration. The Bureau plans to use a combination of mail questionnaires and personal interviews for the 2000 decennial census. Witnesses raised concerns about the proposed sampling technique potentially increasing the undercount disparity among different geographic areas. The Bureau plans to use a sampling technique for the 2000 decennial census, which is estimated to cost $500 million less than the method used in the 1990 census. The Chairman of the Panel on Census Requirements testified about potential undercount disparities among different groups. The Chairman of the Panel on Census Requirements testified about the trade-off between cost savings and adverse effects associated with using a sampling technique for the 2000 decennial census. The purpose of the Act is to promote accuracy and public confidence in the census data. The Act aims to promote accuracy and public confidence in census data by outlining specific requirements. The 2000 decennial census will be conducted with direct contact attempted for every household, using sampling only after 90% direct contact. The Bureau will utilize non-federal resources to reduce undercount, including State and local government offices. The Bureau will describe measures to pursue after the enactment of this Act. SEC. 4. MEASURES TO FACILITATE THE RECRUITMENT OF TEMPORARY EMPLOYEES. Amendments are made to Public Law 101-86 regarding the 2000 decennial census. Compensation for temporary positions related to the census will not affect certain state programs funded under the Social Security Act. The Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 601 et seq.) covers medical assistance, the Food Stamp program, housing assistance programs, school breakfast and lunch programs, and assistance for women, infants, and children under various acts. The Child Nutrition Act of 1966, Job Training Partnership Act, Head Start Act, and Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Act provide various forms of assistance. SEC. 5. DEFINITIONS. This Act defines key terms such as \"census,\" \"Bureau,\" and \"census tract\" for clarity and consistency in its implementation."
