The \"Community Recovery and Enhancement Act of 2011\" introduces a new deduction for qualified debt reduction payments made by taxpayers on eligible commercial real property. The deduction is equal to 50 percent of the payment, with a maximum limit based on the property's qualified indebtedness and fair market value. The deduction for qualified debt reduction payments on eligible commercial real property is equal to 50 percent of the payment, with a maximum limit based on the property's qualified indebtedness and fair market value. Eligible commercial real property is defined as property with qualified indebtedness equal to at least 85 percent of its fair market value or property treated as being in an in-substance foreclosure. The term 'qualified debt reduction payment' refers to cash paid by the taxpayer to reduce qualified indebtedness, exceeding required loan payments. In the case of property held by a partnership, a qualified debt reduction payment can be considered if it is linked to a qualified equity investment by a partner and properly allocated deductions. The term 'qualified equity investment' refers to any equity investment in a partnership acquired at its original issue solely in exchange for cash, with at least 80% of the cash used to reduce qualified indebtedness. The partnership can use cash for improvements to commercial real property if not used to reduce qualified indebtedness, with consent from those entitled to depreciation. Redemptions follow a similar rule as section 1202(c)(3). Qualified indebtedness is defined as debt incurred or assumed by the taxpayer. The taxpayer can receive a qualified debt reduction equity payment if the debt was incurred before January 1, 2009, and is secured by commercial real property. Commercial real property excludes residential rental property unless it has at least 3 dwelling units. This payment is treated as a deduction for depreciation under section 1250. The depreciation adjustments for property include deductions allowed to all taxpayers for reducing debt secured by the property. Special rules include basis reduction for property with qualified debt reduction payments and limitations on refinancing debt. No deduction is allowed for debt-financed payments. Deduction allowed for qualified debt reduction payments made by partnerships on commercial real property held by the partnership, to the extent of indebtedness incurred or continued by partners secured by their interest in the partnership or the property. Amounts required to be paid due to loan default are treated for specific purposes. The text discusses that accelerated payments due to loan default will not be considered for certain purposes. It also mentions that if a taxpayer incurs additional debt within 3 years after making a qualified debt reduction payment, their ordinary income will be increased by a certain percentage of the recaptured deduction. The text explains that a qualified debt reduction payment will be compared to the deduction allowed if the payment was reduced by additional debt. The applicable percentage is determined based on a specific table. The text outlines the allocation of income inclusion for partnerships resulting from an increase in ordinary income due to qualified equity investments. The text discusses rules for debt-financed equity investments in partnerships and subsequent depreciation deductions. It also addresses recapture of deductions if a partner disposes of their interest in the partnership. The section allows for an increase in ordinary income if a partner disposes of their interest in a partnership within 1 year of making a qualified equity investment. The exemption from passive loss rules applies to the deduction allowed by this section. This section applies to qualified debt reduction payments made within a 2-year period. Earnings and Profits are also addressed in subsection (k) of section 312. Earnings and Profits are addressed in subsection (k) of section 312, with a new paragraph added regarding the treatment of section 199A. A clerical amendment is made to the table of sections for part VI of subchapter B of chapter 1.
