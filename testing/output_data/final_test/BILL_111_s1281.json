    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Investment in After-School Programs Act of 2009\". It includes a finding section. Congress finds that 21 percent of children in the US attend rural public schools, with over 14,000,000 school-age children left alone after school. Only 11 percent of K-12 children participate in after-school programs, while 2,500,000 children in rural areas live in deep poverty. Rural schools face financial challenges due to limited resources, impacting educational opportunities. Low literacy rates among parents in poor rural communities affect children's language development. Children in poverty receive less cognitive stimulation compared to middle-income households. The more diverse and impoverished the rural population, the lower student scores on national assessments. After-school programs are linked to improved academic performance, including better test scores and grades. Investing in after-school programs in rural communities helps children break out of poverty by improving academic performance, school attendance, attitudes, and reducing disciplinary actions. These programs provide essential enrichment in literacy, nutrition education, technology, and college exam preparation, especially in areas with limited resources. Children in rural schools have the lowest funding for after-school programs, impacting their access to educational opportunities. Children in rural communities face unique barriers in accessing after-school programs, including higher transportation costs, limited funding per child due to smaller population bases, and a lack of trained staff and community partnerships. Additionally, there has been a significant increase in the percentage of overweight children and teenagers in the United States over the past 30 years. After-school programs are crucial for promoting healthy lifestyles in youth, especially in rural, low-income areas where obesity rates are high. These programs offer opportunities for nutrition education, physical activity, and constructive learning environments. SEC. 366.
