Residential places may also be included if evidence of hazardous substance release is established. Any authorized personnel can inspect and obtain samples from specified establishments, substances, containers, and labeling for suspected hazardous substances. They can also set up monitoring equipment and survey the land for topographic, geologic, and hydrogeologic features.

If photographs are taken, procedures must be followed, the facility owner must be notified, and copies can be provided upon request for trade secret or security purposes. An officer entering a property must inform the owner and provide split samples upon request. Review of photographs by a court or judge is allowed. If access to a property is denied, a warrant must be obtained unless there is an emergency threatening public health and safety. The department may disclose information submitted to authorized representatives, contractors, or other governmental agencies only for its responsibilities. Procedures will be established to ensure information is used appropriately and not disseminated without consent. Information required by law may be shared with the United States Environmental Protection Agency, without waiving any privilege or confidentiality provided by law.

The potentially responsible party must provide a search report and documentation to support the proposed orphan share percentage. The administrator will invite all parties to submit additional information related to the orphan share percentage or identified responsible parties. The administrator, in consultation with the department or regional board, determines the final orphan share percentage based on contaminant volume, toxicity, and removal difficulty contributed by responsible parties. The determination must be timely and equitable, considering apportionment results from arbitration, mediation, or civil actions. The administrator determines the orphan share percentage based on contaminant factors contributed by responsible parties. The share of liability before January 1, 1982, is not included unless the responsible party is defunct or insolvent. The administrator may use authorized activities to determine the orphan share percentage. The fund administrator issues orphan share percentage determinations in writing, notifying all parties involved. The administrator's decision on apportionment or claims payment is final and subject to judicial review only for fraud. The Attorney General represents the administrator in legal actions under this article. No reimbursement is required by this act as it creates a new crime or infraction, eliminates a crime or infraction, or changes penalties, as per the California Constitution."
