    "content": "The global scope of U.S. business has expanded significantly in recent decades, with trade and cross-border investment on the rise. The level of exports and imports has increased from 16% to 29% of U.S. GDP between 1976 and 2016. Foreign direct investment by U.S. firms has also grown, with a rise in outbound investment and portfolio investment. Policymakers are focusing on the taxation of U.S. business operations, prompting discussions on tax reform in the international sector. The current U.S. system for taxing international business is being questioned in the age of globalized operations. There are concerns about tax shelters in low-tax foreign jurisdictions and how tax system revisions could exacerbate or address these issues. The hybrid U.S. tax system, combined with foreign host-country taxes, creates varying incentive effects for U.S. firms, sometimes favoring foreign operations and incentivizing overseas investment, while in other cases imposing high tax burdens and discouraging investment abroad. The current U.S. tax system for international business is under scrutiny due to concerns about tax shelters in low-tax foreign jurisdictions. The hybrid nature of the system creates varying incentives for U.S. firms, sometimes favoring overseas investment and other times imposing high tax burdens. Calls for reform stem from the system's failure to fully satisfy key tax system principles. Alternative approaches based on residence and territory principles are being considered for international tax reform. The U.S. tax system for international business taxes U.S.-chartered firms on worldwide income, while foreign firms are taxed on income earned within U.S. borders. The system allows U.S. firms to defer tax on foreign income if chartered abroad. Calls for reform are driven by concerns about tax shelters in low-tax jurisdictions and the need to align with key tax system principles. The U.S. tax system allows U.S. firms to defer tax on foreign income by operating through foreign-chartered subsidiaries. This deferral reduces the effective U.S. tax burden on foreign income and creates a territorial tax system. The system also includes a foreign tax credit. The U.S. tax system includes a foreign tax credit that allows credits for foreign taxes paid against U.S. taxes owed, avoiding double taxation. The credit is limited to protect the U.S. domestic tax base and prevent shifting of higher taxes to the U.S. Treasury. The limitation on foreign tax credits prevents excess foreign taxes from being credited to the U.S. Treasury. Currently, foreign tax credits are allowed on an overall basis, allowing for cross-crediting between countries. Tax credits are divided into baskets to prevent abuse, with one for active income and one for passive income. Cross-crediting can also occur across different types of income. Subpart F restricts tax deferral by U.S. stockholders of foreign corporations, targeting passive income shifted to low-tax jurisdictions. Only certain stockholders and subsidiaries are subject to Subpart F. Countries with territorial tax systems have anti-abuse provisions. The tax system's rules for dividing income between related firms are crucial due to tax deferral. Firms must set transfer prices to approximate arm's length transactions. The complexity of the system and sourcing rules for income allocation add pressure, especially with the foreign tax credit limitation. The United States taxes resident corporations on worldwide income but allows deferral of active business income earned through foreign subsidiaries. Foreign tax credits offset double taxation but are limited. Subpart F denies deferral for passive income. The tax system is a mix of worldwide and territorial systems, with the debate on moving towards a pure system for improvement. A territorial system would exempt most foreign-source active business income. Moving towards a worldwide tax system would eliminate the deferral benefit for passive income and may restrict cross-crediting by increasing the number of baskets for the foreign tax credit limit. Proposals to tighten rules for deductions include disallowing certain deductions of the parent company that reflect deferred income. The report discusses tools for evaluating international tax systems and emphasizes that competitiveness lies with companies, not countries. The concept of competitiveness in economics is focused on companies rather than countries. Even if a country's firms are more productive than others, they will still produce goods in which they have a relative advantage. This idea is known as comparative advantage and is crucial in economic theory. When discussing national policy, the focus is on efficiency, neutrality, and optimal policies rather than competitiveness. These terms can be similar but may have slightly different meanings. Neutrality in tax policy aims to maintain efficient allocation of investments, even in imperfect markets. Optimal policy focuses on maximizing welfare for a specific agent or country, which may not always align with efficiency on a global scale. The concepts of capital export neutrality, capital import neutrality, and national neutrality are used to evaluate tax rules for outbound investment. Understanding these concepts is crucial for assessing the impact of multinational tax reform. These concepts were developed when most foreign investment was direct investment by multinational companies, with little foreign portfolio investment. The growth in portfolio investment has led to the concept of capital ownership neutrality. This concept includes capital export neutrality, capital import neutrality, and national neutrality, which aim to ensure equal taxation on investments regardless of location or nationality. These neutrality rules may also serve as optimization guidelines. The concept of national neutrality aims to ensure equal taxation on investments regardless of location or nationality. Evaluating tax policy is complex due to the mix of residence- and source-based taxes in different countries. Foreign firms operating in the United States are subject to source-based taxation, while outbound investment faces limitations on foreign tax credits. Income resembles residence tax, but foreign tax credit limitations and deferral provisions make it more like a source-based tax. To explain these concepts, a simple example is used in tax systems consistent with capital export neutrality and capital import neutrality. National neutrality is discussed in more realistic tax systems, comparing residence-based and source-based taxes for economic neutrality. Consider a world with no taxes and perfectly substitutable capital across countries, where a firm earns a 10% after-tax return in each location. In a world with no taxes and perfectly substitutable capital across countries, firms earn a 10% after-tax return in each location. There are three countries with different tax rates: a high-tax country with a 50% tax rate, a low-tax country with a 25% tax rate, and a zero-tax country. Capital export neutrality is achieved with residence taxation, while source-based taxation affects the allocation of investment by firms. The source-based taxation system leads to capital flowing out of high-tax countries and into zero-tax countries, affecting returns and wages. Output is produced inefficiently, reducing world welfare. The residence-based system is consistent with national neutrality, while the source-based system is not. The source-based taxation system leads to capital flowing out of high-tax countries and into zero-tax countries, affecting returns and wages. National neutrality requires foreign-source income to be taxed and any taxes imposed by the country of location to be deducted. Foreign countries imposing taxes does not lead to worldwide neutrality as it discourages foreign investment. National neutrality aims to maximize a country's welfare through optimal policy. Capital export neutrality is best for global output, national neutrality for a nation's welfare, and capital import \"neutrality\" is not truly neutral. A new concept, capital ownership neutrality (CON), is linked to Desai and Hines from Harvard and the University of Michigan. The term \"capital ownership neutrality\" (CON) was coined by British economist Michael Devereux. It is related to the growth of portfolio investment and is achieved through source-based taxation. This concept emerged due to changes in international investment markets, as U.S. investment abroad shifted from foreign direct investment to portfolio investment. The share of foreign stocks in U.S. residents' portfolios increased over time, reaching 22% by the end of 2006 and 19% by the end of 2016. This increase was not smooth, with rises in the mid-1980s, around 1993-1994, and again in the early 2000s. The share of foreign stocks in U.S. residents' portfolios increased over time, reaching 22% by the end of 2006 and 19% by the end of 2016. This increase was not smooth, with rises in the mid-1980s, around 1993-1994, and again in the early 2000s. The CON concept argues for capital ownership neutrality in taxation, assuming immobile capital, differing firm productivity, and no alternative mechanisms for efficiency gains. Relatively inefficient firms cannot rent efficient technologies or hire efficient managers away from efficient firms. Taxing investment abroad would be neutral if immobility across locations is the only factor. Source-based taxation is efficient when productivity differs and no mechanisms exist to boost efficiency. With source-based taxation, efficient firms in each country would operate and displace the less efficient ones, promoting productivity. High-tax countries aiming for capital export neutrality still face challenges when taxing income within their borders. The country aiming for capital export neutrality with a worldwide tax still faces challenges in its home country. The solution of exempting foreign-source income from tax aligns with capital ownership neutrality, but the assumption of immobile capital and high substitution in portfolios limit achieving true neutrality. Despite global securities markets, American residents continue to hold 80% of their stock portfolios in U.S. firms, showing a significant home bias. The share of foreign stocks in U.S. portfolios has grown, but this does not necessarily indicate a high degree of substitution. The U.S. accounts for about a third of total fixed investment in OECD countries, suggesting that perfect substitution in portfolios is not the case. The portfolio shares of U.S. residents in foreign equities reflect a desire to diversify assets across countries to reduce cyclical risk. Investment in foreign equities has shifted towards countries with lower tax rates, such as the United Kingdom and Japan. Despite a decrease in total foreign share, the composition has moved towards tax havens. The composition of foreign portfolios has shifted towards tax havens, with the UK and Japan seeing a decrease in share. Canada and France had similar shares in 2006, but by 2013, their shares had decreased. Investments in Bermuda and the Cayman Islands were largely for tax avoidance purposes. The shift in foreign portfolios towards tax havens is evident, with Bermuda's share declining to 3% in 2015 while the Cayman Islands' share rose to 14%. Efficient firms are less likely to be eliminated, as they tend to earn higher returns and are retained in investors' portfolios. The model assumes that firms with reduced size due to tax-related portfolio shifts are likely to be marginally productive firms. The model assumes productive advantages without formally defining the source of productivity, allowing for efficient allocation of management skills and assets. Ownership of productive assets and intangible assets can be separated, impacting global efficiency. Trademarks and patents are examples of assets that can be distinct from firm ownership. Ownership of intangible assets can be separated and can be franchised, sold, or leased. Contract manufacturing can also be used to shift profits. Efficiency costs of capital ownership non-neutrality are unlikely to be significant compared to location distortions. The U.S. tax system is a hybrid, presenting a patchwork of incentive effects that sometimes encourage investing abroad and other times promote tax neutrality. It resembles residence-based taxation in some cases, taxing foreign branch income while allowing a foreign tax credit. The U.S. tax system departs from pure residence taxation by limiting the foreign tax credit, which aims to equalize the tax burden on domestic and foreign investments. An unlimited foreign tax credit is not feasible due to the potential threat to the home country tax base. The United States limits its foreign tax credit to offset U.S. taxes on foreign income. The neutrality effects of a worldwide system with a limited credit depend on how the credit is restricted, either per-country or aggregated across countries. Cross-crediting in the U.S. tax system allows foreign taxes paid in a high-tax country to offset taxes due on investments in a low-tax country, reducing the total tax liability. This can incentivize investment in high-tax countries and is limited to offset U.S. taxes on foreign income. The U.S. tax system allows cross-crediting of foreign taxes to offset taxes on investments in different countries, encouraging foreign investment over domestic. It also uses deferral for foreign business income, introducing elements of territorial taxation. The tax system introduces territorial or source-based taxation, creating distortions in firms' decisions on profits repatriation. Deferral and cross-crediting allow firms to minimize tax liability by choosing when and where to repatriate profits. This incentivizes U.S. firms to invest in low-tax countries and retain earnings overseas, leading to profit shifting and tax avoidance. The current tax system allows firms to choose between branch operations and foreign-chartered subsidiaries, leading to incentives to invest in low-tax jurisdictions. This creates a patchwork of incentive effects, with a disincentive to invest in high-tax countries and an incentive to invest in low-tax countries. Deferral also incentivizes investment in low-tax countries and allows for income sheltering from tax. The argument for territorial taxation as a second-best system has been proposed by various economists and commissions, including the Grubert-Mutti proposal in 2001 and similar plans put forth by President Bush's advisory commission on tax reform in 2005. More recent proposals, such as those by Chairman Camp and Senator Enzi, have also advocated for a territorial tax system. Reform proposed a territorial tax system, focusing on a \"dividend exemption\" for U.S. parents from foreign subsidiary corporations. The plan aims to move from deferral for foreign income to a permanent exemption, with restrictions on active business investment abroad. The proposal also eliminates foreign tax credits. The proposed tax reform plan includes changes such as not allowing foreign tax credits for repatriated earnings and disallowing deductions for tax-exempt foreign-source income. This would impact the deductibility of debt and overhead expenses for U.S. parent corporations with foreign subsidiaries. The proposed tax reform plan includes changes like not allowing foreign tax credits for repatriated earnings and disallowing deductions for tax-exempt foreign-source income. Grubert and Mutti argue that an exemption system is superior to the current hybrid system in terms of efficiency, simplicity, and raising tax revenue. They believe that the current law's application of tax to repatriated foreign earnings encourages wasteful behavior by corporations, which an exemption system would eliminate. The elimination of foreign tax credits would prevent shielding investments in low-tax foreign locations from U.S. taxes and discourage artificial diversion of technology-exploiting investments. This change would also increase taxes on royalties, which can currently offset U.S. tax liability with excess credits. However, simply removing these inefficiencies would not make an exemption system more efficient than the current law. The key advantage of an exemption system lies in eliminating interest and other deductions for overseas investments. The inclusion of a provision to eliminate interest and other overhead deductions for overseas investment would increase the average tax burden for overseas investment, leading to efficiency gains by reallocating investment into the domestic economy. An exemption system could also boost tax revenue, with estimates ranging from $7 billion to $7.7 billion annually. However, the increase in tax revenue is dependent on denying deductions for costs related to tax-exempt foreign income. Without these restrictions, an exemption system could reduce tax revenue. The Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) has raised estimates of deferral costs significantly, from $6 billion in 2006 to over $80 billion in FY2014, potentially leading to a loss of revenue. This could favor foreign investment overall. Advocates of an exemption system highlight its simplicity and reduced need for tax planning. However, complexities arise when entities are taxed differently. Under an exemption system, foreign subsidiary corporations would be permanently tax-exempt, amplifying the impact on firms' tax planning. Transfer pricing rules for income allocation between U.S. parent firms and foreign subsidiaries would become more significant. Under a territorial tax system, income allocation between U.S. parent firms and foreign subsidiaries would be crucial, with a focus on active and passive income. Moving from branch to subsidiary operations would be incentivized, especially for start-up firms. Analysis suggests a rise in royalties as a share of repatriated earnings for multinationals, indicating an increase in the exploitation of intangible assets in foreign locations. This trend could support the adoption of an exemption system to address tax incentives related to low-tax jurisdictions. Under a territorial tax system, income allocation between U.S. parent firms and foreign subsidiaries would be crucial, focusing on active and passive income. Moving to subsidiary operations would be encouraged, especially for start-up firms. The growth of intangibles would create pressure on transfer pricing administration. Proponents of an exemption system argue it is superior to the existing system, but it has shortcomings. More restrictive rules for deducting costs could enhance economic efficiency more than a full exemption system. Proposals by the Ways and Means Committee and Senator Enzi in the 112th Congress differed from the Grubert-Mutti proposal. Chairman Camp's proposal allocated interest instead of all deductions, while S. 2091 had no allocation of deductions. Both bills provided relief for royalties and included anti-base erosion provisions. They also aimed at limiting profit shifting through intangibles transfers with a minimum tax on foreign intangible income. The proposed plans by the Ways and Means Committee and Senator Enzi in the 112th Congress aimed to limit profit shifting through intangibles transfers with a minimum tax on foreign intangible income, including royalties. However, the plans relied on a one-time taxation of existing accumulated earnings, leading to a potential loss of revenue in the long run and possibly encouraging more investment abroad. The detailed territorial tax provision highlighted concerns about increased international profit shifting and tax avoidance. The proposal includes a 75% exclusion for earnings held in cash and a reduced corporate tax rate of 25%. Moving towards a residence-based system would tax the income of home-country firms regardless of where it is earned. Under this system, current law's deferral system would be repealed, and U.S. taxation would apply on a current basis to the income of foreign subsidiaries. The tax burden on foreign investment equals the tax rate on domestic investment, but foreign taxes complicate achieving pure capital export neutrality. When a foreign host country's tax rate exceeds the U.S. tax rate, unlimited foreign tax credit is needed to offset the high foreign tax burden. However, implementing an unlimited foreign tax credit is impractical due to the risk of foreign governments drawing on the U.S. Treasury. The United States has considered more restrictive foreign tax credit limitations in the past, such as a per-country limitation where taxes paid to one country could not be credited against U.S. tax on income from another country. Proposed bills like the Wyden-Gregg Tax Reform Act and the Tax Reform Act of 1986 aimed to implement per-country foreign tax credit limits to restrict cross-crediting. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 (P.L. 99-514) and the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (AJCA; P.L. 108-357) reduced separate limits for foreign tax credits to two. A more restrictive foreign tax credit limitation may not necessarily move towards pure capital export neutrality. Capital export neutrality requires equal tax burdens on foreign and domestic investment, with current system features favoring domestic investment. The 9% tax deduction for domestic production was enacted in 2004 by AJCA, along with other tax benefits restricted to domestic investment. Grubert and Altshuler analyzed international tax reform in 2006, comparing the exemption system with a \"burden neutral\" worldwide taxation system. They proposed eliminating deferral and reducing the U.S. tax rate on foreign earnings to maintain the competitive position of U.S. multinationals. The burden on investment in low-tax countries would increase under the proposed worldwide taxation system by Grubert and Altshuler. The plan aims to maintain the competitive position of U.S. multinationals by reducing the U.S. tax rate on foreign earnings. However, there are uncertainties regarding the number of firms in an excess-credit position and the burden-neutral tax rate. Additionally, foreign countries may raise their tax rates due to the plan, shifting more of the U.S. tax burden onto corporations. The proposed tax plan aims to shift the U.S. tax burden on corporations from the corporate to the shareholder level. It includes taxing some foreign-source income in full and providing lower rates on others, while retaining the foreign tax credit. Income from activities with a U.S. source and passive income would be taxed in full, while other foreign-source income would be taxed at a lower rate than the U.S. rate. Two options were discussed, one taxing income at 80% of the U.S. rate and another at 60% for active income. The discussion draft included suggestions for taxing foreign-source income at different rates, such as 80% or 60% of the U.S. rate. Minimum tax approaches and profit shifting limitations were also proposed, including a 20% tax on prior deferred earnings with a foreign tax credit. The President's budget proposal for FY2016 included a minimum tax of 19% on income of controlled foreign corporations in each country, along with a foreign tax credit. The proposal also allows an exemption from the minimum tax base for an allowance for corporate equity (ACE) to exempt from the minimum tax return on actual activities in the country. Anti-abuse provisions were also included in the proposal. In the FY2016 budget proposals, there were suggestions to restrict deferral without eliminating it entirely. One proposal in H.R. 3970 aimed to disallow certain deductions of parent-company costs, such as interest, to reduce the attractiveness of investing in low-tax countries. This proposal was projected to raise $106 billion over 10 years and lower the corporate tax rate. Additionally, a foreign tax credit pooling proposal was included to limit firms' ability to repatriate income from high-tax countries. President Obama proposed changes in his budget outlines from 2009 to 2014, including measures to repatriate income from high-tax countries and use foreign tax credits to shield income from low-tax countries. The FY2015 budget projected that these provisions would raise billions over 10 years. Another proposal aimed to eliminate the check-the-box provision that allows firms to treat subsidiaries as separate entities. The FY2015 budget proposal included provisions to raise revenue on foreign-source income, such as treating excess income from intangibles as Subpart F income. This was projected to raise $2.67 billion in FY2016 and $30.0 billion over 10 years. Other proposals aimed to restrict credits for royalties on extractive industries and limit deductions for reinsurance of insurance. The FY2015 budget proposal included provisions to tax certain income associated with digital goods and sales, address interest allocation to U.S. subsidiaries of foreign parents, and disallow inversions by merging with a smaller company. These provisions were projected to raise significant revenue over 10 years. The FY2016 budget proposal aims to raise $0.3 billion in the fiscal year and $12.8 billion over 10 years. It includes provisions to address perceived abuses of the foreign tax credit, such as disallowing foreign tax credits when income is not received. The proposal also includes elements like a minimum tax on foreign-source income in low-tax countries and a 20% credit for costs of moving operations to the United States. The topic of tax havens has been a focus of recent international tax policy discussions. Tax havens do not fit neatly into the traditional evaluation framework as they involve artificial shifting of income and investment, raising questions about revenue losses and tax fairness. Tax havens are countries where nonresidents can save taxes through investments and activities due to low tax rates and strict financial secrecy laws. The discrepancy between real economic activity and apparent activity is a key issue with tax havens. Much economic activity in tax havens may actually occur elsewhere, with income reported by U.S.-controlled subsidiaries potentially having its true economic location in other countries or the United States. U.S. firms utilize tax havens for tax savings due to aspects of the U.S. tax structure, such as corporate inversion reorganizations. Corporate inversion reorganization involves shifting the parent of a corporate group from a U.S.-chartered entity to a foreign corporation in a tax haven to reduce U.S. taxes on foreign income. Recent plans involve merging with a foreign firm to avoid U.S. law restrictions. The President's budget proposal and legislative proposals aim to address this issue. U.S. firms also use tax havens to shift income to zero-tax environments. Some tax havens offer techniques for shifting income, such as manipulation of transfer prices and intra-firm lending to move income to low-tax countries. Tax havens may also facilitate tax evasion, including shielding income from illegal activities and evading taxes on legally generated income. President's proposals and tax reform plans address these issues. The report focuses on multinational firms and their use of tax havens for legal income shifting. This practice impacts the real location of investment and tax savings, regardless of where the underlying investment is located. The United States is considered a high-tax country, leading to the allocation of investment between the US and foreign locations. The United States is a high-tax country, and income shifted to tax havens likely comes from countries with lower taxes. Tax havens amplify the distortion of deferral, diverting US investment abroad and reducing economic efficiency. This loss of tax revenue affects both the US and other countries. Tax havens can damage perceptions of tax fairness when large firms and wealthy individuals use them to avoid substantial taxes. Multilateral action is seen as a way to reduce tax evasion through tax havens, with efforts like the OECD's Project on Harmful Tax Practices aiming to increase transparency in tax haven activities. The OECD's project aims to identify and increase transparency in tax havens, as well as expand tax information exchange agreements. Efforts like Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPs) are being pursued to address profit shifting. Various proposals, including unilateral approaches by the Clinton Administration and legislative proposals, have been put forth to restrict benefits for taxpayers using tax havens. Some proposals, including those in President Obama's budget and congressional proposals, have been made to address tax evasion and avoidance. Certain provisions were adopted in the Hire Act in 2010 (P.L. 111-147). Despite the increasing globalization of the U.S. economy, foreign direct investment remains a small share of the U.S.-owned capital stock. Specific corporate tax revisions could have significant consequences for international taxation, potentially shifting towards a residence-based system. In 2003, relief for double taxation was provided by reducing the tax rate on corporate dividends to 15% for some brackets and 5% for others, with the 5% rate scheduled to fall to 0%. Capital gains also saw lower rates, with provisions expiring in 2012 but made permanent for most by the American Taxpayer Relief Act. High-income individuals were taxed at 20% on capital gains. The tax rates on dividends and capital gains for high-income individuals were reduced to 20% in 2003. The revenue estimates for maintaining these lower rates were $22 billion for dividends and $6.5 billion for capital gains in FY2016. Returning to pre-2003 law could allow for a 2.2 percentage-point reduction in the corporate tax rate, with projected corporate revenues of $439 billion for that year. The impact on capital gains was relatively small, affecting only a small portion of gains. The Joint Committee on Taxation's scoring conventions limit the potential revenue from taxing capital gains at ordinary rates. The static estimate for revenue from capital gains is $113 billion, but using JCT's realizations response, it is only $10 billion, allowing a reduction of a percentage point. With a larger realizations elasticity, revenue could be $44 billion, leading to a corporate rate about 6 points lower at 29%. Another option is to tax corporate stock by marking to market, potentially raising considerable revenue. The corporate tax rate could be lowered by disallowing part of the deduction for interest and taxing more pass-through firms at the corporate level. Lowering the statutory corporate rate through base-broadening provisions may not lower the effective rate for investment. Lower U.S. corporate tax rates are desirable to prevent capital from flowing to low-tax foreign jurisdictions and to address concerns about portfolio substitution favoring foreign-owned firms. The House tax plan aims to change the corporate tax base by moving to a territorial tax system and introducing a destination-based cash flow tax. Lowering the U.S. tax rate may not have a significant impact on overall output, as the corporate tax is relatively small compared to GDP. International concerns suggest the need for corporate tax reforms to improve economic efficiency. The House tax plan proposes a shift to a destination-based cash flow tax, where investments are expensed and interest is not deductible. This change aims to replace the corporate tax with a consumption tax at a lowered rate of 20%. The elimination of a production-based corporate tax could attract equity capital to the United States, but the impact on total capital flows is uncertain. The proposal also addresses concerns about profit shifting and allows for tax-free repatriation of foreign profits. The House tax plan proposes a shift to a destination-based cash flow tax, aiming to replace the corporate tax with a consumption tax at a lowered rate of 20%. The proposal includes a deemed repatriation at lower rates for existing deferred earnings abroad, eliminating the incentive for inversions. However, there is concern over a significant revenue loss of over $2 trillion in the next 10 years. The controversial border adjustment proposal, expected to cause the dollar to appreciate by 25%, has been dropped from future tax plans, potentially adding $1.2 trillion in revenue costs over the next decade. The House tax plan proposes a shift to a destination-based cash flow tax, aiming to replace the corporate tax with a consumption tax at a lowered rate of 20%. The controversial border adjustment proposal has been dropped from future tax plans, potentially adding $1.2 trillion in revenue costs over the next decade."
