    "content": "The Act titled \"Green Infrastructure for Clean Water Act of 2009\" acknowledges the decline of water resources in the US due to various factors. A study highlighted the benefits of green infrastructure, including increased water supplies, job creation, cost savings, and reduction of stormwater issues. The Administrator will grant funds to eligible institutions to establish 3-5 centers of excellence for green infrastructure in the US. Each center will conduct region-specific research on green infrastructure, develop industry standards, and promote environmental, economic, and social benefits. The centers of excellence for green infrastructure will provide research, manuals, technical assistance, and collaboration with institutions and organizations in the region. The centers of excellence for green infrastructure focus on research, technical assistance, curriculum development, training, policy evaluation, and coordination with other centers to avoid duplication of efforts. Eligible institutions must submit an application to receive a grant. The national electronic clearinghouse center, established under the green infrastructure program, operates a website and public database with relevant information. SEC. 4. GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE GRANTS. The Administrator will grant funds competitively to eligible entities for green infrastructure projects, including planning, designing, and developing standards for such projects. The Administrator provides financial support for green infrastructure projects, including design, installation, and maintenance. Grants are also available for developing training materials, implementing best practices, and monitoring benefits. The green infrastructure program requires eligible entities to submit an application detailing the project, monitoring plan, evaluation of benefits, and long-term maintenance plan to receive a grant. The green infrastructure project requires states to submit a schedule of increasing minimum percentages of annual water managed using green infrastructure for a grant. Priority is given to applications from communities with combined storm and sanitary sewers or that are low-income/disadvantaged, as well as eligible entities using 10% of the grant for low-income/disadvantaged areas. The Administrator may provide grants for low-income or disadvantaged communities, with limitations on planning and development grants not exceeding $200,000 and implementation grants not exceeding $3,000,000. The aggregate amount of planning and development grants in a fiscal year is capped at $100,000,000, and implementation grants at $200,000,000. The Federal share of a grant may vary. The Federal share of a grant under this section is capped at 65% of the total project cost. The Administrator can credit non-Federal costs towards the project's share, and may waive the share limitation for entities showing financial need. The Environmental Protection Agency Green Infrastructure Program is established. The Administrator establishes a green infrastructure program within the Office of Water to promote and integrate green infrastructure into permitting programs. Duties include promoting green infrastructure use and coordinating efforts with other agencies. Regional offices are directed to develop programs for monitoring, financing, and designing green infrastructure within their regions. The Administrator establishes a green infrastructure program to promote and integrate green infrastructure into permitting programs. This includes monitoring, financing, and designing green infrastructure, outreach and training for governments and the private sector, and incorporating green infrastructure into regulatory programs. Additionally, a compliance assistance center will be created to provide technical assistance and information on green infrastructure approaches for reducing water pollution and complying with regulatory requirements. The Administrator, in collaboration with State and local water resource managers, will establish measurable goals known as the \"green infrastructure portfolio standard\" to increase the use of green infrastructure in managing water resources. Before the end of fiscal year 2014, the Administrator will submit a report to Congress detailing grants made under the Act, project outcomes, technology improvements, environmental benefits, and recommendations for promoting green infrastructure. The report will also address challenges related to green infrastructure use. The Act defines key terms such as Administrator, Agency, center, eligible entity, and eligible institution as related to green infrastructure. Eligible entities include State or local governments, and institutions of higher education or research institutions with expertise in green infrastructure. The Act defines key terms related to green infrastructure and eligible entities. It includes conducting research, developing information, providing technical assistance, setting standards, offering job training, and creating course curricula for green infrastructure. The Act defines key terms related to green infrastructure and eligible entities, including developing course curricula for schools, training students in green infrastructure, and providing information to governments about green infrastructure implementation. Additional definitions include the meaning of \"elementary school\" as defined in the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. The Secondary Education Act of 1965 defines key terms like \"institution of higher education\" and \"research institution\" as entities meeting specific criteria under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The term \"secondary school\" is defined in the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. Green infrastructure refers to stormwater management techniques that mimic natural hydrology and promote absorption by soil and plant life.
