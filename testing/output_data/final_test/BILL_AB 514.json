    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 25132 of the Government Code is amended to specify that violation of a county ordinance is a misdemeanor unless made an infraction. Violations can be prosecuted by county authorities or addressed through civil action. Infractions are punishable by fines ranging from $100 to $500, with additional penalties for repeated violations within a year. Violations of local building and safety codes as infractions can result in administrative fines or other specified penalties. The amended Section 53069.4 of the Government Code specifies fines for violations of county ordinances: $100 for a first violation, $500 for a second violation within a year, and $1,000 for each additional violation within the same year. Section 53069.4 of the Government Code allows local agencies to impose administrative fines for violations of their ordinances, with procedures outlined in an ordinance. The fines cannot exceed the maximum amounts set for infractions. The amount of an administrative fine for a one-time violation of certain county ordinances, determined to be an infraction, shall be based on the severity of the threat to public health and safety. For the first violation, the fine shall not exceed $5,000 or three times the permit fee, whichever is less. If no permit fee is applicable, the fine shall not exceed $1,000. The administrative fine for multiple violations of the same ordinance within five years increases progressively: up to $10,000 or 5 times the permit fee for the second violation, up to $15,000 for the third and subsequent violations. The fine cannot exceed $500 unless specific findings are made in the administrative record. The administrative fine for violations of ordinances is based on whether the violation was willingly committed or posed a significant threat to public health. The fine should not cause financial hardship and applies to one-time violations that cannot be corrected. The local agency's administrative procedures allow for a reasonable time to correct violations related to building, plumbing, electrical, or zoning issues before imposing fines, as long as they do not pose an immediate danger to health or safety. Within 20 days of receiving the final administrative order or decision from a local agency regarding fines or penalties, a person can appeal to the superior court for a de novo review. The local agency's notice of violation and penalty is considered prima facie evidence, and the appeal must be served in person or by first-class mail. The notice of appeal must be served in person or by first-class mail upon the local agency by the contestant. The fee for filing a notice of appeal is specified in Section 70615. The court requests the local agency's file within 15 days. The court retains the fee regardless of the appeal outcome. If the contestant wins, the fee is reimbursed. Traffic trial commissioners can handle appeals. Failure to file an appeal confirms the local agency's decision. If the fine or penalty is not paid and the court rules against the contestant, the local agency can collect the penalty as per its ordinance."
