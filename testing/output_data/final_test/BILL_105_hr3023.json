    "content": "PROLIFERATOR DESUBSIDIZATION. The Director of Central Intelligence must submit an annual classified report to Congress identifying foreign entities transferring controlled items for missile projects, chemical or biological weapons, or nuclear activities in non-compliant countries. Prohibition of Subsidies for Proliferator Entities: Restrictions on financial support for entities involved in nuclear activities in non-compliant countries. This includes limitations on guarantees, insurance, credit extensions, and business transactions with identified entities. No licenses may be approved for the transfer of controlled items, items requiring validated licenses under specific acts, items on the United States Munitions List, or items controlled for export under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 to certain entities. The Secretary of Energy cannot approve requests for the production of special nuclear material by these entities. The prohibition on transferring controlled items to certain entities can be lifted if the Director of Central Intelligence certifies in writing to Congress that the entity has stopped such transfers. Controlled items include those on the MTCR Annex, listed by the Australia Group, and controlled by the Nuclear Suppliers Group. The Australia Group is a multilateral regime involving the United States. The United States participates in multilateral regimes to prevent the proliferation of chemical, biological, and nuclear weapons. The MTCR Annex and Nuclear Suppliers Group are key components of these efforts, defining covered entities as foreign entities or governments involved in such activities. The curr_chunk discusses the definition of a missile project and specifies the members of Congress involved in overseeing related committees. The curr_chunk specifies Senate committees overseeing missile projects: Foreign Relations, Armed Services, Intelligence, Appropriations, and Governmental Affairs."
