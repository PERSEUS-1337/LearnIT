    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Cesar E. Chavez Congressional Gold Medal Act\". Cesar E. Chavez was born on March 31, 1927, near Yuma, Arizona, and passed away on April 23, 1993. He received various honors, including the Martin Luther King Jr. Peace Prize and the Presidential Medal of Freedom. Chavez, the grandson of a Mexican immigrant, worked with migrant farm workers, instilling in him a strong work ethic and respect for their labor. Numerous holidays, schools, parks, and structures have been named after him in the United States and internationally. Cesar E. Chavez, born in 1927 near Yuma, Arizona, served in the Navy before dedicating himself to organizing farm workers for better working conditions. In 1962, he founded the National Farm Workers Association, later known as the United Farm Workers of America, advocating for workers' rights through nonviolent means. Cesar E. Chavez brought dignity and respect to farm workers through nonviolent means like boycotts, strikes, and fasts, gaining national attention for their struggle for better pay and working conditions. Despite facing violence, Chavez remained committed to nonviolence and even went to jail for his boycott against lettuce growers. Cesar E. Chavez's legacy includes improving working conditions for farm workers, promoting education for their children, and inspiring activism for human rights through voter registration drives and empowerment initiatives. He lived humbly alongside farm workers and his influence extended beyond agriculture. Cesar E. Chavez was laid to rest at the headquarters of the United Farm Workers of America in California after living and working there for 23 years. He led a courageous life with faith, discipline, humility, and inner strength, and his words \"Si se puede! Yes, we can!\" continue to inspire. The Speaker of the House and the President Pro Tempore of the Senate will arrange for a gold medal to be presented to Cesar E. Chavez's next of kin in recognition of his service to the Nation. The Secretary of the Treasury will design and strike the medal. Additionally, duplicate medals will be made. The Secretary is authorized to strike and sell duplicate bronze medals of the gold medal under certain regulations to cover costs. The medals are considered national medals, and funding for them will come from the United States Mint Public Enterprise Fund. Amounts from the sale of duplicate medals will also be deposited into the Fund."
