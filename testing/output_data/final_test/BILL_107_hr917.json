The Congress finds that a significant number of Federal contract workers and employees earn wages below the poverty level, with a majority being adult females and minorities. This highlights the need for the Federal Living Wage Responsibility Act. The Federal Government provides billions of dollars to businesses each year through spending programs, grants, and contracts. In fiscal year 1999, contracts worth over $208 billion were awarded. Congress must ensure responsible use of Federal dollars to improve economic security and well-being of Americans. SEC. 3. POVERTY-LEVEL WAGE. The Federal Government and certain employers must pay workers a wage equivalent to the Federal poverty level for a family of four, plus additional amounts for fringe benefits based on the worker's locality. The text discusses the requirement for employers to provide workers with a wage equivalent to the Federal poverty level for a family of four, along with additional fringe benefits. Exemptions include small-business concerns and nonprofit organizations meeting specific criteria. Retaliation against workers for reporting violations is prohibited, and contracts must comply with the regulations. Contract Requirement: Contracts subject to subsection (a) must ensure that workers are paid according to subsection (a). SEC. 4. ENFORCEMENT BY SECRETARY. If a Federal contractor violates section 3, the Secretary can cancel their contract and require restitution for costs incurred by the Government to find a replacement contractor. After final adjudication of violations, a Federal contractor may be ineligible for new contracts with the United States for five years. The Secretary must publish a notice of ineligibility in the Federal Register. A Safe Harbor provision applies if the contractor has entered into a consent agreement and paid restitution for violations. The Secretary may cancel or debar a Federal contractor for violations, but exceptions can be made if the contractor has paid all wages due or if cancellation is not in the best interest of the Nation. Contractors can seek judicial review of adverse determinations. The President has the authority to suspend this Act during emergencies. Additionally, individuals have the right to take legal action under this Act. SEC. 6. PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION. A worker can file a civil action for relief within 3 years of a violation of section 3. Relief may include injunction, damages, attorney fees, and any other appropriate relief. SEC. 7. RULEMAKING. The Secretary will establish rules for implementing the Act within 120 days of its enactment. Definitions in the Act include \"employer\" as someone with the power to set employment terms, \"fringe benefits\" like healthcare and retirement contributions, and \"Secretary\" as the Secretary of Labor."
