It is considered a crucial presidential speech by Congress. The State of the Union address is a significant annual speech where the President presents their policy priorities and showcases their constitutional powers to Congress and the public. It has evolved from a constitutional duty to a source of executive power and authority for the President. The State of the Union address has evolved over time, with changes in format, delivery, and length. Scholars suggest it reflects American culture and ethos, with a focus on self-interest. Technology, like radio, television, and the Internet, has influenced its delivery. The address has changed rhetorically since the origins of the American republic, with various Presidents contributing to its evolution. George Washington gave the first \"State of the Union\" address on January 8, 1790, known as the \"Annual Message.\" It was a short speech of 1,089 words delivered before Congress. Washington's precedent of providing annual information to Congress was followed by John Adams. Thomas Jefferson changed the format to a written submission, possibly due to being a poor public speaker. Presidents from 1801 to 1913 sent their yearly reports as formal written messages. President Woodrow Wilson altered historical precedent by delivering the 1913 Annual Message in person before Congress, instead of submitting it in writing as his predecessors had done. Wilson believed the President had the authority to serve as a national spokesman and used his speeches to draw public attention to his policies. This change in presidential rhetoric garnered widespread public endorsement. President Woodrow Wilson changed tradition by delivering the 1913 Annual Message in person before Congress, gaining public support for his policies. This led to a shift towards oral delivery of the Annual Message, with Presidents like Warren Harding and Calvin Coolidge following suit. Franklin Roosevelt solidified the oral tradition and popularized the term \"State of the Union.\" The address became shorter, between 5,000 and 7,000 words, under Roosevelt's presidency. President Woodrow Wilson changed tradition by delivering the 1913 Annual Message in person before Congress, gaining public support for his policies. This led to a shift towards oral delivery of the Annual Message, with Presidents like Warren Harding and Calvin Coolidge following suit. Franklin Roosevelt solidified the oral tradition and popularized the term \"State of the Union.\" The address became shorter, between 5,000 and 7,000 words, under Roosevelt's presidency. Roosevelt also introduced the use of \"we\" and \"our\" more frequently in speeches. The length of State of the Union addresses decreased significantly in 1913 when Wilson started the oral delivery mode. Subsequent spikes in length were due to Presidents issuing written messages for their final address of the term. Notably, Barack Obama's 2015 speech was slightly shorter than his 2014 address, lasting 59 minutes and 57 seconds. Harry Truman's 1947 address was the first televised, and until 1965, addresses were delivered during the day. The State of the Union address tradition changed when President Woodrow Wilson delivered the 1913 Annual Message in person before Congress. This led to a shift towards oral delivery, popularized by Franklin Roosevelt. The address became shorter under Roosevelt, and the timing was changed to the evening by Lyndon Johnson to attract a larger audience. The speech is now directed to both citizens and Congress, steeped in tradition and ceremony. The President fulfills political and ceremonial functions, making it a powerful ritual. The State of the Union address is traditionally delivered in the House chamber of the Capitol before a joint session of Congress. Seats in the chamber are not assigned to Members, who can claim a seat for the evening's address but must remain physically present to retain it. Senators join House Members for the address at the designated time. During the State of the Union address, Senators and Members of the House gather in the House chamber. Seats are reserved for Senators at the front, while the Speaker and Vice President sit on the dais. Cabinet members, Supreme Court Justices, and other officials also attend. In a break from tradition, Members of Congress sat next to opposing party members at the 2011 address. During the State of the Union address, Members of Congress sat next to Members of the opposing party, a bipartisan practice since 2011. Seating in the gallery is coordinated by the House Sergeant at Arms, with each Member receiving a specific reserved seat. Presidents often invite guests to join the First Lady in the gallery, individuals who have performed acts of heroism. During the State of the Union address, the President invites guests to join the First Lady in the gallery, known as \"Lenny Skutniks,\" who have performed acts of heroism or achieved significant milestones. Recent guests have included notable figures such as Representative Gabrielle Giffords, Apple CEO Tim Cook, and civil rights pioneer Rosa Parks. The State of the Union address is a significant presidential speech that is widely read and discussed. Historians have identified three common rhetorical sequences in these addresses: public meditations on values, assessments of information and issues, and policy recommendations. These sequences typically occur in a predictable order, with the President offering his opinion on values, identifying targeted issues for his legislative agenda, and providing specific policy recommendations. In his 1962 State of the Union address, President John F. Kennedy emphasized the importance of values such as economic progress and agricultural strength. He then highlighted the policy challenge of maximizing farm productivity and contrasted it with the failures of Communist nations. Kennedy concluded by proposing a new comprehensive farm program to Congress. In his 1962 State of the Union address, President John F. Kennedy proposed a new comprehensive farm program to Congress tailored to fit the use of land and supplies of each crop to prevent chaos in the sixties with a program of commonsense. State of the Union addresses typically focus on past accomplishments, future goals, bipartisanship, and optimism, paying homage to historical achievements and national values. Ronald Reagan emphasized the nation's ability to preserve lasting values by making change work for us in his 1983 address. In State of the Union addresses, Presidents use historical themes and contemporary issues to define national identity and legitimize policy programs. The bipartisan tone distinguishes the address from other presidential rhetoric, aiming to frame arguments effectively before a joint session of Congress. In his 2002 speech before Congress, George W. Bush emphasized the need for bipartisan unity in addressing domestic issues, stating that Americans should come together as one, not as Republicans or Democrats. This rhetorical emphasis on bipartisanship can empower the President to remind citizens of their duty to protect the welfare of all. Presidents emphasize unity and optimism in their annual speeches, highlighting the American people's determination to overcome challenges. Franklin Roosevelt's 1942 State of the Union address after Pearl Harbor exemplified this, showcasing the nation's resolve in the face of crisis. The State of the Union address is a platform for the President to convey policy priorities, advertise past legislative successes, advocate for policies, introduce innovative ideas, and threaten vetoes. It strengthens the President's role as chief legislator and has evolved from being directed mainly to Congress to now being broadcast on television, radio, and the Internet. The State of the Union address allows Presidents to communicate policy priorities, advocate for policies, and set the tone for their administration. Presidents use this platform to address Congress and the public, influencing legislative agendas and seeking support for their proposals. Since 1965, State of the Union addresses have averaged 42 policy requests in the first year, but this number decreases to 29 in the second year. Midterm addresses focus more on highlighting policy achievements, with about 10% of sentences being credit-claiming statements. Presidents may increase policy proposals to around 31 requests in anticipation of reelection, but they do not use the address for campaigning. In second-term State of the Union addresses, Presidents focus more on defense and foreign policy, possibly to build their legacy. Despite electoral considerations, Presidents do not campaign during the address and maintain a bipartisan tone. President Reagan reduced policy proposals in his second-term speeches, while President Clinton increased them. The average number of policy proposals in a second-term speech is 40. In second-term State of the Union addresses, Presidents emphasize defense and foreign policy to shape their legacy. Data from 1965 to 2015 shows that an average of 39.4% of policy proposals in the address are approved by Congress. Presidents tend to have higher legislative success rates in the year following an election, with an average success rate of 46.1% for post-election addresses. The success rate for post-election State of the Union addresses is 46.1%, higher than the overall average. A study found a strong link between a President's foreign policy rhetoric in the speech and his legislative position-taking later in the year. The number of policy mentions in the speech affects presidential legislative behavior, particularly in foreign policy. No statistical relationship was found in health or social welfare policy. Presidents are less likely to support their rhetoric with subsequent position-taking in bills related to health or social welfare policy. Mentioning a policy proposal in the State of the Union can capture the public's attention and increase interest in that policy area. Both substantive arguments and symbolic rhetoric can increase public attention, with every 50 words devoted to an issue resulting in a 2% increase in public awareness. Increased public attention to economic policies mentioned by the President in the State of the Union address tends to fade by the end of the year, while interest in foreign policy remains steady. This suggests that the President can use the State of the Union address more effectively to shape public opinion on foreign policy. A study of State of the Union addresses from 1956 to 2005 shows that \"international affairs and foreign aid\" is the most frequently mentioned policy area. The President's State of the Union address frequently focuses on \"international affairs and foreign aid,\" with foreign policy issues being a common topic. Presidents have historically emphasized foreign policy terms in their speeches, such as \"terrorist,\" \"Saddam Hussein,\" \"security,\" and \"Iraq.\" This trend is not new, as past presidents like Jimmy Carter and Lyndon Johnson also highlighted foreign policy concerns in their addresses. The use of these terms may be a way for presidents to compete for viewership against other media outlets. The State of the Union address is still influential despite declining viewership. Media coverage increases public knowledge about policy priorities. Presidents have used the Internet for alternative dissemination methods, like Obama's \"enhanced broadcast\" in 2013 and \"virtual road trip\" in 2014. The State of the Union address remains influential despite declining viewership. Presidents have utilized the Internet for alternative dissemination methods, such as Obama's \"enhanced broadcast\" in 2013 and \"virtual road trip\" in 2014. Participants engaged in a \"Hangout\" with the President via Google+ for a more interactive experience. The opposition response, given by members of the opposing political party, follows the President's address. The opposition response to the State of the Union address began in 1966 with Senator Everett Dirksen and Representative Gerald Ford providing the Republican reply to President Lyndon Johnson. From 1967 to 1986, the response took on various formats, including multiple Members of Congress participating in televised responses. By 1987, the opposition response settled into a format where one or two Members delivered their party's official reply. The opposition response to the State of the Union address began in 1966 with Senator Everett Dirksen and Representative Gerald Ford providing the Republican reply to President Lyndon Johnson. From 1967 to 1986, the response took on various formats, including multiple Members of Congress participating in televised responses. By 1987, the opposition response settled into a format where one or two individuals provided a reply to the President's address. Parties often select rising stars, new congressional leaders, or possible presidential candidates to give the opposing view. Notable figures who have given the opposition response include Senator Robert Dole in 1996, Governor Tim Kaine in 2006, Speaker of the House Paul Ryan in 2011, and Governor Mitch Daniels in 2012. In 1995, Governor Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey became the first non-congressional elected official to deliver the opposition response. In 2007, Senator Jim Webb was the first freshman Member of Congress to provide the opposition response to the State of the Union address. The opposition response typically emphasizes bipartisanship and cooperation, with key figures like Governor Kathleen Sebelius highlighting these themes in their speeches. In a departure from tradition on State of the Union night, the opposition response aims to offer an American perspective rather than a partisan one. While the President's address may cover numerous proposals, the opposition response usually focuses on a few key issues to outline its policy agenda. Representative Paul Ryan set a precedent in 2011 by starting his speech with prayers for the victims of a tragic shooting. The opposition response to the State of the Union usually focuses on key domestic and sometimes foreign policy issues, outlining the party's policy agenda if they were in power. It distinguishes the President's priorities from the opposition's, often directly responding to specific proposals in the President's speech. The opposition often responds directly to specific proposals in the President's State of the Union address, with excerpts leaked beforehand to enable tailored responses. In 2000, Senator Bill Frist criticized President Clinton's health care proposals as bloating government with new programs and bureaucracies. In the opposition response to the State of the Union address, critics often offer counterproposals to the President's policies. In 2010, Governor Bob McDonnell encouraged public input through social media, while in 2014, Representative Cathy McMorris Rodgers used Vine to promote her speech location. The State of the Union address is a crucial tool for the President to outline their policy agenda to Congress and the American public. By appealing directly to the public, the President can use popular support to convince Congress to enact their legislative proposals. This sustained public pressure goes beyond the State of the Union speech. The State of the Union address is a key tool for the President to present their policy agenda to Congress and the public. It serves as a reminder of the separation of powers between the President and Congress, with the President required to inform Congress of the state of the union and recommend legislative measures."
