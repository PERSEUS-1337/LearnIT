The \"Patient Choice Act of 2012\" includes a provision for provisional approval of fast track products under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. If a drug designated as a fast track product is deemed adequately safe by the Secretary, provisional approval is granted for interstate commerce introduction. The \"Patient Choice Act of 2012\" allows for provisional approval of fast track products under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Provisional approval of a drug is subject to specific requirements, including informed consent and the continued collection of safety and efficacy data for full approval. The \"Patient Choice Act of 2012\" allows for provisional approval of fast track products under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Sponsors of fast track drugs can request provisional approval from the Secretary, who must respond within 90 days. The \"Patient Choice Act of 2012\" allows provisional approval for fast track drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The term 'adequately safe' is defined as the risk of death or morbidity caused directly by an adverse effect of the drug being unlikely to be greater than for at least one population. The \"Patient Choice Act of 2012\" allows provisional approval for fast track drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act based on the drug's safety profile compared to existing therapies and historical data. Provisional approval for fast track drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act is subject to specific requirements, including informed consent and submission of necessary data to the Secretary. The Secretary cannot impose additional safety study requirements beyond those for Phase 1 or Phase 2 studies. As a condition of provisional approval for fast track drugs, the sponsor must ensure informed consent by informing individuals of the limited safety data and unproven efficacy of the drug, as well as known and reasonably predictable risks. The individual must be informed of potential risks of death, complications, injury, and ineffectiveness of the drug, and provide written informed consent. The Secretary will issue regulations for informed consent requirements similar to those for human subjects under subpart B of part 50 of title 21, adjusted as appropriate. Sponsors of provisionally approved drugs must continue appropriate studies diligently. During provisional approval, sponsors must establish the drug's effect on clinical or surrogate endpoints, collect necessary data for safety and efficacy, and submit promotional materials for review. During provisional approval, sponsors must submit promotional materials for review at least 30 days prior to dissemination. Section 505-1 applies to drugs subject to provisional approval in the same way as it does to approved drugs under section 505 or 351 of the Public Health Service Act, without limiting the Secretary's authority to determine the need for a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy. Provisional approval for drugs requires submission of promotional materials for review. The approval only applies to specific indications related to the fast track designation and safety must be demonstrated. Termination of provisional approval occurs if the drug is not designated under section 526 or upon approval. The date of drug approval under section 505(c) or 351 of the Public Health Service Act is important. Provisional approval lasts for 5 years unless the sponsor is actively seeking full approval through actions like clinical trials. The Secretary may extend the period for provisional approval if the sponsor needs more time to complete necessary actions or if termination of provisional approval is deemed adverse to public health. The Secretary may extend the provisional approval period to protect public health. Special rule for orphan drugs: provisional approval ends when the drug is fully approved under section 505(c) or 351 of the Public Health Service Act. Withdrawal of provisional approval is also addressed. The Secretary has the authority to withdraw provisional approval of a fast track drug if requirements are not met. Marketing exclusivity rules apply to drugs with provisional approval in the same manner. Provisional approval under this subsection for a drug shall be an addition to the applicable period of marketing exclusivity. Misbranding for marketing of a terminated drug is prohibited unless the drug is approved under section 505(c) or section 351 of the Public Health Service Act. Conforming amendments are made to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.
