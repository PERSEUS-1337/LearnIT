    "content": "The homeland security appropriations bill allocates resources to every departmental component of DHS, with discretionary appropriations providing the majority of funding. The budget also includes fee revenues, trust funds, and mandatory spending. Appropriations for DHS are typically organized into five thematic groupings, with a fifth title containing general provisions that impact the entire department. The pie chart compares annual appropriations for components funded in the first four titles of the DHS appropriations bill. Title II, Security, Enforcement, and Investigations, receives over three-quarters of the budget authority and funds CBP, ICE, TSA, USCG, and USSS. The Administration requested $32,481 million for FY2016, a 2.5% increase from FY2015. The appropriations request for FY2016 was $807 million more than FY2015. Senate-reported S. 1619 proposed $32,484 million in net discretionary budget authority, $3 million more than requested, and $810 million more than FY2015. House-reported H.R. 3128 proposed $32,182 million in net discretionary budget authority, $299 million less than requested, and $508 million more than FY2015. Senate-reported S. 1619 also included $160 million in overseas contingency operations funding for the Coast Guard, covered by an adjustment under the Budget Control Act. House-reported H.R. 3128 did not include this funding. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 included $33,062 million for Homeland Security components in FY2016, $1,388 million more than FY2015. It also allocated $160 million in overseas contingency funding for the Coast Guard as part of an appropriation to DHS. CBP is responsible for security at and between ports of entry along the border, preventing illegal entries by inspecting people and goods. They enforce over 400 laws and regulations to facilitate legitimate travel and trade into the United States. CBP's major programs include Border Security Inspections and Trade Facilitation, Border Security and Control between Ports of Entry, Air and Marine Interdiction, Automation Modernization, Border Security Fencing, Infrastructure, and Technology, Facilities Management, and immigration and customs user fee accounts. The Administration requested $13,620 million in gross budget authority for CBP in FY2016. In FY2016, appropriations legislation included increases in funding for ports of entry operations, training for CBP officers, NII technology equipment, and border security. There was a decrease in infrastructure and technology funding along the borders, while funding for CBP facilities construction and maintenance increased to address maintenance backlog. The increased funding was requested for a backlog of unmet maintenance and repair requirements of CBP facilities, with a decrease of $3 million for Air and Marine Operations. The Administration also requested additional appropriations for an unaccompanied alien children (UAC) Contingency Fund. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $13,281 million in gross budget authority for CBP, $339 million below the Administration's request and $560 million above the FY2015 enacted level. Senate-reported S. 1619 included $11,304 million in net discretionary budget authority for CBP, with a recommended decrease of $137 million below the Administration's request for POE operations. The committee did not recommend funding the Administration's request for additional CBP officers and Border Patrol agents. The number of officers and agents is below the recommended funding levels and is unlikely to reach them until late FY2016. Challenges in hiring and retaining Border Patrol agents were noted, including a lack of polygraph examiners. The House Appropriations Committee recommended an increase of more than $1 million for additional polygraph examiners for Border Patrol agents. The committee also noted a decrease in funding for the CBP Commissioner's office and a lack of timely response from CBP on hiring and funding information. The House-reported bill included decreases in funding for POE operations and operations along the border compared to the Administration's request and FY2015 enacted levels. The reductions were due to the denial of requested funds for unaccompanied alien children contingency. The House-reported bill recommended reducing funding for Border Patrol agents and increasing funding for Border Security Fencing, Infrastructure, and Technology. The committee noted the Administration's practice of carrying over unobligated amounts from prior years while requesting new funding. The House Appropriations Committee recommended reducing funding for Border Patrol agents and increasing funding for Border Security Fencing, Infrastructure, and Technology (BSFIT). The committee suggested carrying over a portion of the recommended amount for BSFIT into FY2017 and FY2018. However, the House-reported bill decreased the multi-year funding for BSFIT by $150 million from the budget request, providing only a portion of the appropriation as three-year funding. This change from previous years would reduce the amount that could be carried over into future fiscal years. Additionally, Title V of the bill included rescissions totaling almost $99 million from prior appropriations for BSFIT, further reducing the existing level of carryover. The House-reported bill included $785 million for CBP's Office of Air and Marine Operations, an increase of $38 million over the Administration's request. Division F of P.L. 114-113 projected a budget of $13,254 million in gross budget authority for CBP, which was $533 million more than the FY2015 enacted level. Border security operations at ports of entry received $3,436 million in funding, which was $249 million more than the FY2015 enacted level. Additionally, $86 million was recommended for the recapitalization of Non-Intrusive Inspection equipment. $3,751 million was recommended for Border Security and Control Between POEs, which was $153 million less than the FY2015 enacted level. In FY2015, border security operations at ports of entry received $3,436 million in funding, $249 million more than the previous year. The recapitalization of Non-Intrusive Inspection equipment was recommended at $86 million. In FY2016, funding for BSFIT and AMO was higher than in FY2015, the Administration's request, and House-reported bills. The number of unaccompanied alien children apprehended at the Southwest border increased significantly in recent years. The Administration requested contingent appropriations for unaccompanied children crossing the border illegally in FY2016, depending on the number transferred to HHS. The trigger for the contingent appropriation is a higher number of UAC transferred compared to the previous fiscal year. Not all UACs detained by DHS are transferred to HHS. In FY2014, only 1,150 out of 15,600 UACs from Mexico were transferred. The UAC Contingency Fund was not funded in P.L. 114-113, but base resources for UAC care were increased. CBP personnel numbers grew from 31,695 in FY2005 to 46,666 in FY2013. In FY2005 to FY2013, CBP personnel numbers increased from 31,695 to 46,666, with Border Patrol agents seeing the largest growth. The number of CBP officers at ports of entry also increased, with Congress appropriating funds for additional officers. The Administration proposed hiring more CBP officers in FY2016, including through user fee increases. The Administration proposed increasing fees for sea passengers and commercial traffic, including COBRA and ECCF fees. Funding for additional CBP officers was not recommended in Senate-reported S. 1619 and House-reported H.R. 3128. P.L. 114-113 did not appropriate funding for more officers. A pilot program was established in the FY2013 DHS appropriations act for CBP to enter into public-private partnerships to support customs and immigration services at certain ports of entry. In FY2013, a pilot program was established for CBP to enter into public-private partnerships to support customs and immigration services at ports of entry. In FY2014 and FY2015, CBP was authorized to accept donations for constructing or expanding POE facilities. P.L. 114-113 increased the number of air POE pilots from 5 to 10. In April 2013, an agreement was reached with the UAE to set up a preclearance facility in Abu Dhabi International Airport, which faced objections from some Members of Congress. The Abu Dhabi program faced objections from some Members of Congress due to concerns about giving Etihad Airlines a competitive advantage and UAE not being a signatory to the UN Refugee Convention. Appropriators have prohibited funding for new preclearance facilities without an economic impact analysis on US air carriers. ICE focuses on enforcing immigration and customs laws within the US through HSI and ERO components. ICE, through its components HSI and ERO, works on disrupting criminal organizations involved in various illegal activities. HSI focuses on issues like terrorist financing, money laundering, human trafficking, and cybercrime, while ERO is responsible for locating and removing foreign nationals who have violated immigration laws. The Administration requested a slight increase in budget authority for ICE in FY2016. In FY2016, ICE received $6,154 million in gross budget authority, which was 2.2% less than the President's request. The Senate and House both proposed $5,815 million in net budget authority for ICE, resulting in $6,137 million in gross budget authority. ICE received 2.2% less than the President's request in gross budget authority in FY2016. The focus of ICE appropriations is mainly on Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) for identifying and removing foreign nationals who violated U.S. immigration law. ERO manages aliens in removal proceedings and ensures their departure from the United States. ICE appropriations mainly focus on Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) for removing foreign nationals who violated U.S. immigration law. Congress sets a detention bed mandate for ICE to detain a certain number of aliens. The Administration requested funding for 34,040 beds, and both S. 1619 and H.R. 3128 aimed to maintain 34,000 beds. P.L. 114-113 included funding for the requested number of detention beds. ICE's Alternatives to Detention (ATD) program offers less restrictive monitoring for aliens awaiting removal proceedings, using tools like electronic monitoring and home visits. The Administration requested $122 million for the program, with the Senate supporting full funding and the House maintaining FY2015 levels. P.L. 114-113 recommended funding at $114 million. In FY2015, Congress appropriated additional funds to EOIR to hire 35 immigration judges and support staff to reduce the backlog of pending removal cases. The President's budget requested $248 million for OPLA, an increase of $31 million over the FY2015 appropriated amount to increase the number of attorneys. Both the House and Senate bills would have increased funding for OPLA over the FY2015 appropriated amount; the Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $243 million for OPLA while the House Appropriations Committee recommended $231 million. The explanatory statement accompanying P.L. 114-113 recommended $240 million for OPLA. In FY2014, there was a large increase in the number of unaccompanied alien children (UAC) apprehensions, straining ICE resources. However, UAC apprehensions decreased significantly in FY2015. The Administration requested contingent appropriations for transporting UAC in case of unexpected rise in FY2016. The amount provided would depend on the number of apprehended children. In FY2016, ICE did not receive additional funding for UAC transfers unless the number exceeded FY2015 levels. The Public Advocate Office was created in 2012 to address concerns about ICE operations but some question its effectiveness and resource allocation. The FY2015 DHS Appropriations Act specified no funds for the Public Advocate position in ICE. Some argue it was renamed Deputy Assistant Director of Custody Programs and Community Outreach. TSA, created in 2001, protects transportation systems in the US. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) was created in 2001 under the Homeland Security Act to protect the aviation system and other modes of transportation from terrorist threats. TSA's responsibilities include deploying screeners, detection systems, and security technologies, assessing risks, issuing regulations, and serving as a liaison to law enforcement and intelligence communities. The TSA budget is a complex component of the DHS Appropriations bill. The TSA's budget includes appropriations and fees to cover aviation security costs, with $250 million allocated for screening technology. The FY2016 President's request totaled $7,347 million for TSA, $118 million more than FY2015. Approximately $2,581 million is expected to be offset through fees. The TSA's FY2016 budget includes $5,615 million for Aviation Security, with $3,382 million expected to be collected through aviation passenger security fees. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 requires $1,250 million of fee collections to be deposited in the Treasury general fund for deficit reduction. The budget also includes identified savings of over $110 million and a decrease of 1,666 screener positions due to efficiencies in risk-based screening practices. The TSA's FY2016 budget includes savings from risk-based screening practices and a $14 million decrease in equipment maintenance costs. These savings offset pay inflation and retirement contribution increases for TSA screeners and air marshals. The focus for FY2016 activities will be on extending the life of existing screening technologies through software patches and upgrades. Additionally, there is an increase in funding for Intelligence and Vetting activities, including credentialing programs like TWIC and TSA Pre-Check. The TSA's FY2016 budget includes fees for background checks, threat assessments, and issuing credentials. Revenue increases are expected due to higher enrollment numbers for TWIC and HAZMAT assessments. Pre-Check anticipates 900,000 applications with $80 million in fee collections. The requested amounts for Surface Transportation Security and Transportation Security Support activities are in line with previous years, with an increase for cybersecurity remediation. The Senate Appropriations bill allocated $7,299 million for TSA, $70 million more than FY2015 but $48 million less than requested. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $5,583 million for aviation security, $32 million less than requested. Specific allocations included $2,843 million for screener compensation and benefits, $593 million for airport management and technology, and $112 million for checkpoint support. Additionally, $23 million was designated for the Federal Flight Deck Officer program, while $790 million was allocated for the Federal Air Marshals Service, $27 million less than requested. The House-reported bill allocated $919 million for transportation security support, $12 million less than requested. It also recommended $5,559 million for aviation security, $55 million less than requested, and specified $29 million less than requested for screening personnel. The bill retained the cap of 45,000 full-time equivalent screeners and reduced personnel compensation amounts TSA-wide. The Appropriations Committee report recommended funding levels below the requested amounts for various TSA programs, including screening personnel, airport management, and FAMS. It also allocated funds for the FFDO program and crew training, surface transportation security, intelligence and vetting, and transportation security support. The total budget for TSA in P.L. 114-113 was $7,440 million, $93 million more than requested, with $5,719 million specified for aviation security. The act specified $5,719 million for aviation security, $104 million more than requested. This included $2,974 million for screener personnel compensation and benefits, $102 million above the request. The act also provided $12 million more for screener training and $111 million for checkpoint support, $14 million above the request. Additionally, $21 million was allocated for the FFDO program and crew training, $1 million more than requested, while $805 million was specified for FAMS, $12 million less than requested. $337 million was allocated for aviation regulation and enforcement, $12 million less than requested, and $436 million for intelligence and vetting, $9 million more than requested. The act specified $436 million for intelligence and vetting, $9 million more than requested. The appropriation for surface transportation security totaled $111 million, $13 million less than requested. TSA had been directed to increase expedited screening eligibility to 50% by the end of CY2014, resulting in annual savings of over $110 million. Concerns have been raised about the impact of efficiency measures on screening effectiveness at airport checkpoints. Passenger checkpoints have been impacted by screening effectiveness. Expedited screening is granted through the Pre-Check program or other methods like threat assessments and managed inclusion. Vulnerabilities have been identified in these approaches, leading policymakers to focus on restricting expedited screening to Pre-Check passengers. A 2015 DHS OIG report recommended steps for TSA to improve vetting processes for Pre-Check applicants. The DHS OIG report in March 2015 highlighted vulnerabilities in the Secure Flight vetting process for granting access to Pre-Check expedited screening lanes. It recommended limiting expedited screening to trusted populations, but TSA did not agree and continues to use Secure Flight vetting. The TSA continues to use Secure Flight risk assessments and managed inclusion to select passengers for expedited screening, despite concerns raised by the Senate and House Appropriations Committees about the security of the populations granted expedited screening. The TSA continues to use expedited screening methods, despite concerns about security. The Senate and House committees support expanding Pre-Check enrollment and partnering with third-party providers. Appropriations committees question the effectiveness of TSA's behavioral detection techniques. The House committee has raised concerns about TSA's screening technologies and techniques, calling for evidence that behavioral indicators can effectively identify potential threats to aviation security. They have requested regular briefings on covert testing activities and corrective actions taken to address deficiencies. Similarly, the Senate committee has asked for quarterly updates on covert testing activities and mitigation actions. The House committee has raised concerns about TSA's screening technologies and techniques, calling for evidence that behavioral indicators can effectively identify potential threats to aviation security. They have requested regular briefings on covert testing activities and corrective actions taken to address deficiencies. The Senate committee has asked for quarterly updates on covert testing activities and mitigation actions. Additionally, H.Rept. 114-215 highlighted TSA's difficulties in acquiring and deploying checkpoint screening technologies, with Congress withholding $25 million in FY2015 in response to GAO findings. TSA was directed by P.L. 114-113 to submit a detailed report on efforts to develop advanced passenger screening technologies and cost-effective deployment of screeners. The joint explanatory statement accompanying P.L. 114-113 expressed concern over TSA's reduction of screening staff and provided direction for additional funding to address security gaps identified by covert testing. This included retaining 602 full-time equivalent positions for checkpoint staffing, centralized screener training, expanding PreCheck application processing, and exploring new screening technologies. Quarterly updates on security gaps and actions were required. Concerns were also raised about airport worker vetting and screening lapses. The DHS OIG reported in June 2015 that TSA's vetting processes for airport workers with access to secured areas were often inaccurate or incomplete. TSA lacked assurance that all credentialed airport workers had been properly vetted, and failed to identify 73 workers with links to terrorism due to restricted access to watchlist data. TSA relies on airports for criminal history checks, but has limited oversight, leading to incomplete and inaccurate data. Recommendations were made for TSA to improve vetting processes with federal agencies and airports. The Aviation Security Advisory Committee recommended improving security audits, internal controls, biometric standards, surveillance technologies, access controls, and employee engagement in airport security. They also suggested exploring risk-based screening techniques for certain employee groups to enhance security. The Senate Appropriations Committee directed TSA to provide updates on implementing recommendations, including workforce vetting. The Aviation and Transportation Security Act mandated 100% baggage screening, with TSA deploying detection systems to airports. TSA is now focusing on replacing aging screening units. TSA is replacing aging screening units with new, more capable next generation equipment using Aviation Security Capital Fund (ASCF) monies. The Senate and House bills allow ASCF funds to be used for explosives detection screening equipment procurement. Labor savings from deploying high-speed explosives detection systems must be included in TSA's report on efficiencies. The House committee encourages TSA to expedite the development, testing, and deployment of more effective equipment. The Senate and House committees urge TSA to expedite the development and deployment of more efficient baggage screening systems. They also highlight the need for TSA to establish a process to validate and reimburse airports for eligible costs related to modifying baggage handling systems for in-line screening. Additionally, unresolved reimbursement claims from airports for systems installed prior to 2008 need to be addressed within 60 days of enactment. The House committee report highlighted the use of Aviation Security Capital Fund for in-line baggage screening projects at growing airports. P.L. 114-113 authorized funding for explosives detection equipment and directed TSA to develop a process for validating claims submitted by airports for in-line baggage screening. The House committee recommended reductions in funding for TSA due to historic under-execution of funds and diversion of funds for unplanned activities. The House bill included rescissions of funds from various security areas. The Senate bill proposed rescinding $28 million from aviation security funding and $5 million from prior year balances for surface transportation. Division F of P.L. 114-113 rescinded $158 million for aviation security and $14 million for surface transportation security in FY2015. DHS components were directed to submit obligation plans within 45 days of enactment, detailing reprogrammed funds and employee levels. The budget request includes almost $43 million for Technology Infrastructure Modernization (TIM), an acquisition project integrating vetting systems. TIM achieved initial operating capability in FY2014, integrating 2 million TWIC records with plans for further integration by FY2018. The system aims to improve access to identification information and criminal records. The House committee report expressed concern about delays and cost escalation in the Technology Infrastructure Modernization (TIM) project, which aims to improve access to identification information and criminal records. TSA is behind schedule and has scaled back the system's functionality. They have been asked to provide revised plans, an updated schedule, cost estimates, and a description of the end-state system envisioned under the TIM program. The TIM program, aimed at improving access to identification information and criminal records, has faced delays and cost escalation. TSA has reduced the system's functionality, leading to a $500,000 reduction in funding for Other Vetting Programs. The Coast Guard, responsible for maritime security, also performs non-homeland security missions. The President requested $8,151 million in discretionary appropriations for the Coast Guard, $227 million less than FY2015. The Coast Guard requested $8,151 million in appropriations, $227 million less than FY2015. The Senate recommended $8,721 million, $570 million more than the President's request, with additional funding for operating expenses and acquisitions. The House recommended $8,512 million, $361 million more than the President's request. The House-reported bill allocated $8,512 million for the Coast Guard, including $6,899 million for operating expenses and $1,301 million for acquisition, construction, and improvements. This is $361 million more than the President's request. The omnibus bill provided a total of $9,158 million in discretionary appropriations for the Coast Guard, which is $780 million more than FY2015 and about $1 billion more than the President requested. The House-reported bill allocated $8,512 million for the Coast Guard, including $6,899 million for operating expenses and $1,301 million for acquisition, construction, and improvements. Congress provided additional funding for acquisition, construction, and improvements compared to the President's request. There were differences in proposed budgets for new vessels and aircraft procurement in the 2016 fiscal year. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended procuring a ninth national security cutter (NSC), allocating more funds than the President's request. The original plan was to acquire eight NSCs, with the House report stating that funding for additional NSCs beyond the program of record would be unnecessary. The House Appropriations Committee recommended additional funding for Coast Guard acquisitions, including $95 million for a thirteenth HC-130J aircraft and $83 million for shore facilities. There were differences in funding levels for the Offshore Patrol Cutter and Fast Response Cutters. For more details, refer to CRS Report R42567. The omnibus bill provided $83 million more than requested for Coast Guard shore facilities, including a new ship-lift facility, housing, training centers, and boat piers. The production of shale oil in North Dakota and Texas has changed how crude oil is transported on U.S. waterways, with more oil being transported domestically by barge. Petroleum transportation on inland waterways has increased, surpassing coal as the leading commodity transported. The Coast Guard is finalizing a new safety inspection regime for barges due to the significant increase in crude oil transportation by barge. This includes establishing structural standards and crew qualifications, as authorized by the 2004 Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Act. Congress is also concerned with evaluating hours-of-service limits for crews on tugs pushing barge tows. The Coast Guard is finalizing a new safety inspection regime for barges, including structural standards and crew qualifications, due to the increase in crude oil transportation by barge. Congress is concerned about evaluating hours-of-service limits for crews on tugs pushing barge tows, with delays in finalizing related rulemakings. Additional funds have been requested and appropriated for personnel in the Coast Guard's Marine Safety Office to address the backlog of rulemakings and strengthen safety inspections. The Coast Guard is responsible for enforcing fuel use regulations within a 200-mile perimeter from the coastlines. Congress requested information on ECA enforcement actions, waivers granted, and engine stall-outs when switching to cleaner fuels. The Coast Guard issued a safety alert in September 2014 regarding loss of propulsion incidents in California waters related to fuel switching. The incidents were caused by thermal shock from using cleaner fuel, leading to fuel pump seizures and leaks. Interest in using liquefied natural gas (LNG) as a ship fuel has increased to reduce emissions in Emission Control Areas (ECAs). Some cargo ships serving U.S. non-contiguous trades have already converted to LNG. The Coast Guard has provided guidance on the use of LNG as ship fuel, especially in ECA waters. LNG-fueled ships pose budget issues for the Coast Guard due to safety concerns. The Coast Guard's primary function includes installing and maintaining aids to navigation, such as buoys and beacons. They service about 134 buoys and fixed aids to navigation to ensure safe passage for vessels. The Coast Guard services 134 buoys and fixed aids for navigation, including 68 \"buoy tenders\" for channel marker positioning. Despite vessel technology like GPS and AIS, mariners still rely on physical aids. Electronic aids are being tested on the West Coast and Mississippi River to enhance accuracy due to the increase in vessel size and traffic. The Coast Guard is testing electronic aids to navigation on the West Coast and the Mississippi River, with e-navigation potentially offering significant cost savings. Key questions remain about the reliability, accessibility, and cybersecurity concerns of e-navigation. The Coast Guard's budgetary needs will depend on the answers to these questions, and a Senate committee report requests a feasibility report on using e-navigation in the Arctic Ocean. The Coast Guard is also testing small unmanned aircraft for search and rescue operations. The Coast Guard is testing small unmanned aircraft for search and rescue, patrols, and maritime surveillance. They have tested both smaller hand-held UAS and larger UAS to extend surveillance range. In April 2015, testing in the Arctic for missions like surveying ice conditions and search and rescue was announced. The House committee recommended an additional $12 million for UAS on national security cutters, which was included in the omnibus. The use of UAS offers efficiencies in Coast Guard missions. The U.S. Secret Service has concurrent missions in criminal investigations. The U.S. Secret Service has two main missions - criminal investigations and protection of certain individuals and events. Criminal investigation activities include financial crimes, identity theft, counterfeiting, and cyber attacks. The protection mission involves safeguarding Presidents, Vice Presidents, foreign visitors, and key locations like the White House. The FY2016 appropriations request for the Secret Service was $1,939 million, a 16.4% increase from the previous year. The FY2016 appropriations for the U.S. Secret Service saw a significant increase in funding for the protection mission, driven by a $300 million increase designated for protection of persons and facilities, as well as preparations for protecting presidential candidates and nominees. This increase was based on recommendations from the USSS Protective Mission Panel established in October 2014 to review security after high-profile incidents. The Senate-reported S. 1619 included $1,924 million for the USSS, slightly below the requested level but significantly above the amount appropriated in FY2015. The FY2016 appropriations for the U.S. Secret Service included funding for protection of persons and facilities, with proposed funding $80 million higher than FY2015. The House Appropriations Committee recommended slightly less funding than requested, but still higher than FY2015 levels. The omnibus included almost $1,934 million for the USSS, slightly below the requested level but significantly above the FY2015 enacted level. The FY2016 appropriations for the U.S. Secret Service included funding for protection of persons and facilities, with proposed funding $80 million higher than FY2015. The omnibus included almost $1,934 million for the USSS, slightly below the requested level but significantly above the FY2015 enacted level. A $49 million reduction was made in the Salaries and Expenses appropriation to fund a realistic number of FTE. The USSS Protective Mission Panel made recommendations on upgrading security at the White House complex, with some recommendations classified. An additional $25 million was included in the FY2015 DHS for initial funding of some recommendations. The FY2015 DHS Appropriations Act (P.L. 114-4) included initial funding for some of the USSS Protective Mission Panel's recommendations, such as upgrading security infrastructure at the White House complex and Vice President's Residence. The Administration proposed $87 million in additional investments for FY2016, including funds for salaries, expenses, and acquisition to support the USSS training facility. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended funding for improvements at the Rowley Training Center but questioned the cost estimates for the canine training facility and White House mock-up. The House Appropriations Committee recommended $29 million in facilities funding, with $13 million for a new canine training facility, full funding for range and tactical area renovations, and funding for maintenance needs at the training center. The Senate Appropriations Committee also recommended $13 million for the new canine facility, along with funding for range upgrades and maintenance. The House Appropriations Committee recommended almost $3 million for a White House mock-up, but withholds over $2 million until a feasibility study and design plan are approved. The bill included $85 million for enhancements related to the Protective Mission Panel, including $24 million for facilities and $11 million for a new Presidential limousine. Additionally, $750,000 was allocated for a feasibility study and design plan for a proposed White House Training Facility. The House Appropriations Committee recommended $750,000 for a proposed White House Training Facility, with further funding contingent on completion of a full cost estimate and third-party review by the USSS. No specific guidance was given on canine training facilities or firing ranges in the explanatory statement."
