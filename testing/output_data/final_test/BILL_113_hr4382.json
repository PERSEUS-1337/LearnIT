FINDINGS.\" Congress finds that the National Technical Information Service (NTIS), along with other government agencies, collects and distributes government information. NTIS, established in 1950, focuses on scientific, technical, engineering, and business-related information. A GAO report revealed that NTIS sold only 8 percent of its reports between 1995 and 2000. The GAO estimates that 74 percent of reports added to NTIS's repository from 1990 to 2011 were available from other public sources, with 95 percent of them being free. The most common source for these reports was websites like the Federal Internet portal and Google. The National Technical Information Service should not be funded with taxpayer dollars for reports available for free online. Secretary of Commerce William Daley acknowledged in 1999 that NTIS would become obsolete due to agencies providing research for free on the web. The GAO reported in November 2012 that most reports in NTIS from 1990 to 2011 were accessible for free from other sources. According to a November 2012 GAO report, NTIS has been running deficits for the past 11 years, raising concerns about its viability. To compensate for lost revenue, NTIS charges other federal agencies for non-primary services. Future technological advances may render NTIS services even more unnecessary. NTIS has been running deficits for the past 11 years, raising concerns about its viability. Future technological advances may make NTIS services even more unnecessary for essential government functions. SEC. 2. NATIONAL TECHNICAL INFORMATION SERVICE. Repeal of the National Technical Information Act of 1988, transferring critical functions to various government agencies for consultation and certification by the Comptroller General. Before the repeal date, the Secretary of Commerce can transfer critical functions of NTIS to another office within the Department of Commerce. All NTIS functions, except those transferred, will be abolished on the repeal date. Before the effective date, the Secretary of Commerce must certify to the Senate Finance Committee and the House Energy and Commerce Committee that all National Technical Information Service operations have ceased."
