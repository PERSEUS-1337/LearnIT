    "title": "AB 2572",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 3068 of the Civil Code is amended to establish a lien for compensation related to repairs, labor, supplies, and storage of vehicles subject to registration under the Vehicle Code. The lien arises when charges are presented to the owner or 15 days after completion of work. The lienholder is prohibited from removing parts used for the services. Any lien under this section that arises from work on a vehicle must be addressed within 30 days through authorization for a lien sale or court action. If the lien is extinguished, the vehicle must be returned to the legal owner or lessor upon demand and payment for storage fees. If the lienholder fails to permit inspection of the vehicle by the legal owner or lessor within 24 to 72 hours after written demand, any lien on the vehicle will be extinguished, and no lien sale can be conducted. Any lien on a vehicle will be extinguished if the lienholder fails to provide a copy of the work order or invoice to the legal owner or lessor upon written demand. The lienholder is also not allowed to charge the legal owner or lessor more than the authorized amounts for the release of the vehicle. The lien on a vehicle is invalid if it exceeds certain amounts for work, services, storage, or safekeeping, unless prior notice is given to the legal owner. The lien on a vehicle is invalid if it exceeds certain amounts for work, services, storage, or safekeeping, unless prior notice is given to the legal owner named in the registration certificate, and written consent is obtained before any work, services, storage, safekeeping, or rental of parking space are performed. The lien on a vehicle is invalid if charges for care, storage, or parking space rental exceed 60 days without compliance with Vehicle Code sections. Charges for care or storage cannot exceed one day if a release request is made within 24 hours; otherwise, charges apply on a daily basis. In any legal action to recover a vehicle wrongfully withheld by a lienholder, the prevailing party can receive up to $1,750 in attorney's fees and costs."
