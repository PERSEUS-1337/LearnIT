    "content": "The EU is using an emissions trading scheme to comply with the Kyoto Protocol, following the success of the US sulfur dioxide control program. The EU's emissions trading scheme under the Kyoto Protocol covers various energy-intensive facilities across 25 Member countries, accounting for 45% of the EU's carbon dioxide emissions. The program started in 2005, with subsequent trading periods planned for 2008 and 2013 to meet emission reduction targets. The EU's emissions trading scheme, established in 2003, saw a 2.3% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2001 due to a shift from coal to natural gas in the UK and the inclusion of East Germany. With the accession of 10 more countries in 2004, emissions dropped by 22.6% overall, except for Slovenia. This expansion increased opportunities for cost-effective allowance trades. The European Commission adopted a \"learning-by-doing\" approach for the EU's emissions trading program to prepare for the Kyoto Protocol. They aimed for a comprehensive trading scheme covering all greenhouse gases and sinks, with potential cost-saving benefits confirmed by economic analysis. The European Commission aimed for a comprehensive trading scheme to reduce Kyoto compliance costs for EU countries. However, they chose a trading system with limited coverage due to EU politics influencing the decision. This decision resulted in cost savings of 3 billion euro, or one-third, compared to a scenario without trading among Member countries. The European Commission initially considered a more comprehensive trading scheme but opted for a limited coverage system due to political reasons. The decision was justified by uncertainties surrounding emissions of fluorinated gases and carbon dioxide absorption. The EC cited complex technical and administrative issues for small mobile emitters like private cars as reasons for the limited scheme. The size of the trading program was determined based on five criteria including environmental effectiveness and economic efficiency. The European Commission looked at five criteria for the trading scheme: environmental effectiveness, economic efficiency, competition effects, feasibility, and alternative policies. Starting with a small number of sectors that contribute significantly to emissions was deemed satisfactory. The six chosen sectors emit 45% of the EU15's CO2 emissions. National Allocation Plans (NAPs) are crucial for the EU to meet its Kyoto obligations. Each member must submit a NAP outlining allocations under the ETS. The European Commission assessed National Allocation Plans (NAPs) for the emissions trading scheme under the ETS to ensure compliance with Kyoto targets and criteria. NAPs for the first and second trading periods had specific requirements, including emissions caps, protections against discrimination, and provisions for new entrants and clean technology. The EC approved most NAPs by the end of 2004, with the last one from Greece approved in June 2006. The European Commission found issues with National Allocation Plans (NAPs) from various states, including excessive allocation of allowances and attempts to make \"ex-post adjustments.\" These adjustments were deemed disruptive to the emissions market. The EU's goal for the 2005-2007 period was to gain experience with emissions trading rather than meet Kyoto Protocol targets. Table 2 shows national emissions allocations and 2005 emissions levels for 21 EU countries. Table 2 displays national emissions allocations and 2005 emissions levels for 21 EU countries, recorded by the Community Independent Transaction Log (CITL) by the compliance deadline of April 30, 2006. The 21 countries allocated an average of 1.8295 billion allowances for the first trading period, with 73.4 million allowances set aside for new sources or auctions. Verified 2005 emissions for covered sources totaled 1.7853 billion metric tons. The excess allocation of 44.2 million allowances led to a drop in allowance prices in May 2006. Emissions from 8,980 sources accounted for over 99% of allocated allowances, with 849 sources not surrendering sufficient allowances by April 30. The EC will determine if sources in 21 countries have surrendered enough allowances, with penalties for noncompliance. Data on installations and allowances are available for active registries only. Some commentators have raised concerns about the accuracy of the data on emissions allocations, suggesting that the reported figures may not be sufficient to meet Kyoto requirements or develop the trading market. Technical issues in certain national registries have led to incomplete information on installation level surrenders in some Member States. The EU faces challenges in meeting Kyoto requirements and developing the trading market due to over-allocation of allowances. The Climate Action Network calls for stronger emissions limits to ensure environmental benefits. The EC sees the over-allocation issue as a learning process for the second trading period starting in 2008. The EU-ETS traded 362 million metric tons of CO2 in 2005, valued at 7.218 billion euro. Brokers, exchange markets, and bilateral transactions were involved in trading. The average price for an allowance traded in 2005 was 19.9 euro. The EU-ETS traded 362 million metric tons of CO2 in 2005, valued at 7.218 billion euro, with average allowance prices of 19.9 euro. Allowance prices have been volatile since trading began in 2005, dropping to 9-11 euro in April and May due to reported over-allocation in some Member States, but recovering to 17 euro by July 2006. The market is still narrow and maturing, with modest trading volumes. The EU-ETS sulfur dioxide trading program faced thin markets initially, with allowance prices fluctuating unpredictably. Various factors such as regulatory, climatic, and economic events influenced the market during the first trading period. Regulatory delays and over-allocation led to a sudden market correction in May 2006, while weather conditions and fuel prices also played a significant role in price changes. In 2005, fuel prices had a significant influence on ETS allowance prices, with 79% of the variance explained by changes in fuel prices. The power sector, conducting the majority of trades, played a key role in price development. Kaasik argues that fuel prices impact carbon prices, with allowance prices being a derivative of natural gas and coal pricing in the short-term. Allowance prices are affected by changes in natural gas and coal prices, creating a correlation with electricity prices. The EU-ETS can link to the Joint Implementation and Clean Development Mechanism of the Kyoto Protocol. Operators can use credits from these projects to meet their allowance obligations. Operators can meet their EU-ETS allowance obligations using credits from JI and CDM projects. These credits, known as CERs and ERUs, are not interchangeable with allowances but are directly entered into the surrendered allowance table. Restrictions apply, including limits set by countries on the use of CERs and ERUs in the second trading period. Some EU countries have carbon funds to explore JI and CDM opportunities. Several EU countries have established carbon funds to pursue JI and CDM opportunities, with CER and ERU credits selling at a discount to ETS allowance prices based on project riskiness. Prices range from 8-15 euro depending on delivery risk. The impact of CDM and JI on the EU-ETS system will be clearer in the second trading period as demand for credits increases. The EC has surveyed stakeholders' viewpoints on ETS implementation and long-term issues. The report surveys stakeholders' viewpoints on ETS implementation and long-term issues, focusing on topics like emissions reduction targets and allocation rules. The EU has established carbon funds for JI and CDM opportunities, impacting the EU-ETS system in the second trading period. The EU-ETS system faces challenges in the second trading period due to discrepancies in emissions caps between EU-15 countries and newer members. EU-15 states must reduce their emissions caps by 6.8% to meet Kyoto Protocol requirements, while newer countries are in better shape. The EU faces challenges in the second trading period of the EU-ETS system due to discrepancies in emissions caps between EU-15 countries and newer members. The anticipated deficit for the original 15 Member States can be covered by trading with newer Member States that have a surplus, but there are other considerations such as countries wanting to retain some surplus for economic growth. The EU-ETS system faces challenges in the second trading period due to discrepancies in emissions caps between EU-15 countries and newer members. Countries may want to retain surplus credits for economic growth, potentially at the expense of Member States in need. The creation of surplus credits via JI and the EC linking directive must be supplemental to domestic efforts. Compliance may be difficult as some sectors not covered by the ETS, like transportation, are growing rapidly. The transportation sector is a major concern for compliance in the EU-ETS system. It is not currently part of the ETS and relies on voluntary agreements with automobile manufacturers to improve fuel efficiency. The goal of achieving a new car fleet average CO2 emissions rate of 120 g CO2/km by 2005 or 2010 is unlikely to be met. The European Commission set targets of 140 g CO2/km by 2008/2009 for new car emissions, but the average rate at the end of 2005 was about 160 g CO2/km. Despite efforts to increase fuel efficiency information for consumers, the impact on their decisions has been minimal. Germany is experiencing tension regarding the burden between ETS and non-ETS sectors in the second trading period. Germany's draft NAP II proposes a 5.6% reduction in ETS allocation, but with emissions only decreasing by 0.6% from the previous year. New power stations built between 2008 and 2012 may opt out of CO2 caps for 14 years, shifting emissions burden to non-ETS sectors. This places a disproportionate burden on these sectors to meet EU commitments. The EU-ETS system involves an interplay between EU-wide and nationwide definitions and procedures based on the Kyoto Protocol. It defines pollutants, emission targets, participation scope, baseline emissions, and compliance requirements. Germany plans to reduce emissions by training drivers to drive more economically, but the effectiveness of public education programs may be questionable. The EU-ETS system involves industry participants trading allowances equal to 1 metric ton of CO2. The EC harmonizes Member's NAPs with penalties, allocation methods, monitoring, and registries to achieve Kyoto targets. Members have flexibility in allocations, banking, and auctioning. There are significant differences between Members in participant definitions, emissions caps, and enforcement. Stakeholders seek improved harmonization of NAPs for economic and administrative efficiency. The EU-ETS system involves trading allowances for CO2 emissions. Stakeholders are interested in harmonizing NAPs by the EC, addressing issues like new entrants, affected units, allocation methods, use of credits, and monitoring rules. Efforts are being made to increase the use of benchmarking standards in setting allocations. The EC lacks authority to scrutinize allocations at the facility level. The EC lacks authority to scrutinize allocations at the facility level, so any allocation harmonization would be voluntary. Allocation schemes like benchmarking may not be suitable for all industries. Diversity between Member countries in the EU-ETS system is inevitable due to the devolution of allocation responsibilities to its 25 Member States. The EU ETS allows Member States to allocate valuable assets to their industries, similar to US systems. The Commission aims to increase harmonization through guidance notes. Germany is considering allowing new coal-fired power plants to opt-out of the ETS for the first 14 years to promote construction. Stakeholders support a harmonized approach for new entrants and closures, with most believing allowances should be provided free. The EU ETS allows Member States to allocate assets to industries, similar to US systems. Most stakeholders believe allowances for new entrants should be provided free, with reserves set up for this purpose. Allocation methods vary among Member States, but the importance of reserves will increase in future trading periods. The manner in which new entrants receive allowances may impact long-term investment decisions. Allocating allowances based on output rather than carbon intensity can incentivize the development of low-carbon alternatives. Giving more allowances to coal plants over gas plants could hinder climate change objectives, increase future emission reduction costs, and lead to higher electricity prices. This could be further exacerbated if carbon-intensive new entrants receive free allowances for multiple trading periods. The German Government's treatment of coal-fired power plants poses challenges in directing investments towards low-carbon projects. Harmonization across the EU is sought for defining combustion installations under the ETS, which currently applies to energy activities in various sectors above 20 MW thermal rated input. The EU ETS applies to various sectors above 20 MW thermal rated input, including iron and steel, cement, glass, and pulp and paper facilities. Finland and Sweden include small district heating installations below 20 MW, while Germany allows some coal-fired power plants to opt-out for 14 years. Small installations (20-50 MW) make up 30% of facilities but emit a small percentage of CO2. Data shows that the largest 7.5% of installations produce three-quarters of emissions, while small installations (<10,000 metric tons) contribute less than 1%. The EU ETS covers various sectors above 20 MW thermal rated input, with small installations (<10,000 metric tons) responsible for less than 1% of emissions. The debate continues on whether to include these smaller facilities in the ETS. The EU is taking a gradual approach to emissions trading, focusing on adding more economic sectors like chemical, aviation, and aluminum industries. Stakeholder surveys suggest a preference for incremental expansion rather than a comprehensive system. Participants are recommended to be given a longer time frame for future ETS implementation. The EU ETS is gradually expanding to include more economic sectors like chemical, aviation, and aluminum industries. Stakeholders prefer incremental expansion over a comprehensive system. Participants may be given a longer time frame for ETS implementation in the future. The ETS could help the EU meet its Kyoto Protocol obligations by trading with newer Member States and utilizing CERs and ERUs from the CDM and JI. Other countries like Japan and Canada may also incorporate emissions trading into their strategies. Table 6 provides estimates of available allowances for the Kyoto Protocol's compliance period. The EU ETS is expanding to include more sectors like chemical, aviation, and aluminum industries. Stakeholders prefer incremental expansion. Table 6 estimates available allowances for the Kyoto Protocol's compliance period. Surplus credits from JI and CDM are restricted by the EC linking directive. Countries define \"supplemental\" differently in their NAPs, impacting allowance trades. The overall commitment of the Kyoto Protocol is another consideration for the ETS. The EU ETS covers only a percentage of greenhouse gas emissions in EU Member States, with some sectors not covered growing faster than those covered, especially in transportation. There are concerns about the ETS's effectiveness in directing long-term investment towards a low-carbon future, as early signs show over-allocation of allowances and some countries directing investments towards carbon-intensive facilities. Norway also has an emissions trading system for energy and process sectors, covering 51 facilities. The country's carbon tax is much higher than the anticipated allowance price under the trading program, levied on about 64% of CO2 emissions. Norway's emissions trading program covers the period 2005-2007, with an expanded phase starting in 2008. The Quota Commission aims for comprehensive coverage of greenhouse gas emissions, suggesting a hybrid system of quotas to regulate CO2 emissions at the producer level. This approach is seen as effective in incentivizing emission reductions. Norway's emissions trading program covers the period 2005-2007, with an expanded phase starting in 2008. The Quota Commission recommends regulating process emissions through quotas at the end-user level for major industrial companies and at the retailer or importer level for small sources. The future direction of Norway's trading system may be influenced by the EU ETS. The government is considering expanding the system to include more sources of emissions through an upstream allocation system. Norway's emissions trading program, starting in 2008, may move away from including more emission sources through an upstream allocation system, influenced by the EU ETS design features."
