    "content": "The Energy Independence and Security Act (P.L. 110-140, H.R. 6) is a comprehensive energy policy law focused on increasing energy efficiency and renewable energy availability. Key provisions include Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) Standards, Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), and appliance/lighting efficiency standards. The law aims for a 35 miles per gallon target for cars and light trucks by 2020, along with fuel economy programs for medium- and heavy-duty trucks. The Energy Independence and Security Act establishes fuel economy standards for medium- and heavy-duty trucks, with a separate standard for work trucks. The law sets a modified standard for renewable fuel, starting at 9.0 billion gallons in 2008 and increasing to 36 billion gallons by 2022, with 21 billion gallons required to be from advanced biofuels. Energy efficiency standards are also set. Energy efficiency standards are set for various products including incandescent lamps, fluorescent lamps, and consumer electronic products. The law also mandates efficiency standards for external power supplies, residential appliances, electric motors, and commercial refrigeration units. Provisions for a Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard and repeal of tax subsidies for oil and gas were not included in the enacted law. The House-passed second degree amendment to H.R. 6 proposed a national Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard (RPS) target of 15% of total electricity sales by 2020, with up to 4 percentage points allowed for energy efficiency measures. This provision was removed by the Senate and did not make it into the final version of the bill. The House-passed second degree amendment to H.R. 6 included provisions to repeal $22 billion of oil and gas subsidies for energy efficiency and renewable energy incentives. However, most of these provisions were removed by the Senate, with enough tax revenue offsets to cover the cost of the CAFE provision. On January 18, 2007, the House passed the CLEAN Energy Act (H.R. 6) as part of the \"Hundred Hours Legislation\" to establish a reserve for funds from repealed oil and gas subsidies. The Senate later transformed H.R. 6 into a 500-page omnibus energy policy bill focused on energy efficiency and renewable energy. The Senate transformed H.R. 6 into a 500-page omnibus energy policy bill, titled the Renewable Fuels, Consumer Protection, and Energy Efficiency Act of 2007. Key provisions included appliance efficiency standards, increasing the renewable fuel standard to 36 billion gallons by 2022, and raising the corporate average fuel economy standards to 35 mpg by 2020. The House passed the omnibus energy policy bill, H.R. 3221, which included a 15% renewable energy portfolio standard and tax incentives for energy efficiency and renewable energy. The House and Senate omnibus bills had different bill numbers, preventing direct conference committee action. After the House passed H.R. 3221 with a renewable energy portfolio standard and tax incentives, negotiations began with the Senate on key energy issues. EIA issued a report on the impacts of the proposals, but negotiations ceased when the Senate Ranking Member objected to including an RPS. The White House later threatened to veto the bill if it included an RPS. On December 6, 2007, the House passed its second version of an omnibus energy bill, which included provisions on CAFE, RFS, renewable electricity portfolio standard, and tax incentives for energy efficiency and renewable energy measures. The bill proposed increasing the CAFE standard to 35 miles per gallon by 2020 and the renewable fuel standard to 36 billion gallons per year by 2022. The House passed an energy bill with new tax incentives for energy efficiency and renewable energy, offset by repealing $21 billion in oil and gas subsidies. The White House threatened to veto the bill due to tax increases and a national renewable electricity standard that could raise energy costs and ignore state needs. It also criticized the lack of EPA regulation in fuel economy and objected to RFS prescriptions. The House passed an energy bill with new tax incentives for energy efficiency and renewable energy, offset by repealing oil and gas subsidies. The White House objected to RFS prescriptions and criticized the lack of EPA regulation in fuel economy. In December 2007, the Senate failed to pass a bill with provisions for an RPS and the repeal of oil and gas subsidies. The Senate approved a substitute amendment to the House-passed energy bill, removing tax incentives for energy efficiency and renewable energy, as well as repealing subsidies for oil and gas producers. The resulting bill, signed into law as P.L. 110-140, established a single CAFE standard of 35 mpg by MY2020, preserving the distinction between passenger cars and light trucks. Interim standards will be based on vehicle attributes. The new law sets interim standards for manufacturers to meet by MY2011, with the requirement to reach 92% of the standard. Manufacturers can earn credits for exceeding standards in one vehicle class and apply them to boost the CAFE of another class. Credits can be bought and sold between manufacturers. Civil penalties for non-compliance will support future rulemaking and provide grants for research and development. Flexible-fueled vehicle credits will be phased out by MY2020. Standards will be developed for work trucks and commercial medium- and heavy-duty vehicles. This subtitle establishes a loan guarantee program for advanced battery development, grant programs for plug-in hybrid vehicles, incentives for purchasing heavy-duty hybrid vehicles for fleets, and credits for various electric vehicles. Federal agencies are required to achieve at least a 20% reduction in annual petroleum consumption by 2015. Federal agencies must achieve a 20% reduction in annual petroleum consumption and a 10% increase in annual alternative fuel consumption, with milestones and progress reporting required. Regulations for this program must be issued within 18 months. The renewable fuel standard (RFS) is extended and increased, with a new standard starting at 9.0 billion gallons in 2008 and rising to 36 billion gallons in 2022, with a focus on advanced biofuels from 2016 onwards. The Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) is expanded to include biofuels from feedstock other than corn starch, with waivers possible in case of disruptions. New biorefineries must reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20% compared to gasoline and diesel. Cash awards are available for biorefineries displacing 80% of fossil-derived processing fuels. Studies on the economic impacts of RFS expansion are required. The expansion of the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) includes grants for research on biodiesel and biogas as motor fuels, R&D for cellulosic biofuels technologies, conversion of corn-based ethanol plants to produce cellulosic biofuels, and exploration of algae as a biofuels feedstock. It also supports university-based R&D on biofuels, focuses on infrastructure and biorefineries, studies potential impacts of increased biofuels use, and increases funding for DOE biofuels research.
