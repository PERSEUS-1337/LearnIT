    "content": "The \"Child Welfare Workforce Study Act\" is the short title of this Act. It includes findings related to child welfare workforce. The \"Child Welfare Workforce Study Act\" finds that child welfare staff face obstacles such as high caseloads, lack of supervision, mentoring, and professional advancement, leading to burnout and turnover. States struggle to hire and retain quality staff. The turnover rates among child welfare staff are high, leading to multiple placements of children in foster care, longer stays, and lower permanency rates. This results in increased costs for child welfare agencies. Key components of an effective child welfare workforce include supervision, staff training, caseload management, and cultural competence.
