The algorithm's performance relies on the extracted features, but traditional methods struggle with phase shift, amplitude, and signal length variations in time series analysis. The paper proposes a new clustering algorithm using recurrent neural network and variational Bayes method for time series data analysis. It addresses the challenges of phase shift, compress/stretch, and length variation in signals. The algorithm shows robustness against variations and improves classification performance. Feature extraction methods such as Fourier or wavelet transform, as well as recurrent neural networks (RNN), have been effective in addressing issues like compress/stretch, phase shift, and signal length variation in time series analysis. However, there is still a need for comprehensive studies on these problems. Feature extraction methods like RNN-AE have been studied for unsupervised learning. A new clustering algorithm focusing on the dynamical system aspect of RNN-AE is proposed in this paper, utilizing a multi-decoder autoencoder with variational Bayes method. The paper introduces a new clustering algorithm using a multi-decoder autoencoder with the variational Bayes method. It explains the algorithm's application to time series data, including experiments with periodic and driving data. Previous studies have explored clustering algorithms using autoencoders, such as integrating distance metrics into objective functions and proposing generative models with clustering structures. The paper introduces a new clustering algorithm using a multi-decoder autoencoder with the variational Bayes method. It explains the algorithm's application to time series data and the architecture of recurrent neural networks for time series data. The curr_chunk discusses the architecture of a Unitary Matrix RNN for time series data, which uses a recursive structure with a cell unit and an activation function. It mentions the vanishing gradient problem and solutions like LSTM and GRU with gate structures. The unitary matrix RNN offers a simpler solution to the vanishing gradient problem compared to traditional RNN architectures. It utilizes a unitary matrix as the transfer matrix V, preserving the norm of the variable vector and maintaining the original network structure. The focus is on the dynamical system aspect of the RNN, requiring the identification of the transform matrix V in the space of unitary matrices. The architecture of an Autoencoder (AE) using RNN is shown in Fig. 2, with an encoder unit and a decoder unit. The input data is recovered from the encoded signal h using the matrix (V dec, U dec). RNN describes a universal dynamical system with a focus on the transformation of the hidden variable. The Multi-Decoder RNN AE (MDRA) architecture is introduced to extract various dynamical system features, unlike the original RNN which focuses on a single dynamical system. The learning algorithm for optimizing parameters in MDRA is derived in the following section. The learning algorithm for optimizing parameters in MDRA involves applying a clustering method using the variational Bayes method to adjust the number of clusters. The free energy, defined as negative marginal log-likelihood, is calculated using data tensor X and parameter tensor W. The probabilistic model used is a Gaussian mixture model with prior distributions for probability vector \u03b1 and precision parameter \u03b2. The Gaussian mixture model was used as the probabilistic model with prior distributions for \u03b1 and \u03b2. The variational Bayes algorithm was applied to derive the upper bound of the free energy using Jensen's inequality and Kullback-Leibler divergence. The variational free energy is minimized under fixed parameters W. The variational Bayes algorithm is used to minimize the variational free energy under fixed parameters W. The RNN learning algorithm is applied to further minimize the parameters W. The MDRA algorithm is derived to minimize the variational free energy, with specific steps outlined in the derivation. The algorithm calculates R using the VB part of MDRA until the difference in variational free energy is below a threshold. Initial performance testing was done using periodic signals. The algorithm performance was tested using periodic signals with varying parameters. RNN-AE and MDRA were compared for feature extraction, with results shown in Fig. 6 and Fig. 7. Multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) was used for dimension reduction. RNN-AE was able to separate the encoded data effectively. The RNN-AE algorithm was able to effectively separate input data into three frequency regions, although some overlap was present. MDRA extracted clustering allocation weight r_n, which showed complete separation of frequency components without overlap. This feature extraction demonstrated robustness for phase shift, amplitude, and signal length variation. The algorithm was further tested on driver identification using actual driving data. The input data included speed, acceleration, braking, and steering angle signals. A sliding window was used to extract 10 seconds of differential data. The feature extraction results by RNN-AE and MDRA are compared, showing different trends in the distributions of the latent variables. The accuracy of driver identification using MDRA is also discussed, demonstrating robustness in handling variations in phase shift, amplitude, and signal length. The feature extraction performance of MDRA using actual time series data shows clustering weights narrowing down to three effective components. The distribution of frequency data forms spreading clusters without overlapping, indicating diversity in driving scenes. The MDRA algorithm extracts dynamical system features from time series data, improving identification performance by combining features from different sources. It minimizes errors and avoids over-fitting by using unlabeled data. Experimental results show robustness and advantages in handling phase shifts. The MDRA algorithm shows robustness in handling phase shifts, amplitude, and signal length variations, boosting classification performance. The hyperparameter setting of the prior distribution greatly affects clustering results and classification performance. Future studies will explore the relationship between feature extraction performance and hyperparameter settings. The variational Bayes algorithm is derived from the results obtained by applying the RNN algorithm and MDRA algorithm. The parameter setting for the experiments in Section 5 includes L as the dimension of hidden variable h, capacity, fft, and cpx as parameters of EUNN, K as the number of decoders, and \u03b8. The variational Bayes algorithm is based on the RNN and MDRA algorithms. Parameters like L, capacity, fft, and cpx are used in EUNN. K is the number of decoders, and \u03b8, \u03bd, \u03bb are hyperparameters. The algorithm was applied to driving data in Section 5.2, using differential signals of speed, acceleration, braking, and steering angle. Fig. 10 displays examples of acceleration signals."
