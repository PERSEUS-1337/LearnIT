    "content": "The \"National Capital Transportation Amendments Act of 2007\" recognizes the importance of the Metro public transit system in the Washington metropolitan area for the Federal Government's functions and emergency situations. Congress has previously provided funding for the Metrorail system and additional funding is needed to maintain its functionality and viability. The National Capital Transportation Act of 1969 is amended to authorize additional federal contributions for capital and preventive maintenance projects for the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit System. The Secretary of Transportation is authorized to make grants to the Transit Authority for capital and preventive maintenance projects. Federal grants will cover 50 percent of the project cost and are subject to the provisions of the Compact. The project cost must be provided in cash from non-Federal sources for mass transportation projects. Funds can come from cash surpluses, reserves, or new capital. The use of funds must comply with federal transportation law requirements, except as determined by the Secretary of Transportation. The Secretary of Transportation must approve any amendments to the Compact before providing funds to the Transit Authority. Amendments must ensure that local governments match Federal funds with dedicated funding sources for operating and maintaining the regional system. The Transit Authority requires dedicated funding sources to match Federal appropriations. Proposed amendments include establishing an Inspector General office and expanding the Board of Directors. The Transit Authority requires dedicated funding sources for grants under this section, totaling $1.5 billion over 10 fiscal years. The funds will be available until expended and are in addition to other available amounts under existing laws. The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority Inspector General is established.

They serve a 5-year term and can be reappointed for up to 2 additional terms. Removal from office requires a unanimous vote from the Board of Directors, with reasons communicated to the Governor of Maryland. The Inspector General of the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority carries out duties and responsibilities similar to an Inspector General of an executive branch establishment. This includes conducting annual audits of financial statements. The Inspector General is responsible for auditing the financial accounts of the Transit Authority annually, either directly or through an independent external auditor. Semiannual reports summarizing the Office's activities are prepared and submitted to the transit authority following the same guidelines as an Inspector General under the Inspector General Act of 1978. The Inspector General audits the Transit Authority's financial accounts annually and submits semiannual reports on the Office's activities. The Board of Directors is considered the head of the establishment, with the Inspector General transmitting reports to the General Manager. Annual reports are also submitted to local governments and congress summarizing the Office's activities. The Inspector General of the Transit Authority has the authority to investigate complaints from employees or members regarding potential violations of law, mismanagement, waste of funds, abuse of authority, or threats to public health and safety. The Inspector General is required to keep the identity of the complainant confidential.

Staff appointments are made independently to ensure independence. The Inspector General appoints staff independently, ensuring that only those appointed by the Inspector General or procured services can carry out duties. Transit system personnel rules do not apply to the appointment and compensation of Office personnel. The General Manager of the Transit Authority provides the Office with necessary office space, equipment, supplies, and maintenance services. Any duties carried out by the Transit Authority prior to the appointment of the Inspector General will be transferred to the Office. If the Inspector General under this section fails to carry out assigned duties, functions will be transferred to the Office upon the appointment of the first Inspector General under this section. The Comptroller General will conduct a study on the use of funds provided under the National Capital Transportation Act of 1969. A report will be submitted to the House Committee on Government Reform and the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs within 3 years of the enactment of this Act."
