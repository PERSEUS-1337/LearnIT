    "content": "The State of California enacts the following. Section 2263 of the Elections Code is amended to require the Department of Motor Vehicles to electronically provide specified records to the Secretary of State for individuals applying for a driver's license or identification card. The information includes name and date of birth for citizens of the United States. The Department of Motor Vehicles is required to provide the Secretary of State with personal information of individuals applying for a driver's license or identification card, including name, date of birth, address, signature, contact information, language preference, political party preference, voter registration choices, eligibility confirmation, and other specified details. The Department of Motor Vehicles provides personal information to the Secretary of State for voter outreach and education purposes. The Secretary of State must provide materials in languages other than English as required by the Voting Rights Act. Information acquired from the DMV cannot be sold, transferred, or accessed by third parties without approval. The Department of Motor Vehicles will not provide records of individuals who apply for a driver's license without proof of authorized presence in the US. Implementation of this policy will begin after certification by the Secretary of State, ensuring compliance with voter registration database requirements and funding for the California New Motor Voter Program. The Department of Motor Vehicles will not electronically provide records containing confidential home addresses. Section 2265 of the Elections Code is amended to register individuals to vote if they agreed to during a transaction with the DMV and meet voter eligibility requirements. The Secretary of State has not deemed the person ineligible to vote. If a registered voter does not provide a party preference, it will be listed as \"Unknown\" and treated as a \"No Party Preference\" voter. Those with an \"Unknown\" party preference will not be included in the total number of registered voters for election purposes."
