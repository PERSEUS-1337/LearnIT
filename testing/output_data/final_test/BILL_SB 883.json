    "title": "SB 883",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 166 of the Penal Code in California is amended to include various contempts of court as misdemeanors, such as disorderly behavior during court proceedings or disturbances that interrupt the court's proceedings. The amended Section 166 of the Penal Code in California includes various contempts of court as misdemeanors, such as willful disobedience of court orders, resistance to lawful orders, refusal to be sworn as a witness, false reporting of court proceedings, and presenting false information to the court. A person guilty of contempt of court by contacting a victim in violation of Section 646.9 may face up to one year in jail, a $5,000 fine, or both. Each contact is considered a separate violation, and current incarceration is not a defense. Willful and knowing violation of protective orders or stay-away court orders specified in various sections can result in contempt of court, a misdemeanor punishable by up to one year in jail and/or a fine of up to $1,000. Violating certain court orders can lead to imprisonment in a county jail for at least 48 hours if physical injury occurs. These orders include those related to family law and behavior injunctions. A second conviction for violating specified court orders within seven years of a prior conviction involving violence can result in imprisonment in a county jail or state prison. Prosecuting agencies are responsible for enforcing these orders. Possessing a firearm while prohibited by a protective order is punishable under Section 29825. A person under a protective order is exempt from prosecution for firearm ownership if granted an exemption. Probation for violating the order may include payments to a shelter or restitution for counseling costs. The court must assess the defendant's ability to pay fines, make payments to a battered women's shelter, or provide restitution as part of probation. Community property cannot be used to pay for restitution to an injured spouse until the offending spouse's separate property is exhausted. A person violating an order may be punished for offenses under Section 136.1 or 646.9. Contempt finding does not prevent prosecution for violations. Contempt punishment can be credited towards any sentence for offenses under Section 136.1 or 646.9. Conviction or acquittal for substantive offenses bars subsequent punishment for contempt from the same act. No reimbursement required by this act under California Constitution. Costs incurred by local agency or school district due to new crime, infraction, penalty changes, or crime definition changes."
