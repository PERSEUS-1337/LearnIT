    "content": "The African Union (AU) was established in 1994, replacing the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and the African Economic Community (AEC) Treaty of 1991. The AEC Treaty aimed for economic integration by 2028 but faced challenges due to its lengthy implementation schedule. The reform movement leading to the creation of the AU was driven by calls for restructuring and increasing support for good governance among OAU member states in the late 1990s. The African Union (AU) upholds non-interference in member states' affairs, focuses on economic liberalization, and supports regional economic integration. H.Res. 155 commends the AU's creation and goals. The Sirte Summit in 1999 aimed to improve the OAU charter and extend Libya's influence in Africa. Muammar al-Qadhafi pushed for a United States of Africa at the summit. At the Sirte Summit in 1999, Muammar al-Qadhafi advocated for the creation of a United States of Africa to enhance economic development and integration, promote unity among African nations, and establish common defense institutions. Participants issued the Sirte Declaration, calling for the revitalization of the OAU and the formation of an African Union in line with the OAU Charter and AEC Treaty. The Sirte Declaration at the 1999 Sirte Summit called for the formation of an African Union in line with the OAU Charter and AEC Treaty. The African Union Draft Constitutive Act was adopted in Lom\u00e9, Togo in July 2000, with requests for vetting by OAU member parliamentarians. The African Union was mandated to come into being upon the 36th ratification of the AU Constitutive Act by an OAU member state, which was achieved in April 2001 when Nigeria ratified it. The creation and functioning of key AU organs like the Assembly, Executive Council, Commission, and Permanent Representatives Committee were prioritized, along with defining their areas of competence and relationships with other organizations. The African Union was officially inaugurated in July 2002 in Durban, South Africa, following the final meetings of the OAU. The Summit determined that regional economic communities would be key building blocks of the AU and authorized the OAU Secretary General to find alternative funding modalities for AU activities. Additionally, OAU assets, liabilities, and agreements with other parties were mandated to devolve to the AU as per the AU Constitutive Act. The African Union's institutional structure includes an Assembly, Executive Council, Commission of the Union, Pan-African Parliament, Permanent Representatives Committee, Court of Justice, Peace and Security Council, Specialized Technical Committees, Economic, Social and Cultural Council, and Central Financial Institutions. The African Union's institutional structure includes various organs such as the Assembly, Executive Council, and Commission of the Union. Additionally, key AU policies like NEPAD and the African Peer Review Mechanism are endorsed by African leaders and multilateral organizations. The operational relationships among these organs and their subsidiary bodies are yet to be determined. The African Union inaugural summit in July 2002 saw leaders from across Africa coming together in a display of continental unity. The formation of the African Union was the subject of significant debate among African leaders, with some advocating for NEPAD and further integration into the global economy, while others championed African political autonomy. Critics warned that NEPAD could subject Africa to externally-imposed political conditions in exchange for assistance. Libyan and South African Leadership Roles: Disagreements between President Thabo Mbeki and Libyan leader Muammar al-Qadhafi over the purpose and role of the AU. Al-Qadhafi promoted pan-Africanist goals for continental unity and sovereignty, rejecting policy conditionalities for credit access. Despite his early contributions, the AU ultimately supported NEPAD, leading to a leadership struggle between them. Al-Qadhafi's opposition to NEPAD and desire to delay the AU launch in South Africa in favor of Libya caused a leadership struggle with President Mbeki. Libya's financial assistance to some countries aimed to increase its influence within the OAU during the transition to the AU. Efforts to transfer the AU headquarters to Libya were championed by Zambia's president, highlighting a perceived rivalry between Libya and South Africa. Both governments denied any existing rivalry and sought to bridge their differences. President Thabo Mbeki and Muammar al-Qadhafi dismissed claims of a rivalry between them, with efforts to bridge their differences favoring the South African agenda. Mbeki was named the first AU chairperson, and the first AU summit was held in Durban, South Africa. Libya accepted NEPAD and is represented on the NEPAD Implementation Committee. Concerns were raised about al-Qadhafi's presence in NEPAD potentially jeopardizing G-8 endorsement. Africa is heavily affected by the HIV/AIDS epidemic, impacting life expectancy, economic production, and human resources. Critics argue that NEPAD lacks substance in addressing these issues. NEPAD faces criticism for not effectively addressing the devastation caused by AIDS in African countries. Ongoing conflicts in countries like Somalia, Liberia, and Sudan challenge the AU's goal of achieving peace. The AU has deployed a peacekeeping force to Burundi to monitor a cease-fire and political succession. The African Union faces challenges in consolidating democratic institutions and ensuring good governance in African countries. Recent constitutional amendments in some countries have allowed leaders to extend their terms, raising concerns about the rule of law. The legitimacy of local legislative elections in certain countries has been questioned. Key challenges for the AU include addressing these governance issues. In Madagascar, disputed presidential elections in late 2001 led to a stand-off between two candidates. The challenger, Marc Ravalomanana, declared himself the winner citing electoral irregularities. The AU has not recognized the new government and has called for new elections. Some countries, including Senegal and Burkina Faso, have recognized the new government. The AU recognized the new government in Madagascar, as did Burkina Faso, Mauritius, Libya, and the Comoros. There are indications that the AU may soon recognize the current Malagasy government. In contrast, the AU tacitly accepted the disputed re-election of Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe in 2002, despite objections from the United States, the European Union, and other countries. The Zimbabwean opposition called for sanctions against the government for human rights abuses. The AU faces challenges in financing its agenda due to structural poverty in Africa. Critics argue that the organization may become irrelevant without broader input from African societies. President Mbeki has acknowledged concerns and sponsored forums for civil society groups. The average per capita income in sub-Saharan Africa was $470 in 2002, much lower in non-oil-producing countries. Wealth distribution is highly unequal, with even the wealthiest countries having a majority of poor people. NEPAD aims to improve Africa's economic standing, but short-term funding shortages may hinder the AU's objectives."
