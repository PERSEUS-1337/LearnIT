    "content": "The Act titled \"Charitable Volunteers Tax Credit Incentive Act of 1995\" provides a credit for charitable contributions to certain private charities assisting the poor under section 23 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The \"Charitable Volunteers Tax Credit Incentive Act of 1995\" allows eligible taxpayers to receive a tax credit for qualified charitable contributions made to a qualified charity, up to $500. Eligible taxpayers are individuals who have worked at least 50 hours at the qualified charity during the taxable year. Qualified charitable contributions must be made in cash and identified on the tax return. For tax purposes, a \"qualified charity\" is an organization certified by the Secretary as meeting specific requirements and primarily assisting individuals with low incomes. The organization must ensure that at least 70 percent of its annual expenditures are used for exempt purposes, defined as activities to assist individuals with low incomes. The term \"activity\" in paragraph (2) does not include administrative expenses, expenses for influencing legislation, fundraising expenses, or legal services for individuals in paragraph (2). Donors cannot have a financial interest in the charity to receive a credit. No credit allowed for contributions made to an organization if the donor or their family member is an officer or employee of the organization. Additionally, no credit allowed if the donor, their family member, or a 35-percent controlled entity engages in self-dealing activities with the organization. \"A 35-percent controlled entity refers to a corporation, partnership, trust, or estate where certain individuals own more than 35 percent of the voting power, profits interest, or beneficial interest. Constructive ownership rules similar to section 4946(a) apply.\" For the purposes of this subsection, the members of an individual's family shall be determined under section 4946(d). The credit provided by subsection (a) for any qualified charitable deduction shall be in lieu of any deduction otherwise allowable under this chapter for such contribution. A taxpayer may elect for any taxable year to have this section not apply. Every qualified charity must provide a copy of its annual return to individuals upon request without charge, except for reproduction and mailing costs. Copies must be provided immediately if requested in person, or within 30 days for other requests. The 3-year period beginning on the filing date is the only time frame during which subparagraph (A) applies. The amendments made by this section regarding the credit for charitable contributions apply to contributions and work performed after the 90th day following the enactment of the Act, in taxable years ending after that date."
