    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 303.4 of the Elections Code defines a \"ballot on demand system\" as a self-contained system that allows users to manufacture and finish card stock, as well as finish unfinished ballot cards into ballot cards. Additionally, Section 2170 is amended to include the definition of \"conditional voter registration\" as an affidavit of registration delivered to the county elections official within 14 days preceding an election or on election day, which may be deemed effective after processing and validation of the registrant's information. A qualified elector can complete a conditional voter registration and cast a provisional ballot within 14 days before an election or on election day. The registration is effective if the county elections official confirms the registrant's eligibility and information matches DMV or SSA databases. If the information on the registration affidavit cannot be verified, the registrant will be issued a unique identification number and the conditional voter registration will be effective. The county elections official must offer conditional voter registration and provisional voting at all permanent offices. The elections official advises registrants that conditional voter registration will only be effective if eligibility is confirmed and information is verified. They handle each registration and provisional ballot to protect ballot secrecy and validate information before counting or rejecting the ballot. After receiving a conditional voter registration, the official processes it, determines eligibility, and validates information. Conditional registration is effective if confirmed, with provisional ballots included in the official canvass. County elections officials can offer conditional registration and provisional voting at satellite offices. A new section in the Elections Code defines an electronic poll book with voter registration data. The Secretary of State certifies electronic poll books for use in elections, setting standards and regulations. The books must meet requirements to be certified. The Secretary of State regulates ballot manufacturing, finishing, quality standards, distribution, and inventory control. Biennial inspections are required for certified facilities. Approval is needed for ballot manufacturers, finishers, and ballot on demand systems used in California elections. The Secretary of State regulates ballot manufacturing, finishing, quality standards, distribution, and inventory control in California elections. Ballot card manufacturers, finishers, or ballot on demand system vendors must disclose any known flaws or defects that could affect voting. Approval from the Secretary of State is required, and prompt notification of any issues is necessary. Section 13004.5 of the Elections Code states that a jurisdiction must not acquire a ballot on demand system unless it is certified by the Secretary of State. Vendors are also prohibited from selling or leasing such systems without certification. Research and development of ballot on demand systems by jurisdictions is allowed under this section."
