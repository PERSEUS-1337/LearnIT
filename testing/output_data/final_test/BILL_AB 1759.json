    "title": "AB 1759",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature finds that modified hydrofluoric acid is used by two refineries in California to manufacture high octane fuel, which is considered one of the most hazardous chemicals in petroleum refining. An explosion at the Exxon Mobil Torrance refinery in February 2015 nearly missed the storage of hydrofluoric acid, leading to concerns about safety. Over 80 incidents involving hydrofluoric acid have been reported at the Torrance refinery since 1979. Residents in southern California have been trying to ban the use of hydrofluoric acid at refineries for over 25 years, with previous attempts leading to litigation. Survivors of severe hydrogen fluoride exposure may suffer chronic lung disease or permanent visual defects. Residents in California live near refineries storing modified hydrofluoric acid, posing a threat to property and safety. The California Constitution emphasizes the rights to life, liberty, and safety. Legislation is proposed to address the dangers of hydrogen fluoride exposure. Hydrogen fluoride is a highly toxic and corrosive acid used in gasoline and refrigerant production. It can create a deadly gas cloud when released, causing respiratory issues and potentially death. It poses greater risks than sulfuric acid in manufacturing unleaded gasoline. An uncontrolled release of hydrogen fluoride poses a significant threat to human life and health, with a potential impact area six times larger than sulfuric acid. Even a 90 percent controlled spill of hydrogen fluoride could endanger lives beyond the spill site, unlike sulfuric acid. Tests have shown that a worst-case spill of hydrogen fluoride could create a lethal cloud extending five miles downwind. Accidental releases of hydrogen fluoride could occur due to various factors such as earthquakes, equipment defects, human error, sabotage, and aircraft disasters. The storage, transport, and use of hydrogen fluoride pose serious public health risks. Businesses handling more than 250 gallons of hydrogen fluoride should convert to safer alternatives by January 1, 2017. If conversion is not possible and the business is near residential areas, they must stop handling hydrogen fluoride by the same date. This regulation aims to reduce the danger of accidental releases of hydrogen fluoride. An owner or operator of an oil refinery using hydrogen fluoride must send biannual notices to nearby facilities and residences within a three-and-a-half-mile radius. Recipients within a two-mile radius may be warned of living in a \"lethal zone\" with ERPG-3 level toxins. Recipients outside a two-mile radius but within a three-and-a-half-mile radius from the refinery may be warned of living in a long-term illness zone with ERPG-2 level toxins. The notice recipients within a three-and-a-half-mile radius shall be provided with the Internet Web site address of the United States Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s Vulnerable Zone Indicator System. Costs for the notice shall be covered by the refinery owner or operator. The owner or operator must file a copy of the notice and distribution list with the state board. The act does not require reimbursement under the California Constitution. It creates new crimes or infractions related to hydrogen fluoride exposure and is deemed urgent for public safety."
