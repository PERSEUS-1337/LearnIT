    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Truth in Hotel Advertising Act of 2016\". It includes findings related to hotel advertising. Congress finds that hotel rooms are often advertised at one rate, but mandatory fees are later disclosed, such as resort or facility fees, which are charged in addition to the advertised rate. The number of hotels charging these fees is increasing, and deceptive advertising of hotel costs is a concern. The Federal Trade Commission has authority to address this issue. The Federal Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C. 45) prohibits unfair or deceptive acts in commerce. In 2012, the FTC warned 22 hotel operators about mandatory resort fees that could mislead consumers, violating the Act. SEC. 3. PROHIBITION ON UNFAIR AND DECEPTIVE ADVERTISING OF HOTEL ROOM RATES. Prohibition on advertising hotel room rates in interstate commerce without all required fees, enforced by the Federal Trade Commission as a violation of unfair or deceptive practices. The Commission may enforce the prohibition on advertising hotel room rates in interstate commerce by incorporating the terms of the Federal Trade Commission Act, imposing penalties for violations, and promulgating rules for enforcement. Enforcement by States allows the attorney general to bring civil action on behalf of residents if a person violates the subsection, with rights of notice to the federal trade commission. The attorney general of a State must notify the Commission before initiating a civil action, providing a copy of the complaint to be filed. The attorney general must notify the Commission before starting a civil action, allowing the Commission to intervene and be heard in the case. The attorney general of a State has investigatory powers to conduct investigations and compel witnesses in civil actions. If the Federal Trade Commission takes preemptive action in a case, the State attorney general cannot bring a civil action against the same defendant during the FTC's action. The attorney general of a State has investigatory powers in civil actions. The Federal Trade Commission can take preemptive action, preventing the State attorney general from bringing a civil action against the same defendant. The venue and service of process for such actions are specified. In addition to civil actions by attorneys general, other authorized State officers can also bring civil actions under the same requirements. Authorized State officials are not prohibited from pursuing proceedings for violations of State laws. Subsection (a) will take effect 30 days after the enactment of the Act."
