    "content": "Section 1 introduces a new section, 2032B, in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 regarding the valuation of certain historic property for estate tax purposes. Section 2032B of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 allows for the valuation of qualified historic property based on net earnings for estate tax purposes, provided the decedent was a US citizen or resident and the executor meets certain requirements. Qualified historic property is defined as any building designated as a National Historic Landmark. The National Historic Preservation Act requires that the property must have been used for residential or farming purposes for at least 25 years before the decedent's death. It also includes real property necessary for access, public enjoyment, and personal property associated with the qualified historic property. The tax treatment of historic property held by a corporation is determined based on the ownership of the stock by the decedent or family members on the date of the decedent's death. The tax treatment of historic property held by a corporation is based on the ownership of stock by the decedent or family members. Stock in the corporation is considered qualified historic property if its value is linked to qualified historic property held by the corporation. Net earnings refer to income from qualified historic property multiplied by 7. \"In determining the period for which the decedent has held any property or stock, include the period held by family members. An agreement for the building must be in writing and signed by all interested parties, with activities related to the building's purpose.\" The agreement for the building must be in writing, signed by all interested parties, and related to public visitation and maintenance for at least 25 years. For public access, a property must be open for visitation for at least 8 hours per day and 6 days per week during 40 weeks of the year. The executor must notify the State historic agency, and access should be achievable without undue difficulty or cost. To encourage public visitation of a property, signatories must be available to facilitate visits through various methods like telephone, website, or ticket booth. Efforts must be made to promote awareness of the property's availability for visitation. The 25-year period for public access can be suspended during renovation periods. Communication under subparagraph (A)(v) should include periodic contact with State and local historic agencies and tourism boards. If there is a disposal of interest in the building or a violation of the agreement, an additional estate tax will be imposed. An additional estate tax is imposed if there is a disposal of interest in a building or a violation of the agreement. An exception exists for certain transferees who agree to be bound by the agreement and are liable for any tax in the same manner as the person disposing of the interest. The additional tax imposed by paragraph (1) for property is due 9 months after the disposition or violation. Any person signing the agreement is personally liable for the tax. The text discusses joint and several liability for certain persons under specific rules. It also mentions coordination with gift tax and technical amendments to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The table of sections for part III of subchapter A of chapter 11 of the Internal Revenue Code is amended to include a new item after section 2032A. The amendments in section 2032B regarding the valuation of certain historic property will apply to estates of decedents after the enactment of the Act. For the purposes of the Economic Growth and Tax Reconciliation Act of 2001, these amendments will be treated as being enacted before the date of such Act."
