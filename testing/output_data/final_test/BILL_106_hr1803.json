Congress finds that the unified budget surplus in fiscal year 1998 was due to social security trust funds, and future surpluses are also projected from these funds. It is recommended to balance the budget excluding social security surpluses, which will reduce public debt by $1.7 trillion by 2009. Social security surpluses should be used to enhance retirement security or reduce public debt.

Amendments are made to the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 to enforce these protections.
