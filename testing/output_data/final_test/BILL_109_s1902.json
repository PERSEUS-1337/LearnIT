    "content": "The \"Children and Media Research Advancement Act\" or the \"CAMRA Act\" aims to enable the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to research the impact of electronic media on children's development and provide Congress with empirical evidence from the funded research. The Public Health Service Act is amended to include research on the role and impact of electronic media in the development of children and adolescents. The Secretary will contract with an entity to review research on the impact of electronic media on youth in cognitive and physical development areas. The Secretary will award grants for research on the impact of electronic media on youth's cognitive, physical, and socio-behavioral development, in coordination with the National Institutes of Health. The research on the impact of electronic media on youth must focus on factors like media content, format, exposure length, age of youth, venue, and parental involvement. It should not duplicate other Federal research activities. Eligible entities must submit a proposal to the Director to receive a grant. Entities seeking a grant must submit an application to the Director and agree to use the funds for specified activities. Reports must be submitted to the Director and Congress within specific timeframes. The grant program requires entities to submit applications for funding and use the funds for specified activities. A report synthesizing research results and identifying gaps is required to be submitted to the Director and Congress. Authorization of appropriations is provided for fiscal years 2007 through 2012. The Senate passed the bill on September 13, 2006."
