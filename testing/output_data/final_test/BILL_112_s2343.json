It also amends the Employment Tax Treatment of Professional Service Businesses. The \"Stop the Student Loan Interest Rate Hike Act of 2012\" extends the interest rate deadline to July 1, 2013. It also amends the Employment Tax Treatment of Professional Service Businesses by adding special rules for shareholders providing services to specified S corporations. The Employment Tax Treatment of Professional Service Businesses includes rules for shareholders providing services to specified S corporations, where their net earnings from self-employment will include their pro rata share of income or loss. Family members' share of income will also be included unless they provide substantial services. The subsection defines a \"specified S corporation\" as an S corporation engaged in a professional service business where most activities are related to a partnership or where 75% of gross income comes from services. The paragraph discusses the definition of an \"applicable shareholder\" in a specified S corporation based on income thresholds. In partnerships engaged in professional service businesses, subsection (a)(13) does not apply to partners providing substantial services. An \"applicable partner\" is defined as a partner with modified adjusted gross income exceeding $200,000 or $250,000 for joint filers or surviving spouses. In the case of a married partner filing separately, half of the determined dollar amount is applicable, while in other cases, the threshold is $200,000. A professional service business refers to trades providing services in specific fields. Modified adjusted gross income is defined as adjusted gross income for this purpose. The text discusses the definition of adjusted gross income for tax purposes, excluding certain deductions and increasing it by specific amounts. The Secretary is authorized to create regulations to prevent abuse of this provision. Additionally, a conforming amendment is made to the Social Security Act regarding special rules for professional service businesses. Special rules apply to professional service businesses in specified S corporations, where shareholders providing substantial services are treated as engaged in the business for income or loss purposes. Their net earnings from self-employment will include such income. The net earnings from self-employment for shareholders in specified S corporations providing substantial services will include their pro rata share of income or loss. Family members' share of income will also be included unless they do not provide substantial services for the professional service business. For specified S corporations in professional service businesses, the definition includes S corporations that are partners in a partnership engaged in such business and S corporations with 75% or more of gross income from professional services. The specified S corporations in professional service businesses must ensure that their gross income is attributable to services provided by 3 or fewer shareholders. An \"applicable shareholder\" is defined as a shareholder whose income exceeds certain thresholds based on filing status. For partnerships engaged in professional service businesses, subsection (a)(12) does not apply to partners providing substantial services. An \"applicable partner\" is one whose modified adjusted gross income exceeds certain thresholds based on filing status. In the context of partnerships engaged in professional service businesses, the income thresholds for \"applicable partners\" are as follows: $250,000 for joint filers, half of that for married partners filing separately, and $200,000 for all other cases. Professional service businesses include fields such as health, law, engineering, accounting, and consulting. The amendments made by this section apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2012, defining \"modified adjusted gross income\" for tax purposes. SEC. 4. COMPLIANCE PROVISION. The budgetary effects of this Act shall be determined by reference to the latest statement for compliance with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go-Act of 2010."
