    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Repeal of Obamacare Act\". Congress finds that despite promises made by President Obama regarding the ability to keep existing health coverage, the impact of Public Law 111-148 and related provisions of Public Law 111-152 has put millions of Americans at risk of losing their healthcare coverage. The law, despite significant spending and tax increases, does not lower healthcare costs and actually makes coverage more expensive for many. The Affordable Care Act has made health coverage more expensive for millions of Americans, with premiums increasing significantly. The law also cuts over half a trillion dollars from Medicare to fund a new entitlement program, leading to concerns about providers leaving the program. The Affordable Care Act has raised concerns about providers potentially ending their participation in the program, jeopardizing access to care for beneficiaries. The law cuts $206 billion in payments to Medicare Advantage plans, leading to 7.4 million beneficiaries losing access to their plans. Additionally, the law is predicted to result in a decline in employer-sponsored retiree drug coverage, with 90 percent of seniors losing access by 2016. The creation of an unelected Independent Payment Advisory Board is also a key feature of the law. The Affordable Care Act includes a Payment Advisory Board with the power to make decisions on Medicare coverage and payments to cut spending, potentially limiting access to healthcare for seniors. The law imposes new taxes on families and businesses, leading to economic uncertainty and hindering job opportunities. President Obama's promise on abortion funding is questioned as the law expands its role. The Affordable Care Act expands the Federal Government's role in funding and facilitating abortion, appropriating billions of dollars without explicitly prohibiting the use for abortion. It also provides subsidies for health plans covering elective abortions, forcing individuals to pay a separate abortion premium against their religious or moral beliefs. This law infringes on the rights of conscience of insurers, purchasers of insurance, and other stakeholders. The Affordable Care Act imposes nationwide requirements for health plans to cover essential health benefits and preventive services, without allowing opt-outs based on religious or moral objections. This infringes on the rights of conscience and limits participation in the health insurance marketplace. Additionally, the law expands Government control over healthcare and increases financial liabilities. The Affordable Care Act increases financial liabilities and government control over healthcare, putting bureaucrats in charge of decision-making instead of doctors and patients. Repealing the law is necessary for patient-centered care and lower costs for all Americans. Repeal of Obamacare, including provisions from the PPACA and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, restoring laws as if the Acts had not been enacted. The budgetary effects of this Act will be determined by the latest statement submitted by the Chairman of the Committee on the Budget of the House of Representatives. Passed by the House of Representatives on July 11, 2012."
