    "content": "The \"School Violence Prevention Act of 2005\" may be cited as the short title for this Act. It includes findings and a statement of policy. Congress found in 1997 that a study on school violence and prevention revealed various aspects of delinquency prevention efforts in schools, including types of prevention efforts, funding sources, and how schools utilize prevention options to enhance their efforts and management. An expert report in 2002 further analyzed the findings from the study. The 2002 study on school violence and prevention found that schools can enhance violence prevention by focusing on needs assessment, planning, research-based approaches, and monitoring implementation. It also highlighted that middle school students and teachers are more vulnerable to victimization compared to high school counterparts. Additionally, a significant number of students and teachers reported feeling unsafe in certain areas of the school due to fear of being harmed or bothered. The Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act is a common funding source for prevention activities in schools to address school safety concerns. The program aims to prevent school violence and youth drug use, creating safe environments for academic achievement. The Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act requires State and local prevention programs to meet the \"Principles of Effectiveness\" criteria to improve the quality of drug and violence prevention programming. Congress believes that the Department of Education should review and revise guidelines based on recent studies indicating the need for improvement in school violence and prevention programs. The Department of Education is tasked with reviewing and revising guidelines for the \"Principles of Effectiveness\" criteria under the Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act to enhance safe school programs. The Department of Education is reviewing and revising guidelines for the \"Principles of Effectiveness\" criteria under the Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act. The Secretary of Education is reviewing and revising guidelines for the \"Principles of Effectiveness\" criteria to align with findings from a report on school violence prevention, particularly focusing on addressing discipline problems in middle schools. The curr_chunk discusses the importance of strengthening needs assessments in schools to identify problem areas for better targeting violence prevention efforts. It also emphasizes the adoption of a continuous improvement process to track implementation quality and modify activities based on results. Additionally, schools are advised to improve the quality of violence prevention activities by adopting evidence-based programs. The curr_chunk emphasizes the need for monitoring violence prevention activities to ensure consistency with program models and collecting information on activity results to determine effectiveness. Schools and districts are encouraged to focus on quality training for staff implementing these activities. The Secretary of Education is required to submit an initial report to Congress by March 1, 2007, containing guidelines on program effectiveness criteria. A final report must be submitted by January 1, 2010, detailing the implementation of these guidelines and any resulting changes in program efficacy or reduction in school violence."
