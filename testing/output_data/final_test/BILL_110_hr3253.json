The \"Measuring and Evaluating Trends for Reliability, Integrity, and Continued Success Act\" requires states receiving funds to develop a longitudinal data system for public charter schools within 4 years. States must form an advisory committee with members experienced in data system development within 6 months of enactment. The \"Measuring and Evaluating Trends for Reliability, Integrity, and Continued Success Act\" mandates states to establish a committee with diverse backgrounds for developing a longitudinal data system for public charter schools. The data system must include a unique statewide student identifier and student-level enrollment information. The \"Measuring and Evaluating Trends for Reliability, Integrity, and Continued Success Act\" requires states to create a longitudinal data system for public charter schools. This system includes student-level enrollment, demographic, program participation information, academic assessment score matching, reasons for non-participation, and data on student entrance and exit from the education system. The \"Measuring and Evaluating Trends for Reliability, Integrity, and Continued Success Act\" mandates a statewide audit system for data quality, a unique teacher identifier, student transcript details, and the ability to link education data from preschool to higher education and workforce systems. The data system required by the \"Measuring and Evaluating Trends for Reliability, Integrity, and Continued Success Act\" may include student-level data on participation and performance in college admissions and placement assessments. It must ensure privacy of student records, effective data architecture and storage, and the ability to link student records over time and databases for standardized or customized reports. The data system required by the Act must be based on informational needs at various levels, include all required data elements, allow for longitudinal analysis, support program evaluations, ensure interoperability among software interfaces, with other state and local systems, and with migratory systems. The Act requires interoperability with migratory student records system, electronic data portability, professional development, researcher access to data, and protection of employee rights.
