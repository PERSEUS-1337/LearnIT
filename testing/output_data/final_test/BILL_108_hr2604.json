    "content": "Section 1 introduces nonrecognition of gain on qualified sales of telecommunications businesses under a new part in the Internal Revenue Code. This provision allows for the exclusion of gain on certain sales of telecommunications businesses. For qualified telecommunications sales, taxpayers can elect to treat them as involuntary property conversions under section 1033. The deferred gain on such sales cannot exceed $75,000,000. A qualified telecommunications sale refers to selling assets or stock to a qualified business where the business controls the corporation and owns most of its assets. The term 'qualified business' in telecommunications sales refers to a person owning a limited number of broadcast stations, certified by the FCC for expanding ownership of telecommunications businesses. In telecommunications sales, a qualified business is defined as a person owning a limited number of broadcast stations, with specific criteria for ownership thresholds based on net assets and income levels. In telecommunications sales, a qualified business is defined as a person owning a limited number of broadcast stations, with specific criteria for ownership thresholds based on net assets and income levels. An interest in a broadcast station is considered qualified if it represents 50 percent or more of the station's total assets. Additionally, a person cannot be a qualified business if they have been the purchaser in more than 2 prior telecommunications sales where the seller made an election under this section. Special rules apply for determining qualified business status, with net assets defined as the excess of the entity's gross assets over its indebtedness. The term 'after-tax income' in tax law refers to taxable income reduced by the net income tax for the year. Aggregation rules treat all persons as a single entity if they are considered a single employer under specific sections. The term 'telecommunications business' refers to any business providing communication services governed by specific acts. Stock of a corporation operating in this field is treated as related property in a qualified telecommunications sale. Taxpayers can elect to reduce basis rather than recognize the remainder of gain. If a taxpayer has a qualified telecommunications sale and would recognize gain, they can elect to reduce the basis of depreciable property held after the sale. Regulations will determine the reduction amount. Property acquired in an involuntary conversion sale follows specific basis rules. Additionally, if a telecommunications business is resold within 3 years, there may be recapture of tax benefits. If a telecommunications business is resold within 3 years of a qualified sale, there may be a recapture of tax benefits. The purchaser's tax for the year of the recapture event will be increased by 20% of the consideration or the dollar limitation. There are exceptions for reinvested amounts within a 60-day period after the sale. The taxpayer must be the purchaser in another qualified telecommunications sale with consideration not less than the amount realized on the recapture event sale. A recapture event includes the sale or disposition of assets acquired in the initial sale, and in the case of a specific type of sale, the sale of a telecommunications business by the corporation involved. The term \"recapture event\" refers to a transaction where the qualified business loses control of a corporation, excluding sales due to default on taxpayer's debt. A clerical amendment is made to the tax code. The amendments in Part V apply to sales of telecommunications businesses in taxable years after the enactment of the Act. Additionally, a loan guarantee program is established to promote diversity of ownership in telecommunications businesses. The Administrator of the Small Business Administration may guarantee loans for qualified businesses purchasing assets or stock related to expanding ownership of telecommunications businesses, certified by the FCC. The guaranteed portion must be secured by a first lien position, and the guarantee percentage cannot exceed 95% of the outstanding balance. The Administrator may collect a guarantee fee for loans under subsection (a) and require forfeiture of FCC licenses in case of default. The Administrator has general authority for implementing this section. The Administrator has the authority to enter contracts, issue regulations, and work with other agencies for implementing this section. Definitions include the Administrator of the Small Business Administration and a qualified business as defined in the Internal Revenue Code. Authorization of appropriations is granted under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to carry out the purposes of this section."
