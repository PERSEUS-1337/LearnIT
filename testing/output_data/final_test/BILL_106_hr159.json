The \"American Dream Tax Fairness Equity Act of 1997\" reduces the maximum capital gains rate for individuals to 15 percent for assets held for more than 3 years. The tax imposed by section 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 shall not exceed a tax computed at rates as if this subsection had not been enacted, plus 15 percent of qualified 3-year capital gain. The \"American Dream Tax Fairness Equity Act of 1997\" reduces the maximum capital gains rate for individuals to 15 percent for assets held for more than 3 years. Qualified 3-year capital gain is defined as the lesser of net long-term capital gain for the taxable year held for more than 3 years or net capital gain for the year. Net capital gain for any taxable year is reduced by the provisions of this subsection. The amendment allows taxpayers to reduce their taxable income by electing to include investment income under section 163(d)(4)(B)(iii) for the taxable year. This amendment applies to taxable years starting after December 31, 1997. SEC. 2. REPLACEMENT OF ESTATE AND GIFT TAX RATE SCHEDULES. The estate tax rate schedule is replaced by 15 and 28 percent tax rates. The computation of tax includes 15 percent of qualified 3-year capital gain and 28 percent of all other capital gain in the taxable estate. The rate schedule is repealed. The tax rates for estate and gift taxes are amended, with a reduction in the gift tax rate. The computation of tax now includes 15 percent of qualified 3-year capital gain and 28 percent of all other capital gain in taxable gifts. Unified credit against estate tax is also addressed. Unified credit against estate tax is amended to allow a credit to the estate of every decedent against the tax imposed by section 2001. The credit amount is determined based on the tax imposed on imputed capital gains amount not exceeding $600,000, and the tax imposed on the excess amount. The imputed capital gains amount, subject to the rates of section 2001(b), is defined as the total amount. The $600,000 limit in subparagraphs (A) and (B)(i) of paragraph (2) is reduced by the cumulative gift tax credit amount. The term `cumulative gift tax credit amount' refers to the sum of capital gains gift amounts with respect to which a credit was allowed under section 2505. Section 2505 is amended to allow a credit against the tax imposed by section 2501 for each calendar year. The amount determined under this paragraph is the sum of the tax imposed on the capital gains gift amount and the tax imposed on the excess of the capital gains gift amount for the year. The term 'capital gains gift amount' refers to the amount subject to section 2502(b) rates for a year, limited to $600,000 minus the total of previous years' amounts. Gifts made before the gift tax change date are credited accordingly. The credit amount for gifts made before the gift tax change date is based on the rules in effect at the time of the gift, without considering certain provisions. The term 'gift made before gift tax change date' refers to gifts made before the enactment of this paragraph, excluding gifts accounted for under subsection (b). A conforming amendment states that the term 'preceding calendar period' includes the portion of the calendar year preceding the date of enactment for gifts made after such date. Additionally, there is a rate change for estates of nonresident aliens under subsection (b) of section 2101 of the Code. The tax imposed on estates of nonresident aliens is amended to be computed under section 2001(b) as if section 2001 applied to the decedent. Section 2101 of the Code is amended by striking subsection (c), and section 2102 is amended to adjust dollar amounts to reflect changes in sections 2010 and 2505. Effective Date: The amendments made by this section apply to estates of decedents dying on or after the date of the enactment of this Act. SEC. 646 imposes a tax on trusts when the grantor dies, marking assets to market value. On the death of an individual who has contributed property to a trust, the trust must recognize gain or loss as if the property was sold at fair market value. This gain or loss is accounted for in the trust's taxable year of the individual's death, with adjustments made for subsequent gains or losses. The Secretary may determine how property contributed by a partnership or corporation is treated. The section discusses the treatment of property contributed to a trust by an individual with a majority interest in a partnership or corporation. It states that if property is contributed partially by the decedent and partially by another person, the decedent's portion is treated as a separate asset. This section does not apply to the portion of any trust included in the taxable estate of an individual. Assets marked to market when grantor dies. Effective Date: The amendments apply to decedents dying on or after the enactment date. Trusts with property from decedents before enactment date are treated as dying on enactment date for tax purposes."
