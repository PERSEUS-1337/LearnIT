    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Heroin and Prescription Opioid Abuse Prevention, Education, and Enforcement Act of 2015.\" Congress finds that the Controlled Substances Act recognizes the medical benefits of many controlled substances, including opioids for pain management. Addressing pain as a national health issue is crucial, and the responsible treatment of pain must be balanced with efforts to prevent drug misuse. Unused prescription opioids are at risk of diversion, highlighting the importance of proper disposal. Approximately 4 out of 5 new heroin users report addiction to prescription opioids before trying heroin. Heroin attaches to the same brain receptors as prescription opioids, contributing to increased heroin use in the US. The low cost and high purity of heroin have led to more users, including younger individuals. The number of new heroin users rose from 142,000 in 2010 to 178,000 in 2011, with the average age of first use decreasing. The Department of Health and Human Services reported a 79% increase in heroin use nationwide between 2007 and 2012. Deaths from heroin overdose nearly tripled from 2010 to 2013, rising from 3,036 to 8,257. The Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Program addresses heroin-related issues.
