    "content": "The Act titled \"Citizen Petition Fairness and Accuracy Act of 2006\" allows for citizen petitions and petitions for stay of agency action. Section 505(j)(5) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act is amended to require petitions to include all relevant information, be factually supported, not submitted for improper purposes, and not contain false or misleading information. The Secretary will investigate any petition that does not comply with requirements, may have been submitted for an improper purpose, or contains false, misleading, or fraudulent statements. If found to be knowingly submitted for an improper purpose or containing false information, the Secretary may take action. If a petition contains false, misleading, or fraudulent statements, the Secretary may impose penalties such as a civil penalty of up to $1,000,000, suspend the petitioner's authority to submit petitions for up to 10 years, permanently revoke their authority, or dismiss the petition. Enforcement actions will be taken and referred to the Federal Trade Commission. The Secretary may refer petitions containing false statements to the Federal Trade Commission for further action. When determining enforcement actions, the Secretary considers factors like gravity of violation, resources expended, impact on competing drugs, and petitioner's history of violations. The petitioner has a history of violating petition submission rules. Any aggrieved person can request an investigation for enforcement action against a false, misleading, or fraudulent petition. Violating the submission rules may result in a civil penalty. The Secretary must take final agency action on petitions within 6 months of receipt, without extension, even with petitioner consent. Failure to do so results in the petition being deemed denied. The Secretary may create regulations to determine if petitions merit enforcement action."
