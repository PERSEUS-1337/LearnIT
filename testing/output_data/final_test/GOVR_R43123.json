    "content": "The Medicare Supplementary Medical Insurance Program (Part B) covers durable medical equipment, prosthetics, orthotics, and other medical supplies if medically necessary and prescribed by a physician. Beneficiaries obtain these items from a supplier who bills Medicare for reimbursement. DME is equipment that can withstand repeated use, has an expected life of at least three years, serves a medical purpose, and is appropriate for home use. Examples include hospital beds, blood glucose monitors, and wheelchairs. The benefit also includes related supplies like drugs and biologicals necessary for effective use. Prosthetics (P) and Orthotics (O) are artificial aids for body organs and joints. Medicare covers DMEPOS items like surgical dressings. Medicare spending on DME in CY2011 was 20% of all DME spending. Medicare Part B program spent $7.8 billion on DMEPOS in CY2011. There were 98,000 active DMEPOS suppliers in the US in May 2012. Medicare generally pays for most DMEPOS on the basis of fee schedules, with beneficiaries responsible for 20% co-insurance. Investigations have shown that Medicare pays above-market prices for certain DME items. Medicare pays above-market prices for certain DME items, leading to higher costs for the program and beneficiaries. This is due to the fee schedule mechanism of payment not reflecting market changes. The higher payments result in increased Part B program costs, higher co-insurance for beneficiaries, and create a payment differential that can lead to fraud. The payment differential between market prices and Medicare payments for DMEPOS makes fraud lucrative, attracting bad actors. Legitimate Medicare suppliers benefit from higher prices. The Medicare Modernization Act required a competitive acquisition program for DMEPOS, where prices are determined by suppliers' bids. The competitive bidding program for DMEPOS suppliers began in 2008 but faced implementation issues, leading to a rebid in 2009. Payments based on winning bids took effect in 2011 (Round 1 Rebid). Round 2 of competitive bidding, including mail order diabetic testing supplies, will start in 2013. Contracts with winning bidders are limited to three years, prompting a recompetition process for Round 1 areas. The recompetition for DMEPOS contracts in Round 1 areas has begun, with payments expected to start on January 1, 2014. This report outlines the competitive bidding program, including bidder selection and payment determination. It also evaluates the first round of the program and addresses concerns for congress and recent legislation. The legislative history and requirements for competitive bidding are discussed, along with concerns of small suppliers. The authorizing statutes for the competitive bidding program give the Secretary the authority to establish and implement the DMEPOS competitive bidding program. Round 1 and Round 2 of the program were scheduled for specific metropolitan areas, with a national mail order competition planned after 2010. The program is required to be extended to all areas by 2016. The Secretary is required to exclude certain areas from competition before 2015, including rural areas, MSAs with a population of less than 250,000 not selected for Round 1 or Round 2, and areas with low population density within selected MSAs. The Secretary can divide MSAs with over 8 million people into separate DMEPOS bidding markets. Competitive Bidding Areas (CBAs) for Round 1 were determined based on population and DMEPOS allowed charges in CY2004. The methodology for implementing the competitive bidding program was described in a final rule published on April 10, 2007. The top 25 MSAs with the highest DMEPOS allowed charges in CY2004 were considered for the program. A score was calculated for each MSA based on DMEPOS charges per Medicare beneficiary and the number of suppliers per beneficiary. The three largest MSAs and areas served by two DME MACs were excluded. The top MSAs were selected as CBAs for Round 1, with limitations on the number of CBAs per state. The process for identifying Round 2 areas followed similar criteria with updated data. The scoring criteria for Round 2 areas were the same as Round 1, but more recent data were used. The boundaries of a CBA did not have to match the MSA, and CMS could add contiguous areas with high DMEPOS use to the CBA. The final rule did not specify CBA boundaries but provided information on the contractor's website. Additionally, a nationwide mail order competitive bidding program was established. The nationwide mail order competitive bidding program for Medicare diabetic supplies is set to begin on July 1, 2013. The program will phase in competitive bidding for items with high cost, volume, or savings potential, including DME, enteral nutrients, and off-the-shelf orthotics. Certain items like inhalation drugs and complex rehabilitative power wheelchairs are excluded from the program. The final rule specified that CMS would consider factors like Annual Medicare DMEPOS allowable charges, growth in expenditures, number of suppliers, savings during demonstrations, and reports from oversight agencies to determine items for the competitive bidding program. Items with high charges and growth would have priority. Table 3 shows categories of items in different bidding rounds. Items are grouped by related medical conditions. In the competitive bidding program, items (grouped by related medical conditions) are categorized together. Suppliers must bid on all items within a category defined by HCPCS codes. Categories can vary in size, with some having less than a dozen items and others over 100. Suppliers can bid on one or more categories that change in each bidding round. For example, in Round 1 Recompete, hospital beds and support services were combined into a single category, and walkers were grouped with wheelchairs and scooters in a broader mobility equipment category. In the Round 1 Recompete of the competitive bidding program, suppliers must meet eligibility requirements and win based on price competition. Non-winning suppliers can still sell competitively bid items in limited circumstances. The Secretary can only award contracts to accredited suppliers who meet financial standards. The total payments in competitive bidding areas are expected to be lower than fee schedule amounts. Beneficiaries have multiple supplier choices in each area. Suppliers in competitive bidding program must meet eligibility requirements, have active Medicare provider number, and be in good standing. The Secretary may limit winning bidders to meet demand. Methodology for determining winning suppliers was published in 2007. Suppliers bid for entire product categories, submitting bids for each item with an estimate of supply. Composite bid is calculated for each product category bid. The composite bid for suppliers in the competitive bidding program is calculated by multiplying each item bid by a weight based on national utilization, then summing for the category. Bidders are ranked by their composite bids, with a pivotal bid identified where combined capacity meets demand. Suppliers below the pivotal bid are offered contracts, while those above are denied. CMS established a target for 30% of winning bidders in a Competitive Bidding Area (CBA) to be small suppliers, defined as those with annual revenues of $3.5 million or less. If this target is not met, contracts are offered to small suppliers with the lowest composite bids above the pivotal bid. This process continues until 30% of suppliers in each product category are small suppliers or there are no more small suppliers to offer contracts to. In rare cases, non-winning suppliers may still be able to sell competitively bid items in the CBA. If a supplier does not win a contract to provide grandfathered items paid on a rental basis, they may finish the rental period by accepting a specified payment, usually the competitive bidding payment. They can also enter into a subcontracting agreement with a winning supplier or purchase the business with approval from the Secretary. Certain providers are exempted from competitive bidding. Physicians or practitioners may furnish orthotics or DME to their own patients. Hospitals may also provide these items to their patients. Suppliers in competitive bidding areas can be paid by Medicare to repair beneficiary-owned equipment. The names of winning suppliers are published online. Payment for competitively bid items is based on the median of the bids. The payment for competitively bid items in a competitive bidding area is based on the median of the bids from winning suppliers. This means that half of the suppliers will be paid less than their bid for an item, while the other half will be paid more. Suppliers may be paid more or less than their bid for different items in the category. Suppliers in the competitive bidding program must accept assignment, agreeing to the single payment amount as full payment. Medicare covers 80% of the amount, with beneficiaries responsible for the remaining 20% and any deductible. Outside the program, assignment is optional, allowing suppliers to bill beneficiaries any amount for covered items. Certain DME items are rented for specific periods. The final rule for the Competitive Bidding Program established safeguards and payment adjustments, including a grandfather provision for beneficiaries in CBAs, minimum monthly rental payments for oxygen equipment, and payment adjustments for changes in HCPCS codes. The final rule for the Competitive Bidding Program includes provisions to ensure small suppliers have opportunities to participate in the program, with most suppliers meeting the Small Business Administration's definition of a small business. The rule aims to increase the likelihood of small suppliers being able to participate in the program by implementing various provisions. The Competitive Bidding Program aims to facilitate small suppliers' participation by selecting multiple suppliers for each category, conducting separate bidding competitions, and establishing new criteria for small suppliers. Focus groups were held to gather input on how to support small suppliers, including discussions on quality standards and accreditation processes. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services set a target of 30% or more DMEPOS small suppliers in each competitive bidding program. In Round 1 Rebid, 51% of winning suppliers were small suppliers, and in Round 2, they make up 63% of contract suppliers. The Secretary has broad authority to administer the Medicare program and undertake research, studies, and initiatives. Specific provisions in Section 1847 of the Social Security Act require the formation of an advisory body, an ombudsman's office, and program evaluations for the Competitive Bidding Program. The Secretary established a Program Advisory and Oversight Committee (PAOC) to advise on the implementation of the Competitive Bidding Program. PAOC provided advice on financial standards, data collection, efficient interaction among stakeholders, and quality standards. The committee was terminated in 2011 as required by law. Membership information and meeting notes are available on the CMS website. The Secretary established a Competitive Acquisition Ombudsman (CAO) within CMS to address complaints related to the competitive bidding program. The CAO collaborates with the Medicare Beneficiary Ombudsman and submits an annual report to Congress. Evaluations of the Competitive Bidding Program have been conducted, with some still pending. CMS found that the program reduced expenditures for selected DMEPOS by over 42% in the first year of the Round 1 Rebid. The Competitive Acquisition Ombudsman's office found no disruptions in access to needed supplies or negative health consequences for beneficiaries due to competitive bidding. Inquiries about the program were high in 2011, but complaints were minimal. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) evaluated the first year of the program, focusing on outcomes of the rebid process, effects on DME suppliers, beneficiary access and satisfaction, utilization, and costs to CMS. The report found that nearly the same number of suppliers bid in Round 1 Rebid as in Round 1, with fewer disqualifications in the Round 1 Rebid. About 20% of the bids submitted were disqualified. In Round 1 Rebid, 20% of bids were awarded contracts, similar to Round 1. Some suppliers were incorrectly disqualified but later offered contracts. Difficulty complying with bid submission requirements was noted, especially with financial documentation. 4% of original contract suppliers had contracts terminated, and 2% changed ownership. In January 2011, 58% of suppliers chose to become grandfathered, decreasing to 22% by December 2011. In December 2011, 22% of suppliers chose to become grandfathered as rental periods expired. 31% of contract suppliers had subcontracts within the first 8 months. 43 new contract suppliers entered a product category, and 44 entered a competitive bidding area. CMS's monitoring showed no impact on beneficiary access or satisfaction. DME utilization decreased post-competitive bidding, but pre-bidding levels may have been too high. CMS estimated savings outweighed program costs, with an average bid submission cost of $2,303.16. The Office of the Inspector General (OIG) examined suppliers soliciting physicians for specific DMEPOS brands in the competitive bidding program. Most physicians did not specify brands in prescriptions, and those who did were not solicited to change it. OIG is required to evaluate competitive bidding conduct and payment amounts determination. Concerns have been raised about the program's long-term viability and pricing reflecting the market. The Competitive Bidding Program raises concerns about reducing DMEPOS suppliers, leading to higher bids in subsequent rounds. In a demonstration in Polk County, Florida, prices for urological supplies increased between the first and second round, indicating potential price rises for reasons other than supplier reduction. In a demonstration in Polk County, Florida, prices for urological supplies increased between the first and second round of competitive bidding. Some suppliers bid too low initially and had to bid higher in the second round. The DME business has low barriers to entry, with suppliers needing to meet accreditation requirements and surety bonds. Higher prices in subsequent bidding rounds may attract new businesses to compete, potentially changing the market landscape. The use of non-binding bidding in the DME market has been criticized for allowing bidders to submit bids they have no intention of paying, potentially resulting in unrealistically low bids. Concerns have been raised about the combination of non-binding bidding and median pricing leading to suppliers winning contracts they may not fulfill. In a study published in the Quarterly Journal of Economics, economists and experts warn that using non-binding bids and median pricing could lead to market failure. An experimental auction with university students showed that non-binding bids resulted in low-ball offers, while binding bids revealed true costs. This suggests that the DMEPOS bidding program may incentivize unreasonably low bids. The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) allows bid modification or withdrawal before bid opening, but only permits it after bid opening and before contract award with \"clear and convincing evidence\" of a mistake and intended bid. This reflects case law allowing bidders equitable relief in certain circumstances. Bidders may be entitled to equitable relief from entering contracts based on their bids, known as the \"law of mistaken bids.\" This law allows rescission of bids in cases of mutual mistakes, obvious unilateral mistakes, and clerical errors. Judgment mistakes are generally not excused unless enforcement is unconscionable. The government is entitled to damages if a bidder fails to execute a contract based on its bid. The government is generally entitled to damages if a bidder fails to execute a contract based on its bid. Agencies often require bidders to submit security with their bids to guarantee performance, such as cash deposits, cashier's checks, certified checks, letters of credit, and bid bonds. Bid bonds are commonly used in federal construction contracts, authorized by the FAR. The FAR generally authorizes bid bonds for federal construction contracts, requiring performance and payment bonds. Sureties on bid bonds can assert defenses except personal ones. Courts may not require forfeiture of bid bonds if a bidder can prove a mistake. The DMEPOS bidding program does not mandate bid bonds. Bidders must fulfill contract terms but performance obligations are separate. The bidder's obligation to perform under a contract may differ from its obligation to enter into the contract. If a contractor defaults, the government can seek monetary damages but may have limited ability to compel performance. Specific performance is usually granted for real property or unique items, not for commercial items or services. DMEPOS contracts require repeated performance over time, with potential variations in quality. The bidder's obligation to perform under a contract may vary by task or time. Both binding and nonbinding bids could lead to underperformance, as evidenced by the high acceptance rate of contracts in previous rounds. Only 4% of suppliers were terminated or cancelled in the first 10 months of the program. The price for each item in the program is set at the median of all winning bids, which may lead to \"low-ball\" bids. The extent of this issue depends on the distribution of bids for each item. If the range between the highest and lowest winning bids is narrow, setting the price at the median could result in a small difference. The price for each item in the program is set at the median of all winning bids, which may lead to \"low-ball\" bids. Most successful bidders accepted contracts, suggesting they did not find the difference between their bid and the offered price to be significant. CMS chose to offer contracts to more suppliers than needed, setting the price at the median rather than the market clearing price. The median price was used instead of the market clearing price for a larger group of suppliers in the Round 1 Rebid. CMS believed this approach was successful initially but the imprecise pricing methodology would eventually fail. Allowing more suppliers than necessary was seen as a conservative measure to prevent market disruption. Some argue that quality is not a significant factor in the competitive bidding program, leading to concerns about lower quality equipment and customer service as suppliers focus on cost reduction. All suppliers, including contract and non-contract suppliers, must meet accreditation requirements, ensuring leadership and systems are in place for various aspects of the business. The accreditation requirements for suppliers include responsibilities such as consulting with the prescribing physician, delivery and set-up of equipment, training for beneficiaries, and follow-up services. Additional requirements exist for suppliers of respiratory equipment, wheelchairs, and certain orthotics or prosthetics. Quality was assessed in the Competitive Bidding Demonstration Programs from 1999 to 2002. During the Competitive Bidding Demonstration Programs from 1999 to 2002, beneficiary and supplier surveys indicated high satisfaction with product selection and quality. Anecdotal reports mentioned issues with urological supplies and wheelchair fitting, which were resolved through new bidding rounds and improved referral agent experience. Winning suppliers competed on customer service and product selection due to fixed payment amounts. Four bills introduced in the 113th Congress aim to amend the Competitive Bidding Program. The Small Supplier Fairness in Bidding Competition Act of 2013 (H.R. 27) would repeal the DMEPOS competitive bidding program and require a report on its impact on small clinical laboratories. The Medicare DMEPOS Market Pricing Program Act of 2013 (H.R. 1717) proposes replacing the competitive bidding program with a Market Pricing Program to determine prices under Medicare Part B. The Medicare DMEPOS Market Pricing Program Act of 2013 proposes conducting live auctions for DMEPOS based on reference items, with winners signing two-year contracts. Market-clearing prices from auctions would be applied to similar markets, and suppliers could sell products at the determined price. Additionally, the Secretary would re-establish the Program Advisory and Oversight Committee for two years. The PAOC would be re-established for two years to advise on the competitive bidding program and the MPP. The cost of terminating the competitive bidding program and establishing the MPP would be covered by fee schedule reductions and rescission of budget authority. H.R. 2375 was introduced to delay the implementation of Round 1 Recompete and Round 2 of the competitive bidding. The bill introduced on June 27, 2013, aims to delay the implementation of Round 2 of the competitive bidding program in Tennessee. It would require the termination of contracts for winning suppliers in Tennessee and impose penalties for errors. The Congressional Budget Office has not yet issued cost estimates for the bill. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA97, P.L. 105-33) introduced competitive bidding for DMEPOS, requiring the Secretary to establish three-year demonstration projects. Suppliers competed for contracts to furnish Medicare beneficiaries with selected items and services in areas selected based on supplier availability and potential savings. Demonstrations were conducted in Polk County, FL, with bids from 30 suppliers reviewed by CMS. Medicare established new payment rates for five categories of products based on bids from 30 suppliers, with 16 winning suppliers selected. The new rates took effect on October 1, 1999, saving the Medicare program and beneficiaries an estimated 16%-17% on covered items. A second round of bidding took place in Polk County in early 2001, with 16 winners chosen to participate. The prices went into effect on October 1. The second round of the demonstration in Polk County ended on September 30, 2002, resulting in estimated savings of approximately 20%. Another demonstration site in a three-county area around San Antonio, TX, began on February 1, 2001, covering various medical supplies. Fifty-one suppliers were selected, saving Medicare and beneficiaries an estimated 20% before its termination in December 2002. A final report to Congress evaluated the demonstrations based on Medicare expenditures, beneficiary access, and product quality. The demonstrations in Polk County, FL, and San Antonio, TX, saved an estimated 19% on Medicare payments and $7.5 million over three years. Access to goods and services was largely unaffected, except for a decline in portable oxygen equipment use in Polk County. This decline was confirmed through claims data analysis. The Polk County demonstration showed a decline in portable oxygen use due to an oxygen policy change, while the San Antonio site did not. Beneficiary and supplier surveys indicated high satisfaction and little change in products provided. Anecdotal reports mentioned issues with urological supplies and wheelchair fitting, which were eventually resolved through new bidding rounds and improved referral agent experience. The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA, P.L. 108-173) required the Secretary to establish a competitive acquisition program for durable medical equipment. The program phased in items and services with high cost and volume, exempting those unlikely to result in significant savings. The Secretary had the authority to exempt rural and low-density urban areas from competitive bidding, unless a significant national market existed. MMA established a phase-in schedule for the program. The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA) required the establishment of a competitive acquisition program for durable medical equipment. The program phased in items and services with high cost and volume, exempting some areas. The Secretary could establish a process for physicians to prescribe specific items if it would avoid adverse outcomes for beneficiaries. Contracts could only be awarded if entities met quality and financial standards set by the Secretary. Contracts for durable medical equipment under the competitive acquisition program must be re-competed every three years, with multiple suppliers awarded contracts in each area. Payment is based on competitively priced bids, with Medicare covering 80% of the payment amount. Beneficiaries are responsible for the remaining 20% after meeting the Part B deductible. The competitive acquisition program for durable medical equipment requires suppliers to bid competitively every three years. Medicare covers 80% of the payment amount, with beneficiaries responsible for the remaining 20% after meeting the Part B deductible. Suppliers must bill Medicare on an \"assignment-related\" basis and can use advanced beneficiary notice. The Secretary considers clinical efficiency and value when establishing bidding categories. Small suppliers have the opportunity to participate, and contractors must submit bids to supply items. Certain provisions of the Federal Acquisition Regulation can be waived for program efficiency, except for confidentiality of information. The implementation of the competitive bidding program for durable medical equipment was overseen by a Program Advisory and Oversight Committee appointed by the Secretary. The committee provided advice on data collection, interactions among stakeholders, quality standards, and other functions. The committee was sunset by MMA in 2009. The Secretary described the methodology used by CMS in implementing the program in a final rule published in 2007, including how competitive bidding areas, items, suppliers, and payments are determined. Considerations for small businesses were included in the rule. Implementation Concerns Congress held hearings on the Competitive Bidding Program for durable medical equipment. Suppliers expressed concerns about education, bid submission, bid rejection, and payment calculations. GAO confirmed CMS had issues providing clear information to bidders. Suppliers also criticized the lack of education and communication from CMS. Suppliers raised concerns about the post-bidding review process and lack of involvement in educating the beneficiary community. CMS disagreed, stating they had extensive communication with various groups. Suppliers also criticized the online bidding system as primitive and problematic. CMS acknowledged difficulties with the online bidding system and extended the bidding window. Suppliers expressed concerns about bids being rejected for various reasons without clear explanations. CMS reexamined disqualified bids for missing documentation but did not disclose how financial information was used to judge bidders. A subsequent GAO analysis found issues with the post-bid review process not being effectively communicated to suppliers. The Medicare Competitive Bidding Program for DMEPOS faced challenges with disqualified bids, leading to a post-bid review by CMS. 58 bids from 10 suppliers were found to be incorrectly disqualified, with 7 suppliers ultimately offered contracts. The Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act of 2008 halted the program temporarily, requiring a rebid in 2009 and addressing implementation issues identified in congressional hearings. The provisions of MIPPA were deemed to have minimal budgetary effects by the Congressional Budget Office. The Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act of 2008 (MIPPA) had substantial budgetary effects due to program delays and changes funded by decreased Medicare DMEPOS payments. MIPPA terminated Round 1 contracts for the Competitive Bidding Program, with damages paid from the Part B Trust Fund. A new Round 1 competition was required in 2009, including previously identified areas and items. Suppliers were prohibited from seeking legal recourse. MIPPA delayed Round 2 until 2011 and added 70 new competitive bidding areas. The Secretary can subdivide areas with a population of at least 8 million. Expansion of the program beyond the original 80 locations was delayed by two years. Competitive bidding is prohibited in rural areas, MSAs of fewer than 250,000, and areas with low population before 2015. MIPPA delayed the Secretary's authority to adjust payments for items and services in non-competitive bidding areas by two years. The fee schedule update for 2009 was reduced by 9.5% for all items and services identified before July 1, 2008, as part of Round 1 of the competitive bidding program. This reduction applied to all areas, regardless of their bidding status. The 2009 fee schedule update was reduced by 9.5% for items and services identified before July 1, 2008, as part of Round 1 of the competitive bidding program. The reduction applied to all areas, regardless of bidding status. MIPPA required a 2% increase in the fee schedule update for competitively bid items in 2014, but this increase was eliminated in the ACA. New assessments and feedback opportunities were introduced for program evaluation. The OIG will assess CMS's process for the competitive bidding program and pricing determinations. MIPPA delayed a GAO evaluation of the program and expanded the study scope to include beneficiary access, satisfaction, costs to suppliers, and recommendations. The OIG will assess CMS's process for the competitive bidding program and pricing determinations, including savings, costs to suppliers, impact on small businesses, use of different items within HCPCS code, costs to CMS, impact on access and spending, and missing document notifications to bidders. The OIG will assess CMS's competitive bidding program, pricing determinations, impact on small businesses, access, and spending. Suppliers must submit missing documents by a specified date, and if received by the Secretary, the bid cannot be rejected solely for missing documents. Accreditation was required for DMEPOS suppliers by October 1, 2009, with exceptions for certain health care professionals. MIPPA granted the Secretary authority to exempt certain professionals from accreditation requirements, such as physicians, therapists, nurse practitioners, and orthotists. The added authority was not to delay program implementation. Contracted suppliers had to report subcontractors' accreditation status to the Secretary. MIPPA also mandated evaluation of HCPCS codes for wound therapy. Starting in the second round of the program, suppliers must demonstrate that their bid covers over 50% of all types of diabetic test strips in use. The volume of test strips could be determined with data recognized by the Secretary. The Inspector General was required to conduct a study to determine the types of diabetic test strips by volume. Items exempt from competition include off-the-shelf orthotics and durable medical equipment when furnished by physicians or other practitioners. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) expands competitive bidding in Round 2 to 91 MSAs, saving Medicare $1.4 billion by 2019. ACA also extends the accreditation deadline for pharmacies to January 1, 2011. Section 3109 of ACA extended the accreditation deadline for pharmacies to January 1, 2011. ACA exempts certain pharmacies from accreditation requirements, but all pharmacies must still meet them for competitive bidding. The CBO score is $0.0 billion for FY2010-FY2014 and $0.0 billion for FY2010-FY2019. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 requires payments for diabetic supplies under the mail order competitive bidding program to also apply to non-mail order supplies. The Secretary must recalculate payment rates for non-mail order diabetic supplies within 30 days of enactment. The CBO estimates a $0.6 billion savings for FY2013-FY2017 and FY2013-FY2022 by ordering diabetic supplies with a 9.5% payment reduction in 2009."
