    "content": "The people of California enact the following. California is a leader in innovation and technology, utilizing the Internet and digital technologies for efficient government services. In 1995, California enacted Section 16.5 of the Government Code to promote e-commerce and digital transactions with public agencies using digital signatures. In 1999, California enacted the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act, validating electronic signatures in transactions between individuals and government agencies. The similarity between the definitions of \"digital signature\" in the Government Code and \"electronic signature\" in the Act has caused confusion in the marketplace and among public agencies. The lack of clarity in the law hinders public agencies from fully utilizing digital transactions requiring a signature, impacting contracts, permits, and forms. This affects the efficiency, cost savings, and convenience of digital transactions. The Legislature aims to amend current law to clarify that a \"digital signature\" authorized by the Government Code is an acceptable form of \"electronic signature\" under the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act. In this title, key terms are defined such as \"Agreement\" as the parties' bargain, \"Automated transaction\" as electronic transactions, and \"Computer program\" as a set of instructions for information processing. In this title, key terms are defined such as \"Agreement\" as the parties' bargain, \"Automated transaction\" as electronic transactions, and \"Computer program\" as a set of instructions for information processing. Additionally, a \"Contract\" is the total legal obligation resulting from the parties' agreement, \"Electronic\" relates to technology with various capabilities, an \"Electronic agent\" is a program or automated means for electronic actions, and an \"Electronic record\" is a record created or stored electronically. An electronic signature is a sound, symbol, or process attached to an electronic record with the intent to sign it. A digital signature is a type of electronic signature. A governmental agency refers to federal, state, or local government entities. Information includes data, text, images, sounds, codes, and software. An information processing system is an electronic system for creating, storing, and processing information. In the context of electronic signatures and records, key definitions include \"Person\" as any legal entity, \"Record\" as information stored in a tangible or electronic medium, \"Security procedure\" as a method to verify electronic signatures, and \"Transaction\" as business or governmental actions. Section 16.5 of the Government Code allows for the use of digital signatures in written communications with public entities, provided the digital signature meets specific requirements for uniqueness, verification, control, and data linkage. The Government Code allows for the use of digital signatures in written communications with public entities, with regulations to be adopted by the Secretary of State by January 1, 1997. The use of digital signatures is optional, and certain exemptions apply. The Government Code allows for the use of digital signatures by public entities, with regulations set by the Secretary of State. Digital signatures have the same legal effect as manual signatures, and do not limit the use of electronic signatures as defined in the Civil Code. Regulations only apply to the use of digital signatures, not other electronic signatures authorized in the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act."
