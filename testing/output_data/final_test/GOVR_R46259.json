    "content": "Between 1969 and 1999, around 3,500 people died in political violence in Northern Ireland, known as \"the Troubles,\" stemming from the division of Ireland in 1921. The conflict involves Protestants (unionists) who identify as British and support UK incorporation, and Catholics (nationalists) who see themselves as Irish and desire a united Ireland. Militant unionists (loyalists) and nationalists (republicans) resorted to violence to achieve their goals, sparking the Troubles in late 1968 with a civil rights movement led by Catholics. In 1968, a civil rights movement began in Northern Ireland led by Catholics facing discrimination in electoral rights, housing, and employment. The violence escalated, leading to the deployment of the British Army in 1969 and direct rule from London in 1972. Multiparty talks for a political settlement started in 1996, facilitated by George Mitchell and involving the UK and Irish governments. The Good Friday Agreement, also known as the Belfast Agreement, was reached on April 10, 1998, after negotiations involving the UK and Irish governments and Northern Ireland political parties. Despite a decrease in violence, challenges remain in implementing the peace accord. Tensions persist among political parties and communities, with Northern Ireland still divided and facing issues in its pursuit of peace and reconciliation. Sectarian differences and addressing the legacy of violence are ongoing controversies, leading to a fragile peace and security situation in the region. The UK's withdrawal from the EU, known as Brexit, has added to divisions in Northern Ireland, posing challenges to peace and the economy. US administrations and Congress have actively supported the peace process, including police reforms and human rights. The US has provided aid through the International Fund for Ireland since 1986 to encourage economic development and reconciliation in Northern Ireland. The Good Friday Agreement is a complex document that requires consent from the majority of Northern Ireland's people for any changes in status. It acknowledges the desire for a united Ireland but respects the majority's wish to remain part of the UK. The Good Friday Agreement set out a framework for devolved government in Northern Ireland, including provisions for future polls on its constitutional status. It also addressed issues such as decommissioning of paramilitary weapons, policing, human rights, security normalization, and the status of prisoners. The Good Friday Agreement established new institutions like the North-South Ministerial Council and the British-Irish Council. Voters in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland approved the agreement in separate referendums on May 22, 1998. The Good Friday Agreement, approved in separate referendums on May 22, 1998, led to progress in Northern Ireland despite challenges with decommissioning and police reforms. The agreement aimed to establish a new Northern Ireland Assembly and Executive with cross-community support for key decisions. The Good Friday Agreement in 1998 led to the establishment of the new 108-member Northern Ireland Assembly, with power transferred to Belfast in December 1999. However, concerns about decommissioning, especially by the IRA, led to the suspension of the devolved government multiple times between 2000 and 2002. In May 2007, Northern Ireland's devolved government was restored after a landmark deal between the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) and Sinn Fein, leading to greater stability over the next decade. Tensions persisted within the government and between unionist and nationalist communities, with incidents such as protests over flags and emblems in 2012 and 2013. Protests in 2012 and 2013 over flags and emblems, a 2014 welfare reform dispute, and the 2015 arrest of a Sinn Fein leader in connection with a murder periodically threatened the devolved government's stability. Following its collapse in 2017, tensions due to Brexit stalled negotiations on forming a new government for almost three years, highlighting divisions in Northern Ireland politics and society. Decommissioning paramilitary weapons has been a challenge in implementing the Good Friday Agreement. The IRA's decommissioning of weapons was a slow and incremental process, with a key milestone in July 2005 when they declared an end to their armed campaign. The Independent International Commission on Decommissioning confirmed in September 2005 that the IRA had put all its arms \"beyond use,\" matching estimates provided by security forces. Other republican and loyalist groups also decommissioned their weapons. The IICD concluded its work in 2011. In 2001, the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) replaced the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) to address concerns of Protestant domination. The PSNI aimed to increase the proportion of Catholic officers from 8% to 30% in 10 years, following recommendations by the Patten Commission. The PSNI introduced a 50-50 Catholic/Protestant recruitment process to increase Catholic representation. Sinn Fein initially refused to participate in the Policing Board but later voted to support the police in 2007. In 2010, the Hillsborough Agreement devolved policing and justice powers to Belfast. In 2011, the 50-50 recruitment process for Catholic and Protestant PSNI officers concluded, fulfilling goals set by the Patten Commission. Concerns arose about low Catholic recruitment due to suspicions and fears of dissident republicans. In 2017, procedural changes were made to attract more Catholics and women. The Good Friday Agreement aimed for a return to normal security in Northern Ireland, leading to the removal of security installations like watchtowers. In July 2007, the British Army ended its military operation in Northern Ireland after 38 years. British forces no longer have a policing role, but a garrison of 5,000 troops remains. The UK government incorporated the European Convention on Human Rights into Northern Ireland law and established new human rights and equality commissions. Some nationalists advocate for a Northern Ireland Bill of Rights and an Irish Language Act for official status of the Irish language. The Good Friday Agreement supports linguistic diversity in Northern Ireland, including the Irish language. The St. Andrews Agreement of 2006 proposed an Irish Language Act, which remains controversial. Efforts have been made since 2013 to reduce sectarian tensions and promote reconciliation, including the 2013 Haass Initiative led by Richard Haass. In 2013, Richard Haass led the Haass Initiative to address sectarian issues in Northern Ireland. Despite releasing a draft proposal, final agreement was not reached among political parties. In 2014, the Stormont House Agreement tackled financial pressures, welfare reforms, and austerity measures. Northern Ireland parties agreed to support welfare reform, balance the budget, and reduce reliance on the public sector. The 2015 Fresh Start Agreement aimed to address Northern Ireland's financial challenges by reducing the size of the Assembly and Executive departments, implementing welfare reform, and improving governance efficiency. Disagreements between the DUP and Sinn Fein delayed the implementation of the agreement. The Fresh Start Agreement reduced Executive departments and allowed for an official opposition in the Assembly. It addressed issues like parading, flags, and paramilitary activity. Concerns remain about the stability of the devolved government and community relations. The government collapsed in 2017 but was reestablished after three years. The search for peace and reconciliation in Northern Ireland remains challenging, with issues such as sectarian divisions, paramilitary concerns, and economic development. Previous agreements like the Haass initiative, Stormont House Agreement, and Fresh Start Agreement aimed to address these challenges, but some measures were delayed due to the collapse of the devolved government in 2017. The government collapsed following a renewable energy scandal involving DUP leader Arlene Foster and Sinn Fein's Martin McGuiness. Then-Deputy First Minister Martin McGuiness of Sinn Fein called for Foster to temporarily stand aside as First Minister while an investigation was conducted into the energy scheme; McGuinness resigned in protest, leading to new elections on March 2, 2017. Tensions between Sinn Fein and the DUP on various issues, including the energy scandal, Brexit implications, Irish Language Act, and same-sex marriage, prompted Sinn Fein to force snap Assembly elections. Arlene Foster led the DUP's campaign, while Michelle O'Neill succeeded McGuinness as Sinn Fein's leader in Northern Ireland. In the 2017 elections in Northern Ireland, Sinn Fein's Michelle O'Neill led the campaign following Martin McGuinness's resignation due to ill health. The Assembly seats contested were reduced to 90 from 108. The DUP retained the most seats, but Sinn Fein narrowed the gap between the two parties. A high voter turnout of almost 65% favored Sinn Fein and the Alliance Party, leading to unionist parties losing their overall majority in the Assembly. Following the 2017 snap Assembly elections in Northern Ireland, negotiations for a new devolved government between the DUP, Sinn Fein, and other parties stalled over an Irish Language Act and Brexit divisions. The DUP's support for the Conservative Party government heightened tensions, making reaching a new power-sharing agreement difficult. In April 2019, journalist Lyra McKee was killed by the New IRA during riots in Londonderry. In April 2019, journalist Lyra McKee was shot and killed by the New IRA during riots in Londonderry. The incident sparked public outcry and led to intensified efforts by the UK and Irish governments to revive talks on forming a new devolved government. Despite negotiations being deadlocked throughout 2019 due to Brexit uncertainty, new talks were launched in December 2019 following the UK general election. The DUP's influence in the UK Parliament was negated by a new power-sharing deal called New Decade, New Approach, which reestablished Northern Ireland's devolved government. This deal, agreed upon by the DUP, Sinn Fein, and other parties, addresses key issues such as health and education. Arlene Foster and Michelle O'Neill were elected as First Minister and Deputy First Minister, respectively, in the new Executive. The New Approach deal in Northern Ireland addresses health, education, and political transparency issues. It promotes the use of Irish and Ulster-Scots languages, with official recognition and support from both UK and Irish governments. Both the UK and Irish governments have pledged additional financial support for Northern Ireland as part of the agreement to restore the devolved government. Northern Ireland remains divided, with Protestant and Catholic communities living separately, marked by over 100 physical barriers including peace walls. Efforts are being made to remove these walls, but a significant portion of the population still supports their presence. Experts note that schools and housing developments in Northern Ireland remain mostly single-identity communities, with sectarian divisions evident during the annual summer marching season. Some unionist parades are perceived as triumphalist and intimidating by Catholics, leading to past violence during the Troubles. Many Protestants view the Parades Commission as biased in favor of Catholics. Efforts to address contentious parading issues in Northern Ireland have stalled, leading to protests and violence in late 2012 and early 2013. The decision to fly the UK flag at Belfast City Hall only on designated days sparked protests by unionists and loyalists, resulting in threats to leaders and vandalism of political party offices. In June 2016, a Commission on Flags, Identity, Culture, and Tradition was established to recommend policies on these issues. The Commission on Flags, Identity, Culture, and Tradition in Northern Ireland was established to address contentious parading issues and recommend policies. It consists of 15 members, with a deadline to produce recommendations within 18 months. However, due to the collapse of the devolved government in 2017, the commission has faced challenges in delivering its findings. The legacy of violence in Northern Ireland remains controversial, with the Good Friday Agreement emphasizing the importance of acknowledging and addressing the suffering of victims as part of reconciliation efforts. In 2008, the Northern Ireland Assembly established a Commission for Victims and Survivors to support victims and their families. Legal processes exist for examining crimes from the Troubles, including police investigations, inquiries like the Saville inquiry, and the Historical Enquiries Team reviewing over 3,200 deaths. Critics argue these processes are piecemeal and prioritize some incidents over others, with over 3,000 conflict-related deaths remaining unsolved. The Historical Enquiries Team reviewed over 3,200 deaths related to the conflict in Northern Ireland between 1968 and 1998. Critics argue that the processes for examining crimes from the Troubles are costly and time-consuming, with differing views on how to address the past due to competing narratives between unionists and nationalists. The 2014 Stormont House Agreement proposed establishing four new bodies to address \"legacy issues.\" The 2014 Stormont House Agreement proposed establishing three new bodies to address \"legacy issues\" from the conflict in Northern Ireland: Historical Investigations Unit (HIU) to take forward outstanding cases, Independent Commission for Information Retrieval (ICIR) for victims to seek conflict-related information privately, and Oral History Archive for sharing experiences. The 2014 Stormont House Agreement proposed creating new institutions in UK law to address legacy issues from the Troubles in Northern Ireland. Efforts to establish these bodies were hindered by divisions over \"national security caveats\" and concerns about potential cover-ups of criminal wrongdoing by state agents. Victims groups, nationalists, and unionists all had differing concerns about the proposed institutions. In Northern Ireland, measures to address the past should include a statute of limitations or amnesty. The 2014 Stormont House Agreement proposed new institutions to deal with legacy issues from the Troubles, but progress was hindered by national security concerns. The UK government pledged to introduce legislation for these legacy bodies in the New Decade, New Approach deal in January 2020. However, obstacles remain, such as demands to protect military veterans from prosecution. Major paramilitary organizations from the Troubles era are no longer active. Experts say that paramilitary groups from the Troubles in Northern Ireland are now focused on the political process and are on cease-fire, but concerns remain about their involvement in criminal activities. A 2015 study commissioned by the UK government found that these groups still exist but are committed to peaceful means. However, individual members pose a threat to national security through organized crime. The 2015 Fresh Start Agreement aimed to address concerns about paramilitary groups in Northern Ireland, calling for disbandment and prohibiting members from taking instructions from such groups. An Independent Reporting Commission was established in 2017 to monitor paramilitary activity and reported in 2019 that paramilitarism remains a significant issue. The Independent Reporting Commission (IRC) reported in November 2019 that paramilitarism continues to be a significant obstacle to peace and reconciliation in Northern Ireland. Security assessments highlight ongoing threats from dissident republican and loyalist groups opposed to the 1998 peace accord. Despite the existence of these groups, experts note that dissident groups lack the capacity for sustained terror campaigns seen during the IRA's activity in the 1970s-1990s. The IRA conducted a sustained terror campaign in the 1970s-1990s. Currently, there are four main dissident republican groups in Northern Ireland: Continuity IRA, \u00c3\u0093glaigh na h\u00c3\u0089ireann, Arm na Poblachta, and the New IRA. These groups target police officers, prison officers, and security services. Dissident republicans have been responsible for the deaths of two PSNI officers, two British soldiers, and two prison officers between 2009 and 2017. Despite \u00c3\u0093NH declaring a cease-fire in January 2018, the other groups remain active, with the New IRA posing a severe threat according to authorities. The New IRA is a severe threat in Northern Ireland, suspected of a car bomb in January 2019 and claiming responsibility for killing journalist Lyra McKee in April 2019. Dissident republican activity has increased, especially in border regions, exploiting political stalemates. Economic development and equal opportunity are seen as key to lasting peace. Northern Ireland's economy grew 5.6% annually between 1997 and 2007. Northern Ireland's economy grew by 5.6% annually between 1997 and 2007, with unemployment decreasing to 4.3% by 2007. However, the 2008-2009 global recession had a significant impact, leading to slow and uneven economic recovery. As of September 2019, the region's economic activity grew by 0.3%, with unemployment at 2.4%, lower than the UK average. Despite this, income and living standards in Northern Ireland remain below the UK average, with high rates of economic inactivity and a significant proportion of working-age individuals lacking formal qualifications. Northern Ireland has historically poor areas with high inactivity rates and a lack of formal qualifications among working-age individuals. Despite this, strides have been made in promoting equality in the workforce, with economic activity rates between Protestants and Catholics converging in recent years. Unemployment rate gaps have also decreased significantly. Northern Ireland leaders aim to improve long-term economic performance by promoting export-led growth and reducing economic dependency. Northern Ireland leaders have aimed to promote export-led growth, decrease economic dependency on the public sector, and attract foreign direct investment. Devolving power over corporation tax to Belfast was a key issue in cross-party negotiations. The Fresh Start Agreement targeted April 2018 for introducing a devolved corporation tax rate of 12.5%. However, the process was put on hold due to the absence of a devolved government between 2017 and early 2020. Brexit has added to divisions within Northern Ireland and poses challenges for its peace process, economy, and constitutional status. EU membership was crucial for underpinning the Good Friday Agreement by providing a common European identity for unionists and nationalists. EU law also supported human rights and equality provisions in the peace accord. The peace agreement between the UK and Ireland led to the disappearance of the land border between Northern Ireland and Ireland, which was crucial for the region's political and economic stability. The goal of preventing a hard border post-Brexit was a major challenge in the UK's negotiations with the EU, as it could potentially reignite violence from dissident groups opposed to the peace process. The fear of violence threatening the region's security and stability due to a hard border post-Brexit was a concern for many in Northern Ireland and Ireland. Maintaining an open border was crucial for \"frictionless\" trade, the North-South economy, and community relations. Border communities worried about the impact on daily travel and the numerous crossing points along the border. The UK government's pursuit of a hard Brexit complicated efforts to devise a mechanism for an open border. In early 2019, the UK Parliament rejected the initial UK-EU withdrawal agreement multiple times due to concerns about the backstop for the Irish border. Some Brexit advocates believed that Ireland and the EU were exaggerating security concerns to keep the UK close to the EU. The Irish government and many in Northern Ireland argued that an open border was essential for peace on the island. In October 2019, EU and UK negotiators reached a revised withdrawal agreement. The revised withdrawal agreement reached in October 2019 includes new provisions for Northern Ireland to maintain an open border on the island of Ireland post-Brexit while aligning with EU regulations, effectively keeping Northern Ireland in the EU customs union. This arrangement eliminates the need for regulatory checks on trade between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland but creates a customs border in the Irish Sea. At the end of the transition period, the UK, including Northern Ireland, will leave the EU customs union. The DUP opposed the \"Northern Ireland-only\" arrangements, fearing a customs border in the Irish Sea would divide Northern Ireland from the UK. Despite losing political influence, the DUP was unable to block the approval of the renegotiated withdrawal agreement. The UK and EU ratified the agreement, allowing the UK to leave the EU after 47 years. Concerns about a hard border in Ireland have largely diminished with the agreement in place. The EU and UK negotiators are still working on the details of post-Brexit regulatory and customs arrangements for Northern Ireland. A Joint Committee of UK and EU officials will decide on issues during the transition period. Uncertainty remains about the overall UK-EU relationship post-Brexit. The provisions related to the Northern Ireland land border are not expected to change pending the outcome of negotiations. The post-Brexit arrangements for Northern Ireland will be subject to the consent of the Northern Ireland Assembly in 2024. If the Assembly fails to renew these arrangements, the UK and EU would need to agree on new provisions to keep the border open. Brexit has worsened political and societal divisions in Northern Ireland, with the DUP opposing the Northern Ireland provisions in the withdrawal agreement. Some in the unionist community in Northern Ireland perceive a loss in traditions and dominance, exacerbated by post-Brexit border arrangements. This could lead to political instability and potential loyalist violence. Brexit may also have negative economic consequences for Northern Ireland, as it heavily depends on EU markets for exports. In 2017, 57% of Northern Ireland's exports went to the EU, with 38% to Ireland. Manufacturers in Northern Ireland and Ireland rely on integrated supply chains crossing the border multiple times for processing. Trade with Ireland is crucial for small- and medium-sized companies in Northern Ireland, despite higher sales to other parts of the UK. Northern Ireland companies dominate exports to Ireland and the rest of the UK. UK and DUP leaders emphasize the economic importance of the UK to Northern Ireland. Concerns arise about the potential negative impact of the renegotiated withdrawal agreement on the economy, including reduced business investment and trade. The DUP highlights potential profit implications for Northern Ireland businesses trading with the UK. Brexit could have significant economic ramifications for Northern Ireland, including increased costs and administrative burdens for businesses exporting to the UK under EU customs rules. Experts are concerned that Brexit may deter future foreign direct investment due to the loss of access to the EU single market. Northern Ireland will also lose EU regional funding and agricultural aid post-Brexit. UK officials are committed to safeguarding Northern Ireland's interests and see Brexit as offering new economic opportunities. Brexit offers new economic opportunities for Northern Ireland outside the EU. The renegotiated withdrawal agreement will improve Northern Ireland's economic prospects by allowing participation in UK trade deals and retaining access to the EU single market. Sinn Fein believes Brexit could lead to greater support for a united Ireland, calling for a border poll to achieve Irish unification. The Good Friday Agreement allows for a border poll in Northern Ireland to determine its constitutional status. The UK Secretary of State must call a poll if it seems likely that a majority would want to leave the UK and join a united Ireland. Current conditions do not favor a border poll as most polls show support for Northern Ireland remaining part of the UK, although some surveys suggest a shift in views. Some surveys indicate a potential shift in views on Northern Ireland's status, with 46% favoring unification with Ireland and 45% preferring to remain part of the UK. Changing demographics and post-Brexit arrangements could increase support for a united Ireland in the long term, subject to Ireland's consent. Concerns exist about public and political support for unification in the Republic of Ireland. Sinn Fein's success in Ireland's 2020 election, driven by domestic issues, may impact the potential for Irish unification, despite concerns about loyalist violence and Brexit's effects on Northern Ireland. Sinn Fein's electoral success in Ireland's 2020 election could boost calls for a united Ireland. The US has supported the Good Friday Agreement for peace in Northern Ireland, with administrations backing its implementation and urging leaders to reach agreements on key issues. The US administrations, including Obama and Trump, have supported peace efforts in Northern Ireland through agreements like the Hillsborough Agreement, Stormont House Agreement, and Fresh Start Agreement. Vice President Pence praised Northern Ireland's progress in peace and prosperity. The US remains ready to support efforts to implement the Good Friday Agreement and restore power-sharing institutions. President Trump appointed Mick Mulvaney as U.S. special envoy to Northern Ireland, which was welcomed by leaders in Northern Ireland and Ireland. Members of Congress have actively supported the Northern Ireland peace process, focusing on the Good Friday Agreement, policing reforms, and human rights. Some Members are interested in public inquiries into past murders with suspected collusion. There were calls for the Trump Administration to name a special envoy for Northern Ireland to show continued U.S. commitment. The United States is a key trading partner and source of investment for Northern Ireland, with exports to the U.S. accounting for 17% of total exports and imports from the U.S. accounting for 10% of total imports. U.S.-based companies have invested \u00a31.8 billion in Northern Ireland between 2008 and 2018. President Trump has expressed support for Brexit and the Trump Administration backs a future U.S.-UK free trade agreement post-Brexit. Vice President Pence reiterated U.S. commitment to the region during a visit to Ireland in September 2019. In a September 2019 visit to Ireland, Vice President Pence reiterated the Administration's support for Brexit but acknowledged the \"unique challenges\" of the Irish border. He urged the UK and Ireland to ensure that any Brexit respects the Good Friday Agreement. Some Members of Congress are concerned about Brexit's impact on Northern Ireland and support the Good Friday Agreement. They also back a future U.S.-UK free trade agreement but tie their support to protecting the Northern Ireland peace process. Members of Congress have tied their support for a future U.S.-UK free trade agreement to protecting the Northern Ireland peace process, specifically the Good Friday Agreement. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi emphasized the importance of upholding the peace accord in relation to Brexit. The House passed a resolution reaffirming support for the Good Friday Agreement and stating that any future U.S.-UK trade agreement must include conditions to uphold it. Other Members of Congress have not directly linked their support for a trade agreement to Northern Ireland post-Brexit. The United States has provided development aid to Northern Ireland through the International Fund for Ireland. The International Fund for Ireland (IFI) was established in 1986 with development aid from the UK, Ireland, and other countries. The IFI supports projects in Northern Ireland and border areas of the Republic of Ireland to promote economic regeneration and reconciliation. The United States has contributed over $540 million to the IFI since its inception, with other countries also providing funding. US appropriations for the IFI have averaged around $23 million annually in the 1980s and 1990s, and $18 million each year in the 2000s. The International Fund for Ireland (IFI) has supported projects in disadvantaged areas with high unemployment and little private sector investment. Initially focusing on economic development, the IFI shifted towards promoting community reconciliation in 2006. US administrations and Congress support the IFI to encourage economic development and unity in divided communities, aiming to create jobs and alleviate economic deprivation. Many observers see job creation and economic opportunity as crucial for resolving the conflict in Northern Ireland. Some critics question the effectiveness of the International Fund for Ireland (IFI) projects, calling them wasteful. In FY2011, amid budget cuts, some Members of Congress called for an end to U.S. funding for the IFI. In FY2011, Congress did not specify funding for the International Fund for Ireland (IFI) in the budget resolution. However, the Obama and Trump Administrations continued to allocate funds from the Economic Support Fund (ESF) for specific IFI activities. The Obama Administration provided $2.5 million per year between FY2011 and FY2014, and $750,000 per year in FY2015 and FY2016. The Trump Administration provided $750,000 per year in FY2017 and FY2018."
