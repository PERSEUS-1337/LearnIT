    "content": "The Act titled \"Western Alaska Community Development Quota Program Implementation Improvement Act of 2001\" aims to improve the Western Alaska Community Development Quota Program. The Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act is amended to include provisions for the Western Pacific Community Development Program and the Western Alaska Community Development Program. The North Pacific Council and the Secretary establish a western Alaska community development quota program to provide eligible communities with opportunities in Bering Sea fisheries and support sustainable local economic development. The program includes allocating a percentage of the total allowable catch of Bering Sea directed fisheries, such as 10 percent for the pollock fishery. The Secretary allocates a percentage of the total allowable catch for various Bering Sea directed fisheries based on recommendations from the North Pacific Council. This allocation includes the pollock fishery and other groundfish, halibut, and crab fisheries. The North Pacific Council cannot submit any plans before October 1, 2001, without approval from the Secretary. To participate in the western Alaska community development quota program, a community must be located within 50 nautical miles from the baseline along the Bering Sea coast or on an island within the Bering Sea. They must not be located on the Gulf of Alaska coast and must be certified by the Secretary of the Interior. To qualify for the western Alaska community development quota program, a community must be certified as a Native village under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, have residents primarily engaged in fishing in the Bering Sea or Aleutian Islands, and lack previous significant involvement in groundfish fisheries unless participation is through the western Alaska community development program. The Secretary may authorize a CDQ group to harvest a share of the total allowable catch of a Bering Sea fishery if they submit a community development plan. The plan must request a share of the catch that the CDQ group desires to harvest annually. The Secretary approves community development plans submitted by CDQ groups for participation in projects over a 36-month period. Plans approved before 2001 expire in 2003. The Secretary specifies the authorized share of the total catch in the approved plan. The CDQ group is authorized to harvest a share of the total allowable catch or guideline harvest level allocated to them by the Secretary. If the requested harvest shares exceed the allocated percentage, the Secretary will determine the appropriate share for each CDQ group to harvest annually. The CDQ group can amend their community development plan if their harvest share is less than requested. Within 24 months, each CDQ group can submit criteria for determining harvest shares, with the Secretary considering shared criteria if all groups submit the same. The Secretary will establish criteria for determining harvest shares if CDQ groups do not submit the same criteria within 30 months. The State of Alaska may participate in the program, and CDQ groups may need to submit their community development plans to the Governor if the state participates. If the State of Alaska participates in the western Alaska community development quota program and requests more harvest shares than allocated, the Secretary may direct the Governor to consult with CDQ groups and the North Pacific Fishery Management Council. The Governor must provide written rationale to the Secretary and CDQ groups for approval of the plans. Each CDQ group must submit an annual report on their community development plans to the Secretary and Governor of Alaska. The report should detail project implementation, financial performance, and any modifications made. The CDQ group must submit an annual report detailing financial performance of subsidiaries and non-CDQ activities, as well as the group's budget for the current year. This information is confidential and not available to the public. The CDQ group must submit an annual report on financial performance, which is confidential and cannot be used for purposes other than evaluating the group's financial status. Definitions include CDQ group as a nonprofit or for-profit entity composed of qualifying communities, and a community development plan outlining harvest intentions. The CDQ group must submit an annual report on financial performance, which is confidential and cannot be used for purposes other than evaluating the group's financial status. A CDQ project is a program or activity funded by revenue derived during the duration of a community development plan. The group must outline how they intend to use the harvest opportunity and revenue to assist communities in achieving sustainable economic development. The Secretary may approve a community development plan that restricts harvesting of fishery, excluding programs funded by entities where CDQ groups have equity interest. The Secretary can create necessary regulations for implementation."
