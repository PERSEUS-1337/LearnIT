    "content": "The people of California enact the following. Section 980 of the Military and Veterans Code is amended to define a \"veteran\" as a U.S. citizen who served in the military between specific dates and received an honorable discharge. Veterans who performed military service during specific periods, including between December 7, 1941, and January 1, 1947, or between June 27, 1950, and February 1, 1955, are eligible for benefits. Veterans who served between August 5, 1964, and May 8, 1975, or between August 2, 1990, and the end of combat in the Arabian Peninsula are eligible for benefits, including those deployed for Operation Desert Shield or Desert Storm. Any member of the reserves or National Guard who is called to active duty during a presidential executive order specifying combat or homeland defense, and receives an honorable discharge, is eligible for benefits. Any person who served in the Merchant Marine Service of the United States or qualifies under federal laws for revenue bond, and met specific criteria such as serving in the active military for a minimum of 90 days and receiving an honorable discharge, is eligible for certain benefits. Any person who qualifies for funds from a qualified mortgage revenue bond issued under 26 U.S.C. Section 143 and is a member of the California National Guard or a reserve component of the U.S. armed forces with at least six years of service and one year of satisfactory service may apply for Cal-Vet benefits. The definition of \"veteran\" excludes those separated under dishonorable conditions, due to alienage, or who refused military duty. A person may be excluded from being considered a veteran if they: \n- Performed no military duty or refused to wear the uniform\n- Served only in an auxiliary or reserve component without exemption from the Selective Training and Service Act\n- Had temporary active duty orders for training, processing, or a physical examination\n- Only served as a student at a military academy without completing the course and subsequent active duty service."
