    "content": "Since 1913, Congress has debated the taxation of capital gains income, with proposals to increase the limit on deducting capital losses against ordinary income. Currently set at $3,000, some suggest raising it to $10,000 or $15,000. The limit exists because gains and losses are only taxed when realized, allowing individuals to benefit from tax advantages by realizing losses and holding onto assets with gains until death. The current tax system allows individuals to benefit from tax advantages by realizing losses and holding onto assets with gains until death. Long-term gains are taxed at a maximum rate of 15%, while long-term losses are deductible without limit against short-term capital gains. Taxpayers can time their gains and losses to minimize income taxes, such as realizing and deducting losses in one tax year at 35% while waiting to realize gains at 15% in the next tax year. Increasing the net capital loss deduction would further incentivize gaming the system. Increasing the net loss deduction may primarily benefit taxpayers in upper income ranges and may not effectively stimulate the economy through increased spending. The report provides an overview of the tax treatment of capital losses, including current income tax treatment, historical treatment, tax gaming opportunities, distributional issues, and possible stimulative effects of increasing the net loss deduction. Capital gains or losses result from the sale of assets like stocks or real estate, with a gain occurring if the sale price is higher than the acquisition price. When selling an asset for a higher price than its acquisition cost, it results in a capital gain, while selling for a lower price leads to a capital loss. Long-term assets held over 12 months are taxed differently from short-term assets. Capital gains on short-term assets are taxed at regular income tax rates, with a maximum tax rate of 15% for long-term assets sold before January 1, 2013. Losses on capital assets can be fully deducted against gains, except for losses on a principal residence or business assets. When capital losses exceed gains, there is a $3,000 annual limit on deductions against other income. The process involves deducting short-term losses from short-term gains, then long-term losses from long-term gains. Net gains or losses are combined, with net losses deductible up to $3,000 against other income. Excess losses can be carried forward indefinitely. Since 1913, there have been significant legislative changes in the tax treatment of capital gains and losses. Congress has struggled with how to tax capital gains and losses, aiming for a tax system that aligns with a correct measure of income. Capital losses were initially only deductible if associated with a taxpayer's trade or business, but later became deductible up to the amount of any capital gains between 1916 and 1918. The Revenue Act of 1921 changed the tax treatment of capital gains and losses, dividing assets into short and long-term categories. Short-term gains were taxed at regular income tax rates, while long-term gains were taxed at a flat rate of 12.5%. Excess long-term losses could be deducted against other types of income at higher tax rates. This imbalance was corrected by the Revenue Act of 1924, which introduced a tax credit. The Revenue Act of 1924 rectified the imbalance in tax treatment of gains and losses by introducing a 12.5% tax credit for net long-term losses. This approach remained in effect with minor modifications until 1938 when changes were made to the tax treatment of gains and losses from the sale of capital assets. Gains and losses were classified as short-term or long-term based on the holding period, with deductions and carryover provisions for losses exceeding gains. During World War II, the tax treatment of capital losses changed significantly. The Revenue Act of 1942 consolidated short- and long-term losses and imposed a $1,000 limit on offsetting ordinary income with combined capital losses. The Revenue Act of 1942 consolidated short- and long-term losses and imposed a $1,000 limit on offsetting ordinary income with combined capital losses. The Revenue Act of 1951 corrected the asymmetry in tax treatment by allowing only 50% of a net long-term loss to be deducted against net short-term gains. The Revenue Act of 1951 corrected the asymmetry in tax treatment by eliminating double counting of net long-term losses. The Revenue Act of 1964 replaced the five-year loss carryover for capital losses with an unlimited loss carryover. The Tax Reform Act of 1969 imposed a 50% limitation on the deductibility of net long-term losses, with a $1,000 limit on ordinary income. The Tax Reform Act of 1976 increased the capital loss offset against ordinary income, raising the limit to $2,000 in 1977 and $3,000 for tax years after 1977. The Revenue Act of 1978 reduced the tax rate on long-term capital gains income by increasing the exclusion from tax to 60%. The 1978 Act did not reduce the limit on the deductibility of net long-term losses. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 repealed the net capital gain deduction for individuals, including both short-term and long-term capital gains in taxable income. Capital losses were no longer limited to 50% deductibility, allowing for netting against gains and full deduction against up to $3,000 of ordinary income. Gradual changes favored capital gains again, with a maximum rate of 28% set in 1990. The Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 and the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003 lowered the maximum tax rate on long-term capital gains income to 20% and further reduced it to 5% and 15% for certain tax years. This created a wider gap between taxation of ordinary income and capital gains income. The treatment of capital losses remained unchanged. The Tax Increase Preventive and Reconciliation Act of 2005 extended reduced tax rates on long-term capital gains to the end of tax year 2010. Legislative changes have aimed to align the tax treatment of capital gains and losses, but current law still allows for inconsistencies. Net long-term losses can be deducted against short-term gains and up to $3,000 of ordinary income, despite the maximum tax rate differences. The net capital loss limitation allows for up to $3,000 of ordinary income deduction, despite the difference in tax rates between ordinary income and long-term gains. Suggestions to increase the limitation to soften market downturns may further widen the gap in tax treatment between gains and losses. The limitation was originally enacted to prevent taxpayers from manipulating the timing of capital gains and losses to minimize tax liabilities. The ability to offset capital losses against other income helps taxpayers minimize taxes by timing gains and losses strategically. For instance, selling assets with a gain and a loss in different tax years can reduce tax liabilities. This strategy allows for tax savings by realizing gains in one year and losses in another. By strategically timing gains and losses, taxpayers can minimize taxes. For example, by waiting to take a loss in the next tax year, a taxpayer could reduce federal income taxes by $4,000. Excess losses can be carried forward indefinitely, allowing taxpayers to deduct them in future years. The cost of forgoing a full loss in the current year is the interest on the additional tax reduction that could have been realized. The $20,000 net long-term capital loss faces a $3,000 annual loss limitation, requiring seven years to fully deduct. Despite reducing taxes by $7,000 over the period, the time value of money makes the tax savings less valuable compared to taking them in the first year. The $20,000 net long-term capital loss faces a $3,000 annual loss limitation, taking seven years to fully deduct. Despite reducing taxes by $7,000 over the period, the time value of money makes the tax savings less valuable compared to taking them in the first year. The present value of the tax savings over seven years is $6,118, resulting in a reduction of approximately $882 in tax savings. Taxpayers with net long-term capital losses receive more tax savings under the current system than if there were a symmetrical tax rate on long-term gains and losses. The $20,000 net long-term capital loss is deducted over seven years at regular income tax rates, resulting in a present value of tax savings of $6,118. Capital gains are concentrated at the higher end of the income range, with the top 3% of taxpayers earning 91% of schedule D capital gains. The top 3% of taxpayers earned 91% of schedule D capital gains. A study showed that the top 1% who earned over $200,000 received 57% of gains, and the top 3% who earned over $100,000 received 73% of gains. About two-thirds of gains are received by the top 2% of the income distribution. Losses by income class may not be very meaningful as high income individuals may understate their share of losses. The top 3% of taxpayers earned 91% of schedule D capital gains, with about two-thirds of gains realized by individuals in the top 2% of the income distribution. Lower and middle income taxpayers are less likely to be affected by the expansion of capital losses due to limited direct stock ownership and assets held in tax-favored forms. In 2001, 29% of equities held by individuals were in pensions or retirement accounts, not affected by loss restrictions. Another 7% were in tax-free life insurance plans. These assets make up over 40% of equities and are more important for the middle class. In 1999, the largest source of realized capital losses was the sale of corporate stock, accounting for 61% of losses reported. Other securities like mutual fund shares and options made up 15% of losses. Most capital losses were realized by higher income taxpayers, with those below $200,000 not filing a schedule D and having no capital losses. Over 90% of taxpayers with income over $1 million filed a schedule D. Only a small fraction of taxpayers, especially those with income over $1 million, report a net capital loss on their tax returns. About 6% of taxpayers have any loss at all, with less than 20% of high-income taxpayers reporting a net capital loss. Taxpayers with net capital losses can deduct up to $3,000 against ordinary income, but about 60% are subject to the loss limit and have to carry over excess losses to subsequent years. Evidence shows that most individuals who could not deduct their losses in full were able to do so within two years, with more than 90% doing so within six years. Raising the capital loss limit to $6,000 would mainly benefit high-income tax filers, who account for 11% of taxpayers. This tax benefit may not effectively stimulate the economy as high-income individuals tend to save rather than spend. Direct government spending on goods and services is considered the most effective economic stimulus, followed by transfers and tax cuts for lower income individuals. Providing capital gains tax relief may not effectively stimulate the economy as direct government spending is considered more effective. The link between capital gains tax cuts and increased stock market values is uncertain, with mixed evidence. Revisions to capital gains tax may lead to more sales than purchases in the short run, potentially stimulating the stock market but benefiting high-income individuals more. Increasing the net capital loss limit may not effectively stimulate the economy as it could lead to a short-term incentive to sell stocks, potentially depressing stock prices further. Reasons for increasing the limit include economic stimulus, restoring confidence in the stock market, and returning the limit to its 1978 level. However, this may not be an effective way to boost aggregate demand as it could erode confidence and depress stock prices. The empirical evidence suggests that increasing the net capital loss limitation would mainly benefit higher income individuals. Restoring the loss limitation to its 1978 level is complex, with no optimal time period identified. Adjusting the $3,000 loss limit to reflect 2010 dollars would be around $10,000, but historical treatment of net long-term capital losses is more favorable post-1978 tax changes. Restoring historical treatment of net long-term capital losses would require addressing asymmetry in the tax system, which has become increasingly important through various tax changes. Without addressing this issue, raising the limit on losses could lead to gaming the system. Achieving symmetry would involve accounting for the tax rate differential between short and long-term gains and losses during the netting process. This could be done by requiring $2 of net long-term losses to offset $1 of short-term gain, considering the current rate differential of approximately two to one. To offset gains and losses, $2 of net long-term losses should offset $1 of short-term gain. If a net loss position remains, $2 of long-term losses should offset $1 of ordinary income up to the limit. Any excess losses can be carried forward. In cases of both short-term and long-term losses, short-term losses are used first to offset ordinary income. If short-term losses exceed the limit, they are carried forward with long-term losses. If net short-term losses are less than the limit, $2 of net long-term losses can be used to offset each remaining $1. In cases of net short-term loss and net long-term gain, each $1 of short-term loss offsets $2 of long-term gain. Any remaining net loss offsets ordinary income on a dollar for dollar basis. To achieve symmetry in offsetting gains and losses, a tax credit of 15% could be implemented for capital losses, capped and indexed to inflation. This approach was used between 1924 and 1938 and would benefit taxpayers in lower tax brackets."
