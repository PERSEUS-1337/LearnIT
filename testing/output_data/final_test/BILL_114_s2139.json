    "content": "The \"Small Contractors Improve Competition Act of 2015\" limits reverse auctions for covered contracts to improve procurement by increasing competition, reducing prices, and benefiting small businesses. In this section, the term 'contracting officer' is defined as per section 2101 of title 41, US Code. A 'covered contract' includes contracts for design and construction services, goods for protection, and other goods or services awarded based on factors other than price or technical responsibility. The term 'design and construction services' includes site planning, architectural design, engineering design, construction work, material supply, public building construction, and engineering services. The term 'responsible source' is also defined. The term 'responsible source' is defined in section 113 of title 41, United States Code. A reverse auction, for procurement by an agency, involves offerors competing by submitting offers with the ability to revise with lower prices. Reverse auctions are prohibited for covered contracts under specific sections like 8(a) and 15(a). In the case of awarding a contract under certain provisions of law, a reverse auction can only be used if specific requirements are met. These requirements include decisions regarding the use of a reverse auction being made by a contracting officer, such as deciding to use a reverse auction as part of the competition for the contract and determining evaluation criteria and vendor acceptability. Training is required for contracting officers to use or supervise reverse auctions for contract awards. The training must be similar to that provided by the Defense Acquisition University as described in the Carl Levin and Howard P. 'Buck' McKeon National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015. Federal agencies must follow specific guidelines when awarding contracts through reverse auctions. These guidelines include restrictions on the number of offers received, the ability to submit revised bids, evaluation of offers as technically acceptable or unacceptable, and the use of price rankings. Misinforming offerors about price rankings can result in disqualification from the procurement process. The Federal agency must ensure that third-party agents assisting with contract awards in reverse auctions do not perform inherently governmental functions. Information on offerors' past contract performance must be collected and shared in compliance with regulations. The third-party agent must also determine if an offeror is a responsible source. The third-party agent must ensure that disputes with an offeror do not impact the offeror's ability to compete for a contract award. SEC. 3. SURETY BOND REQUIREMENTS AND AMOUNT OF GUARANTEE. Amends Chapter 93 of title 31, United States Code to include provisions for individual sureties and the pledge of assets for bonds. Amends Chapter 93 of title 31, United States Code to increase the amount of surety bond guarantee from the Small Business Administration to 90%. The amendments will take effect 1 year after the enactment of this Act."
