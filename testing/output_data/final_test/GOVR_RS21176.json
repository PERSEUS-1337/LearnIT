    "content": "The Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA) regulates contributions and expenditures for federal election campaigns, including \"hard money\" which refers to funds raised and spent in accordance with FECA restrictions. Hard money can be used to influence federal elections and is subject to contribution limits of $2,000 per candidate, per election. The Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA) sets contribution limits for federal election campaigns, including $25,000 per year to a national committee of a political party and $5,000 per year to PACs. An individual is subject to an aggregate limit of $95,000 per two-year election cycle, with sub-limits for candidates, PACs, and parties. The FEC interprets and enforces these statutory provisions. The Federal Election Commission (FEC) interprets the Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA) to include unincorporated Indian tribes as \"persons,\" subjecting them to contribution limits. However, Indian tribes are not considered \"individuals\" and are not subject to aggregate election-cycle limits. This ruling allows tribes to exceed the limits applicable to individuals by making multiple contributions. FECA also prohibits corporations, labor unions, and national banks from using treasury funds for federal campaign contributions and expenditures. Indian tribes are not subject to the ban on using corporate treasury funds for federal election contributions. They can contribute directly from their tribal funds without establishing a PAC, making it easier for them to participate in federal elections. Contributions to a PAC are limited to $5,000 per year. Indian tribes can contribute directly to federal elections from their tribal funds, bypassing the $5,000 limit imposed on PAC contributions. The FEC treats tribes differently than PACs, with reporting requirements being superceded in 1995. Contributions from tribes must be reported by recipients, but tracking the funds requires reviewing FEC and IRS filings. PoliticalMoneyLine found that $25 million was donated by 212 tribes for 2000-2005 federal elections. PoliticalMoneyLine discovered that 212 federally recognized Indian tribes donated around $25 million for federal elections between 2000-2005. The reporting was done under nearly 2,000 different variations of their names, making it challenging to track the flow of election-related money from Indian tribes compared to other large entities. Indian tribes, unlike interest group PACs, have no aggregate limit on their total federal election contributions and can use their tribal funds for donations. This sets them apart from other interest groups that typically operate through PACs. Indian tribes have no aggregate limit on their federal election contributions, unlike interest group PACs. They can use their tribal funds for donations, which sets them apart from other interest groups. Multicandidate committees, like PACs, have a $5,000 per candidate limit, while other individuals, including Indian tribes, have a $2,300 per candidate limit. Soft money, not regulated by FECA, refers to funds that cannot legally be used in federal elections. Soft money, also known as nonfederal funds, are treasury funds that cannot be used in federal elections but can be used for other specified purposes. The Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 put an end to the practice of national parties raising non-FECA funds. However, spending on issue advocacy communications, paid for by groups like corporations or labor unions, remains a prominent soft money activity. The Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 regulated issue advocacy communications by creating the term \"electioneering communication\" for political ads referring to federal candidates within specific timeframes. BCRA prohibits the use of union or certain corporate funds for these communications. Indian tribes, as unincorporated entities, may finance \"electioneering communications\" with disclosure requirements for disbursements over $10,000 and donors of $1,000 or more."
