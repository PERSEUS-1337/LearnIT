    "content": "The Act titled \"Multiemployer Retirees Medical Equity Benefits Act of 1993\" allows the use of multiemployer plan contributions and assets for retiree health benefits. The Act \"Multiemployer Retirees Medical Equity Benefits Act of 1993\" permits multiemployer plan contributions to be used for retiree health benefits by treating them as if directly contributed by employers to a related retiree medical benefits plan under certain conditions. The Act allows multiemployer plan contributions to be used for retiree health benefits under specific conditions, ensuring the transferred amounts are within limits and exclusively used for providing health benefits to eligible individuals. The permissible amount is defined as the excess of contributions made to the pension plan over the amount required to avoid funding deficiencies. The term 'retiree medical benefit plan' refers to a trust or a section 401(h) account that provides benefits to retired participants. It is related to a pension plan if 75% of those covered are receiving pension benefits. 'Multiemployer plan' is defined by section 414(f), and 'transfer year' refers to the plan year for transferred amounts. Section 420 of the Code allows for qualified transfers of excess pension assets to a health benefits account within a defined benefit plan. This transfer does not affect the plan's compliance with certain requirements, does not impact the employer's gross income, and is not considered an employer reversion. Section 420 of the Code allows for qualified transfers of excess pension assets to a health benefits account within a defined benefit plan without impacting the employer's gross income or being considered an employer reversion. The limitations of subsection (d) apply to an employer maintaining the plan, with restrictions on the amount of excess assets that can be transferred for retiree health liabilities. Section 420 of the Code allows for qualified transfers of excess pension assets to a health benefits account within a defined benefit plan without impacting the employer's gross income. The amendment in Section 420(c)(1)(B)(ii)(II) specifies that such transfers shall be treated as an employer reversion for purposes of section 4980 to the extent the original transfer satisfied obligations of an employer to provide retiree health benefits. Additionally, a special rule for plans maintained by multiple employers is added in Section 420(c)(3)(E). The special rule in Section 420(c)(3)(E) applies to plans maintained by multiple employers, expanding the definition of \"employer\" to include employee welfare benefit plans providing retiree medical benefits. It also includes the plan year of such benefit plans in the definition of \"taxable year\" for certain purposes. An employer may not contribute to health benefits accounts or welfare benefit plans after specific dates for retiree health liabilities. Contributions not allocated to specific benefits will be allocated to current employee benefits. The employer may allocate benefits to current employee benefits, reserves, and qualified retiree health liabilities. Qualified current retiree health liabilities refer to deductible amounts for applicable health benefits provided directly by the employer. The employer may allocate benefits to current employee benefits, reserves, and qualified retiree health liabilities. Amounts contributed to a multiemployer pension plan can be treated as if they were contributed directly by the employers to a related retiree medical benefit plan if certain conditions are met. The employer can transfer excess contributions from a pension plan to a retiree medical benefit plan within a year, as long as the amount transferred is permissible and used exclusively for health benefits for retirees. The term 'retiree medical benefit plan' refers to a trust or an Internal Revenue Code section 401(h) account providing benefits for retired participants. It is considered related to a pension plan if at least 75 percent of those covered are retirees or beneficiaries receiving pension benefits. The term 'multiemployer plan' refers to a pension plan where contributions are made by more than one employer. The term 'transfer year' is defined as the plan year in which contributions were transferred to the multiemployer pension plan. The amendments made by this section will apply to taxable years starting after December 31, 1992."
