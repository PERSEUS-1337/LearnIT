    "content": "The global food and economic crises have led to over 1 billion people being undernourished, with the majority in developing countries. The U.N. aims to reduce the proportion of hungry people by half by 2015, with Asia, sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America, the Near East, North Africa, and developed countries all affected. The number of undernourished people globally has been increasing steadily, with a decline in the 1980s and early 1990s attributed to increased investment in agriculture. However, between 1995-1997 and 2004-2006, the number of hungry people increased in all regions except Latin America and the Caribbean. The recent food and economic crises have reversed the declining trend in hunger reduction. The recent food and economic crises have reversed the declining trend in hunger reduction, with the proportion of hungry people rising in 2008. The U.N. Secretary General suggests that progress in meeting the Millennium Development Goals has slowed or even reversed. The current situation is particularly devastating for poor households in developing countries due to simultaneous crises affecting large parts of the world. The global recession exacerbates the food crisis, pushing vulnerable populations deeper into poverty and food insecurity. The U.S. Global Food Security Initiative, a priority for President Obama, aims to alleviate global hunger and support agricultural development in poor nations. The State Department released a fact sheet in January 2009 outlining the U.S. food security initiative, focusing on global hunger and agriculture development. President Obama made commitments to food security at the G8 Summit in July 2009, leading to the establishment of the Global Partnership for Agriculture and Food Security. The Global Partnership for Agriculture and Food Security was established at the G8 Summit in July 2009 with the goal of mobilizing $20 billion over three years to combat hunger and poverty. The initiative focuses on promoting sustainable production, productivity, and rural economic growth through comprehensive strategies and stronger coordination among donors. The G8 leaders pledged to provide sustainable funding to enhance world production capacity and reverse the trend of decreasing ODA for agriculture. The initiative aims to support country and regional agricultural strategies through country-led coordination processes, consistent with the Accra Agenda for Action and leveraging the Comprehensive Framework for Action of the U.N. High Level Task Force on Global Food Security Crisis. The G8 and G20 Summits focused on addressing the global food security crisis. The G8 endorsed the CAADP for sub-Saharan Africa, while the G20 endorsed the L'Aquila food security initiative and proposed a World Bank Food Security Trust Fund. The Global Partnership was launched with support from countries like Belgium, Finland, Norway, and Switzerland committing $2 billion. The United States is also collaborating with private sector actors to enhance food security efforts. The U.S. food security initiative was discussed during Secretary of State Clinton's trip to Kenya, Angola, and Liberia in August 2009, as well as at various events including the Clinton Global Initiative and a food security event co-hosted with U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. The World Summit on Food Security in Rome in November 2009 saw 60 heads of state endorsing the Global Partnership to reduce hunger by half by 2015. The U.S. food security initiative aims to reduce chronic hunger, increase rural incomes, and improve child nutrition. Agricultural output needs to increase by 70% to feed a growing population. The Global Hunger and Food Security Initiative Consultation Document outlines these goals and emphasizes the commitment to providing emergency food assistance. The U.S. food security initiative aims to reduce chronic hunger, increase rural incomes, and improve child nutrition through a consultative process involving various stakeholders. The strategy focuses on advancing market-led growth in agriculture, reducing under-nutrition, and leveraging humanitarian assistance and social safety net programs. The U.S. food security initiative aims to reduce chronic hunger, increase rural incomes, and improve child nutrition through market-led growth in agriculture, under-nutrition reduction, and regional integration to support smallholder farmers in accessing markets and trade. The U.S. food security initiative aims to reduce chronic hunger, increase rural incomes, and improve child nutrition through market-led growth in agriculture. This includes investing in global innovation and research to adapt technologies for developing-country farmers, particularly in Africa, to address immediate and long-term needs in agricultural systems. The United States will expand support to the multilateral Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR) to benefit the world's poor. The curr_chunk focuses on mobilizing agricultural and environmental research to benefit women in the developing world, particularly those responsible for agricultural work. It aims to reduce under-nutrition by addressing the underlying causes and increasing the impact of humanitarian assistance for small-scale farmers. The Consultation Document emphasizes supporting small-scale farmers during emergencies through safety net programs and better coordination systems. It highlights the importance of country-led plans like CAADP for sustainable investments in food security and improved coordination among stakeholders. The United States sees the country-led process as crucial for enhancing coordination efforts. The United States supports country-led processes to improve coordination with global partners, focusing on strengthening countries' capacity to convene stakeholders and provide financing for regional coordinating mechanisms. The strategy also backs the G8 Global Partnership for Agriculture and Food Security to facilitate dialogue and track stakeholder commitments. Internal coordination is to be led by a U.S. Global Food Security Coordinator. The U.S. strategy for global food security, led by a U.S. Global Food Security Coordinator at the State Department, aims to leverage resources from multilateral institutions like the World Bank and African Development Bank for large-scale projects. The strategy also highlights the multi-donor trust fund at the World Bank as a key financing mechanism proposed at the 2009 Pittsburgh G20 Summit. The global community has committed $22 billion towards ensuring global food security over the next three years through a multi-donor trust fund at the World Bank. The strategy calls for measurable benchmarks, targets, and accountability, with investments in monitoring and evaluation systems for tracking progress. Flexibility is allowed to learn from mistakes, self-correct objectives, and share lessons learned with others. The Administration's food security initiative is still in the consultative process with no timeline announced for next steps. Consultation is ongoing with various stakeholders, including the U.S. government, other countries, international institutions, civil society organizations, and small-scale farmers. Input has been solicited from the public, and details are expected in the President's FY2011 budget for foreign affairs. Other relevant activities include a Presidential Study Directive on Global Development Policy and State initiatives. The Presidential Study Directive on Global Development Policy (PSD) and the State Department's Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review (QDDR) are expected to be completed by early 2010. The PSD authorizes a U.S. government-wide review of global development policy, led by key officials, and is set to be finished by January 2010. The PSD will assess the specific roles and advantages of U.S. in global development. The PSD and QDDR aim to review U.S. government agencies' roles in global development, develop effective development policies, and organize government efforts to achieve development objectives. The QDDR, led by the Secretary of State, aims to create a whole-of-government approach to development policy, set foreign policy and development objectives, recommend strategies to achieve them, and suggest tools and resources for implementation. The QDDR aims to contribute to the PSD by assessing how its recommendations fit into broader interagency approaches and the Administration's foreign policy framework. U.S. foreign assistance is seen as crucial to foreign policy, especially since 9/11, with global development now a key pillar alongside defense and diplomacy. Agricultural development is recognized as a significant driver of economic growth. U.S. assistance for agriculture has been a component of foreign aid since the 1960s, with agricultural productivity crucial for the development of the world's poorest countries. Funding levels for agricultural development in sub-Saharan Africa have varied over time, with a decline in the share of assistance from 13% in the 1980s to about 3% in 2006. The percentage of ODA going to agriculture declined from 20% in 1980 to about 3% in 2006. U.S. assistance for agriculture dropped from 11.4% in 1983-1984 to 2.3% in 2006. The United States' ODA for agriculture peaked at 20% in 1980 and fell to 5% by 2007. Agriculture regained attention in the late 1990s due to global focus on poverty and hunger in Africa. The Obama Administration plans to increase commitments to agricultural development and global food security initiatives, with over $5.5 billion provided to fight global hunger in FY2008 and FY2009. Congress plays a central role in funding and overseeing U.S. agricultural development and food security assistance, authorized by various laws. Congressional earmarks influence development assistance programs. Key bilateral and multilateral institutions deliver agricultural development assistance. Estimates of funding for activities in sub-Saharan Africa come from a recent report by the Partnership to Cut Hunger and Poverty in Africa. USAID is the primary U.S. development agency managing assistance programs for peace, security, governance, health, education, economic growth, and humanitarian aid. Agriculture is part of USAID's Economic Growth objective, supporting productivity, market-oriented systems, rural finance, agribusiness, producer organizations, and emerging markets. USAID funds agricultural development assistance through three separate budget accounts authorized by Congress: Development Assistance, P.L. 480 Title II, and Food for Peace Program. The DA account supports economic and social development, including agriculture, education, water, and sanitation. In FY2008, 40% of agricultural development programs were funded by the DA account, and in FY2009, $375 million of the $1.8 billion DA appropriation was earmarked for agricultural development. In FY2008, aid from the United States, including funds from P.L. 480 Title II and Economic Support Fund, supported agricultural development programs. The Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) also provides grants to developing countries with good governance for country-led solutions. The Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) provides assistance to developing countries with good governance for country-led solutions to reduce poverty through sustainable economic growth. MCC has approved 19 compacts totaling almost $4.4 billion, with over 50% of funding going to agriculture-related projects in sub-Saharan Africa. The USDA's Foreign Agriculture Service administers the Food for Progress food aid program, donating agricultural commodities to finance development projects in countries committed to free enterprise elements in their agricultural economies, primarily focusing on improving food security and agricultural productivity. In 2008, Food for Progress invested $175.2 million in food aid worldwide, with over half of the funds used for transportation to Africa. USDA also administers the McGovern-Dole International Food for Education and Child Nutrition Program, providing $91.5 million in food aid in FY2008. The USADF makes small grants to benefit marginalized communities in Africa, receiving $32 million in FY2009, with almost $10 million going to agriculture-related projects. The World Bank provides market-rate loans to reduce global poverty. The World Bank's mission is to reduce global poverty by providing market-rate loans to middle-income and creditworthy poor countries through the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and concessional loans and grants to the world's poorest countries through its International Development Association (IDA). IDA is funded by contributions from donor countries, including the United States. In 2008, about half of IDA's new commitments went to countries in sub-Saharan Africa, with a significant portion allocated to agriculture-related projects. Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs) support economic and social development in developing countries through market-rate loans, concessionary loans, and grants. MDBs like the African Development Bank, Asian Development Bank, Inter-American Development Bank Group, and European Bank for Reconstruction and Development aim to reduce poverty, improve living conditions, and promote economic growth. For instance, the African Development Bank's Africa Food Crisis Response provided $700 million to boost food production and alleviate macroeconomic pressures during a recent food crisis. The WFP, a UN agency, provides food aid in humanitarian situations and is increasingly involved in development activities to prevent hunger. It operates in 78 countries, reaching about 100 million people annually. The US is the largest contributor, providing over $2 billion in FY2008. In response to the global food crisis in 2008, WFP increased its assistance by approximately $1.2 billion, representing about 40% of total contributions. FAO, a U.N. membership organization, addresses hunger worldwide by providing knowledge and information services to help countries improve agricultural productivity. In FY2008, the United States contributed $93 million to FAO's $828 million budget. FAO launched an Initiative on Soaring Food Prices, appealing for $1.7 billion to address short-term needs, with $249 million mobilized by June 2009 from various donors including the European Union and the United States. IFAD, an international financial institution with 165 members, also plays a role in addressing global hunger. IFAD is an international financial institution with 165 member countries that aims to reduce rural poverty in poor countries through market-oriented, sustainable agriculture development. They provide low-interest loans and grants for about 200 programs in 116 countries, totaling $3.4 billion. In FY2008, IFAD committed $570 million globally, with the United States contributing $15 and $18 million in FY2007 and FY2008. In response to the food price crisis, IFAD's president announced a readiness to allocate up to $200 million from existing loans and grants to boost agricultural production in countries they already support. The 111th Congress faces various issues and policy options regarding U.S. foreign aid reform. Many experts are concerned about the lack of strong leadership at USAID, the primary U.S. federal agency for global development. Critics have pointed out a \"leadership vacuum\" at USAID, allowing other federal agencies to take on a larger role in development activities. This has led to criticism of a divided development approach among different agencies. Some critics question the divided development approach among federal agencies, expressing concerns about the lack of strong leadership at USAID. The appointment of Dr. Rajiv Shah as the new USAID Administrator raises questions about the Obama Administration's stance on USAID's authority and resources. Many in Congress and the development community are calling for the restoration of USAID's authority. Many in Congress and the development community are advocating for the restoration of USAID's authority and independence, questioning the role of the USAID Administrator in relation to the Secretary of State. The recent nomination has sparked concerns about a weakened USAID, while others see it as a sign of the Obama Administration's commitment to strengthening the agency. Strategic reviews like the QDDR and PSD are expected to clarify and potentially enhance USAID's role in shaping U.S. development assistance policy. Several senior government officials, including Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and former USAID Administrator Peter McPherson, have raised concerns about the decline in staff capacity at USAID over the past few decades. Secretary Gates highlighted the imbalance between military and civilian elements in national security, attributing it to a lack of capacity rather than willingness. He pointed out that key instruments of U.S. power abroad were reduced in the 1990s, affecting national security capabilities. The State Department froze hiring of new Foreign Service officers and USAID's staff has significantly decreased over the years. Testimony noted a decline in permanent foreign officers at USAID, resulting in reduced on-the-ground effectiveness and technical expertise loss. USAID has shifted from an implementation agency to one that outsources its foreign aid program. The USAID has transitioned from being an implementation agency to one that contracts out large portions of its foreign aid program. This shift has led to concerns about reduced coherence, effectiveness, flexibility, and leverage in the overall effort. Additionally, there are challenges in managing the agricultural development portfolio due to staff shortages and difficulties in overseeing numerous small projects. Land-grant universities have been involved in creating counterpart institutions in developing countries since the 1950s and 1960s, with further legislative support in 1975 through the Title XII amendment to the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961. The Collaborative Research Support Program (CRSP) is a flagship capacity-building program at USAID that supports theme-based agricultural research programs at U.S. universities. It aims to build sustainable capacity in developing countries' national agricultural research systems to address food insecurity and malnutrition globally. The Collaborative Research Support Program (CRSP) is a multi-disciplinary effort to tackle food insecurity and malnutrition in developing countries. It involves U.S. universities, national agricultural research systems, international research centers, and USAID. USAID provided $29 million in funding for CRSP activities in FY2008. However, USAID has reduced the focus on capacity building since the 1990s, leading to shorter project durations and less emphasis on research. The reduction of the CRSP training program in the 1980s has led to a loss of institutional capacity for training and work abroad for U.S. universities and partner institutions in developing countries. Some argue that CRSPs were not cost-effective and lacked accountability, while others believe in the long-term benefits of building institutional capacity. USAID recognizes the importance of long-term institutional building for aid effectiveness. USAID is moving towards strengthening institutional capacity for aid effectiveness, especially in agriculture. Questions remain about the institutional capacity in the US and developing countries, particularly in Africa, to implement agricultural programs effectively. Some believe that sub-Saharan Africa lacks a strong scientific foundation for modern agriculture and that long-term investments in science, technology, and training are needed to increase agricultural productivity. Several U.S. agencies, including USAID, State Department, USDA, MCC, Treasury Department, and USTR, are involved in agricultural development and food security assistance. Interagency coordination is seen as both a challenge and an opportunity to enhance global food security efforts. Lack of coordination is viewed as a major constraint to U.S. food security initiatives. The Chicago Council recommended creating an Interagency Council on Global Agriculture within the Executive Office of the President to provide leadership and maintain consistent priorities among U.S. government agencies in food aid and nutrition. The Government Accountability Office highlighted coordination issues between USDA and USAID in food aid provision. The establishment of a White House National Security Council deputy for global agriculture was also suggested for improved coordination. The need for interagency coordination in global development policy and addressing global hunger is highlighted by various recommendations and bills introduced in Congress. The United States engages in regular bilateral consultations with major donor governments and regional entities to make international aid more effective. It also plays a leading role in coordinating discussions within international bodies such as the United Nations, OECD, World Bank, and regional multinational lending bodies. The OECD, World Bank, and other multinational lending bodies, along with global summits sponsored by the United Nations, play a crucial role in donor coordination and establishing international development goals. Donors have worked to harmonize their strategies and activities to ensure aid is demand-driven and aligned with developing countries' priorities. This was agreed upon at the 2003 High-Level Forum on Harmonization and reiterated at the 2005 Paris High-Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness. Over 100 signatories endorsed the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness, committing to help developing countries with their national development plans. The 2008 High-Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness in Accra involved ministries, agencies, and organizations from both donor and developing countries, emphasizing a more active role for developing countries and NGOs. The Accra Agenda for Action introduced new principles for donor coordination, emphasizing predictability, country systems, conditionality, and untying aid. Developing countries and NGOs played a more active role in preparing for the meeting, which addressed global challenges like rising food prices and climate change. The Accra Agenda for Action introduced new principles for donor coordination, emphasizing predictability, country systems, conditionality, and untying aid. Donors will relax restrictions to allow developing countries to purchase goods and services freely. The U.S. government has shifted focus to implementing programs in line with the 2005 Paris Declaration, such as the Presidential Initiative to End Hunger in Africa administered by USAID. This initiative supports African ownership of development by backing African initiatives, institutions, and capacity building at national and regional levels, including the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Program (CAADP). The Administration's global food security initiative aligns with the Accra Agenda for Action, but some argue that aid reform is progressing slowly. In the FY2010 budget, food security was highlighted as a key area, with a focus on P.L. 480 commodity food aid and additional funding for disaster and famine assistance. Congress approved $1.69 billion for P.L. 480 food aid in the Agriculture budget. In the Agriculture appropriations bill (H.R. 2997), Congress approved $1.69 billion for P.L. 480 food aid. The House-passed Foreign Operations appropriations bill (H.R. 3081) allocated $200 million for international disaster assistance, $100 million less than requested. The President's FY2010 budget requested $1.36 billion for agricultural development assistance, while the House bill provides $1.0 billion. The Senate Foreign Operations bill (S. 1434) recommends $1.5 billion for agriculture and food security assistance, excluding disaster assistance funds for local and regional food aid purchases. The Administration's requests for funding for the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) have consistently been below the President's requests, causing concern among supporters. Funding levels for the MCC for FY2010 are still pending. At the L'Aquila summit, the President pledged support for the United States. At the L'Aquila summit, the President pledged $3.5 billion over three years for the Global Agriculture and Food Security Partnership. Skepticism exists about meeting the overall G8 commitment of $22 billion over three years. Several bills in the 111th Congress address global agricultural development and food security assistance. Several bills in the 111th Congress (S. 384, H.R. 3077, H.R. 2817, H.R. 2139, S. 1524) address U.S. food security and foreign assistance strategies. They aim to promote global food security, improve agricultural productivity, and support higher education and research in developing countries. The bills establish a Special Coordinator for Food Security to advise the President and allocate appropriations for agriculture, rural development, and nutrition programs. The bills S. 384 and H.R. 3077 focus on supporting biotechnology research in food, agriculture, forestry, and fisheries. They authorize the President to provide assistance for research, capacity building, agricultural development, and trade services. Funds would also support programs like the USAID Collaborative Research Support Program. The bills S. 384 and H.R. 3077 establish a U.S. Emergency Rapid Response to Food Crisis Fund for urgent food assistance needs. They allow for the purchase of food aid locally or regionally and provide funds for emergency non-food assistance. These bills aim to reduce global hunger and advance nutrition. H.R. 2817 establishes U.S. policy to reduce global hunger, advance nutrition, and increase food security. It aims to provide emergency response, increase resilience, build capacity for sustainable food production, ensure access to necessary nutrients, support small-scale farmers, and promote environmentally sound agricultural practices. The bill also creates a White House Office on Global Hunger and Food Security, with a Coordinator appointed by the President. The bill H.R. 2817 establishes a White House Office on Global Hunger and Food Security, with a Coordinator appointed by the President to develop and implement a comprehensive strategy to address global hunger and food security. The Coordinator will work with federal departments and agencies, hold weekly meetings, and submit biennial reports to Congress. The bill H.R. 2817 establishes a Permanent Joint Select Committee on Hunger and recommends $50.36 billion for federal programs addressing global hunger and food security. H.R. 2139 directs the President to develop a National Strategy for Global Development and a system to monitor U.S. foreign assistance effectiveness. H.R. 2139 aims to provide American taxpayers and foreign assistance recipients with access to U.S. foreign assistance information. It was introduced in April 2009 and referred to the House Committee on Foreign Affairs. S. 1524 amends the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to establish positions in USAID for policy and strategic planning, program design, evaluation, and budget management. It also creates a Bureau for Policy and Strategic Planning to focus on policy development, program evaluation, and resource allocation. S. 1524 directs the Administrator of USAID to develop a workforce strategy to reduce global poverty and establish career guidelines for officers. It also requires federal departments to provide accessible information on U.S. foreign assistance. Introduced in July 2009, S. 1524 focuses on promoting development and enhancing transparency in foreign assistance. S. 1524 was introduced in the Senate on July 28, 2009, and reported by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on November 17, 2009."
