    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Campus Fire Safety Right to Know Act\" and requires the disclosure of fire safety standards for campus buildings. The Higher Education Act of 1965 is amended to include a new subsection requiring eligible institutions to prepare and disclose fire safety reports annually starting in 2001. The Higher Education Act of 1965 was amended to mandate eligible institutions to annually publish a fire safety report for students, employees, and applicants. The report must include information on campus fire safety practices, statistics on fires and false alarms in the past two years, and details on fire safety systems in student housing facilities. The Higher Education Act of 1965 requires eligible institutions to annually publish a fire safety report detailing human injuries, structural damage, fire alarms, smoke alarms, fire escape planning, fire drills, and future fire safety improvements. The Secretary cannot mandate specific fire safety policies for higher education institutions participating in the program. Each institution participating in the program must report fires and false fire alarms to the campus community in a timely manner. They are required to maintain a log detailing all reported fires and false alarms, which must be open to public inspection. Additionally, an annual report must be submitted to the Secretary. Each institution in the program must report fires and false alarms promptly, maintain a public log of incidents, and submit an annual report to the Secretary. The Secretary reviews and shares the statistics publicly, identifies effective fire safety practices with input from higher education representatives, and defines \"campus\" as provided in subsection (f)(6). The Secretary of Education is required to report to Congress. The Secretary of Education must submit a report to Congress within a year of this Act's enactment. The report will include an analysis of fire safety systems in college and university facilities, recommendations for appropriate fire safety standards, cost estimates for updating nonconforming buildings, and input from experts and stakeholders. The Secretary will provide recommendations on meeting fire safety standards in college and university facilities, including funding methods."
