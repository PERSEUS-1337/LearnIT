    "content": "Section 137 amends part III of the Internal Revenue Code to address certain pensions and annuities under state or local retirement systems. The text discusses the exclusion of qualified governmental pension amounts from an individual's gross income, with a dollar limitation based on social security exclusion and other factors. The term 'qualified governmental pension' refers to pensions received from a State or local retirement system that are not attributable to certain types of employment or covered by a Social Security agreement. The social security exclusion amount limits the portion of such pensions that can be excluded from gross income. The social security benefits received are subject to certain limitations. Qualified governmental pensions exceeding the maximum benefit amount are not considered. The applicable maximum benefit amount varies based on filing status. The maximum individual social security benefit is the highest total amount that could be paid as old-age insurance benefits to an individual who is 65 years old and has filed for benefits. Marital status is determined under section 143 for this purpose. The maximum individual social security benefit is determined based on age and filing status. If an individual receives a qualified governmental pension for less than a full taxable year, their benefit will be reduced accordingly. State or local retirement systems refer to pension funds established by states or political subdivisions. The tax code is amended to redefine modified adjusted gross income and update the table of sections related to items excluded from income.
