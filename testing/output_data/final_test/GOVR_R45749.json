    "content": "The remnants of the Vietnam War and other regional conflicts have left mainland Southeast Asia heavily contaminated with unexploded ordnance (UXO). More than 45 years after the US bombing of Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam, civilians are still injured or killed each year by UXO. It is estimated that over 20% of the land in Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam is contaminated by UXO. The US has appropriated over $400 million to assist in clearing the land of UXO, with 77% of the assistance provided by the Department of State. The United States has provided treatment for individuals injured by unexploded ordnance (UXO) in Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam through USAID programs and the Leahy War Victims Fund. Efforts by the countries and international donors may take 100 years to clear the region of UXO, hindering economic development. President Obama pledged $90 million for UXO decontamination in Laos, and the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019 provides $196.5 million globally for conventional assistance. The Appropriations Act, 2019 (P.L. 116-6) allocates $196.5 million for conventional weapons destruction, including $159.0 million for humanitarian demining. Specifically, $3.85 million is designated for Cambodia, $30.0 million for Laos, and $15.0 million for Vietnam. Additionally, $13.5 million is provided for global health and rehabilitation programs under the Leahy War Victims Fund. The 116th Congress will need to consider further efforts to address the war legacy issue of unexploded ordnance (UXO) in mainland Southeast Asia, which could include decontamination and medical support for UXO victims. This aid may also improve bilateral ties with these countries. U.S. aid for war legacy issues in Laos, Vietnam, and Cambodia includes assistance for Agent Orange/dioxin contamination and unexploded ordnance (UXO) clearance. UXO refers to military ammunition that has failed to function as intended, such as mines, artillery shells, and rockets. This aid aims to improve bilateral relations with these nations. Cluster munitions, including artillery shells, rocket warheads, and aerial bombs, disperse smaller munitions that may fail to function as intended. Unexploded Ordnance (UXO) poses a highly unpredictable detonation risk due to factors like corrosion and arming mechanisms. UXO presents a danger to both combatants and civilians, with some items detonating upon movement while others may remain dormant. Military munitions are used in various combat scenarios. Military munitions, such as mines and cluster munitions, are used in combat scenarios to attack targets, establish barriers, and impede enemy movement. Cluster munitions can create large areas of destruction with fewer weapons needed. Mines pose a threat as they can be easily forgotten if not marked. Cluster munitions and mines, despite international protocols to limit their use, pose a hazard to people due to their explosive charge. The 1999 Ottawa Convention prohibits anti-personnel landmines, requiring their destruction within four years. The 2010 Convention on Cluster Munitions bans all cluster munitions. The United States has not signed the 2010 Convention on Cluster Munitions but is a States Party to the Convention on the Use of Certain Conventional Weapons (CCW) since 1995. In 2009, the US ratified Protocol V of the CCW, which covers explosive remnants of war and requires the government to clear such munitions. The United States has initiatives to limit hazards posed by unexploded ordnance (UXO) and has a policy on cluster munitions to minimize harm to civilians. Assistance may be requested for clearing munitions, but no state-party is obligated to provide help. The United States has a policy on cluster munitions to minimize harm to civilians. The revised policy allows combatant commanders to use cluster munitions with more than 1% unexploded submunitions in extreme situations. There is no deadline to replace these munitions, and they are to be removed only after new munitions are available. The new DOD policy allows for the procurement of cluster munitions meeting the 2008 UXO requirement or with advanced features to reduce risks. UXO in Southeast Asia, mainly from the Vietnam War, includes ground combat, emplaced mines, and air war with the US dropping a million tons of bombs on North Vietnam. The United States dropped over 8 million tons of bombs in Southeast Asia during the Vietnam War, leading to the rise of communist countries in Cambodia, Laos, and South Vietnam. Cambodia remains heavily contaminated with landmines and unexploded ordnance from decades of armed conflict. Cambodia and Laos are heavily contaminated with landmines and unexploded ordnance from past wars. In Cambodia, minefields are concentrated in the western region, while in Laos, UXO, including cluster munitions remnants, pose a significant threat to the population. Laos is considered the most heavily bombed country per capita in the world due to the Indochina wars of the 1960s and 1970s. Laos, Vietnam, and Cambodia are heavily contaminated with unexploded ordnance (UXO) from past wars. UXO, mostly of U.S. origin, remains a significant threat in Laos and Vietnam, while Cambodia is among the world's most UXO-afflicted countries. The contamination in these countries is a result of conflicts such as the Vietnam War and civil wars in the 1970s and 1980s. The United States conducted a carpet-bombing campaign on Cambodia in 1969, dropping 2.7 million tons of ordnance. Up to one-quarter of the cluster bomblets failed to explode, leading to over 64,700 UXO casualties in Cambodia since 1979, including over 19,700 deaths. Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen has occasionally criticized the U.S. bombing, but it has not been a major issue in recent U.S.-Cambodian relations. Since 1979, Cambodia has experienced over 64,700 UXO casualties, with more than 19,700 deaths. Despite a decrease in annual casualties, migration to heavily mined areas near the Thai border continues to pose risks. Cambodia has the highest number of amputees per capita globally, with 25,000 UXO-related amputees. The economic costs of UXO include hindrances to infrastructure development and disruptions to agriculture and water supplies. Open Development Cambodia reports that 580 square miles of land has been cleared of UXO since the early 1990s. Since the early 1990s, 580 square miles of land in Cambodia has been cleared of UXO. Estimates suggest that about 50% of contaminated land has been cleared, with 630 square miles still containing UXO. The U.S. government has contributed over $133.6 million for UXO removal, education, and survivor assistance programs in Cambodia, largely carried out by U.S. and international NGOs in collaboration with local organizations and the Cambodian government. The USAID's Leahy War Victims Fund has supported programs for Cambodian victims of UXO. Demining activities received NADR funding of $5.5 million in 2015 and 2016, $4.2 million in 2017, and $2.9 million in 2018. Global donors contributed over $132 million between 2013 and 2017 for clearance efforts. In 2018, the Cambodian government launched the National Mine Action Strategy (NMAS) to clear UXO from all contaminated areas by 2025, requiring $400 million for the clearance of 110 square kilometers per year. The NMAS estimated that Cambodia would need a little over 10 years to complete clearance of all known mined areas, costing about $400 million per year. Concerns arise due to declining international assistance, with a 61% decrease in demining support in 2017. The United States military dropped over 2 million tons of cluster munitions in Cambodia from 1964 to 1973, with an estimated one-third failing to explode. During the French colonial period and Laotian Civil War in the 1960s and 1970s, Laos was heavily bombed by the U.S. to disrupt North Vietnamese supply lines. Cluster munitions were extensively used due to their ability to penetrate jungle cover. Over one-third of Laos is still contaminated with unexploded ordnance (UXO), with the most affected areas being the northeastern and southern provinces. The northeastern and southern provinces of Laos were heavily bombed by the U.S. during the Laotian Civil War to disrupt North Vietnamese supply lines. Over 50,000 mine and ERW casualties have been reported in Laos since 1964, with an estimated 40% of victims being children. The Lao government has set targets to reduce UXO-related casualties, with reported casualties dropping to 41 in 2017. Cluster munitions have hindered economic development in Laos, with UXO contamination affecting one-quarter of all villages. Unexploded ordnance impacts agricultural production, mining, forestry, hydropower projects, and infrastructure development. Demining efforts and medical treatment expenses divert resources from other areas, leading to decreased productivity among UXO survivors. The presence of UXO is linked to poverty, and Laos requires $50 million annually for clearance, victim assistance, and education, with the government contributing $15 million. International aid also supports these efforts. The Lao government contributes $15 million towards education, with international assistance from countries like Japan, the United States, and the United Nations Development Program. The United States has provided $169 million for UXO clearance since 1995, making Laos the third largest recipient of such funding. In 2016, the US announced a $90 million increase in assistance for cluster munitions remnant survey and clearance activities. The US Department of Defense has been training Lao personnel in demining techniques since the early 1990s. The United States has been providing significant financial support for UXO clearance in Laos since 1996 through various programs and organizations. This assistance includes funding for mine clearance operations, training centers, and humanitarian aid for war victims. Laos has also received assistance from the USAID Leahy War Victims Fund for prosthetics, orthotics, and rehabilitation. In the 1990s and 2000s, UXO-related clearance programs were a key area of cooperation between the United States and Laos. President Obama's visit in 2016 included announcing a $90 million UXO aid package, emphasizing the moral obligation to help Laos heal from the past. War legacy issues like Agent Orange/dioxin contamination, MIAs, and UXO played a role in reestablishing diplomatic relations between the United States and Vietnam. Vietnam's efforts to locate and return the remains of U.S. MIAs were significant in developing a comprehensive partnership between the two nations. Vietnam's voluntary effort to locate and return the remains of U.S. MIAs played a significant role in restoring diplomatic relations with the U.S. Assistance in decontaminating Da Nang airport of Agent Orange/dioxin also contributed to the partnership. U.S. UXO assistance in Vietnam has helped establish trust between the two governments. The UXO in Vietnam are remnants from conflicts spanning over a century, with the majority believed to be from conflicts with France and the U.S. from 1945-1975. Estimates vary on the amount of unexploded ordnance (UXO) in Vietnam, with one source stating at least 350,000 tons and another claiming around 800,000 tons remain scattered across the country. The Vietnamese government estimates that between 6.1 and 6.6 million hectares of land in Vietnam, or 19% to 21% of the nation, is contaminated by UXO. The province of Quang Tri, along the previous demilitarized zone between North and South Vietnam, is the most heavily affected area. The province of Quang Tri, along the previous demilitarized zone between North and South Vietnam, is the most heavily contaminated with unexploded ordnance (UXO). Estimates on UXO casualties in Vietnam vary, with one source estimating at least 105,000 casualties since the war ended. The main circumstances leading to casualties were scrap metal collection, playing/tampering, and cultivating or herding. Vietnam's Ministry of National Defence established Office 701 to address the nation's UXO issue, working with individuals and organizations to decontaminate Vietnam of UXO for public safety and socio-economic development. The Vietnam National Mine Action Center and Center for Bomb and Mine Disposal Technology are key players in UXO clearance efforts. The Bomb and Mine Disposal Technology (BOMICEN) coordinates Vietnam's UXO clearance operations, setting up project management teams (PMTs) to identify and decontaminate UXO. The Mine Action Partnership Group (MAPG) enhances coordination of clearance efforts. International organizations like the Danish Demining Group (DDG) and Mines Advisory Group (MAG) also conduct UXO removal projects in Vietnam. In 2016, a $32 million, multi-year UXO project was initiated in Binh Dinh and Quang Binh provinces by KOICA, VNMAC, and UNDP. NGOs working in Vietnam face challenges collaborating with the MND due to restricted access to contaminated areas for surveying and decontamination. The lack of information sharing hinders efforts to establish a nationwide UXO database for refining clearance techniques. Since 1993, the United States has provided UXO and related assistance to Southeast Asia through various channels, including CDC, DOD, DOS, and USAID. Most assistance has been provided by DOS through NADR-CWD account. USAID assistance to Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam includes Leahy War Victims Fund programs. Laos, Cambodia, and Vietnam are the largest recipients of U.S. CWD funding in East Asia. In December 2013, the United States and Vietnam signed a Memorandum of Understanding. In December 2013, the United States and Vietnam signed a Memorandum of Understanding on cooperation to overcome the effects of wartime explosives in Vietnam. Department of State and USAID support demining and related assistance in Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam, working with international NGOs and local organizations in clearance, surveys, and medical assistance. In Laos, U.S. assistance includes clearance and survey efforts, medical and rehabilitation services, education and training assistance to victims and families, and mine risk education. In Vietnam, the United States provides mine clearance and survey support, capacity building programs, and medical assistance and vocational training for victims. DOD's role in remediating UXO in Southeast Asia falls under the category of \"Support to Humanitarian Mine Action (HMA).\" The DOD HMA program assists nations plagued by land mines and ERW through \"train-the-trainer\" programs. U.S. military personnel are restricted in actively participating in UXO activities due to U.S. Code regulations. The DOD HMA program provides humanitarian demining assistance in foreign nations, including detection and clearance of land mines and ERW. U.S. military personnel are restricted from physically engaging in demining activities under U.S. Code regulations. Under DOD policy, U.S. military personnel are restricted from physically engaging in demining activities unless it is for the concurrent purpose of supporting a United States military operation. U.S. law limits DOD to \"train-the-trainer\" type UXO remediation activities, with U.S. Indo Pacific Command overseeing activities in Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos. USARPAC is tasked with land-based UXO operations in Vietnam. In Vietnam, USARPAC is responsible for land-based UXO operations, while PACFLT handles underwater UXO operations. Accomplishments in FY2018 included training on IMAS Level I and II, EOD instructor development, medical first responder training, and ordnance identification. Plans for FY2019 and FY2020 include continuing IMAS training, developing training lanes for demining, increasing the Vietnamese medical first responder force structure, and EOD instructor development. In Cambodia, Marine Forces Pacific (MARFORPAC) is responsible for land-based UXO operations. Plans for FY2019 to FY2021 include training in IMAS EOD Level I, EOD instructor development, medical first responder training, ordnance identification, and IMAS Demining NTS/TS techniques. FY2020 will focus on enhancing capacity with IMAS EOD Level I and II training. In Cambodia, Marine Forces Pacific plans to develop capacity with IMAS EOD Level I and II training, Demining NTS/TS techniques, and increase the medical first responder force structure. FY2021 will focus on training in EOD Level II and III, advanced medical techniques, demolition procedures, mission planning, and instructor development. Laos: USINDOPACOM has tasked Marine Forces Pacific. In Laos, Marine Forces Pacific (MARFORPAC) is responsible for land-based UXO operations. Plans for FY2019-FY2021 include training on IMAS EOD levels, EOD instructor development, medical first responder training, ordnance identification, and capacity building. Plans for FY2020 include increasing knowledge on lane training development and medical first responder force structure. FY2021 will focus on training in advanced medical techniques and EOD levels. The U.S. government has been providing UXO-related assistance to Southeast Asia for over 25 years, with contributions amounting to over $400 million. Despite sustained support, it may take decades to clear Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam of UXO contamination. Legislation (H.R. 2097) would authorize $50 million annually from 2020 to 2024 to address the UXO issue in these countries. The legislation (H.R. 2097) authorizes $50 million annually from 2020 to 2024 for UXO clearance and humanitarian assistance in Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam. It also requires the President to provide annual briefings to relevant congressional committees on related activities. Funding levels for decontamination and victim assistance remain uncertain. The legislation authorizes $50 million annually from 2020 to 2024 for UXO clearance and humanitarian assistance in Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam. Questions arise about the equitable distribution of funding, coordination across U.S. agencies, and the focus on clearance over assistance to UXO victims. The U.S. government is considering increasing support for UXO victims in Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam beyond current assistance provided by the Leahy War Victims Fund. The amount and types of U.S. UXO assistance to these countries have implications for bilateral relations, with Vietnam seeing it as a significant factor in building normalized relations post-War. In Cambodia and Laos, UXO-related assistance has been a key area of cooperation, potentially impacting U.S. relations with these countries. The U.S. government is considering increasing support for UXO victims in Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam. This assistance has implications for bilateral relations, with Vietnam viewing it as crucial for normalized post-War relations. The Department of Defense aims to replace cluster munitions with a failure rate below 1%. Should the U.S. prohibit certain submunitions to reduce post-conflict UXO? Are there lessons from U.S. UXO assistance in Southeast Asia applicable to other regions? During the 115th Congress, legislation was introduced to address UXO issues, including the Unexploded Ordnance Removal Act and the Cluster Munitions Civilian Protection Act. These bills aimed to develop strategies for UXO removal in Iraq and Syria and prohibit the use of cluster munitions with a high unexploded ordnance rate."
