    "content": "The President submitted the fiscal year 2003 budget request to Congress on February 4, 2002. The House and Senate went through various stages of marking up and passing the bill (H.R. 5011) before finally accepting the conference report on October 11. The Senate adopted the conference report on October 11 for bill P.L. 107-249, an appropriations bill enacted during the 107th Congress. Defense authorization legislation (H.R. 4546) passed the House and Senate with amendments and conferees appointed. The Senate disagreed to the amendment and appointed conferees. Conferees met on September 5 and reported the bill to the House on November 12 (H.Rept. 107-772). The Defense Authorization Bill was enacted into law (P.L. 107-314) by the President on December 2, 2002. The military construction appropriations bill provides funding to enhance and maintain the Department of Defense's infrastructure, which is worth over $500 billion. The military construction appropriations bill funds facility sustainment, restoration, and modernization for the active Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force, and their reserve components, defense-wide construction, NATO Security Investment Program, military family housing operations, and Base Realignment and Closure account. This bill is part of annual legislation providing funding for national defense, along with the defense appropriations bill. The Department of Defense receives over 90% of national security spending, funded through the energy and water development appropriations bill. Authorization and appropriations bills are required for defense funds, with separate bills for military construction and national defense. The military construction appropriations process is intertwined with defense policy and funding debates. The separate military construction appropriations bill dates back to the late 1950s, with a surge in funding during the Korean War leading to a steady increase in military construction appropriations. The military construction appropriations process began in the late 1950s due to increased funding during the Korean War. Military construction appropriations fund infrastructure for defense agencies, with additional funding for minor construction and maintenance from the defense appropriations bill. Special accounts are included in the military construction appropriation for various purposes. Special accounts within the military construction appropriation fund functions ancillary to building military infrastructure. These funds can generally be obligated for up to five fiscal years, unlike most appropriations. The consideration of the military construction budget starts when the President's budget is delivered to Congress each year. Recent focus has been on funding improvements to military housing, workplaces, and installation infrastructure. The subcommittee hearings discussed leveraging funds through privatization of utility services and military family housing. The Department of Defense aimed to eliminate substandard military housing by FY2010 through private development. Congress authorized DOD to use \"alternative\" business practices in negotiations. Since 1996, Congress authorized DOD to use \"alternative\" business practices in negotiations with private contractors, leading to the Military Housing Privatization Initiative. Sixteen projects have been awarded, with 24,518 housing units underway and 41,503 units pending solicitation. DOD is considering extending privatization to improve unaccompanied housing. The privatization program aims to improve military housing, with a target set for FY2007. The FY2003 budget request for military family housing exceeds the previous year. The Defense Reform Initiative aims to transfer ownership of public utilities at military bases to private entities. Privatization contracts are expected to be awarded by September 30, 2003. Consolidation of overseas military facilities is being pursued to improve living and working conditions for personnel stationed abroad. Agreements have been made with Germany and Korea to close smaller installations and move personnel to larger bases. Construction projects are planned to increase capacity at Grafenwoehr, Germany. Similar plans are in place for Korea to close half of U.S. facilities over a 10-year period. The 10-year plan in the Republic of Korea aims to close half of the U.S. facilities and consolidate military personnel onto upgraded installations. Legislation passed by the 107th Congress authorizes a new round of military base realignments and closures, with criteria for selection and appointment of a BRAC review commission in FY2003. Environmental remediation on closed military bases from the 1995 BRAC round is ongoing under the Defense Environmental Restoration Program. The Department of the Army closed and conveyed 46% of the 1995 BRAC property by February 2002. Environmental remediation is cited as the main reason for delays in transferring more property. The goal is to transfer all 1995 BRAC property before the 2005 round, with a request for $545 million in FY2003 BRAC funds. Additional funding is recommended for BRAC Environmental Cleanup Acceleration Initiative to speed up the transfer of ownership of former military property to local authorities. The Department of Defense allocated $100 million for environmental cleanup sites, with $55 million to the Army, $55 million to the Navy, and $25 million to the Air Force. The Efficient Facilities Initiative included plans for base realignments and closures in FY2003, granting authority to convey title of federal property on military installations to non-federal entities. Congress authorized base realignment and closure (BRAC) and the Efficient Facilities Initiative (EFI) in the National Defense Authorization Act for FY2002. The Act established a procedure for a FY2005 BRAC round and allowed the service secretaries to nominate military installations for a pilot project to increase efficiency. No facilities have been nominated yet. Table 1 outlines the legislative steps for FY2003 military construction appropriations. The House Subcommittee on Military Appropriations held hearings on the budget request for construction and family housing requirements of the individual services. The House passed bill H.R. 5011 on June 27, 2002, which was received in the Senate on June 28. The Senate Committee on Appropriations Subcommittee on Military Construction also held hearings in March. The Senate passed bill S. 2709 on July 17, which was later substituted with H.R. 5011. Conferees met on October 8, and the House accepted the conference report on October 10. The Senate adopted the report on October 11, and the bill was sent to the President on October 18. The President signed the companion authorization bill, H.R. 4546, on October 23 as P.L. 107-249. The Military Construction Appropriation Act and the National Defense Authorization Act for FY2003 each contain over 700 line items, with more than 300 being adjusted during the legislative process. Tables 10 and 11 in the Appendix list the line items adjusted, showing the new budget authority requested by the President, appropriated in the House and Senate, and authorized in the final conference versions. The tables in the Appendix track changes in proposed legislation, such as a $38 million budget request for a construction project at Pueblo Depot, Colorado. Congress did not approve the funding, reallocating it under the Defense-Wide budget instead. Table 10 shows funding for Pueblo Depot under the Defense-Wide budget, with the House granting $38 million, the Senate passing $36.1 million, and both agreeing on the requested amount. The project was moved from the Army's budget to the Department of Defense. Another example is the Air Force's $13 million addition for the Graduate Education Facility at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. Table 11 can be used to review military family housing appropriations, with the first Army project being a housing unit in Stuttgart, Germany. The House approved the full $990 thousand, while the Senate reduced it to $500 thousand. The Senate reduced the military construction project funding to $500 thousand, while the appropriations conference and authorization did not include any funding. Key issues during legislative deliberations include overall and specific account funding levels, congressional additions to the budget request, military housing, and funding through the Defense Emergency Response Fund. The President's FY2003 budget requested $8.987 billion in new budget authority, $1.62 billion below the 2002 enactment, with additional requests through the Defense Emergency Response Fund. The Defense Emergency Response Fund (DERF) saw additional requests totaling $9.578 billion for House consideration, with an extra $122.5 million in Army DERF requests to be reviewed by the Senate. This brings the total Presidential budget request for FY2003 to $9.66 billion. The Senate is also expected to review a $200 million Army and Air Force Transformation Initiative for infrastructure support. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $10.62 billion in new military construction budget authority for FY2003, with significant changes in budget allocation. In FY2003, there were significant changes in budget allocation for military construction, with increases in funding for military family housing and general construction overseas to improve quality of life for personnel. The budget authority by location was detailed in Table 2 from various sources. In FY2003, there were significant changes in budget allocation for military construction, with increases in funding for military family housing and general construction overseas. The budget authority for domestic military construction projects in the United States saw noticeable reductions, particularly in the active duty and reserve components. Special accounts like BRAC and the NATO Security Investment Fund were also included in the budget. In FY2003, there were significant changes in military construction budget allocation, with decreases in funding for active duty and reserve components. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld and DOD Comptroller Dov Zakheim anticipated a reduction in military bases during the FY2005 BRAC round, leading to a decrease in construction funding offset by an increase in sustainment funds. In FY2003, sustainment funding increased by $267 million between FY2001 and FY2002. The expected increase for FY2003 was $6.089 billion, but DOD requested $6.488 billion, indicating an additional $398 million for maintaining existing property. Some Members have raised concerns about funding requests for the Army National Guard and Air National Guard. Since FY1989, Congress has consistently appropriated more than the Administration's requests for military construction funding for the National Guard and Reserve, with the gap between request and enactment growing considerably. Senator Christopher Bond noted that National Guard forces have traditionally been underfunded in construction requests submitted by the Pentagon. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees passed appropriations for Guard and Reserve construction exceeding the Administration's request. Military housing has been a prominent issue, with a goal to eliminate substandard housing by 2010 through various methods including partnering with private enterprise and increasing the Basic Allowance for Housing. Approximately one-third of military families currently live in government-owned housing. DOD and Congress initiated programs to improve military family housing, aiming to eliminate substandard housing by 2007. BAH compensation covered only 85% of off-base living costs, prompting efforts to increase funding for housing construction. The goal is to eliminate out-of-pocket expenses for on-base living by 2005. The House report for the Bob Stump National Defense Authorization Act directs DOD to report on housing privatization projects at military installations. The Administration's defense budget request includes a $20.1 billion Defense Emergency Response Fund for DOD to respond to emergencies. The Defense Emergency Response Fund (DERF) is a transfer fund used by DOD to respond to terrorism. The request includes $10.1 billion, with $594 million for military construction to enhance security at military installations. The House Appropriations Committee added $594 million to appropriate accounts. The DERF funding requested by the President is shown in the conference committee's recommendations. The DERF funding, as recommended by the conference committee, is detailed in Table 5 of the Omnibus Appropriations Act. Additional defense appropriations were included in Division M of the Senate amendment to H.J.Res. 2 of the 108th Congress. Amendments were made to the Military Construction Act for FY2003, including a provision limiting funds for Partnership for Peace Programs. Section 104 reallocates $18.6 million from Air Force military construction to Air Force Reserve construction, a 28% increase. Section 105 allows $15 million for land acquisition at Nellis Air Force Base to be transferred to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service for obligations under the Military Lands Withdrawal Act of 1999. The bill also amends the National Defense Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2003, including changes in reprogramming thresholds and limits on expenses/investments with Operation and Maintenance funds. Between FY1985 and FY1998, military construction funding declined steadily due to changing strategic environment, a shrinking military force, and base realignments. However, appropriations began to rise in FY1998 to replace outdated facilities and improve quality of life for military personnel. Administration requests for military construction funding continued to decline until additional appropriations were made, including transfers of defense appropriations and an additional $3.89 billion. Military construction funding declined until FY2000, then rose for FY2001 and 2002. DOD projects a triple increase in construction requests between FY2003 and FY2007. Congress has consistently added to Administration requests since FY1995, citing inadequate funding. The FY2003 request fell relative to FY2002, anticipating base realignments and closures in FY2005. The FY2003 military construction funding request is detailed in tables, showing a comparison to previous years. H.R. 4775, a bill for supplemental appropriations in 2002, does not include significant military construction funding. The Union Calendar (Calendar No. 289) bill was passed in the House on May 24, 2002, and then taken up by the Senate. The Senate made amendments to the bill, leading to a conference report being filed on July 19 (H.Rept. 107-593). The House agreed with the conference report on July 23, and the Senate also considered it. The House passed H.R. 5011 on a roll call vote (397-32) and the Senate agreed with a 92-7 vote. The bill was enacted by the President on August 2, 2002. H.R. 5011 is about making appropriations for military construction, family housing, and base realignment and closure for the Department of Defense for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2003. The House Committee on Appropriations Subcommittee on Military Construction held hearings and markups before the bill was reported and passed on a 426-1 vote. The Senate substituted the language of S. 2709 for that of H.R. 5011 and passed the amended bill with a 96-3 vote. Conferees met on October 8, and the House accepted the conference report on October 10 with a 419-0 vote. The Senate adopted the report unanimously on October 11, and the President signed the bill into law on October 23 as P.L. 107-249. The Senate passed the bill on October 23 as P.L.107-249. S. 2709 (Feinstein) was received by the Senate Committee on Appropriations Subcommittee on Military Construction in March. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $10.62 billion in new budget authority on June 27 for military construction. H.R. 5011 was amended by substituting the language of S. 2709 on July 18, 2002, and passed by the Senate. H.R. 4546 (Stump) authorized appropriations for FY2003 for military activities of the Department of Defense. The bill introduced on April 23, 2002, and referred to the Committee on Armed Services, underwent various subcommittee referrals and amendments related to military construction and base realignments and closures (BRAC). The full Committee considered the bill on May 1, 2002, and ordered it reported, rejecting a BRAC-stopping amendment. The bill was reported on May 3, 2002, and placed on the Union Calendar. A supplemental report was filed on May 6. On May 9, 2002, H.R. 4546 was debated, amended, and passed by recorded vote.
