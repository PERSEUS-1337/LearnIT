    "content": "On March 19, 2010, the FDA reissued a 1996 rule to reduce underage smoking and use of tobacco products. This rule was mandated by the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act of 2009, giving the FDA authority to regulate tobacco products. The new law limits underage access to tobacco, restricts advertising, and prohibits sales to those under 18. The FDA's tobacco rule, effective since June 22, 2010, prohibits selling tobacco products to those under 18, requires age verification, restricts vending machine sales, limits advertising to text-only in certain publications, bans brand-identified promotional items, and prohibits brand-name sponsorship of events. This report compares the current rule to previous attempts at regulation and the 1998 Master Settlement Agreement. The report discusses the First Amendment implications of the FDA's tobacco rule, which went into effect in 2010. It includes an analysis of court decisions related to advertising restrictions and updates on regulatory actions. FDA's initial attempts to regulate tobacco products in the 1990s aimed at reducing underage smoking and included restrictions on sale and distribution. The FDA's tobacco rule, implemented in 2010, aimed to restrict tobacco product sales to minors, limit marketing and advertising, and introduce new labeling requirements. The goal was to reduce access to tobacco products for minors and decrease positive advertising that appeals to them. While not directly addressing adult tobacco use, the rule was expected to lower overall consumption by reducing new teenage smokers who replace adult smokers. The FDA asserted regulatory jurisdiction over cigarettes and smokeless tobacco under the FFDCA by defining nicotine as a \"drug\" and cigarettes as a drug-delivery \"device.\" The agency considered nicotine's effects on the body, including addiction, stimulation, and sedation, and concluded that cigarettes and smokeless tobacco deliver nicotine into the body. Unlike drugs, medical devices are intended to affect the body's structure and function but do not achieve their primary purpose through ingestion. The FDA determined that tobacco products are combination products with both a drug and device component, choosing to regulate them under the device provisions of the FFDCA for greater regulatory flexibility. Drug and device manufacturers must demonstrate safety and effectiveness for FDA approval. The FDA regulates tobacco products under the device provisions of the FFDCA to ensure safety and effectiveness for FDA approval. Critics argued that banning tobacco products due to their harmful effects would lead to overwhelming healthcare system challenges and create a black market for potentially more harmful products. The FFDCA's device authorities impose mandatory controls on devices and manufacturers, including labeling, registration, and good manufacturing practices. The act also includes discretionary provisions for devices under certain circumstances, such as the restricted device provision allowing the FDA to regulate tobacco products for safety and effectiveness. The FDA implemented additional restrictions on tobacco access and advertising to prevent new users from becoming addicted due to the harmful effects of cigarette and smokeless tobacco. Tobacco companies filed a lawsuit against the FDA, arguing that the agency lacked the authority to regulate tobacco products without explicit therapeutic claims and that the FDA exceeded its statutory authority in regulating tobacco products as drugs or devices. The FDA faced legal challenges from tobacco companies regarding its authority to regulate tobacco products as drugs or devices. In a 2000 case, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of the tobacco companies, stating that Congress had not given the FDA jurisdiction to regulate tobacco products. The Court examined the FDA tobacco rule in light of precedents governing agency interpretation of statutes. Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc. established a two-step test for judicial review of agency interpretations. The Court, under Chevron step one, found that Congress had clearly intended to preclude the FDA from regulating tobacco due to its dangerous nature, thus avoiding the need to proceed to step two of Chevron. The Court held that Congress intended to exclude tobacco products from FDA jurisdiction, citing previous legislation supporting this decision. The dissent argued that tobacco products should be regulated by the FDA as they fall within the definition of drugs and devices and are intended to affect the body's structure and function. However, following the Brown & Williamson case, it was clear that the FDA lacked the authority to regulate tobacco without explicit Congressional authorization. The Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act was introduced in Congress to address this issue. The Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act (H.R. 1256) was introduced in Congress to grant FDA authority over tobacco products. It went through multiple reintroductions in different Congress sessions but faced challenges in passing. The Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act (H.R. 1256) was passed by Congress in 2009, granting FDA authority over tobacco products based on a public health standard. The Act allows FDA to regulate the sale, distribution, advertising, and promotion of tobacco products to protect public health. The FDA has the authority to regulate tobacco products for public health, including requiring changes in design and ingredients. Manufacturers need FDA approval to market new tobacco products, unless they are substantially equivalent to existing products. The FSPTCA allows manufacturers to introduce new tobacco products if they are substantially equivalent to existing products or considered minor modifications. Manufacturers must provide evidence for reduced-risk claims and meet FDA requirements for approval. Changes in labeling, advertising, and health warnings on tobacco products are also mandated. Beginning on June 22, 2010, more explicit health warnings will be displayed on smokeless tobacco products and advertising. FDA has the authority to adjust the warnings for better public understanding. The FSPTCA also mandates restrictions on the sale, advertising, and marketing of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco. Manufacturers, distributors, and retailers are responsible for ensuring compliance with these regulations. The FSPTCA mandates restrictions on tobacco product labeling and advertising. Retailers must ensure compliance with the rule's provisions, including removing non-compliant displays. FDA has new authority to regulate tobacco product labeling and advertising, with adjustments to warnings for better public understanding. The original rule's labeling provisions were dropped, and definitions of key terms were updated. The FSPTCA instructed FDA to consider modifications to the original rule's ban on outdoor cigarette and smokeless tobacco advertising within 1,000 feet of schools and playgrounds to address First Amendment case law, including the 2001 U.S. Supreme Court decision in Lorillard Tobacco Co. v. Reilly. The reissued final rule does not include the outdoor advertising ban. The final rule does not include the outdoor advertising ban. FDA has reserved a section for future rulemaking on outdoor advertising restrictions and requested public comment on more narrowly tailored options. Retail establishments must provide training to employees on the new regulations, with FDA planning to publish guidance for compliance and enforce retailer compliance through inspections. FDA will contract with states for inspections but will conduct its own inspections in the interim. The FDA has enforcement tools to address retailer noncompliance with tobacco regulations, including civil penalties, warning letters, injunctions, and criminal prosecution. In 2009, tobacco companies sued the FDA over free speech rights, leading to a court ruling in 2010 that struck down a provision limiting advertising in publications with youth readership. The FDA rule expands on restrictions agreed upon by tobacco companies. The 1998 Master Settlement Agreement (MSA) imposed restrictions on youth access, marketing, and advertising by tobacco companies. Attorneys general from 46 states, DC, and five U.S. territories signed the MSA to settle lawsuits over public health costs. The MSA required tobacco companies to pay approximately $200 billion over 25 years, with ongoing payments. The FDA rule expanded on MSA restrictions by reinstating a 20-cigarette pack size minimum and banning free items. The FDA rule expands on the MSA restrictions by restoring the 20-cigarette pack size minimum and banning free samples of cigarettes. It also introduces new restrictions on retailers, brand-name sponsorship of events, tobacco labeling, and advertising in youth-oriented publications and audio/video ads. However, it does not include a ban on outdoor tobacco advertising near schools or playgrounds. The FDA is seeking public comment on outdoor advertising restrictions for tobacco products, which raises constitutional questions on commercial speech. Modifications to a ban on outdoor advertising near schools are being considered in light of First Amendment case law. The U.S. Supreme Court's decisions on commercial speech regulation are relevant to legal challenges against the reissued tobacco rule. The FDA is considering outdoor advertising restrictions for tobacco products, which raises constitutional questions on commercial speech. The regulations must meet specific criteria to be protected by the First Amendment, including lawful activity, truthfulness, government interest, direct advancement of that interest, and a reasonable fit between restrictions and objectives. The agency's 1996 tobacco rule included advertising restrictions aimed at reducing underage smoking and smokeless tobacco use to withstand a constitutional challenge. The FDA's 1996 rule on tobacco advertising restrictions faced constitutional challenges, but the Supreme Court did not address the rule's marketing restrictions in FDA v. Brown & Williamson. The Court later found Massachusetts state regulations on tobacco advertising to be unconstitutional in Lorillard Tobacco Co. v. Reilly. The Supreme Court found Massachusetts state regulations on tobacco advertising, including outdoor advertising restrictions, to be unconstitutional as they excessively limited free speech rights and failed to meet the Central Hudson test. The restrictions were deemed too broad and would effectively ban the communication of truthful information about smokeless tobacco and cigars to adult consumers. The Supreme Court ruled Massachusetts' tobacco advertising regulations unconstitutional due to excessive limitations on free speech rights. The restrictions were found too broad, preventing the communication of truthful information about smokeless tobacco and cigars to adult consumers in major metropolitan areas. The Court's decision in Lorillard may influence future considerations of FDA's outdoor advertising provisions. The Supreme Court found Massachusetts' outdoor advertising regulations unconstitutional for being too broad and not carefully calculated, leading to a near complete ban on truthful information about smokeless tobacco and cigars in major metropolitan areas. The Supreme Court criticized Massachusetts' outdoor advertising regulations for being too broad and not carefully calculated, leading to a near complete ban on truthful information about smokeless tobacco and cigars. The Court found that the regulation did not demonstrate a careful calculation of speech interests and was not sufficiently tailored to prevent minors' access to tobacco. The Court also referenced the FDA's proposed 1996 outdoor advertising regulation in dicta. The FDA's 1996 final rule on outdoor tobacco advertising faced criticism for its lack of tailoring to different communities, particularly urban areas. The agency aimed to restrict advertising within 1,000 feet to protect children from exposure to tobacco messaging. The FDA's reissued tobacco rule faced challenges from tobacco companies, with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit issuing a mixed ruling on its provisions. The court struck down some advertising restrictions while upholding others. The U.S. Court of Appeals ruled that the FSPTCA's ban on color and graphical advertising violated tobacco companies' First Amendment rights. The court suggested targeting specific advertising practices appealing to youth instead of implementing a blanket ban on color and imagery in tobacco advertising. The court of appeals concluded that the ban on color graphics and text in tobacco advertising failed the fourth prong of the Central Hudson test as it was more extensive than necessary. The court upheld most restrictions on tobacco advertising but struck down the ban on \"continuity programs.\" The district court did not address outdoor advertising restrictions, which were not appealed by the cigarette companies. The district court did not address outdoor advertising restrictions, which were not appealed by the cigarette companies. The court held that a challenge to the outdoor advertising ban was not yet ripe for review under the FSPTCA. The validity of the reissued tobacco rule's outdoor advertising restrictions will depend on modifications issued by the FDA. In the context of Central Hudson, Lorillard, and Discount Tobacco, an unconditional restriction on advertisements within 1,000 feet of a school or playground may not pass the Central Hudson test. The regulation must not be more extensive than necessary to serve the government interest. Any modification to the outdoor advertising provision needs to balance the FDA's interest in protecting children from tobacco products with the tobacco companies' right to advertise. The FDA reissued a final rule on tobacco advertising, removing the outdoor advertising ban and reserving a section for future rulemaking on outdoor advertising restrictions. They are considering various options to alter the 1996 outdoor advertising provision. The FDA reissued a final rule on tobacco advertising, considering changes to the outdoor advertising provision, such as limiting billboard restrictions near schools and creating a sliding scale regulatory scheme. Public health experts believe legal constraints limit the effectiveness of tobacco advertising restrictions. Tobacco advertising restrictions must balance between being narrowly tailored for effectiveness and not overly extensive to fail parts of the Central Hudson test."
