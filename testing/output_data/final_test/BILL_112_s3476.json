Child and youth homelessness has increased by 38 percent since 2006, with a 44 percent rise in homeless children served by Head Start programs. Among homeless children in HUD shelters, 50 percent are under 5 years old. A 2010 study found that high-quality care in early years leads to better academic and cognitive outcomes at age 19. Homelessness negatively impacts child development, leading to more instances of developmental delay, learning disabilities, and health problems compared to low-income peers in stable housing. Homeless families face obstacles like residential instability, mobility issues, documentation requirements, and lack of transportation when accessing child care services. Homeless families are also less likely to receive government financial assistance for child care. Without child care, homeless parents of young children struggle to search for employment, maintain employment, and enter job training programs. Many parents, including domestic violence survivors, are limited by a lack of child care, with 29 percent of domestic violence survivors in shelters indicating a need for help with child care. Congress should enact policies to increase homeless families' access to and continuity in child care, similar to successful policies for homeless children's access to education programs. Policies to increase homeless families' access to child care will help parents maintain employment, regain housing, and support vulnerable children. The purpose of this Act is to ensure access to high-quality child care for homeless children and families.
