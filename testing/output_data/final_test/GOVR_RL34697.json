    "content": "The U.S. military justice system has jurisdiction over criminal cases under the UCMJ and the Constitution. Military courts can try individuals connected to the armed forces for specific crimes. The system is separate from civilian courts, with different rules and limited application of constitutional safeguards. Appellate review is also distinct within the military justice system. Military courts have jurisdiction over criminal cases under the UCMJ and the Constitution, trying individuals connected to the armed forces for specific crimes. Appellate review is distinct within the military justice system, with limited Supreme Court jurisdiction for military cases. Companion bills in Congress aimed to broaden the Supreme Court's authority for military cases. The UCMJ, governed by Article I, sec. 8 of the Constitution, grants military courts jurisdiction over officers, enlisted servicemembers, and other individuals connected to the military. This jurisdiction extends to cases involving retired servicemembers receiving military benefits, specified reserve unit members, enemy combatants, and individuals with ties to military operations. Questions remain about military courts' power over retired servicemembers, but it is clear that jurisdiction applies to military veterans with current military connections. Military courts have jurisdiction over veterans with current military connections, allowing them to be tried for a range of offenses under the UCMJ, including crimes not related to official military duties. This includes unique military crimes like unlawful enlistment and desertion, as well as common law crimes such as murder and robbery. Appeals can be made to the U.S. Supreme Court at the end of the process. The UCMJ establishes military courts and appellate procedures for military cases. After a court-martial, cases undergo various stages of review within the military justice system, with a convening authority overseeing the process and having the discretion to modify sentences. Appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court is allowed in specific circumstances at the end of the process. Under the UCMJ, convening authorities have substantial discretion to modify sentences and findings. Courts of Criminal Appeals provide legal review of military cases and review cases involving serious convictions or penalties. Each branch of the armed services has its own Court of Criminal Appeals, comprised of panels of military judges established by the Judge Advocate General for each branch. The United States Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces (CAAF) is the final opportunity for appellate review within the military court system. It is an Article I court comprised of civilian judges appointed by the President. The CAAF has discretion to grant or deny appeals, similar to the U.S. Supreme Court. However, it must accept appeals in cases involving affirmed death sentences or when a Judge Advocate General sends a case to the CAAF. The CAAF's appellate review is limited to cases involving affirmed death sentences or when a Judge Advocate General sends a case for review after a final Court of Criminal Appeals decision. Appeals must involve issues heard by a court-martial and affirmed or denied by a convening authority and the relevant Court of Criminal Appeals. The CAAF cannot hear appeals based on the All Writs Act unless they aid direct review of court-martial decisions. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the CAAF exceeded its jurisdiction by granting injunctive relief to a servicemember without reviewing a court-martial decision. The Court emphasized that the CAAF does not have continuing jurisdiction over actions administering sentences. The U.S. Supreme Court has jurisdiction to grant certiorari in specific circumstances for appeals from the CAAF, including cases involving death sentences, certifications by Judge Advocates General, petitions for review, and cases where relief is granted by the CAAF. This limited jurisdiction extends to military cases that the CAAF has also reviewed. The CAAF's discretion over appeals serves as a gatekeeper for military appellants' access to Supreme Court review. Unlike criminal appellants in Article III courts, military courts operate separately with distinct trial procedures and limited interaction with the U.S. Supreme Court. In military cases, jurisdictional authority is under Article I, not Article III, leading to differences in safeguards for defendants. While military defendants have due process rights under the Fifth Amendment, the Supreme Court has narrowed these rights in military court contexts. Article III court interpretations do not always bind Article I courts, with only U.S. Supreme Court rulings binding military courts. Military courts may even reject Supreme Court precedents, as seen in United States v. Marcum. The Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces (CAAF) diverged from Supreme Court precedent in the Marcum case, stating that constitutional protections may apply differently to members of the armed forces. While constitutional rights generally apply to military members, they may not when they are plainly inapplicable by text or scope. Article III courts are not bound by military court decisions, but the Supreme Court may find CAAF decisions or UCMJ provisions persuasive. The Supreme Court may consider CAAF decisions or UCMJ provisions as potentially persuasive, as seen in the case of Kennedy v. Louisiana. The Court held that the Eighth Amendment prohibits the death penalty for child rapists who did not cause the child's death. Louisiana argued that a recent UCMJ amendment allowing the death penalty for child rape in military cases undermined the Court's decision, but the Supreme Court reaffirmed its ruling with minor changes. The Supreme Court reaffirmed its decision in Kennedy v. Louisiana, disagreeing with Louisiana's interpretation of the death penalty language in the UCMJ amendment. The case of United States v. Stevenson raised questions about military courts' jurisdiction over retired servicemembers and the Supreme Court's jurisdiction to review legal questions when the CAAF denied review. The U.S. Supreme Court's jurisdiction over cases reviewed by the CAAF is unclear, particularly regarding issues the CAAF declined to address. In the case of United States v. Stevenson, a man on the Navy's temporary disability retired list was investigated by NCIS officials while receiving treatment at a VA hospital and convicted for rape by a military court-martial. The CAAF remanded the case for fact-finding on blood draws taken at the VA hospital, and after the Navy-Marine Corps Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed the decision, the CAAF granted a second review limited to potential Fourth Amendment violations. The CAAF limited the issues on appeal to potential Fourth Amendment violations, declining to review the question of military court jurisdiction over a man on the temporary disability retired list. The Supreme Court declined to hear the case, as the CAAF had declined to review the issue of military courts' jurisdiction over such cases. On remand to the Navy-Marine Corps Court of Criminal Appeals, for the second time, the court set aside both decisions. The Navy-Marine Corps Court of Criminal Appeals set aside findings and sentence for a rehearing. Bills in Congress aimed to expand Supreme Court jurisdiction over military cases. Senator Feinstein introduced S. 357 to give U.S. service personnel the right to appeal to the Supreme Court in military cases. H.R. 569, reported to the House in 2010, included language authorizing the Supreme Court to set time limits for appeals from the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces (CAAF). The Supreme Court's authority to establish rules will be effective upon the act's enactment. There has been no similar legislation introduced in the 112th Congress. Courts recognize the need for a separate military justice system, emphasizing discipline and obedience in the armed forces. The military's interest in disciplining servicemembers based on rank raises questions about access to Supreme Court review, especially for former members or crimes under both military and civilian laws. Military cases undergo a unique appellate review process, including appeals to Courts of Criminal Appeals for each armed forces branch. The unique appellate review process for military cases includes automatic appeals to Courts of Criminal Appeals for each armed forces branch, potential discretionary review by the highest military court (CAAF), and review by the U.S. Supreme Court in limited circumstances. Legislative proposals in the 111th Congress aim to expand Supreme Court jurisdiction over military cases, allowing review even if the CAAF denies an appeal. This would address the issue highlighted by United States v. Stevenson regarding the Supreme Court's jurisdiction over specific issues declined by the CAAF."
