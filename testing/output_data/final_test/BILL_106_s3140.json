The \"Kentucky National Forest Land Transfer Act of 2000\" finds that the United States owns land and mineral rights in the Daniel Boone National Forest, acquired by the Tennessee Valley Authority for power production. The management should follow national forest laws, and the Authority should be compensated for transferred rights. The Act aims to transfer jurisdiction over Tennessee Valley Authority land in Daniel Boone National Forest to the Secretary of Agriculture and compensate for the transfer. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. The term \"covered land\" refers to all Tennessee Valley Authority land within Daniel Boone National Forest in Kentucky, excluding land used for water, gas, or power transmission. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Agriculture. SEC. 4. TRANSFER OF ADMINISTRATIVE JURISDICTION OVER COVERED LAND. All covered land is transferred to the Secretary's jurisdiction to be managed according to National Forest System laws. The Secretary of the Interior retains authority over mineral resources, including laws on mineral leasing and the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act. Surface mining on covered land is restricted, except as allowed under specific provisions. The Secretary of the Interior will provide the Tennessee Valley Authority with $4,000,000 in monetary credits for mineral, oil, gas, or geothermal leases. This can be used for up to 50% of payments in the contiguous 48 States and up to 10% in Alaska. The Secretary of the Interior will accept credits for mineral, oil, gas, or geothermal leases in Alaska and the contiguous 48 States. The credits can cover up to 50% of payments in the contiguous 48 States and up to 10% in Alaska. The total amount of credits provided shall be equal to the fair market value of the land. The credits accepted by the Secretary of the Interior for mineral, oil, gas, or geothermal leases will be used in the same way as cash payments. The use of credits must comply with relevant laws and regulations. Accepted credits will be considered as money received for specific purposes under existing acts. Additionally, an exchange account will be established by the Secretary of the Interior within 60 days of the Act's enactment. The Secretary of the Interior will establish an exchange account for the Tennessee Valley Authority with an initial balance of $4,000,000 in credits. These credits can be used by the Authority for specified purposes. The Secretary will adjust the balance to reflect accepted credits. Transfer or sale of credits is also allowed. The Tennessee Valley Authority may transfer or sell credits to another qualified person or entity for use in mineral, oil, or gas leases under specific acts. The Tennessee Valley Authority must notify the Secretary of the Interior within 30 days of transferring or selling credits. The validity of the transfer or sale is contingent upon this notification. Unused credits from the terminated account must be used within 5 years of establishment. Unused credits from the terminated account must be used within 5 years of establishment, or they will expire. SEC. 6. EXISTING AUTHORIZATIONS. This Act does not affect existing rights under any lease, permit, or authorization by the Tennessee Valley Authority on covered land. Renewal of existing authorizations is at the discretion of the Secretary. SEC. 7. COMPLIANCE WITH ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS. The term \"environmental law\" in this section refers to all applicable Federal, State, and local laws related to protecting human health, natural resources, and the environment, including specific acts like the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 and the Clean Air Act. The Clean Air Act, Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, Toxic Substances Control Act, Safe Drinking Water Act, National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, and Endangered Species Act of 1973 are all environmental laws that regulate hazardous substances, pollutants, contaminants, releases, and response actions. The Tennessee Valley Authority must provide documentation of the environmental condition of the covered land to the Secretary within 60 days of the enactment of the Act. Additional information must be provided as it becomes available. The Tennessee Valley Authority must assess and provide documentation of any required environmental actions on covered land to the Secretary within 120 days of the Act's enactment. If action is needed, a memorandum of understanding will be created for prompt completion of the required actions. The Tennessee Valley Authority must provide documentation to the Secretary showing completion of required environmental actions on covered land, including response actions for hazardous substances. The transfer of land under this Act does not relieve the Authority of its responsibilities and liabilities under environmental laws. The Tennessee Valley Authority has access to necessary property to fulfill responsibilities and liabilities. The Secretary can impose additional terms to protect the US interests. This Act does not affect anyone's responsibilities under environmental laws. Federal agencies conducting operations on covered land leading to the release of hazardous substances must cover costs for response and remediation actions related to petroleum products or derivatives under environmental laws."
