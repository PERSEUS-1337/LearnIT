This paper explores RNN applications in Incident Detection, Fraud Detection, and Android Malware Classification. Through experiments on different network parameters and structures, the best performing architecture is identified. RNN outperforms classical machine learning algorithms by extracting underlying features and characteristics of the data, leading to higher accuracy. Malware poses a significant threat in today's data world, with cyber-crimes on the rise. Hackers exploit vulnerabilities to steal valuable data, passwords, and information, especially on the Android platform. Attacks can come through various means like emails, software, and more. Criminals use sophisticated algorithms to avoid detection, emphasizing the need for effective security systems. Malware attacks are a major security threat in cyberspace, with hackers constantly developing new techniques to evade detection by antivirus software. Security solution companies are turning to deep learning and machine learning to predict and prevent these attacks. Email address: harishharunn@gmail.com (Mohammed Harun Babu R) Recent research is focused on using machine learning algorithms to detect new and upcoming malware, including polymorphic and metamorphic malware. Deep learning approaches have shown success in various AI challenges and are now being applied in cybersecurity for detecting cyber attacks by learning from security data. The efficiency of SVM and RNN machine learning techniques is being evaluated in this paper. In this paper, the efficiency of SVM and RNN machine learning algorithms for cybersecurity problems is evaluated. The paper discusses related work, background knowledge of RNN, proposed methodology, data set description, and results. It also covers cybersecurity use cases such as Android Malware Classification, Incident Detection, and Fraud Detection. The most commonly used approach for Malware detection in Android devices is the static and dynamic approach. The static and dynamic approach is commonly used for malware detection in Android devices. Static analysis is preferred for low computational cost and resource utilization, while dynamic analysis can detect metamorphic and polymorphic malware. BID4 evaluated traditional ML algorithms for malware detection without using API calls and permissions as features. MalDozer proposed using API calls with a deep learning approach for Android malware detection. API calls provide schematic information to understand the app's intention indirectly. In BID5, embedding techniques are used to extract API calls in DEX assembly for effective malware detection on neural networks. Security issues in cloud computing are briefly discussed in BID7, while BID8 proposes ML-based anomaly detection for network, service, and work-flow layers. A hybrid of machine learning and rule-based systems is used for intrusion detection in cloud infrastructure in BID9. BID10 shows Incident Detection outperforming intrusion detection, and BID11 explores traditional ML classifiers for detecting credit card and financial frauds. Credit card fraud detection using Convolutional Neural Networks is discussed, along with Fraud Detection in crowd sourcing projects in BID12. Statistical Fraud Detection methods are trained to differentiate fraudulent and non-fraudulent activities in credit card frauds. In BID15, a detailed survey is conducted on Fraud Detection in online e-commerce transactions using Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). The risks and trust involved in the e-commerce market are studied in BID16. An android classification task is discussed in BID17, where a dataset of APK files collected from the Opera Mobile Store is used for training and testing. In BID17, a dataset of 61,730 APK files was divided into 30,897 files for training and 30,833 files for testing. The tasks included incident detection and fraud detection using anonymized data. Experiments with varying learning rates showed the highest accuracy at 0.01, with potential for further improvement by extending the number of epochs. For Task Two and Task Three, experiments were conducted using RNN networks with 1 to 6 layers to find the optimal structure for the input data. Each experiment was run for 700 epochs, with most architectures learning normal patterns within 400 epochs. Malicious data required more epochs to learn, with complex networks needing more iterations for accuracy. The best-performing network topology was identified for each use case. The best-performing network topology for each use case was determined through experiments using RNN networks with 1 to 6 layers. The 6 layer RNN network showed good performance for Task One compared to the 4 layer RNN, leading to its selection for further experiments. The proposed RNN architecture includes an input layer with six hidden layers and an output layer, with varying numbers of neurons for each task. The detailed structure and configuration of the network are provided in TAB2. The proposed Recurrent Network architecture includes recurrent layers, fully-connected layers, batch normalization layers, and dropout layers with self-connection units for carrying previous time step information. Dropout and Batch Normalization are used for regularization and to prevent overfitting during training. The final fully connected layer uses sigmoid activation for Task One and Task Two, and softmax for Task Three for classification. The proposed Recurrent Network architecture includes recurrent layers, fully-connected layers, batch normalization layers, and dropout layers with self-connection units for carrying previous time step information. The final fully connected layer uses sigmoid activation for Task One and Task Two, and softmax for Task Three for classification. The prediction loss for Task One and Task Two is estimated using binary cross entropy, while Task Three uses categorical-cross entropy. The model was evaluated against SVM on 3 different cybersecurity use cases. The proposed RNN model is evaluated for cybersecurity use cases such as Android malware classification, incident detection, and fraud detection. Results are displayed in TAB3."
