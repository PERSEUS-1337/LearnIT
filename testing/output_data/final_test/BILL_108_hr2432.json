Congress established the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) in 1980 to reduce the paperwork burden on the public. In 2002, OIRA estimated the burden at 7.7 billion hours and $230 billion in cost, with the IRS responsible for 83% of it. Despite government goals to reduce paperwork, the burden increased from 1996 to 2001. In 2002, the paperwork burden on Americans increased, with the IRS imposing over 80% of it. The Office of Management and Budget needs to focus on identifying and reviewing IRS paperwork to reduce the burden.
