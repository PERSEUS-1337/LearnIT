    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Providing Real Outreach for Veterans Act of 2008\" or the \"PRO-VETS Act of 2008\". It aims to share information to improve veterans' access to benefits. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs will enter an agreement with the Secretary of Defense to transfer data for providing individualized information about veterans benefits. The agreement will specify criteria for identifying Department of Defense data that can be used by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs will enter an agreement with the Secretary of Defense to transfer data efficiently for determining eligibility and likelihood of veterans benefits. The agreement will specify an electronic data transfer method for the identified criteria. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs will transfer data to the Secretary of Defense to determine eligibility for veterans benefits. The criteria for transfer include members scheduled for discharge or separation from service and those not covered under clause (i). The initial list of benefits available must be generated within 7 days. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs compiles a list of veterans benefits for eligible members within 7 days of receiving data. The list is updated annually with new information. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs compiles a list of benefits for eligible members annually using available information. Notifications are sent to members or veterans regarding the benefits and application procedures. If a member of the Armed Forces or veteran does not apply for listed benefits within 60 days of receiving the initial notice, a second notice will be sent. If they still do not apply within a year, subsequent annual notices will be sent by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs. The Secretary will send a subsequent notice to a member or veteran or their legal representative if they have a high probability of being eligible for veterans benefits based on updated information. If the Secretary identifies a member or veteran with a high probability of eligibility based on available data, a notice will be sent to them or their legal representative. The Secretary will send a notice to a member or veteran who is likely eligible for a veterans benefit if they have not applied for it and have not been informed about it previously. The notice will include information about the benefit, an explanation, and a summary of any relevant provisions of law. The Secretary will send a notice to eligible members or veterans about a veterans benefit, including an explanation and application requirements. Recipients have the option to decline further notices. The Secretary may not send any further notices under this section to a member or veteran who declines notices. Notices will be sent by mail and electronically if the Secretary has the contact information. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs will use data received to simplify the application process for veterans benefits by prepopulating application forms with relevant information. The Secretary may require confirmation of data from Armed Forces members or veterans for eligibility for veterans benefits. When evaluating eligibility, the Secretary reviews a compiled list of benefits and discloses information if high probability of eligibility is determined. The Secretary informs eligible members or veterans of benefits they did not apply for and records the disclosure for at least 5 years. The Secretary must notify veterans of benefit denials within 30 days and provide an explanation. Within 5 years of the Act's enactment, the Secretary of Defense must transfer relevant data to the Department of Veterans Affairs. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs must comply with other laws related to veterans' benefits. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs must implement the section without conflicting with processes for transitioning Armed Forces members to the Department of Veterans Affairs. The Secretary of Defense must allow members to decline data transfer authorization. The member or veteran shall be treated as authorizing data transfer until they decline it. Data transfer is prohibited if the member or veteran declines authorization. This section does not waive regulations under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. The agreement allows data transfers to the Secretary of Veterans Affairs as a routine use of records. Definitions include \"veteran,\" \"Armed Forces,\" and \"veterans benefits.\""
