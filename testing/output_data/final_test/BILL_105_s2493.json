    "content": "The \"Animal Agriculture Environmental Incentives Act of 1998\" allows for a credit for nutrient management costs of animal feeding operations under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. This credit pertains to equipment used in animal feeding operations. The \"Animal Agriculture Environmental Incentives Act of 1998\" provides a tax credit equal to 25% of eligible nutrient management costs for the purchase of calibrated manure spreaders or processing equipment for animal feeding operations. Eligible costs include equipment for precision application of manure in accordance with a nutrient management plan. The \"Animal Agriculture Environmental Incentives Act of 1998\" offers a tax credit for eligible nutrient management costs related to processing manure for animal feeding operations. Eligible processing equipment is defined as equipment used exclusively for processing manure, excluding equipment for containment or transportation. An animal feeding operation refers to a facility for dairy cow milking or raising livestock/poultry for commercial sale. The term \"application\" includes various methods of placing manure on land. The term 'manure' refers to animal excreta and organic byproducts from animal feeding operations, including litter, bedding, and composted carcasses. Precision application involves carefully spreading manure on land. Precision application refers to the controlled distribution of a specified amount of manure, based on its nitrogen or phosphorous content, across a defined area of land. Processing involves mechanical, physical, or chemical treatments that alter the concentration of nutrients in manure to facilitate its application on land or commercial use. The tax credit for manure management applies to activities that enhance manure value as a fertilizer, soil amendment, or energy source. Special rules include basis reduction for property receiving the credit, pass-thru rules for estates and trusts, and allocation rules for partnerships. The tax credit for manure management includes special rules for partnerships, with the credit being allocated among partners as per regulations. Conforming amendments to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 include adding a new paragraph for the animal feeding operation equipment credit. The amendments made by this section apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 1998 for the animal feeding operation equipment credit."
