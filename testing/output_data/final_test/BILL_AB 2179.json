    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 1206.5 of the Business and Professions Code is amended to require that clinical laboratory tests classified as waived under CLIA must be performed under the supervision of the laboratory director by qualified personnel, including licensed physicians, podiatrists, dentists, or naturopathic doctors. Licensed individuals who can perform waived clinical laboratory tests include those licensed under specific chapters, physician assistants under supervision, perfusionists, respiratory care practitioners, and medical assistants with proper authorization. Licensed individuals who can perform waived clinical laboratory tests include pharmacists ordering drug therapy-related tests, naturopathic assistants with specific authorization, licensed optometrists, other health care personnel providing direct patient care, individuals performing nondiagnostic testing, and hepatitis C counselors conducting HCV tests. No person can perform moderate complexity clinical laboratory tests under CLIA without supervision by the laboratory director. Tests must be conducted by licensed physicians, podiatrists, dentists, or individuals licensed to practice clinical laboratory work. Authorized individuals to perform tests under CLIA include those with certificates issued under specific sections of the Health and Safety Code, licensed physician assistants supervised by a physician, individuals licensed under Chapter 6, perfusionists, respiratory care practitioners, those performing nuclear medicine technology, and individuals performing blood gas analysis in compliance with Section 1245. Individuals certified or licensed in specific healthcare roles can perform point-of-care laboratory testing using approved devices at licensed sites, as long as they meet education requirements. The individual must meet education, training, and experience requirements set by the department and demonstrate competence in operating point-of-care testing devices for each analyte. Prior to performing laboratory tests, testing personnel must participate in a preceptor program to ensure accurate results and competent skills. A preceptor program involves personal observation and evaluation by a preceptor to review the accuracy, reliability, and validity of laboratory testing. Any person within a physician office laboratory must be supervised by the patient's physician or podiatrist, ensuring accurate and reliable test methods are followed. Pharmacists can order drug therapy-related laboratory tests in compliance with specific regulations. No high complexity clinical laboratory tests can be performed without the supervision of a licensed physician, podiatrist, dentist, or a licensed clinical laboratory practitioner authorized in a specific specialty. Authorized individuals to perform specific tests include those with certification under the Health and Safety Code, licensed physician assistants under supervision, perfusionists, respiratory care practitioners, nuclear medicine technologists, and individuals performing blood gas analysis in compliance with regulations. Any person within a physician office laboratory can perform tests under the onsite supervision of the patient's physician or podiatrist. Clinical laboratory examinations classified as provider-performed microscopy under CLIA can be personally performed by licensed physicians using a microscope during the patient's visit. A nurse midwife, nurse practitioner, physician assistant, or dentist can use a microscope during a patient's visit on a specimen obtained from their own patient or from a clinic or group practice. A hepatitis C counselor meeting specific requirements can perform certain tasks. Perform waived hepatitis C virus (HCV) tests under CLIA regulations with specific authorization from a licensed physician for skin punctures by a hepatitis C counselor. The person performing HCV tests works under a licensed physician, trained in rapid test proficiency and infection control precautions. They meet requirements for waived laboratory testing. The patient is informed that the preliminary HCV test result must be confirmed by a more specific test or a second rapid HCV test. Positive or indeterminate results require referral to a licensed healthcare practitioner for further evaluation. A hepatitis C counselor performing waived HCV tests cannot perform other tests unless qualified. Compliance does not count towards phlebotomy certification. Counselors must meet specific criteria for HCV testing. The organization must utilize hepatitis C counselors trained by the State Department of Public Health or its agents for counseling and testing. They must have a quality assurance plan and staff who comply with protocols provided by the State Department of Public Health."
