    "content": "The tax law governing charitable donations of food was temporarily changed to provide a tax incentive for businesses donating food to charity. Legislation such as the Katrina Emergency Tax Relief Act of 2005 and the Pension Protection Act of 2006 expanded the tax deduction for charitable contributions of food inventory. The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 further extended this temporary expansion for eligible donors. The Good Samaritan Hunger Relief Tax Incentive Extension Act of 2007 proposes to permanently extend the charitable deduction for contributions of food inventory. Various bills aim to retroactively extend the temporary expansion of eligible donors through December 31, 2009. Several bills have been proposed to provide tax relief and incentives related to charitable contributions and food donations. These bills include S. 2886, S. 3098, S. 3322, H.R. 6587, H.R. 3628, S. 1132, and S. 2420. One of the bills, S. 2420, became law in June 2008 (P.L. 110-247) and revised the Federal Acquisition Regulation to encourage the donation of food in certain contracts. Legislation encourages donation of excess food to nonprofit organizations assisting food-insecure people. Tax treatment for contributions by businesses to nonprofit organizations is discussed, with deductions allowed up to specified limits. Contributions can be in cash or property and must be made in the taxable year to be deductible. Common deductible organizations include churches, universities, schools, and hospitals. Contributions to deductible organizations like churches, universities, schools, and hospitals are allowed for tax deductions. The recipient must be a charitable organization certified by the IRS and based in the US or its possessions. Donations to foreign charities are not deductible, but contributions to qualified organizations are, even if some funds are used internationally. Corporate deductions are limited to 10% of taxable income. The deductible portion of corporate charitable contributions is limited to 10% of taxable income, with any excess contributions able to be carried forward to future tax years. The increase in the cap from 5% to 10% was enacted through the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981, with the goal of stimulating corporate charitable giving. This allows corporations to potentially benefit fully from their contributions over time, even if they are initially limited in a given year. The law allows excess charitable contributions to be carried forward for five years. Corporate gifts of property like stocks and bonds are deductible at market value, while depreciable property is deductible at the corporation's basis. Fully depreciated machinery and equipment result in a zero charitable contribution deduction. Under current tax law, C corporations receive more favorable tax treatment for contributions of inventory and ordinary-income property to charitable organizations. This provision is temporarily available to S corporations, partnerships, and sole proprietorships. Donors can deduct their cost plus half the difference between cost and market value, not exceeding twice the cost basis. This special tax incentive applies to capital assets and allows large corporations a larger deduction for charitable contributions of qualified tangible personal property to \"qualified\" tax-exempt organizations. The enhanced deduction for charitable contributions of food to qualified tax-exempt organizations requires the donation to be used solely for the care of the ill, needy, or infants. The donee must provide a statement confirming the intended use of the donation and must meet all quality and labeling standards. The donation must not be exchanged for money, other property, or services, and must comply with regulations for 180 days prior to transfer. Current law provides that the charitable deduction for contributions of inventory and other property is subject to certain limitations and rules. Contributions must be made to a U.S. charitable organization, with a 10% limitation on deductions for corporations. Excess contributions can be carried forward for five years. Special rules apply for gifts of tangible personal property (inventory) to qualified charitable organizations for specific purposes. Fair market value must exceed basis for an enhanced deduction. The current law provides an enhanced deduction for donations made by C Corporations of food products for the care of the ill, needy, or infants. The deduction is primarily used for unsaleable products due to labeling errors, damage, or nearing expiration. Proposed legislation aims to extend this deduction to all taxpayers in business, limit it to \"apparently wholesome food,\" and define it further. The proposed legislation aims to extend the enhanced deduction for donations of \"apparently wholesome food\" to all taxpayers in business. The determination of basis for qualified contributions would be set as a percentage of the food's fair market value, which is defined more rigorously to lessen valuation problems for taxpayers. The court case clarified donation valuation regulations, determining the value of surplus bread donated to charity as the full retail price. This contradicted the IRS's contention that the value should be discounted. The new definition of \"apparently wholesome food\" aligns with the Bill Emerson Good Samaritan Food Donation Act. The Tax Reform Act of 1969 changed the rules for charitable contributions of appreciated property, allowing taxpayers to deduct the fair market value without paying taxes on the appreciation. This definition of \"apparently wholesome food\" was also used in the Katrina Emergency Relief Act. The Tax Reform Act of 1969 allowed taxpayers to deduct the fair market value of appreciated property without paying taxes on the appreciation. However, the Tax Reform Act of 1976 provided corporations with more favorable tax treatment for contributions of inventory to certain charitable organizations. The Tax Reform Act of 1976 provided corporations with more favorable tax treatment for contributions of inventory to certain charitable organizations, aiming to increase donations of items like food, clothing, and medical supplies to those in need. In 2006, total charitable giving reached $295 billion, with corporations contributing $12.7 billion in cash and in-kind donations. Individual giving accounted for 75.6% of total giving, while corporate gifts made up 4.3%. Religious organizations receive little funding from corporate donors, as individuals are their primary supporters. The American Association of Fund-Raising Counsel (AAFRC) Trust for Philanthropy, Inc. found that in 2006, contributions to religion represented 32.8% of all charitable gifts. Corporate giving has ranged from 0.7% to 2.3% of pretax income over 30 years, with variations due to changes in tax law. Profits grow fastest in service industries like banking and telecommunications. Non-manufacturing companies cannot take advantage of tax-deductible gifts of inventory. Non-manufacturing companies are unable to benefit from tax-deductible gifts of inventory, unlike the manufacturing sector. Strategic corporate support is a growing trend that is not considered charitable giving but appeals to both companies and non-profits. Companies should consider increasing charitable support to non-profits without using pretax income as the basis for contributions. The Conference Board reported that in 1999, 28% of company contributions were in non-cash forms. In 1999, companies reported that 28% of their contributions were in non-cash forms, the highest level ever reported. Industries like chemical, pharmaceutical, and computer equipment manufacturers donated a significant percentage of their contributions in non-cash forms. The 10 companies in the Food/Beverage/Tobacco sector gave 28% of their contributions in in-kind giving. Worth magazine provided information on the top 50 companies that gave the most in 1999, with a subset of five food concerns listed. In 1999, companies reported a high level of non-cash contributions, with food companies showing high giving as a percentage of profits. Sara Lee gave the lowest percentage at 3.3%, with only four nonfood companies giving more. Most food companies provided substantial in-kind giving, while some others showed none. Companies with higher in-kind giving than cash giving benefit from tax deductions, mainly in the pharmaceutical/health care sector. Corporate charitable contributions are not a prominent issue in U.S. tax policy as companies, especially in pharmaceutical/health care or computer/information technology sectors, prioritize maximizing returns for investors. Despite this, corporations often make charitable gifts to enhance their visibility and goodwill. Deducting payments as charitable contributions or business expenses generally makes no difference to corporations. When corporations make charitable contributions, deducting them as charitable donations or business expenses generally has the same tax impact. However, special rules for contributions of inventory can affect how the gift is valued under current tax law. Extending enhanced tax deductions for corporate food contributions to all taxpayers, including small businesses, faces equity challenges due to potential differences in cost basis. This is because corporations may have higher cost bases than small businesses due to factors like wages and taxes. Small businesses like farmers and owner-chefs may not include certain costs in their basis, giving corporate farmers an advantage with higher cost bases. This results in corporations potentially receiving more in appreciation compared to individual entrepreneurs. The temporary law provides more equity among all taxpayers engaged in a trade or business by offering enhanced deductions to C corporations, unlike the current permanent law. Tax rates and graduation differ for individuals and corporations, with corporate tax rates ranging from 15% to 35% and individuals subject to six tax rates from 10% to 35%. The value of the enhanced deduction depends on the applicable tax rate, with higher incomes receiving more advantage. The extension of the current enhanced deduction for corporate gifts of food inventory may not achieve full equity among all taxpayers engaged in a trade or business. Higher incomes receive more advantage under the proposal, with large corporations likely benefiting more than small farmers. The law only applies to food inventory, potentially discriminating against other charitable contributions like gifts of clothing for the poor. Using a tax credit instead of a deduction could promote better equity among all business taxpayers. Tax credits are subtracted from tax liability, while deductions are subtracted from income to determine taxable amount. Each $1 of tax credit reduces tax liability by $1, while deductions reduce tax liability by a percentage. Tax credits directly reduce taxes and are used as incentives for all eligible taxpayers. The decision to donate crops to qualified organizations for gleaning is based on whether the farmer will receive a market price that exceeds the cost of harvesting, packing, and transporting the crop. Fixed costs such as seed and fertilizer are not considered in this decision. The farmer can benefit from the enhanced deduction by having crops gleaned by an exempt organization, avoiding harvest expenses and offsetting taxable funds. A carryover deduction can be used for up to five future tax years. Determining the fair market value of donated goods can be based on the price of similar food items sold by the taxpayer. Previous legislation defined \"apparently wholesome food\" eligible for donation. The proposed definition of donation includes apparently wholesome food that may not be readily marketable due to various conditions. A court case cited in legislative history determined the value of surplus bread donated to charity as the full retail price, rather than the discounted price suggested by the IRS. This decision encouraged charitable donations by providing a tax benefit to the donor. The court's findings contradicted IRS regulations on charitable donations, with no tax benefit received. The proposed legislation aims to make the Lucky Stores case ruling applicable nationwide. Opponents argue that economic incentives, like reduced disposal costs and goodwill, already exist for stores to donate. Critics fear the changes could reduce federal revenues. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimated a revenue loss of $255 million over 5 years and $626 million over 10 years due to the \"Care\" legislation. Some argue for direct government subsidies for food programs to ensure funds are allocated objectively based on need. Some argue that expanding the charitable deduction to all taxpayers in a trade or business would benefit those near farm areas more than those in cities. Proponents believe this would provide more food to the elderly, poor, and infants compared to direct government food programs. Minimal federal involvement in program administration is seen as an advantage. The proposed change to expand the charitable deduction to all taxpayers in a trade or business would add complexity to tax return filing for more taxpayers in the charitable contribution arena. Some suggest that Congress could evaluate the success of the change due to the sunset provision."
