    "content": "The \"CHP Support Act\" is cited as the short title. Section 375 of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act is amended to establish the CHP Technical Assistance Partnership Program. The Clean Energy Application Centers of the Department of Energy are now the CHP Technical Assistance Partnership Program, consisting of regional partnerships and supporting technical activities under the Advanced Manufacturing Office. The CHP Technical Assistance Partnership Program encourages the deployment of combined heat and power technologies through education and outreach to various professionals, policymakers, and organizations interested in efficient energy use. The Program provides support for microgrids, district energy, and CHP technologies to institutions of higher education and research centers to ensure their continued effectiveness. Funding is available for research, development, and distribution of informational materials. The Program supports manufacturers, commercial buildings, institutional facilities, and Federal sites with informational materials on CHP and microgrid technologies, including updating databases, technology analyses, State resource pages, and websites. The Program aims to educate end users, regulators, and stakeholders on CHP technologies through workshops, reports, and seminars. It also conducts onsite assessments for potential CHP technology deployment and identifies candidates for clean energy technologies. The Program aims to provide unbiased engineering support for sites considering CHP technologies, assist in overcoming barriers to clean energy technology deployment, and conduct field validation and performance evaluations. Funding is available for 5 years. Authorization of Appropriations: $12,000,000 is authorized for each fiscal year from 2018 to 2022 for the Program supporting CHP technologies."
