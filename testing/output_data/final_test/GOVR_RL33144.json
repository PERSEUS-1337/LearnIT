    "content": "The report discusses agricultural issues in WTO multilateral trade negotiations, specifically the Doha Round. It covers the implications of the suspension of negotiations in July 2006, efforts to revive them, reasons for the suspension, agreements reached at the 2005 Hong Kong Ministerial meeting, and potential economic benefits of a successful trade agreement. Numerous meetings between WTO member countries have been ongoing. Efforts to revive the Doha Development Agenda multilateral trade negotiations have quickened since the suspension in July 2006. The expiration of fast-track authority for congressional consideration of trade agreements is approaching, with discussions on extending it with potential amendments. This authority is crucial for the speedy consideration of multilateral trade agreements and other free trade agreements currently being negotiated. Efforts to revive the Doha Development Agenda negotiations have focused on reducing trade-distorting subsidies and tariffs. Political discussions involve expressions of support for concluding the round and reaching compromises. The United States is urged by the EU and developing countries to offer more in reducing domestic support. The United States is pushing for more substantial reductions in tariffs and limits on import-sensitive products in trade negotiations with the EU and developing countries. Brazil is focused on reducing trade-distorting domestic subsidies, while India is advocating for a large number of special products to be exempt from market opening. Intense discussions are ongoing between the United States and the EU. The United States and the EU are engaged in intense trade negotiations, with discussions focusing on reducing tariffs and import-sensitive products. Both sides are considering showing more flexibility, but domestic political considerations are constraining new offers on domestic support and market access. Neither U.S. nor EU farmers are willing to make further concessions on subsidies or tariffs at this time. In Doha Round negotiations, the U.S. and EU must reach an agreement, but developing countries like Brazil and India play a crucial role. Brazil's proposal for tariff reduction falls short of U.S. expectations, while India supports the G-20 proposal but seeks many special product exemptions. The next step in restarting the Doha Round negotiations will be an informal WTO Minister's meeting at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland in January 2007. Around 30 trade ministers are expected to attend to discuss resuming negotiations at the ministerial level. The Director General of the WTO announced an indefinite suspension of negotiations in the Doha Round due to disagreements among key member countries. The G-6 countries, including the United States, the EU, Brazil, India, Australia, and Japan, were at an impasse over methods to achieve agricultural trade goals in the Doha Round. The U.S. felt its offer to reduce domestic subsidies was not matched by tariff reductions from the EU or market access from Brazil and India. The EU and Brazil argued the U.S. offer didn't go far enough in reducing trade-distorting support. Some trade policy analysts believe that reauthorization of U.S. trade promotion authority (TPA) is uncertain in the 110th Congress. Congress may temporarily extend TPA if a Doha Round agreement seems imminent. Several agreements have been reached in the Doha Round agricultural negotiations, contingent on a comprehensive agreement. The Doha Round agricultural negotiations have reached agreements contingent on a comprehensive agreement, including the elimination of EU agricultural export subsidies and extending duty-free access for least developed countries. The WTO will provide aid for trade funds to help developing countries participate in the world trade system. The suspension of negotiations has reduced pressure for U.S. farm policy change. The current farm bill (P.L. 107-171) expires in 2007, and pressure for U.S. farm policy change has dissipated due to the indefinite suspension of the Doha talks. Legislation has been introduced to extend the 2002 farm bill by one year, and the American Farm Bureau has endorsed the concepts of the 2002 farm bill for its farm safety net features. The United States must still meet obligations under existing WTO agricultural agreements, limiting trade-distorting spending to $19.1 billion annually. The expiration of the \"peace clause\" in the WTO agreement may lead to increased litigation by member countries challenging U.S. farm subsidies. Brazil and Canada have already challenged U.S. agricultural subsidy programs, while the U.S. may focus on bilateral and regional free trade agreements due to the suspension of Doha Round negotiations. The United States may pursue bilateral and regional free trade agreements more aggressively, with a focus on larger economies like Korea and Malaysia. The U.S. Trade Representative prioritizes negotiating FTAs with key trading partners. WTO member countries outlined objectives for global trade liberalization in agriculture, manufactures, and services during the Doha Round negotiations. Limited progress was made in reaching agreements. Limited progress was made in reaching agreement on liberalizing agricultural trade during the Doha Round negotiations. The Hong Kong agreement set new deadlines for completing the round in 2006, but none were met before the negotiations were suspended indefinitely in July 2006. The agreement aimed to establish modalities for cutting tariffs on agricultural products, eliminating export subsidies, and reducing trade-distorting domestic support by April 30, 2006, with member countries submitting draft schedules by July 31, 2006. The goal was to conclude the Doha Round in 2006. The Hong Kong declaration in December 2005 addressed agricultural negotiations, including export competition, domestic support, and market access. Progress was made on eliminating export subsidies, but challenges remained in establishing new disciplines for other forms of competition. Detailed negotiations were lacking for domestic support and market access, with unresolved issues on trade-distorting support and market access for import-sensitive and special products. Some progress was made on eliminating export subsidies during the Hong Kong Ministerial, with the agreement to end agricultural export subsidies by 2013. However, challenges remain in addressing trade-distorting support and market access for import-sensitive and special products. The United States and African cotton-producing countries have differing views on reducing support for cotton. The European Union opposed setting an end date for export subsidies, arguing that other forms of subsidized export competition needed to be disciplined first. The Hong Kong Ministerial made progress on eliminating export subsidies by agreeing to end them by 2013. The United States and Brazil pushed for this deadline, with a compromise to eliminate all forms of export subsidies and equivalent measures by the end of 2013. Export credit programs should be market-consistent and short-term. Monopoly powers of State Trading Enterprises (STEs) should not circumvent export subsidy disciplines. Disciplines will be established on food aid to prevent loopholes for export subsidization. WTO members agreed to three bands for reducing trade-distorting domestic support, with the EU facing the largest reduction commitments. Japan and the United States would be in the middle band. The HK declaration establishes bands for reducing trade-distorting domestic support, with the EU facing the largest reduction commitments. The United States would not be allowed to engage in box shifting to maintain current spending levels. Tariff cuts will be structured into four bands, with thresholds and reduction percentages to be determined in modalities negotiations. Sensitive products exempt from tariff reductions will also be addressed in modalities negotiations. The preliminary draft of the declaration at the WTO required member countries to adjust tariff rate quotas for sensitive products based on agreed formulas. Developing countries were granted privileges such as self-designating special products and implementing a special safeguard mechanism. The declaration also reaffirmed commitments on cotton made in a previous agreement. The HK declaration reaffirms commitments on cotton made in a previous agreement, calling for developed countries to eliminate export subsidies on cotton in 2006. The United States will end its Step 2 program for cotton by August 1, 2006, following a WTO ruling. Developed countries are urged to provide duty-free access to cotton exports from least-developed countries. The HK declaration addresses the reduction of trade-distorting domestic subsidies for cotton and emphasizes the need for balance between agricultural and non-agricultural market access modalities. It calls for a high level of ambition in market access for developing countries in both sectors. The HK declaration calls for developed and developing countries to provide duty-free and quota-free market access for products from LDCs by 2008. The U.S. proposed detailed modalities for agricultural reform in WTO negotiations, followed by similar proposals from the EU and G-20. The U.S., EU, G-20, and G-10 have proposed different modalities for agricultural negotiations in the WTO, highlighting wide differences, especially in market access. Chairmen of House and Senate Agriculture Committees outlined four principles for a successful WTO agricultural agreement. The chairmen outlined four principles for a successful WTO agreement: substantial improvement in market access, greater harmonization in domestic support, elimination of export subsidies, and greater certainty in WTO litigation. Negotiations on agricultural modalities continued but reached an impasse before the Hong Kong WTO Ministerial. The U.S., G-20, and CAIRNS group called for the EU to improve its market access offer, while the EU claimed it needed formal proposals from others to do so. The WTO faced challenges in improving market access without formal proposals from other countries on non-agricultural trade sectors. News reports suggested scaled-back ambitions for the Hong Kong Ministerial. WTO Director General proposed setting deadlines for establishing modalities and agreeing to schedules of concessions by the end of 2006. Major DDA negotiating proposals for agricultural modalities came from the United States, EU, G-20, and G-10, each varying in specificity. The G-10 proposal varies in specificity for negotiating pillars, focusing on domestic policy reforms and market access. Export competition negotiations were influenced by the EU's pledge to end export subsidies. Market access remains challenging, with the EU's offer falling short of the G-20 proposal. The U.S. modalities proposal of October 10, 2005, aims to reduce trade-distorting support and tariffs over a three-stage reform period. It includes cutting agricultural export subsidies, establishing disciplines for export credit guarantees, and reducing overall trade-distorting support by 75% for the EU and 53% for the United States and Japan. The United States and Japan propose to cap blue box spending at 2.5% of production value, cut de minimis exemptions to 2.5%, maintain green box criteria without caps, establish a peace clause to protect domestic supports, reduce highest tariffs by 90%, cut other tariffs by 55%-90%, cap maximum agricultural tariff at 75%, limit sensitive products to 1% of tariff lines, expand TRQs, and set a maximum developing country agricultural tariff at 100%. U.S. support commitments depend on market access proposals from the EU and G-20. EU faces pressure to improve offers and made new proposals on market access and domestic support. The EU made a proposal on October 27 regarding domestic support, export competition, and Geographical Indications. The EU's market access offer is criticized for not incentivizing developing countries like Brazil and Thailand to make concessions in non-agricultural market access or services. The United States and G-20 countries are pressuring the EU to offer further concessions on agricultural market access, including eliminating all agricultural export subsidies by 2012. They also want to establish a \"short-term self-financing principle\" for export credits and eliminate price-pooling and anti-trust measures for STEs. The proposal includes measures to ensure self-financing by charging adequate premiums, eliminating various subsidies and preferential financing, phasing out food aid that leads to commercial displacement, reducing amber box ceilings, and establishing caps on de minimis exemptions. Additionally, it aims to freeze price differences in the blue box support prices. The proposal aims to reduce trade-distorting support in three bands, maintain the green box without limits, cut tariffs by 35%-60%, reduce sensitive products to 8% of tariff lines, cap maximum agricultural tariffs at 100%, keep the SSG available for both developed and developing countries, and extend protection to wines and spirits under Article 23 of TRIPS to all products. Establish a multilateral system for notification and registration of GIs for all products, with legal effect in Member countries. Prohibit use of well-known GIs on a short list, establish higher tariff bands, lower tariff cuts, and a maximum tariff of 150% for developing countries. No tariff cuts for WTO-member LDCs. NAMA agreement on a progressive formula for tariff cuts for manufactured products before Hong Kong. Services trade liberalization targets to be established at Hong Kong. Negotiate a list of issues including antidumping before the Ministerial meeting. Prepare a Trade Related Assistance package for developing countries and extend tariff assistance. The G-20 proposal on market access reflects differences between Brazil and India. It includes eliminating export subsidies over a five-year period, cutting domestic support in three bands, addressing cotton issues by the Hong Kong Ministerial meeting, and reducing tariffs for developed and developing countries. The G-10, a group of developed countries, proposes reducing developing country tariffs by 25%-40% and capping agricultural tariffs. They suggest limiting sensitive products and maintaining the Special Safeguard Mechanism for developing countries. Special & Differential Treatment exempts LDCs from reduction commitments. The G-10 takes a defensive stance on market access, advocating for lower tariff reductions and more sensitive products. The G-33, consisting of 42 developing countries, proposes reducing agricultural tariffs by 27% to 45% for most products. They suggest designating 20% of tariff lines as Special Products essential for food security and rural development. No cap on the highest agricultural tariff is allowed under their proposal. The G-33 calls for significant reductions in the amber box ceiling for different levels of support. The G-33, consisting of 42 developing countries, proposes reducing agricultural tariffs by 27% to 45% for most products. They suggest designating 20% of tariff lines as Special Products essential for food security and rural development. 50% of the tariff lines would be exempt from tariff reduction commitments, with an additional 15% exempted under \"special circumstances\". The remaining tariff lines would be subject to cuts no greater than 10%. The African Cotton Initiative proposed by four least-developed African countries aims to eliminate export subsidies and trade-distorting domestic support by all WTO members. The Doha Round negotiating mandate identified cotton as crucial for its success after the Cancun Ministerial in 2003. A preliminary agreement in July 2004 acknowledged the importance of cotton for certain developing countries and established a \"Cotton\" Sub-Committee. Two main proposals were discussed at the Hong Kong meeting regarding the trade-related aspects of the cotton initiative. At the Hong Kong Ministerial, two proposals were discussed regarding the trade-related aspects of the cotton initiative. The African proposal aimed to eliminate export subsidies on cotton by the end of 2005 and trade-distorting domestic support by January 1, 2009. It also called for duty-free and quota-free access for cotton products from least-developed countries and the establishment of an emergency fund for depressed international prices. The EU proposal sought more ambitious commitments on cotton, without specifying numerical targets. The EU proposed earlier elimination of export subsidies and all duties on imports. They would eliminate trade-distorting subsidies for cotton by 2006. The US sees cotton as part of overall agriculture negotiations for subsidy reductions and market access. The outcome for cotton depends on the agriculture agreement. The U.S. Deputy Trade Representative indicated that the outcome for cotton in the agriculture agreement should be \"more than the average.\" Developing countries' active participation in the Doha Round sets it apart from previous trade rounds. The U.S.-EU joint proposal on agriculture faced opposition from developing countries like Brazil, India, and China during the 2003 Cancun Ministerial meeting. The G-20, led by Brazil, India, and China, is actively participating in the Doha agricultural negotiations. Their proposal on agricultural modalities set a benchmark for other developed country proposals. The least developed countries (LDCs) are also involved in the negotiations, with initiatives like the African Cotton Initiative. LDCs played a role in blocking an overall agreement at Cancun by rejecting an EU proposal to discuss \"Singapore issues\" of trade facilitation. The Doha Round negotiations include various issues such as reducing trade barriers, liberalizing trade in services, and addressing specific concerns of developing countries. The agreement to focus on trade facilitation was a win for the least developed countries. The Doha Round negotiations aim to reduce trade barriers and address developing countries' concerns. If a trade agreement is reached by March 2007, Congress would implement it under fast-track procedures. The fast-track authority expires on July 1, 2007, serving as the deadline for U.S. participation in the Doha Round. Congress could extend the authority if needed. The expiration of Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) coincides with the 2002 farm bill expiration on September 30, 2007. Legislation has been introduced in Congress to extend the farm bill for a year pending completion of the Doha Round negotiations. Supporters are now calling for extending the farm bill contingent on a successful conclusion of WTO negotiations. The American Farm Bureau Federation has withdrawn its insistence on extending the current farm bill until a new WTO agreement is reached. They now call for a more comprehensive rewrite of the 2002 farm law, including its basic concepts. The Uruguay Round's Agreement on Agriculture was the first international trade agreement to focus solely on agricultural policy reform, with an implementation period of six years for developed countries and ten years for developing countries. The AA included a provision for continuing the agricultural policy reform process at the WTO's Fourth Ministerial Conference in Doha, Qatar in 2001. At the WTO's Fourth Ministerial Conference in Doha, Qatar in 2001, member countries agreed to launch the Doha Development Agenda (DDA), a new round of trade negotiations that included agricultural trade liberalization. The DDA aimed to integrate developing countries into the world trading system and covered various trade issues such as industrial tariffs, services, and dispute settlement. The Doha Ministerial Declaration mandated negotiations for market access improvements, phasing out export subsidies, and reducing trade-distorting domestic support. The Doha Ministerial Declaration mandated negotiations for market access improvements, phasing out export subsidies, and reducing trade-distorting domestic support in agricultural trade. The three pillars of the agricultural negotiations are domestic support, export subsidies, and market access. Special and differential treatment for developing countries was emphasized in the negotiations. The deadline for reaching agreement on \"modalities\" was missed, leading to continued negotiations in preparation for the fifth WTO Ministerial Conference in Cancun, Mexico in September 2003. The US and EU reached agreement on a broad framework for negotiating agricultural trade. The United States and the EU, along with the G-20 group of developing countries, proposed different approaches to agricultural trade liberalization before the Cancun meeting. The G-20 focused on reducing subsidies and tariffs for developed countries, while the Cancun Ministerial Conference failed to reconcile these differences without specific proposals for reducing trade barriers. The Cancun Ministerial Conference failed to reconcile differences on agricultural issues and expanding the negotiating agenda. It ended without an agreement on modalities for continuing multilateral negotiations on agricultural trade liberalization. WTO member countries reached an agreement on a work program for completing the DDA negotiations on July 31, 2004. The Framework set the stage for negotiations on curbing trade-distorting domestic support, reducing trade barriers, and eliminating export subsidies by July 2005. Only 24 out of 36 WTO members have used export subsidies, with the EU accounting for nearly 90% of them during 1995-2001. Under the Framework, WTO members agreed to eliminate export subsidies, export credits with repayment periods beyond 180 days, trade-distorting practices of State Trading Enterprises, and provision of food aid by a specified end date. Under the WTO Framework, members agreed to eliminate export subsidies, export credits with repayment periods beyond 180 days, trade-distorting practices of State Trading Enterprises, and provision of food aid by a specified end date. Developing countries will benefit from longer implementation periods for eliminating export subsidies. Only 35 out of 149 members have notified the use of trade-distorting domestic subsidies. During the 1995-2001 period, the EU, the United States, and Japan accounted for 91% of all domestic subsidies used by WTO members. The Doha Ministerial Declaration calls for substantial reductions in trade-distorting domestic support, with special treatment for developing countries. Developed Members will harmonize reductions using a tiered, progressive formula. Amber Box subsidies will see substantial reductions and limits on support for specific products. De Minimis exemptions allow for non-product-specific support up to 5% of total agricultural production value. The Doha Ministerial Declaration calls for substantial reductions in trade-distorting domestic support, with special treatment for developing countries. Amber Box subsidies will see substantial reductions and limits on support for specific products. The Blue Box is currently unbound but will be limited to 5% of total agricultural production value. Overall Ceiling for Trade-Distorting Domestic Support is currently unbound with substantial reductions to be determined. The curr_chunk discusses the unbound status of the sum of amber box, blue box, and de minimis, with substantial reductions to be negotiated. Additional cuts may be required if the sum exceeds the Overall Ceiling commitment. Criteria for Green Box measures will be reviewed for minimal trade-distorting effects. Formulas for reductions in bounds for Overall and Amber Box, blue box disciplines, and de minimis disciplines are outlined. The curr_chunk discusses market access reform complexities, with all members required to improve access for all products. The Framework provides direction for tariff reductions, with special treatment for developing countries including smaller formula commitments, greater access to sensitive products, and a longer implementation period. The curr_chunk discusses the parameters governing Sensitive Products, including the principle of substantial improvement in market access, the appropriate number of permissible sensitive products, and the harmonized tariff reduction scheme. It also covers the designation of Special Products based on criteria of food security, livelihood security, and rural development need. Improved administration of TRQs and reducing tariff escalation for value-added products are key points. Specific details of Special and Differential Treatment for developing countries include lesser commitments, longer implementation periods, and flexibility for sensitive products. Special Safeguard Mechanisms are available for developing countries, with TBD status for developed countries. Treatment of Least-Developed Countries and Geographical Indications are also under discussion. Geographical Indications (GIs) are being discussed for inclusion in the final agreement, with questions on how they will be defined and implemented. The economic and policy implications of trade liberalization are being reviewed at different levels, including global trade effects and U.S. domestic agricultural income. It is noted that any agreement from the Doha Round will only partially liberalize trade, allowing countries to maintain some policies that distort agricultural trade. Current proposals focus on setting limits on spending categories, with individual member countries making final decisions. Policies that distort agricultural trade, such as tariffs and tariff-rate quotas, account for a significant portion of trade distortions. Bound tariff rates need to be reduced before applied rates can be lowered under a new trade agreement. Before applied rates can be lowered, negotiations must be made to reduce bound domestic spending limits. The treatment of sensitive products will impact market access gains. A 2005 World Bank study showed that partial trade liberalization could result in annual welfare benefits of $74.5 billion, compared to $182 billion under full trade liberalization. The World Bank study found that under full trade liberalization, there could be an annual benefit of $182 billion. However, if developed countries are allowed to designate sensitive products with high tariffs, the economic benefits would decrease significantly. If above-quota tariffs are capped at 200%, the annual economic benefits could still reach $44.3 billion. The economic benefits from trade liberalization are estimated at $44.3 billion. Proposed reforms in U.S. agricultural policies may be necessary, including changes to export subsidies and credit guarantees. The U.S. is a major provider of international food aid and uses export subsidies primarily for milk and milk products. In FY2004, agricultural exports worth nearly $3.7 billion were facilitated with export credit guarantees. In FY2004, nearly $2.2 billion worth of U.S. agricultural exports were made under food aid programs, including PL480, Food-For-Peace, and McGovern-Dole. The U.S. is a leading food aid donor, with most aid in the form of commodity donations. Changes in export credit guarantee programs are being made to comply with Doha reform proposals. The U.S. is a major food aid donor, with most aid in the form of commodity donations. Reforms to food aid may reduce donations if they limit commodity donations. The U.S., EU, and Japan provide 90% of global agricultural subsidies, facing economic consequences from new domestic support rules. Proposed U.S. reforms would lower the amber box ceiling to $7.6 billion, requiring redesign of domestic support programs. The U.S. proposal for reforming domestic support programs includes shifting away from market-distorting programs like loan deficiency payments and towards green box programs. De minimis exemptions would be bound at 2.5% of relevant production value, with a ceiling of about $5 billion for non-product specific exemptions. Shifting counter-cyclical payments to the blue box would help meet the lower ceiling. The U.S. proposal for reforming domestic support programs includes shifting away from market-distorting programs like loan deficiency payments towards green box programs. De minimis exemptions would be bound at 2.5% of relevant production value, with a ceiling of about $5 billion for non-product specific exemptions. Shifting counter-cyclical payments to the blue box would help meet the lower ceiling, with potential for increased agricultural exports under improved market access. The U.S. proposal for reforming domestic support programs includes shifting towards green box programs and setting bound de minimis exemptions. TRQ protection benefits dairy products, beef, and sugar in the U.S., likely to continue under a new DDA agreement with increased imports. Specifics on TRQ administration are not provided in the U.S. proposal, but the G-20 recommends minimum access quotas at 6% of domestic consumption. Australia suggests a higher access quota level of 8-10%. Under the U.S. proposal, the amber box annual limit falls to $7.6 billion, with specific assumptions made for U.S. farm policy reform. Loan rates for various products were reduced, CCP payments were redirected, and tariff reductions were made for non-sensitive products according to specified tiers. The U.S. proposal includes reducing loan rates, redirecting CCP payments, and making tariff reductions for non-sensitive products. TRQs for sensitive products were increased by 7.5% and export subsidies will be eliminated by 2010. Two scenarios were evaluated: one with reduced target prices and another with increased direct payment rates. Both scenarios lower CCP payments by 7%, with the \"compensated\" scenario increasing government outlays to offset the decrease. This represents a shift from capped blue box to unlimited green box payments. The U.S. proposal includes reducing loan rates, redirecting CCP payments, and making tariff reductions for non-sensitive products. TRQs for sensitive products were increased by 7.5% and export subsidies will be eliminated by 2010. Two scenarios were evaluated: one with reduced target prices and another with increased direct payment rates. Both scenarios lower CCP payments by 7%, with the \"compensated\" scenario increasing government outlays to offset the decrease. This represents a shift from capped blue box to unlimited green box payments. Annual net government outlays are reduced by 22.5% but net farm income is still up by $1.3 billion (2.4%) as increases in prices resulting from increased exports offsets at least some of the reduction in payments. Rice producers experience a sharp jump (5.7%) in combined market returns plus government payments. However, returns plus payments remain below baseline levels for corn, soybeans, and cotton. Annual net farm income is up by $3.4 billion (6.5%) as the increase in direct payments further offsets reductions in CCPs and loan benefits. For rice, wheat, corn, and soybeans, average estimated returns plus payments exceed the baseline levels. Of the five major program crops, only for cotton do returns plus payments remain below baseline levels. Crop and livestock receipts are up by about $2 billion and $4.2 billion. Livestock and crop receipts have increased significantly due to higher prices and exports. International commodity prices have risen due to the removal of export subsidies and expansion of TRQs, leading to higher demand and trade. Tariff reductions and reduced domestic support have also played a role in boosting exports and prices. Expansion of rice TRQs in Japan and South Korea has pushed international rice prices higher by 8% on average. In the FAPRI study, U.S. farm real estate values experience small, but significant changes. Under the uncompensated scenario, average U.S. farm land values decline by 1.4% as reduction in government payments more than offsets higher market returns. Factors other than net market returns and payments affect land values, but changes in profitability play an important role. Under the compensated scenario, farm real estate values increase by 1.7% as slightly lower projected government payments are more than offset by expected market returns suggesting improved long-run returns to the land.
