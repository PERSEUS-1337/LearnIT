    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Civil Rights Uniformity Act of 2016.\" Congressional findings and declaration of purpose are included. Congress finds that civil rights laws have historically prohibited discrimination based on objective biology, not subjective self-identification. Advocates have pushed for including \"gender identity\" in federal laws, but Congress has only done so in limited cases. President Barack Obama's administration attempted to replace the word \"sex\" with \"gender identity\" in Federal antidiscrimination law through executive actions, despite Congress historically protecting sex based on biology, not self-identification. Eric Holder announced the reinterpretation of the ban on \"sex\" discrimination under title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to include \"gender identity.\" This was followed by an Equal Employment Opportunity Commission decision on March 27, 2015, stating that not using a female pronoun for a male identifying as female is considered discrimination. The Obama administration sued North Carolina on May 9, 2016, for not adopting their interpretation of title VII and title IX, leading to a threat of fines and loss of Federal funding. On May 13, 2016, the Departments of Justice and Education issued a guidance letter on the matter. The Education Department issued guidance under title IX stating that transgender students must be allowed to participate in sex-segregated activities and facilities based on their gender identity. This includes access to restrooms, locker rooms, housing, and athletic teams. Failure to grant such access is considered a title IX violation. The Education Department issued guidance under title IX allowing transgender students access to sex-segregated facilities based on their gender identity. Federal regulations permit separate facilities based on sex, defined as biology. Health regulations now cover \"gender identity\" in federally funded health programs. The Obama administration's actions regarding \"gender identity\" in healthcare have raised concerns about liability and the rule of law. The purpose of the Act is to prevent the executive branch from redefining \"sex\" or \"gender\" to mean \"gender identity\" and to ensure that gender identity is not a protected class in Federal law or policy. The purpose of the Act is to prevent the executive branch from redefining \"sex\" or \"gender\" to mean \"gender identity\" and to ensure that gender identity is not a protected class in Federal law or policy without the approval of Congress. The Act prohibits policies that redefine sex to mean gender identity. The Act clarifies that in Federal civil rights laws, \"sex\" and \"gender\" do not include \"gender identity\" or \"transgender status\" as protected classes. It also specifies that no law should interpret gender identity or transgender status as protected unless explicitly stated. The term \"Federal civil rights law\" refers to any law prohibiting discrimination based on sex or gender. The Act clarifies that Federal civil rights laws, including title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Fair Housing Act, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, and other Federal laws, prohibit discrimination based on sex or gender."
