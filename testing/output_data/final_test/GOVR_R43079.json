    "content": "The President and leading Members of Congress are focused on income tax reform, with the House supporting base broadening and lower tax rates, while the Senate aims for revenue raising. The President's budget outlines propose tax policy changes, and both tax-writing committees are actively working on tax reform. Itemized deductions, such as mortgage interest and charitable contributions, are key areas for potential reform. The Ways and Means Committee has held hearings on state tax provisions. The Ways and Means Committee has recently held hearings on provisions affecting state and local governments, charitable contributions, and housing tax provisions, including the home mortgage interest deduction. Itemized deductions account for about one-fifth of all tax expenditures and may be easy targets of reform due to their visibility and policy grounds. While they have broad support and are claimed by roughly one-third of tax filers, arguments can be made to justify some deductions. Reducing incentives and subsidies that alter taxpayers' costs could contribute to tax simplification. Tax reform aims to reduce incentives and subsidies that influence taxpayers' choices and broaden the tax base to raise revenue without increasing tax rates. There is a trade-off between a broader base and lower rates to meet revenue targets. Base-broadening proposals could have unintended effects on savings incentives and labor supply. Various suggestions to limit itemized deductions have been put forth by policymakers, economists, and tax experts, considering their potential revenue gains and impact on taxpayer behavior and the economy. Individual income tax filers can claim either a standard deduction or itemized deductions on Form 1040. The standard deduction is a fixed amount based on filing status, while itemized deductions require listing specific expenses. For more detailed information on tax deductions, refer to CRS Report R42872 and CRS Report R43012. Tax filers can claim either standard or itemized deductions on their tax return. AGI is the income measurement before deductions are taken into account. Generally, individuals with itemized deductions greater than the standard deduction find it worthwhile to itemize. The tax benefit of itemizing is the amount that exceeds the standard deduction, multiplied by the top marginal tax rate. Around one-third of taxpayers, mainly in the middle to upper income brackets, itemize deductions. At incomes over $200,000, 95% of taxpayers itemized, with two-thirds below $100,000. Middle-class taxpayers also itemize deductions. Itemized deductions vary in purpose and target different tax filers, some classified as tax expenditures under the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974. The Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) provides estimates for tax expenditures, including special exclusions, exemptions, deductions, credits, and preferential tax rates. Some itemized deductions are not considered tax expenditures, such as employee job expenses. These deductions are included to simplify tax compliance and administration. Detailed tables in Appendix A show the number of claimants and deduction sizes for each type of itemized deduction, totaling $1.1 trillion in deductions. In 2010, tax expenditures totaling $1.1 trillion included state and local deductions for income, sales, and property taxes, mortgage interest deductions, and charitable contribution deductions. State income taxes had the largest deduction at $246 billion, followed by real estate property taxes at $172 billion. Optional sales tax deductions were $16 billion, and personal property taxes were $7 billion. Mortgage interest deductions totaled $401 billion, with charitable contributions totaling $172 billion. In 2010, deductible contributions totaled $172 billion, with $135 billion in cash, $44 billion in property, and $31 billion carried over from prior years. Medical and dental expense deductions above the 7.5% floor amounted to $85 billion. These deductions serve various purposes, such as reflecting ability to pay taxes and encouraging homeownership and charitable contributions. State and local income taxes deductions may incentivize governments to enact these taxes. Itemized deductions not classified as tax expenditures reached $264 billion. Itemized deductions totaling $264 billion were not classified as tax expenditures, with only $117 billion allowed due to restrictions like floors and ceilings. These deductions include investment interest expenses, unreimbursed employee expenses, tax preparation expenses, and gambling losses. Restrictions on itemized deductions can be in the form of dollar amounts or percentage-of-income amounts, limiting the total amount that can be deducted. Pease is a tax provision that affects higher-income tax filers with an AGI over $250,000. It results in an increased tax rate rather than a true limit on deductions. Two itemized deductions are subject to caps: mortgage interest deductions are allowed on the first $1 million of a mortgage, and charitable contributions are subject to percentage-of-income ceilings. Cash contributions are limited to 50% of income and 30% for contributions to certain nonprofits. The tax provision Pease affects higher-income tax filers with an AGI over $250,000, resulting in an increased tax rate. Charitable contributions are subject to percentage-of-income ceilings, with cash contributions limited to 50% of income and 30% for certain nonprofits. Deductions for appreciated property are capped at 30% and 20%. Individuals aged 70\u00bd or older can contribute IRA withdrawals directly to charity, capped at $100,000. Medical deductions are allowable in excess of 10% of AGI. Excess of 10% of AGI allowable for casualty and theft losses, limited to excess over $100. Employee expenses, tax preparation expenses, and certain miscellaneous deductions limited to amounts over 2% of income. Pease is not a true limit on itemized deductions, triggered by AGI threshold, reducing total deductions by 3% of AGI exceeding threshold. Pease's limitations reduce itemized deductions by 3% of AGI exceeding a threshold, capped at 80% of deduction value. This functions like an additional tax rate, increasing taxable income by $1.03 for every $1 increase in AGI. This results in an effective marginal tax rate 3% higher than the statutory rate. For example, a tax filer in the 33% bracket faces an effective rate of 33.99%. Pease's total reduction cannot exceed 80% of deductions. Pease's limitations on itemized deductions are capped at 80% of the deduction value, affecting higher-income itemizers. Reforms could include overall limits or specific revisions to deductions to increase federal revenue or reduce tax benefits. The curr_chunk discusses various justifications for tax reforms, including increasing federal revenue, reducing economic distortions, improving equity, and simplifying the tax code. It also mentions the potential impact of restricting itemized deductions on revenue generation. The potential impact of restricting itemized deductions on revenue generation is significant, with options like limiting tax exclusions for employer contributions to health care and retirement plans being larger sources of annual revenue loss. Various reasons may limit these options, such as difficulties in imputing income and protecting savings incentives. The maximum revenue gain from eliminating itemized deductions is projected at $190 billion in 2015. The projected revenue gain from eliminating itemized deductions is $190 billion in 2015, which is a significant portion of individual income taxes and the projected deficit. Proposals to limit deductions may not raise as much revenue, with some focusing on lowering tax rates rather than reducing subsidies. Lower tax rates are seen as limiting the distorting effects of taxes on income and long-term growth. Base broadening to permit lower rates should not be expected to have a supply-side effect, as restrictions on itemized deductions can have similar effects to tax rate increases. The focus should be on affecting the tax collected from a marginal dollar of income, which can impact taxpayers in different brackets. Designing an efficient proposal to reform itemized deductions without increasing effective marginal rates may conflict with distributional objectives. Base-broadening can increase marginal tax rates in some cases, as argued by Martin Sullivan, Chief Economist at Tax Analysts. Base-broadening can increase marginal tax rates by expanding taxable income for some itemizers, pushing them into higher tax brackets. The effective marginal tax rate (EMTR) is impacted by restricting itemized deductions, as it determines the share of an additional dollar of income paid in taxes. Eliminating deductions raises the EMTR, not the statutory tax rate. The effective marginal tax rate (EMTR) can rise if deductions are eliminated, impacting the supply of labor or savings. Studies show mixed opinions on the significance of these effects. For example, the deduction for state and local income taxes can increase the EMTR, with an average deduction of 5.5% for those with an AGI of $200,000 or more in 2010. If state income tax is deductible, the total EMTR can be higher, reaching 38.9% in some cases. The elimination or capping of the state and local income tax deduction can raise the Effective Marginal Tax Rate (EMTR) to 41%, an increase of 2.1 percentage points for tax filers. Retaining the deduction and raising the federal statutory rate to 37.2% would have a similar effect. The impact on EMTR depends on the proposed change and the nature of itemized deductions. Itemized deductions in the federal tax code serve specific purposes, whether to reflect income generation costs or promote social policy goals. The net effects of these provisions have been deemed desirable by past Congresses. Traditional tax reform assumes that provisions to be eliminated distort resource allocation. Specific attention is needed for each itemized deduction, as they may distort spending towards housing, charity, or state and local services. Some argue for raising revenue through restrictions on itemized deductions to concentrate income tax on higher incomes, while others oppose for distributional or equity reasons. Current tax provisions favor home ownership, charity, and state/local services, leading to debates on horizontal equity. Tax reform may aim to simplify the tax code by eliminating itemized deductions, which could streamline tax filings. However, retaining and restricting these deductions may complicate tax planning and filing. Various proposals suggest limiting itemized deductions to address equity concerns and simplify the tax system. Some proposals suggest capping itemized deductions to reduce revenue losses and limit tax benefits for higher-income filers. The flat-cap option proposes a set limit on deductions, ranging from $17,000 to $50,000 per joint tax filing unit. Implementing a flat-cap would add complexity to tax filing but is simpler compared to other reform options as it does not depend on income calculations or other tax benefits. A flat-cap proposal suggests setting a limit on deductions, ranging from $17,000 to $50,000 per joint tax filing unit. This option adds complexity to tax filing but is simpler compared to other reform options as it does not depend on income calculations or other tax benefits. Tax filers may need to choose which deductions to claim if their potential deductions exceed the flat-dollar value cap. The proposal could exclude deductions for unusual expenses like medical costs and theft losses. The cap would impact different income classes, with a $17,000 cap affecting most itemizers and a $50,000 cap mainly affecting higher-income itemizers. After proposing a flat-cap on deductions ranging from $17,000 to $50,000 per joint tax filing unit, approximately 6% of itemizers with incomes above $250,000 would be affected. Taxpayers might adjust deductible activities like charitable contributions, leading to potential reductions in other deductions. Prospective homebuyers could opt for smaller purchases or rental housing, while taxpayers with assets might pay down mortgages. Another option is to restrict total claim amounts to a percentage of the tax filer's AGI, adding complexity to the tax-filing process. An alternative option to a flat dollar-value cap on deductions is an AGI cap, which would require itemizers to calculate their total itemized deductions as a share of their AGI. This approach could affect deductions like state and local income taxes proportionately with income. However, implementing a broad cap based on AGI would impact both higher-income and lower- or middle-income earners. An AGI cap could be applied to certain deductions, such as state and local taxes or charitable gifts, to reduce the negative effects on middle-income tax filers. Limiting the value of tax provisions after applying tax rates is another way to restrict itemized deductions. In his FY2015 budget recommendation, President Obama proposed limiting the tax rate that applies to itemized deductions, certain above-the-line deductions, and certain income exclusions to 28% for tax filers in the top three brackets (33%, 35%, and 39.6%). Taxpayers affected would generally be those with incomes of $250,000 or more. Researchers proposed the FFM option to limit certain tax expenditures, including itemized deductions, to 2% of a tax filer's AGI. This proposal aims to enhance progressivity in the tax system and reduce tax expenditures without changing statutory tax rates. The FFM proposal aims to limit itemized deductions to 2% of a tax filer's AGI, focusing on higher-income taxpayers. Options include a $10,000 flat-cap and phasing in FFM for tax filers earning between $250,000 and $500,000. The rationale is that over 40% of tax expenditures benefit those with incomes above $200,000. The FFM proposal aims to limit itemized deductions for higher-income taxpayers by implementing a $10,000 flat-cap and phasing in FFM for tax filers earning between $250,000 and $500,000. To simplify tax administration, deductions could be restricted to extraordinary expenditures exceeding a certain dollar or percentage of income floor. This approach would proportionally reduce deductions for higher-income earners. Taxpayers in different income classes would be affected differently by proposed changes to itemized deductions. One option is to convert deductions into credits, with proponents arguing that credits are fairer. Opponents believe this change could reduce incentives for certain individuals, especially higher-income earners. Converting deductions into credits may reduce incentives for certain individuals. Credits could be structured as non-refundable or refundable, with the latter providing a dollar-for-dollar reduction in tax liability regardless of the taxpayer's marginal tax rate. Extending credits to all taxpayers, including those taking the standard deduction, could limit revenue gains and complicate tax filing. Restricting credits to those not taking the standard deduction is an option. The choice between deductions and credits should depend on the purpose, with deductions suitable for correcting ability to pay taxes and credits for encouraging specific behaviors. The debate over whether to use deductions or credits for certain behaviors like charitable contributions remains unclear. Eliminating all itemized deductions could reduce tax compliance costs and eliminate the unequal value of deductions based on tax rates. However, the variety of justifications for itemized deductions makes it challenging to argue for their complete elimination. The Simpson-Bowles report discusses the complexities of reforming or eliminating itemized deductions. The Simpson-Bowles proposal calls for eliminating itemized deductions and converting some tax expenditures to credits. Taxpayers can claim a standard deduction and personal exemptions. Mortgage interest and charitable contributions would be replaced with non-refundable tax credits. The Domenici-Rivlin plan also eliminates itemized deductions and offers a 20% credit for home mortgage interest expenses. The D-R proposal includes phasing down interest credit from 20% to 15% over five years and introducing a 15% refundable credit for charitable contributions. It also suggests changes in tax administration, such as mortgage brokers and charities applying for a matching grant from the IRS. This would result in a 15% reduction in home mortgage interest payments for taxpayers. The aim is to reduce the need for some individuals to file a tax return and potentially lower tax administration costs. Eliminating non-tax expenditure itemized deductions would change the taxable income base, potentially causing taxes to rise for individuals with high medical expenses. Instead of complete elimination, a percentage of deductions could be disallowed. Options for reforming major itemized deductions include mortgage interest, state and local taxes, and charitable contributions. The itemized deduction for home mortgage interest expenses is currently limited to interest on the first $1 million of mortgage debt, combined on a primary and secondary residence, and first $100,000 of home equity debt. Potential reforms could include reducing the cap on eligible mortgages to $500,000 or implementing a declining limit to phase out the provision over time. The mortgage interest deduction could be limited to primary residences, excluding second or vacation homes. Interest on home equity loans may be disallowed or the deductible ceiling reduced. The growth in home equity loan deductions is linked to the Tax Reform Act of 1986. The deduction for qualified mortgage insurance premiums, considered as interest, could be allowed to lapse along with other extender provisions. The proposal includes a credit for interest paid on home mortgages that would benefit all homeowners, even those who do not itemize. This credit may result in a net revenue loss depending on the chosen rate, as it extends benefits to lower-income taxpayers. Additionally, the proposal includes a matching grant for mortgage lenders as a substitute for the mortgage deduction. The extenders include an option to deduct state and local sales taxes instead of income taxes, temporarily in effect through 2013. Sales taxes were reintroduced as a deduction recently and might be allowed to lapse permanently. Another deduction at risk is for personal property taxes, mainly on motor vehicles, claimed by fewer filers than state and local income taxes. The deductions for state and local income, sales, and property taxes may be considered for more limited reforms, with a proposed cap on deductions based on a percent of adjusted gross income. This cap would primarily target certain tax filers, such as those with $500,000 or more of income. Revision of the deduction for charitable contributions is also a key policy concern to retain giving incentives. The revision of the deduction for charitable contributions may involve implementing a floor to only allow deductions above a certain dollar amount or percentage of income. This approach aims to raise revenue while maintaining the incentive to give, eliminate deductions for small amounts, and simplify record-keeping. Proposals to convert the deduction into a credit could increase complexity and limit revenue-raising capacity. The D-R plan suggests providing grants to charities as a substitute for credits to streamline tax administration. Reforms for charitable contributions could target gifts of property, including items that have lost or appreciated in value. Gifts of property, including clothes, household items, and appreciated assets like art and stocks, accounted for 26% of contributions in 2010. Higher-income taxpayers tend to give appreciated property, while middle-class taxpayers often donate household items and clothes. Tax filers may overstate the value of non-cash donations to claim larger deductions. Options to restrict deductions for clothes and household items include setting a dollar ceiling or allowing only a fraction of the market value to be deducted. The Joint Committee on Taxation proposed a $500 limit on deductions for non-cash donations. Allowing deduction of a fraction of the value may encourage donations. Gifts of appreciated property have tax benefits and make up a significant portion of donations, with stocks, real estate, and art being common types of assets donated. There is a risk of overvaluing assets to claim larger deductions. More equal treatment between cash and property gifts could be considered. Imposing capital gains tax on appreciation of charitable gifts could lead to more equal treatment between cash and property gifts. Disallowing deductions for appreciation in value would encourage taxpayers to sell assets and donate cash proceeds, increasing the charitable deduction value. This approach would also address over-valuation issues by incentivizing individuals to find market prices for donated items. Expired tax extender provisions related to charitable contributions may be reconsidered for reauthorization in 2014 if itemized deduction rules are revised. The provision allows individuals aged 70\u00bd to donate IRA distributions directly to charity, excluding them from gross income calculations. This benefits non-itemizers, reduces AGI, and may help avoid taxation on Social Security benefits. Extenders also address conservation property treatment and propose expanding benefits for charitable contributions, including deductions for non-itemizers and lottery winners, and allowing IRA direct contributions. Expanding IRA contribution allowances and revenue estimates for proposals to restrict itemized deductions are presented in the report. The Tax Policy Center's estimates show that eliminating all itemized deductions could increase revenue by $190.1 billion in 2015, potentially offsetting revenue losses from a reduction in tax rates. The elimination of all itemized deductions could lead to a 10.6% reduction in statutory tax rates across all marginal tax brackets. JCT estimates the revenue loss in 2015 for each itemized deduction, including medical expenses. Real estate taxes are separated from other deductions, with the majority being for income taxes. Table 5 and Table 6 provide revenue estimates for various limits to itemized deductions in 2015, including dollar ceilings and restrictions on the value of deductions. Some options exclude restrictions on charitable deductions, while others could result in significant revenue increases. Minor proposals may yield modest amounts of revenue, while more significant options, such as ceilings on mortgage interest, could have a larger impact. The focus is on analyzing proposals for itemized deductions to increase revenue. Restrictions on tax provisions may raise effective marginal rates, contradicting the goal of lowering tax rates. Various revisions impact the effective marginal rate by affecting tax-free uses of income, particularly through itemized deductions. The calculations in this section illustrate the impact of itemized deductions on effective marginal tax rates. The deductions can affect the last dollar of income and are higher at the margin than on average. The share of returns and AGI for two deductions tends to rise with income at almost every class. The share of returns and AGI for two deductions tends to rise with income at almost every class over an AGI of $200,000: state income taxes and charitable gifts. Deductions rising as a share of income implies that the deduction out of each marginal dollar is growing, potentially increasing effective taxation at the margin. Mortgage interest deduction declines with income at very high levels, reflecting that higher-income tax filers may not need to borrow as much to purchase homes. The declining value of property tax deduction claims as a share of AGI is a concern, as itemized deductions become a smaller percentage of income as income rises. Other provisions, such as tax-exempt income from employer-provided benefits like health insurance and pensions, can also impact the effective marginal tax rate. Tax exclusions for health insurance may not increase with income, while pension benefits are more likely to be marginal. Tax-exempt state and local bonds may rise with income and be marginal for taxpayers with higher tax rates. Table 7 highlights a potential issue with base-broadening through restricting itemized deductions, as the costs may fall on middle-income itemizers while tax benefits from rate reductions spread across all filers. Most itemized deductions are claimed by those with AGI under $200,000, limiting potential revenue gains. High-income taxpayers would not benefit enough from rate reductions to offset the loss of deductions. Lowering ceilings could increase revenue but burden middle-class taxpayers. Restricting itemized deductions could burden middle-class taxpayers as it would reduce revenue for top rate reductions. This could impact effective marginal tax rates and tax expenditures, not accounting for lower rates on capital gains or Medicare taxes. The analysis illustrates the potential impact of restricting itemized tax deductions on effective marginal tax rates for high-income taxpayers. Eliminating these deductions could increase EMTRs across a broad income range, affecting tax filers with incomes well above $1 million. Eliminating certain itemized deductions could increase effective marginal tax rates for a wide range of income levels, including lower-income tax filers. For example, eliminating taxes, mortgage interest, and charity deductions could increase rates by 3.7 percentage points for some tax filers. Eliminating certain itemized deductions could increase effective marginal tax rates for a wide range of income levels. The deductions that are marginal for taxpayers in the top bracket and at very high income levels could lead to a 4.4 percentage point increase. A flat-cap approach could direct more of the revenue increase to higher-income tax filers, with a suggested cap of around $50,000 to largely affect taxpayers with $250,000 or more in income. According to Table 8, taxpayers with incomes over $200,000 would see reduced deductions of around 8%, raising effective marginal tax rates by about 3 percentage points. For very high income tax filers, deductions would be reduced by about 11%, raising rates by over 4 percentage points. This would increase the top statutory rate from 35.2% to 39.6%. Setting a flat-cap on itemized deductions could potentially increase effective tax rates for some tax filers, especially if deductions exceed the cap. If the cap is set at low levels, it could impact a wide range of incomes. However, if designed to avoid affecting those with AGI less than $250,000, it may not generate significant revenue. Implementing a percentage of income cap on deductions could limit the impact to a smaller group of tax filers. A percentage of income cap on deductions could limit the impact to a smaller group of tax filers, potentially shifting more of the burden of a tax increase to those with AGI less than $250,000. One suggestion is to allow both a dollar ceiling and a percentage of income ceiling, with the tax filer choosing the higher of the two. Alternatively, a percentage of income ceiling could be placed on itemized deductions for higher-income tax filers. Limiting the value of certain tax expenditures, such as deductions for state and local income taxes and charitable gifts, could increase effective marginal tax rates for higher-income tax filers. For example, a 6% cap on deductions would raise revenue from tax filers with an AGI over $1 million while still allowing most deductions to be taken by others. This proposal would limit the increase in effective tax rates for affected individuals to about 1\u00bd percentage points on average. Limiting the value of itemized deductions can reduce the effective marginal tax rate (EMTR) for tax filers facing a top marginal statutory tax rate. President Obama's proposal to limit the tax rate for itemized deductions could increase the EMTR for those in the top tax brackets. This option may raise some revenue but could be limited in its effectiveness. The proposal to substitute a credit for a deduction could raise revenue and impact tax filers, especially those in the top tax brackets. Different credit rates would have varying effects on itemizers and non-itemizers, potentially increasing effective marginal tax rates. Various approaches examined in the report could lead to higher EMTRs and target restrictions on itemized deductions. Approaches to target restrictions on itemized tax deductions may have limited ability to solely affect higher-income tax filers, impacting revenue goals. Eliminating all itemized deductions could raise the top tax rate by 4.4 percentage points, while an across-the-board reduction could lower it by 4.2 percentage points. The effects of these approaches are largely offsetting, with a potential 5 percentage point reduction for high-income individuals. The effects of restricting itemized deductions on high tax rate individuals are largely offsetting. Dollar caps would raise less revenue but have the same marginal effects. Economic analysis may overlook the effects on Effective Marginal Tax Rates (EMTRs) and their impact on labor supply, savings, and economic growth. Understanding EMTRs versus statutory marginal tax rates is crucial for dynamic scoring in cost estimates. The analysis suggests that tax reform focused on lowering statutory rates may not achieve its purpose, as behavioral effects could be overestimated. Most evidence indicates that marginal effects on labor supply and saving behavior are small, making higher effective marginal tax rates for some tax filers less significant. The report emphasizes the importance of understanding Effective Marginal Tax Rates (EMTRs) versus statutory rates for dynamic scoring in cost estimates. The report discusses the merits of base broadening in tax reform, focusing on efficiency reasons for eliminating or revising tax provisions. It addresses the incentives and effectiveness of subsidies, with detailed information available in other CRS reports. Homeownership subsidies are justified for economic efficiency rather than social policy goals. Subsidies for homeownership can be justified based on economic efficiency, as individuals may not consider the social benefits of owning a home. The literature is inconclusive on the merits of subsidizing homeownership, but there are positive social benefits such as spillover effects in communities. Homeownership is seen as beneficial for stability, property maintenance, community involvement, and as a retirement asset, especially for moderate-income families. Economists support subsidies for homeownership from an economic perspective. Subsidies for homeownership can be justified based on economic efficiency, as there may be market failures in capturing the social value of spillover benefits. Homeownership can have negative effects like exclusionary policies, discrimination, and limiting job creation. Concentration of assets in a home can lead to decreased diversity and increased financial risk. Labor immobility can result from households unable to easily sell their homes. Labor immobility caused by homeowners unable to sell their homes can lead to societal burdens like increased claims for unemployment benefits. The effects of these issues are challenging to estimate, raising questions about the benefits of providing large incentives for homeownership. Tax deductions for mortgage interest and property taxes may increase homeownership rates and home sizes, but research suggests that tenure choice (renting vs. owning) has a greater impact on community benefits. Despite tax benefits, the rate of homeownership has remained stable over time. Historically, homeownership rates have remained stable despite changes in inflation and tax rates. The major barrier to owning a home is saving for a down payment, unaffected by tax subsidies. Tax deductions for mortgage interest and property taxes may incentivize individuals already inclined to own to spend more on housing. Proposals to restrict deductions aim to target moderate-income individuals. The current home equity loan deduction is not targeted towards a particular behavior because home equity funds can be used to finance spending unrelated to the home. Instead of these tax incentives, a more desirable alternative for some could be loan programs that make it possible for younger families to acquire homes. Economists argue that owner-occupied housing is also subsidized by the exclusion of net imputed rental income. Eliminating deductions for home mortgage interest and property taxes could still provide tax benefits for homeowners by increasing their incomes with net rental income. This could disadvantage lower-income tax filers compared to those with assets to offset the loss of deductions. Paying off mortgages could help retain tax exemption for some individuals. Tax benefits for charity are supported by economists due to market failures like free-rider problems. These issues arise when individuals benefit from charitable contributions without contributing themselves, leading to undersupply of contributions. Deductions for charitable contributions may face scrutiny due to concerns about individuals giving less. The deduction for charitable contributions may face scrutiny due to concerns about individuals giving less than the revenue loss associated with their tax deduction claim. This could lead to government providing more funds for charitable purposes through grants rather than tax deductions. Additionally, contributors may receive direct or implicit benefits, or their contributions may go to charities that not everyone benefits from, such as fringe benefits like front-row seats at the orchestra or box seats at sporting events. A floor for charitable contributions deduction is being considered as a reform option to ensure that a larger portion of contributions goes directly to aid those in poverty. Different floor options, such as 2% of income, $500, or $1,000, could increase tax-induced charitable contributions per dollar of revenue loss and improve tax compliance by excluding small donations. With a 2% floor, 14% of contributions would no longer have a marginal incentive, resulting in a 37% revenue gain. The revenue gain from disallowing contributions up to 2% of income would be 37% of the total tax expenditure. This gain is larger because higher-income individuals would still have a marginal incentive to give. Deductions for state and local taxes are seen as a federal subsidy to the states, potentially encouraging more taxes or government services at the state and local level. The assessment questions whether federal taxpayers should subsidize activities in specific states or localities through tax subsidies or direct grants. Some government services provided by state and local governments benefit all federal taxpayers to some extent, while others do not. Overall, state and local government spending primarily benefits their own residents. The federal tax deductions for state and local taxes primarily benefit residents of those states with higher-income tax rates, leading to an inequality in benefits. Alternative policies could still support state and local governments while achieving other federal tax reform goals. The deduction for state and local taxes could be capped, replaced with a credit, or certain taxes disallowed. Economists analyze tax policy through vertical and horizontal equity. Vertical equity affects rate reduction and revenue neutrality. Base-broadening can indicate which income groups are impacted. Base-broadening for revenue purposes reveals which income groups pay more taxes. Higher income classes may contribute more revenue. Itemized deductions, such as charitable contributions and state/local taxes, benefit higher-income groups more. In contrast, mortgage interest and real estate tax deductions benefit lower-income groups. The distribution of tax benefits from certain itemized deductions is skewed towards higher-income levels due to income concentration among fewer tax filers. Concentration curves visually illustrate this, showing that tax benefits are larger for lower-income taxpayers if above the diagonal line. The tax benefits from certain itemized deductions tend to favor higher-income taxpayers, with only the deduction for medical expenses showing some progressivity. Data from the Tax Policy Center show that these deductions make after-tax income more unequal, particularly for provisions like home mortgage interest and property taxes. The tax benefits of itemized deductions favor higher-income taxpayers, with the mortgage interest deduction being more beneficial for middle and upper classes. Deductions for charitable gifts and state/local taxes increase with income. The percentage increase in after-tax income from deductions can inform potential cuts in statutory tax rates for a revenue-neutral base-broadening restriction. At the $500,000 income level, rates could be cut by approximately 1.75 percentage points. The top statutory tax rate could be reduced by about 5 percentage points in a revenue-neutral manner if the itemized deduction provisions for charitable gifts, state and local taxes, and mortgage interest were eliminated for higher-income tax units. Implementing a flat-cap of $50,000 or limiting the value to 2% of income could restrict the tax benefits of itemized deductions for the highest income levels. The tax code recognizes factors like family size, health, and age that affect ability to pay income taxes, introducing horizontal inequities. For example, homeowners have a lower tax burden than renters, even with the same income. Charitable donations also create disparities in tax burdens. Taxpayers with different preferences, such as charitable donations or medical expenses, can have varying tax burdens. Itemized deductions can help increase equity among taxpayers with similar abilities to pay. For instance, a mortgage interest deduction can benefit homeowners with more financed assets. However, it may also create disparities between homeowners and renters. Eliminating deductions for state and local taxes could result in higher federal taxes for those in high-tax states. Reforms to simplify tax administration and compliance may include repealing itemized deductions or specific deductions. This could reduce record-keeping and auditing for deductions, making it easier for taxpayers to decide between itemizing deductions or claiming the standard deduction. Implementing a floor on charitable deductions could eliminate the need for record-keeping for small donations. Limits on contributions of property, such as household goods and clothing, could reduce administrative costs. Limiting the deduction for appreciated assets to basis could improve asset valuation. Some approaches may complicate tax compliance by requiring additional computations, especially for high-income taxpayers. The FFM proposal would require multiple tax calculations for high-income taxpayers, including basic, adjustments for dividends and capital gains, and for the AMT. This could complicate tax choices for individuals, even with tax preparation software. Additionally, comparing tax liability with and without deductions, coordinating with capital gains and dividends, and considering the standard deduction could further complicate tax calculations. The presence of aggregate ceilings or floors in tax calculations could complicate decisions on charitable contributions, especially in the short term. Revisions to the treatment of donated property may require individuals to sell the property before donating, adding complexity. Transitional issues, particularly with mortgage interest deductions, could impact taxpayers who assumed deductibility when taking out mortgages. The tax reform legislation proposed by House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Camp includes significant changes to individual itemized deductions, particularly regarding mortgage interest deductions. Two potential solutions to address issues with the elimination of mortgage interest deductions are grandfathering existing mortgages or slowly lowering the cap on mortgages over time. Additionally, there are concerns about the short-term impact on the housing market, suggesting a gradual phase-down of caps as a possible solution. Proposed changes to itemized deductions include reducing the cap on home mortgage interest deductions to $500,000, repealing deductions for home equity loans, subjecting charitable contributions to a 2% of AGI floor, repealing state and local tax deductions except for those accrued in a trade or business, repealing casualty loss deductions for personal losses, repealing medical expenses deductions, and eliminating several miscellaneous itemized deductions. The House Ways and Means proposal aims to reduce the number of tax filers who itemize deductions by increasing the standard deduction and eliminating or reforming major itemized deductions. This could potentially increase effective marginal tax rates for tax filers. The Ways and Means draft proposal aims to reduce the number of tax filers itemizing deductions by increasing the standard deduction and reforming major itemized deductions. This could potentially increase effective marginal tax rates for tax filers. The draft also includes reforms to charitable deductions to increase economic efficiency and eliminate tax avoidance opportunities. The legislation claims to boost charitable giving by $2.2 billion annually, but this claim is questionable due to potential reductions in tax filers itemizing deductions. The draft tax reform proposal aims to reduce the number of tax filers itemizing deductions and decrease incentives for giving among middle- and upper-middle-income tax filers. The macroeconomic impact of the reform is uncertain. The lower cap on mortgage debt for the home mortgage interest deduction adds to the plan's progressivity. Repealing deductions for home equity interest, medical expenses, and casualty losses would make the tax code less equitable. A concise history of itemized deductions in the U.S. tax code since 1913 includes provisions for interest paid, casualty losses, state and local taxes, charitable contributions, health expenses, and miscellaneous expenses. Deductions expanded post-World War II, growing to approximately 3.7% of personal income. The growth of itemized deductions as a share of personal income increased from 3.7% in 1947 to 10% in 1969, then slightly decreased to 9% in 1979. The standard deduction also grew from 2.4% of income in 1969 to 6.5% in 1979, reducing the incentive for tax filers to itemize. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 aimed to broaden the tax base without raising tax rates. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 aimed to expand the tax base by reducing marginal tax rates, eliminating certain deductions like state and local sales taxes, and limiting others such as home mortgage interest deductions. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 limited itemized deductions to $1 million for married filing jointly and $500,000 for married filing separately, leading to a decrease in itemized deductions claims. However, the standard deduction increased, offsetting some of the decline. Congress has since authorized new itemized deductions, such as deducting state and local sales taxes and qualified home mortgage insurance premiums. The report presents data on itemized deductions claimed by tax filers in 2007, sourced from the IRS. Over 46.6 million filers itemized deductions totaling $1.2 trillion. Tables A-1 and A-2 show the number and amounts of deductions classified as tax expenditures, while Tables A-3 and A-4 show those not classified as tax expenditures."
