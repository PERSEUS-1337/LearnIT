The Commission must assess available alternatives, ensure regulations are accessible and written in plain language, and seek to improve regulatory results. The Commission must assess costs and benefits of regulatory alternatives, including not regulating, to maximize net benefits. This assessment must consider investor protection and promotion. The Commission will evaluate regulations to protect investors, promote efficiency, competition, and capital formation. It will assess if regulations impose the least burden on society and if they are inconsistent, incompatible, or duplicative of other Federal regulations. The Commission will consider the impact of regulations on investor choice, market liquidity, and small businesses. It will also explain comments received on the potential costs or benefits of proposed rules. The Commission will review existing regulations periodically to assess their effectiveness and make necessary modifications. The Commission reviews regulations to determine if they are necessary for public interest, investor protection, and promote efficiency and competition. Specifically, regulations impacting issuers with a public float of $250,000,000 or less are assessed for the burden versus benefit. Additionally, post-adoption impact assessments are conducted by the Commission.
