The Congress finds that American K-12 schools spend over $6 billion annually on energy costs, educators and students perform best in a comfortable, healthy environment, over half of schools are over 40 years old and need renovation, and inadequate ventilation, poor lighting, and uncomfortable temperatures are common issues in school buildings. Inefficient water use in older schools is common. Designing new schools with a whole building approach improves performance and reduces costs. Energy conservation in school construction and renovation projects can save a significant portion of current energy costs, allowing more funds for teachers and educational materials. The use of renewable energy sources in low-energy buildings can meet energy needs without additional emissions. Implementing environmentally friendly products and ensuring adequate fresh air supply can enhance indoor air quality in school buildings. Many school districts lack knowledge of advanced design and technologies for optimal implementation. The purpose of this Act is to assist school districts in constructing or renovating high performance, energy efficient, and environmentally sound elementary and secondary school buildings. The Act aims to help school districts build or renovate energy-efficient and environmentally friendly school buildings. The High Performance Schools Program is established in the Department of Energy to provide grants for energy-efficient school buildings. Grants can be given to school districts and State energy offices to promote energy efficiency. Grants for new school buildings aim to reduce energy use by at least 30 percent. Grants under the High Performance Schools Program are provided for energy-efficient school buildings, aiming to reduce energy use below baseline consumption. School districts must demonstrate a need for the grants and commit to developing high-performance buildings. Grants under subsection (b)(2) of the High Performance Schools Program can be used for evaluating compliance with the Act, distributing information on high performance school buildings, organizing programs for school personnel, and obtaining technical services for planning and designing such buildings. Grants under the High Performance Schools Program can be used for planning, designing, and monitoring high performance school buildings. Grants may also be used for promotional activities, facilitating financing, and working with school administrations and communities. Grants are provided to school districts with feasible plans developed in consultation with State energy and education offices. The State energy office determines feasible and appropriate grants for high performance school buildings. School districts are encouraged to supplement grant funds with other sources. The funds allocated under this Act are provided to State energy offices for grants to improve school buildings. Seventy percent is for grants under section 3(b)(1), fifteen percent each for grants under sections 3(b)(2) and 3(b)(3). The Secretary of Energy can retain up to $300,000 per year to assist State energy offices in implementing the Program. Authorization of appropriations for the Secretary of Energy to implement the Act is set at $200,000,000 annually from 2002 to 2005, with additional funding as needed from 2006 to 2011. The Secretary must provide biennial reports to Congress on State actions related to the Act, assessing the effectiveness of school funding eligibility calculations. The Act defines \"elementary school\" and \"secondary school\" as per the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. It also defines a \"high performance school building\" as one that maximizes renewable energy use, is cost-effective, uses environmentally friendly materials, and enhances indoor quality. \"Renewable energy\" refers to sustainable energy sources. The term \"renewable energy\" refers to energy produced from solar, wind, geothermal, hydroelectric, or biomass power."
