    "content": "AMENDMENTS TO THE NATIONAL WRITING PROJECT. Section 10991 of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 is amended to include new findings and purposes. Congress finds a crisis in writing in schools and workplaces due to factors like changing student demographics, limited English proficiency, teacher shortages, and the need for specialized knowledge. Reports show that many students are unprepared for college-level writing, leading to the widespread need for remedial writing courses in higher education institutions. Private 4-year institutions of higher education must provide remedial courses in writing to address concerns from American businesses about limited writing skills in both entry-level workers and executives. Writing is fundamental to learning and has historically been neglected in schools. It is a central feature in State and school district education standards, and the National Writing Project has been the only national program addressing the writing problem in schools since 1973. The National Writing Project is a nonprofit organization that improves teaching quality by developing teacher leaders who train other teachers in writing. Evaluations show positive impacts on writing teaching, student performance, and learning. It serves as a model for programs in various fields like math, science, history, and more. The National Writing Project supports and promotes the expansion of its network of sites across the United States to ensure teachers have access to its programs. It aims to maintain high-quality sites through ongoing review and support the dissemination of effective practices and research findings. The National Writing Project aims to disseminate effective practices and research findings about teaching writing, coordinate activities with other programs, and improve the quality of student writing and learning through grants and teacher training programs. The training programs under subsection (a) have a funding limit of $100,000 per contractor or $200,000 for a statewide program with at least five sites. Section 10992 of the Act is amended to repeal classroom teacher grants and authorize appropriations. Section 8332 is amended to increase funding from $4,000,000 in 1995 to $15,000,000 in 2000."
