    "content": "Many employers offer health insurance plans and other health-related benefits as part of an employee's total compensation. Employers typically cover a significant portion of the premiums, with 57% offering health insurance plans in 2015. A 40% excise tax will be imposed starting in 2020 on the cost of coverage exceeding a set limit, with the responsibility falling on the coverage provider to pay the tax to the IRS. The excise tax is imposed on the cost of coverage exceeding a set limit, with the responsibility falling on the coverage provider to pay the tax to the IRS. Applicable coverage, dollar limit, and excess benefit are key terms defined for determining the tax amount. Coverage under any group health plan provided by an employer is defined as excludable from an employee's gross income under Section 106 of the IRC. This includes employer contributions to health insurance premiums, MSAs, and HSAs. Applicable coverage includes employee-paid premiums, self-employed individuals' deductible health insurance, and coverage for government employees. The cost of applicable coverage for civilian employees of federal, state, or local governments is determined under rules similar to COBRA regulations. Certain arrangements are excluded from applicable coverage, and the cost is calculated based on specific criteria outlined in the statute and Notice 2015-16. For COBRA purposes, the cost of the premium for health insurance continuation is determined using rules from Section 4980B(f)(4) of the IRC. The application of these rules in the context of the excise tax is still unclear. Treasury and IRS are considering various approaches outlined in Notice 2015-16. Specific calculation rules exist for determining the cost of applicable coverage, excluding any portion attributable to the excise tax. Costs are calculated separately for single and non-single coverage. The cost of applicable coverage for retired employees, health care FSAs, Archer MSAs, and HSAs is determined based on various factors. The excise tax is assessed on the excess benefit of an employee's applicable coverage. If the cost is not determined monthly, it will be allocated as prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury. The excise tax is assessed on the excess benefit of an employee's applicable coverage, which exceeds dollar limits set by the ACA. The limits for 2018 were $10,200 for single coverage and $27,500 for non-single coverage, adjusted annually. The CAA of 2016 delayed the tax until 2020 without changing the 2018 limits. The 2020 limits are estimated to be around $10,800 for single coverage and $29,100 for non-single coverage. The dollar limits for coverage could be adjusted based on employees' demographic characteristics, using the BCBS Standard plan. The adjustment considers age and gender differences between the employer's workforce and the national workforce. The excess cost of the BCBS Standard plan for the employer's workforce compared to the national workforce determines the potential increase in dollar limits. The BCBS Standard plan may be adjusted for the national workforce, retirees aged 55 and older who do not qualify for Medicare, and individuals in high-risk professions such as law enforcement, fire protection, emergency medical care, and longshore work. The excise tax is not assessed on an employee in high-risk professions like longshore work, construction, mining, agriculture, forestry, and fishing. Dollar limits are increased by $1,650 for self-only coverage and $3,450 for other coverage. The tax is assessed on the entity providing the coverage. The excise tax on excess benefits under the ACA is the responsibility of each coverage provider based on their share of the excess benefit. Employers must calculate and notify the Treasury Secretary and providers of the amount owed. Penalties may apply for incorrect calculations, and the excise tax is nondeductible for coverage providers. The CAA of 2016 modified the ACA to allow coverage providers to deduct the excise tax, which is one of several taxes to raise revenue for the ACA. The excise tax is estimated to increase federal revenues by $87 billion between 2016 and 2025, with most of the revenue coming from increases in taxable income. The excise tax and its impact on taxable income are discussed. Employer-sponsored health insurance and benefits are usually excluded from employees' gross income for tax purposes. These exclusions result in significant revenue loss for the federal government, with an estimated $785 billion in foregone revenue between 2014 and 2018. Policymakers are considering modifying or repealing these exclusions to generate additional revenue. Ending or modifying the tax exclusion could generate significant revenue by indirectly limiting it through the excise tax. The revenue raised will come from the excise tax collection and increases in taxable income, as employers are expected to reduce health coverage to avoid the tax. This shift in compensation from health benefits to taxable wages will result in higher taxable wages for affected employees, with about one-quarter of the revenue coming from collection. About one-quarter of the revenue raised from the excise tax will come from collection, while three-quarters will stem from employers' responses to the tax."
