    "content": "The \"Americans Giving Care to Elders (AGE) Act of 2018\" is a new law that introduces a credit for eldercare expenses under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The \"Americans Giving Care to Elders (AGE) Act of 2018\" introduces a tax credit for eldercare expenses. The credit allows individuals with qualifying individuals to claim 20% of eldercare expenses, with the percentage decreasing for higher income levels. A qualifying individual is defined as someone who is at least 65 years old. An individual, aged 65 or older, needing help with daily activities, and living with the taxpayer or their spouse, qualifies as a dependent for the eldercare tax credit. The term 'eldercare expenses' includes amounts paid for the care of a qualifying individual, such as medical care, lodging away from home, adult day care, custodial care, respite care, assistive technologies, environmental modifications. The term 'eldercare expenses' cover various services like medical care, adult day care, custodial care, respite care, assistive technologies, and home modifications. Adult day care refers to community-based programs for adults with impairments, while custodial care involves personal care services for daily living. The term 'respite care' provides temporary relief to caregivers. Eldercare expenses incurred at care centers outside the taxpayer's household must comply with state regulations. The term 'care center' refers to a facility that provides care for more than 6 individuals and receives payment for their services. The dollar limitation for eldercare expenses is $6,000 per taxable year. This amount is reduced by any dependent care assistance exclusion. The tax credit under section 129 is limited by the amount excluded from gross income. Special rules apply, such as no credit for payments to related individuals eligible for a deduction under section 151(c). Identifying information of the service provider is required for the credit. The taxpayer must include identifying information of the person or organization claiming the credit on the return. Failure to provide this information can be excused if due diligence was exercised. The taxpayer must also include the taxpayer identification number of any qualifying individual on the return to claim the credit. The taxpayer must include identifying information of the person or organization claiming the credit on the return. No credit shall be allowed if a credit is already claimed under section 21. The Secretary will prescribe necessary regulations for this section. Section 25E allows for expenses related to eldercare. Conforming amendments are made to sections 213(e) and 6213(g)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. These amendments apply to taxable years starting after the enactment of the Act."
