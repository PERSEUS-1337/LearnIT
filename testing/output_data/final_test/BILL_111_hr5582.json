The Act, titled the \"Private Property Rights Protection and Government Accountability Act\", includes findings that emphasize the importance of property rights in interstate commerce and the prohibition of public takings for private economic development. SEC. 3 prohibits States or political subdivisions from receiving Federal economic development funds for 10 years if they carry out public takings for private purposes affecting interstate commerce. SEC. 4 allows property owners to seek injunctive relief in court for such takings, with attorneys' fees covered. SEC. 5 provides definitions. The Act defines \"private purpose\" as the ownership, control, or use of property acquired through public taking by a private party that advances their economic interests, including economic development plans for increased tax revenue or employment. Private purpose refers to the ownership, control, or use of property acquired through public taking by a private party for private development, excluding general public use or benefit, and primarily benefiting the private party. Exceptions include conveying property for public ownership or to entities like common carriers. The curr_chunk discusses the various ways in which property can be acquired or used, including by a carrier for public use, to eliminate harmful uses, leasing to private entities for incidental use, and acquiring abandoned property. The curr_chunk defines Federal economic development funds as Federal funds administered by specific government agencies and distributed to states for promoting interstate commerce and improving infrastructure. The curr_chunk defines public taking as the transfer of property rights from a private owner to another person or public ownership without the owner's consent."
