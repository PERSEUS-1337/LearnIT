    "content": "Thailand's political instability has been ongoing for the past three years, with frequent changes in government and concerns about the erosion of democracy. The U.S. remains cautious but maintains its military alliance with Thailand. The outlook for stability in Thailand is uncertain, and the partnership with the United States may be at risk. Thailand's political turmoil since 2006 saw an interim military government, controversial court rulings leading to prime ministers' resignations, protests, and disruptions including the cancelation of an East Asian summit in 2009. Despite clashes and economic impacts, few deaths but over a hundred injuries occurred. The political turmoil in Thailand since 2006 has led to protests by two main groups: the People's Alliance for Democracy (PAD) and the United Front for Democracy Against Dictatorship (UDD). The PAD, supported by the elite establishment, accused Thaksin of corruption, leading to a military coup. The \"red shirts,\" Thaksin loyalists, claim the current government is illegitimate. Thaksin's rule was marked by alleged dismantling of traditional watchdog groups and institutions, leading to protests by groups like the PAD who viewed his successors as puppet leaders. The UDD, supported by popular elections, are frustrated with the judicial system. The Abhisit government has faced criticism for its handling of protests, with concerns about Thailand's drift away from democratic governance. Demonstrators have caused economic damage and disrupted high-profile events, raising worries among democracy advocates. The cancellation of a high-profile summit was embarrassing for Abhisit and reflected poorly on ASEAN. Thailand's standing among regional neighbors was diminished. The government faces challenges with the economy in recession and an insurgency in southern provinces. Calls for elections within a year are increasing, but Abhisit is hesitant, citing potential violence. Past elections have favored Thaksin's supporters, but it's uncertain if the current successor party would have the same success. Abhisit stresses national reconciliation and flexibility, supporting amendments to the constitution. Debate surrounds his authority, especially over the military, which traditionally holds significant power in Thai politics. Since the monarchy was established in 1932, Thailand has seen 18 military coups, with the 2006 coup being the first in 15 years. Intra-military rivalries and competition with the police complicate security forces' politics. The military has taken control, governed, and returned power to elected officials since 2006, showing restraint in handling protests. Despite this, the military still wields significant influence over current events, refraining from seizing power outright when Thaksin allies regained control. The military has remained a relatively quiet observer and light enforcer of order since relinquishing control after Thaksin allies won power back in popular elections. However, some observers still view the military as a wild card, insisting that civilian leadership lacks full independence. Meanwhile, an insurgency in Thailand's southern provinces has claimed over 3,400 lives since 2004, with past governments failing to quell the violence. The military's reluctance to cede authority in the region may hinder government efforts to address the issue. Thaksin's rise to power upset the delicate balance in Thailand's democracy, leading to chaos. His assertiveness as prime minister gave unprecedented power to the elected government, causing tension with traditional power centers like the palace and military. Thaksin's assertive leadership as prime minister led to tension with traditional power centers in Thailand, resulting in a coup in 2006. The coup highlighted the limitations of Thailand's democratic institutions and the influence of military and palace elites. Thaksin, who has been out of the country since 2008, is evading extradition by moving between various locations in Europe, Asia, Africa, and the Middle East. Despite initial beliefs that his power was waning, the April 2009 UDD demonstrations showed his continued influence. It remains uncertain if the counter-establishment movement he sparked is sustained by his charisma or reflects deeper societal tensions in Thailand. Thaksin's return to Thai politics cannot be ruled out, despite his background in business. The future of Thai politics may see Thaksin's return despite warrants for his arrest. The role of the palace, led by King Bhumiphol, is crucial for stability, although the king's health is a concern. The king's silence during political instability raises questions about continuity in Thai society. Thailand's political situation is closely watched by the United States and China due to its strategic importance in the Asia-Pacific region. The U.S. has imposed penalties in the past but lifted them after the 2007 polls, aiming to balance its strategic needs with promoting democracy. The ongoing political turmoil and separatist violence in southern provinces raise concerns about Thailand's stability. The U.S. response to Thailand's political turmoil following the 2007 polls was relatively mild. Many officials wanted to maintain strong relations with the elite despite the interruption of democratic practices. However, hopes for a smooth transition back to representative government were dashed as the turmoil continued. Thailand's status as an ASEAN leader and example of democratic rule has slipped. The U.S.-Thai alliance is seen as lacking strategic direction. The Obama Administration is looking towards cooperative relations with Indonesia, raising questions about Thailand's position as a favored U.S. partner in Southeast Asia. Decades of shared strategic interests and defense cooperation have strengthened the U.S.-Thai alliance, dating back to the 1954 Manila Pact and the 1962 Thanat-Rusk communiqu\u00e9. Thailand's role as a key anti-Communist ally during the Cold War and its support in various conflicts have solidified its status as a \"major non-NATO ally,\" granting access to U.S. aid and military assistance. However, some analysts question Thailand's position as the favored U.S. partner in Southeast Asia, as the Obama Administration shifts focus towards cooperative relations with Indonesia. Thailand's strategic value to the U.S. is highlighted through its role as a logistics hub for relief efforts and hosting of military exercises. Despite criticism of U.S. efforts to promote democratic values, maintaining strong ties with the Thai military is crucial for regional contingencies. Thailand's importance as a democratic ally in the region is emphasized, although doubts exist about its willingness to allow U.S. military operations. Thailand's reliability as a U.S. ally is questioned due to doubts about allowing U.S. military use of facilities and reluctance to extradite international suspects. Joint intelligence operations may be decreasing, raising concerns about the alliance. The competition with Beijing for influence in Southeast Asia motivates the U.S. to maintain strong relations with Bangkok. Thailand's political turmoil has raised concerns about potential strengthening of defense ties between Bangkok and Beijing, amid fears of China taking advantage of any U.S. military withdrawal. Existing arms sales and military exercises with China have continued, while the U.S. military has also engaged with China. The disruption in Thailand has impacted ASEAN's activities and poses challenges for the organization's effectiveness. Thailand's political turmoil has disrupted ASEAN's activities, affecting its ability to function effectively in international diplomacy. UDD demonstrations led to the cancellation of the April 2009 ASEAN summit, causing embarrassment for Bangkok. ASEAN, a regional organization of 10 nations, struggles to maintain relevance in diplomatic affairs. The global economic downturn has weakened ASEAN, impacting broader cooperation mechanisms. Thailand's export-dependent economy has been hard-hit, raising concerns about its ability to regain strength post-recovery. Indonesia's democratic success challenges Thailand's regional leadership, while the US looks to capitalize on its ties with Indonesia. Thailand's role in Burma's economy is also significant. Thailand's significant role in Burma's economy may require assistance from Bangkok due to the decline in its regional clout."
