    "title": "AB 2868",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature finds and declares that the state has set energy storage procurement targets, allowed ratepayer funding for incentives, and reauthorized the self-generation incentive program for technologies like energy storage. The State Energy Resources Conservation and Development Commission funds research programs for energy storage. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Order No. 792 classifies energy storage devices as generating facilities. Industrial and commercial customers face challenges with time-of-use tariffs and demand charges. Section 745 of the Public Utilities Code allows default time-of-use pricing for residential customers. The state encourages energy storage to achieve ratepayer benefits, air quality standards, and climate goals. Energy storage systems help manage costs, reduce peak demands, improve public health, and create new business opportunities. This will also help keep manufacturing and industrial jobs in California. In California, the state promotes energy storage systems to achieve ratepayer benefits, air quality standards, and climate goals. A distributed energy storage system is defined as having a useful life of at least 10 years and being connected to the distribution system or located on the customer side of the meter. An energy storage management system allows an electrical corporation to manage the charging and discharging of the system for ratepayer benefits. The commission will direct the state's largest electrical corporations to propose programs and investments for distributed energy storage systems to achieve ratepayer benefits, reduce petroleum dependence, meet air quality standards, and lower greenhouse gas emissions. Programs should aim to minimize costs and maximize benefits. The commission may approve programs and investments in distributed energy storage systems with a total capacity not exceeding 500 megawatts, divided equally among the state's three largest electrical corporations. No more than 25 percent of the capacity approved shall be provided by behind-the-meter systems. This capacity is in addition to any investments authorized under Section 2836. The commission must resolve electrical corporation applications within 12 months. Priority is given to programs providing energy storage to public sector and low-income customers. The Legislature intends for costs to be recovered in proportion to benefits for approved energy storage programs. No reimbursement is required by this act as it creates a new crime or infraction, eliminates a crime or infraction, or changes penalties, within the meaning of the Government Code."
