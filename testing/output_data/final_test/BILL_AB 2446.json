    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 116700 of the Health and Safety Code is amended to allow for a petition for a writ of mandate for review of an order issued by the state board within 30 days. The court must independently review the evidence, and if no petition is filed, the state board's decision is not reviewable. Section 13321 of the Water Code is also amended. Section 13321 of the Water Code is amended to allow the state board to stay the effect of a decision or order within 90 days of receiving a request for stay. The party requesting the stay may extend the 90-day period. The state board must issue or deny a stay request within 45 days for certain water quality certifications or cleanup orders. The party requesting the stay can extend the 45-day period. The party requesting a stay can extend the 45-day period. If the state board fails to issue or deny the stay within the specified period, the request is deemed denied. Within 30 days, an aggrieved party can file a petition for review with the superior court. The Code of Civil Procedure governs these proceedings. If the state board fails to follow procedures or abuses discretion, the superior court can set aside the order and stay its effect pending review. The court may proceed without a certified record and stay the order if it is not against the public interest. In actions involving water quality certification, the court cannot issue a stay that prevents the state board from avoiding waiver of certification. The court must consider federal regulations in determining waiver risk. If a stay is granted, it can be effective from the date of the board's decision. If a petition is filed with the superior court under Section 13330, any stay in effect shall remain for 20 days from the date of filing. Section 13330 of the Water Code is amended. Section 13330 of the Water Code is amended to allow aggrieved parties to file a petition for writ of mandate with the superior court within 30 days of receiving a decision or order from the state board. If the initial decision is issued by a delegated authority, a petition for reconsideration must be filed with the state board before seeking court review. The state board must respond to a petition for reconsideration within 90 days of adopting the decision. A party aggrieved by a final decision or order of a regional board can seek review in the superior court by filing a petition for writ of mandate within 30 days of the state board's denial of review. The time for filing an action under Section 21167 of the Public Resources Code begins after the state board completes its review or reconsideration. If no party files a petition within the specified time, the decision or order is not reviewable by any court. The court will exercise independent judgment on the evidence in cases involving judicial review of decisions or orders issued by the state board or regional board under specific sections, following Section 1094.5 of the Code of Civil Procedure. No legal or equitable process can be used to review, prevent, or stop adjudicative proceedings by the state board or regional board, except as allowed by this section and Section 13321. The same restriction applies to reviewing decisions or orders by the state board or regional board until administrative review procedures have been exhausted. A party aggrieved by a decision or order issued by the state board under Article 7 of Chapter 7 may petition for reconsideration or judicial review. This includes final actions in adjudicative proceedings and actions subject to specific Government Code sections. Section 13361 of the Water Code is amended to allow civil actions under this division to be brought by the Attorney General in the name of the people of California. Actions must be brought in the county where the discharge occurs, with the option to transfer to a different county upon motion by either party. In civil actions under this division, regional or state boards can seek injunctions without proving irreparable damage or inadequate remedy at law."
