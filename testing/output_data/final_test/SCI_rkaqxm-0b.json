    "content": "Answering compositional questions requiring multi-step reasoning is challenging for current models. An end-to-end differentiable model for interpreting questions is introduced, inspired by formal approaches to semantics. Each text span is represented by a denotation in a knowledge graph, along with a vector capturing ungrounded meaning aspects. Composition modules recursively combine constituents to provide a grounding for the complete sentence, serving as the answer to the question. The model can learn to represent various challenging scenarios by jointly learning composition operators and output structure through gradient descent. The model introduced can learn to represent challenging semantic operators and generalize well to longer sentences. Compositionality is crucial for understanding complex expressions, and the model outperforms LSTM and RelNet baselines. Popular neural network approaches typically encode sentences word-by-word, but this model uses composition modules to recursively combine constituents for question answering. Our model uses a latent tree of interpretable expressions to encode sentences, outperforming LSTM and RelNet baselines. Inspired by linguistic theories, it recursively combines constituents using neural modules, achieving higher performance on longer questions. The structure and composition modules are learned through end-to-end gradient descent, resembling Montague semantics. The model uses neural modules to build a parse chart over sentences, representing text spans with distributions over groundings and ungrounded meaning aspects. It encodes questions with RNNs and evaluates them against knowledge sources, without explicit interpretations for constituents of complex expressions. Our model uses neural modules to parse sentences and encode questions with RNNs. It represents text spans with distributions over meanings and evaluates them against knowledge sources. The denotation of the complete question provides the answer. The model imposes strong independence assumptions for better generalization on complex sentences. The model uses neural modules to parse sentences and encode questions with RNNs, enforcing strong independence assumptions for better generalization. It interprets phrases independently of surrounding words, allowing natural generalization to different contexts. The model learns structures and modules through gradient descent, aiming to answer questions with respect to a Knowledge Graph consisting of entities and relationships. The model uses neural modules to parse sentences and encode questions with RNNs, enforcing strong independence assumptions for better generalization. It interprets phrases independently of surrounding words, allowing natural generalization to different contexts. Our model builds a parse for the sentence, grounding phrases in a Knowledge Graph and using composition modules to combine phrases, resulting in an answer to the question. The model utilizes neural modules to parse sentences and encode questions with RNNs, enforcing independence assumptions for better generalization. It interprets phrases independently of surrounding words, combining representations for adjacent phrases to produce denotations. A binary-tree structure is assigned to question sentences, determining how words are grounded and phrases are combined using trainable neural composition modules. Different parses are merged into an expected denotation for dynamic programming, leading to the most likely grounding of the phrase for answering questions. The model classifies text spans into semantic types for denotations or vectors. Phrases are assigned distributions over types, determining grounding and composition modules. Semantic types include Grounded, Ungrounded, and Vector types for different representations. The model classifies text spans into semantic types for denotations or vectors. It includes Vector type for functions not grounded in the KG, Vacuous type for semantically empty spans, and Partially-Grounded Semantic Types for partially grounded text spans. The model classifies text spans into semantic types for denotations or vectors, including Vector type for functions not grounded in the KG, Vacuous type for semantically empty spans, and Partially-Grounded Semantic Types for partially grounded text spans. These semantic types combine with fully grounded representations and ungrounded vectors to parameterize composition modules, which create representations for larger phrases using trainable word vectors. The composition modules in the model perform functions on soft entity sets to produce new soft entity sets, parameterized by global parameter vectors. These modules can interpret compound nouns and entity appositions by learning to output intersections or complements of entity sets. The module composes relations and entity sets to produce an output entity set, using adjacency matrix and soft entity set representations. It maps a soft entity set to a boolean based on word vectors, counting elements in or out of the set. It combines two entity sets into a boolean for modeling generalized quantifiers. The module composes a pair of soft set of relations to produce an output soft set of relations, using the v2 word vector to parameterize the composition function. It facilitates modeling boolean set operations and allows the model to use the same ungrounded word vector for semantically analogous compositions. The composition function is similar to combining the relations left and above using the word \"or\" to relate entities ei and ej if either relation exists between them. The composition function in the module combines relations using word vectors to relate entities if either relation exists between them. Phrases with certain types are treated as identity functions, while modules combine grounded and ungrounded phrases to create partially grounded representations. This allows for classification of question tokens into different semantic type spans. The model classifies question tokens into semantic type spans and computes their representations. It uses composition modules to parse questions into a soft latent tree for answering. The model is trained using question-answer supervision. Each token in the question is assigned a distribution over semantic types (E, R, V, \u03c6). Semantic type distribution is computed using embedding vectors for words and semantic types. The model assigns semantic type distributions to question tokens using embedding vectors for words and semantic types. Each entity and relation is represented by an embedding vector, and the model computes expected adjacency matrices for each token to form the E-Type and R-Type representations. The model learns vectors for words and semantic types to assign semantic type distributions to question tokens. It uses embedding vectors for entities and relations to compute expected adjacency matrices for each token, forming E-Type and R-Type representations. Additionally, a parsing model is employed to determine the correct structure for applying composition modules in a parse-chart over the question. The distribution of semantic types for question tokens is computed using a parsing model, which assigns scores based on different ways of composing constituents. Each node in the parse-chart is associated with a potential value representing the semantic type for a span, calculated from all possible ways to form the span with that type. The composition of spans is determined by trainable weights and feature functions for each word in the vocabulary. The distribution of semantic types for question tokens is computed using a parsing model, which assigns scores based on different ways of composing constituents. The final t-type potential of a span is computed by summing scores from all possible compositions. Answer Grounding involves recursively computing phrase semantic-type potentials to infer the semantic type distribution of the complete question sentence and the resulting grounding for different semantic types. The answer-type for the question is computed using corresponding methods. The model is trained on a dataset of question-answer pairs with boolean or entity subset answers from a knowledge graph. The answer is represented as a semantic type, either boolean or a subset of entities. The model generates answers by considering the question's representation and maximizing log-likelihood. Regularization is added for parsing features, and a dataset is created based on CLEVR for question-answers. The dataset for question-answers is generated based on the CLEVR dataset BID4, containing knowledge graphs with object attributes and relations. The questions aim to address biases in existing questions, with a focus on spatial relations and question length. 75K questions are for training and 37.5K for validation, testing various semantic operators like conjunctions and negations. Future work should explore scaling the approach to longer questions. The curr_chunk discusses the creation of test sets for question-answering tasks, including simple tests to remove biases, and the introduction of a COMPLEX QUESTIONS test set with longer, multi-step questions. The experimentation setting, baseline models, and experiments showcasing the model's ability to answer compositional questions are also described. The training details of the model include representing entities with 4 attributes, learning embedding vectors for attribute-values, and using Curriculum Learning to pre-train on easier questions before tackling complex semantics and structures. Results for Short Questions: Our model outperforms baseline models on the Short Questions test set, showing its ability to learn challenging semantic operators and parse questions using weak end-to-end supervision. Hyper-parameters are tuned using validation accuracy, with training done using SGD. Trainable parameters include question word embeddings and biases added to the semantic type distribution. Our model's trainable parameters include question word embeddings, relation embeddings, and entity attribute-value embeddings. Baseline models used for comparison are a simple LSTM model without KG access, an LSTM model with KG entities but no relationship information, and a RELATION NETWORK BID14 augmented model. Performance details are provided in the Appendix section. The model's performance on answering questions is detailed in the Appendix section. Our model excels in answering all questions in the test set, showcasing its ability to learn complex semantic operators and parse questions with weak supervision. The RELATION NETWORK performs well on relation-based questions but lags behind our model on certain question types. The LSTM (NO RELATION) model also shows good performance on questions not involving relations. Results on complex questions, formed by combining shorter question components, demonstrate the models' ability to handle multi-hop reasoning and generalize to new question types. The model's ability to generalize to new question types and unseen attribute combinations in knowledge graphs is highlighted. Despite challenges in generalizing RNN encoders, the model structure allows for easier generalization to complex questions. Error analysis reveals that most errors stem from incorrect structure assignments rather than semantic errors. Our model outperforms baseline models in handling complex questions requiring multi-hop reasoning. Errors are mainly attributed to incorrect structure assignments rather than semantic errors. Future work should focus on using more sophisticated parsing models. Semantic parsing models learn structures over pre-defined operators to produce logical forms for answering questions. Early work used gold-standard logical forms, while later efforts only used question answers. Our model learns semantic operators from data to handle fuzzy interpretations of function words. Neural program induction models and neural module networks have also been used for question answering. Our approach learns a model over all possible structures for interpreting a question, using a LSTM network to encode the question. It predicts answer-type, entity attention value, and the probability of the answer being True. This differs from previous models like D-NMN and N2NMN, as it is end-to-end differentiable and does not require reinforcement learning for optimizing layouts. The model encodes the question using a LSTM network and predicts answer-type, entity attention value, and the probability of the answer being True. It utilizes entity attribute-value embeddings and defines a parameter vector to predict answer-type. The Relation Network module outputs a scalar score value for elements in the answer vocabulary.
