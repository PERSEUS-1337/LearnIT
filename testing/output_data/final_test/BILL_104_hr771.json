The Congress recognizes the significant impact of fire losses, including 5,000 deaths and 29,000 injuries annually, with an estimated economic loss of $10 billion per year. Fire safety education at the State and local levels has proven effective in preventing fires and reducing casualties. However, fire departments have faced budget cuts, leading to a need for expanded fire prevention programs and resources to support public education efforts. Fire departments in countries with lower fire deaths spend 4-10% of their budgets on prevention, compared to less than 3% in the US. Accurate data analysis is crucial for directing educational efforts effectively. SEC. 3. FIRE SAFETY EDUCATION. The Administrator may contract with eligible entities to distribute fire safety education programs and resources at the state and local level. Funding distribution includes limits on statewide programs, new regional/local programs, and awards for existing effective programs. Funds provided under the Act can be used for public education on fire safety, including the use of fire prevention equipment, exit drills, and safe product usage. Priority should be given to existing public education materials that meet program requirements. The Administrator can contract with States to implement the revised National Fire Incident Reporting System for better fire data collection. Eligible entities must submit applications for funding. The entity receiving funds under section 3 must submit an annual report to the Administrator detailing program activities, support materials obtained, and initiatives to develop public-private partnerships.
