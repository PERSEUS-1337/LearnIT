    "content": "The importance of security tasks in post-conflict operations is crucial for establishing stability and effective governance. Failure to provide adequate troops and police with a proper mandate can complicate and prolong operations. In Iraq, some citizens have expressed disillusionment with the U.S. military for security shortcomings. In post-conflict Iraq, analysts emphasized the need for immediate security measures to prevent looting and violence. The lack of security has been a recurring issue in peacekeeping operations, with concerns raised about the effectiveness of ad hoc coalition forces in maintaining stability. In July 2002, a vice president was assassinated, leading to questions about the legitimacy of the interim government in Afghanistan. The peacekeeping force of 7,000 troops has struggled to protect the population from bandits and warlords. The lack of security and military force has been a challenge in previous peacekeeping operations in Bosnia and Kosovo. In post-conflict situations, military forces, including U.S. forces, have performed various security tasks in Bosnia, Kosovo, and potentially Iraq. These tasks include protecting humanitarian workers, disarming military personnel, demining territory, securing borders, and containing power-hungry leaders. Police skills are also crucial in post-conflict security, with military support often necessary for immediate implementation. In post-conflict situations, various security tasks require a combination of military and police attributes, such as blocking reprisal killings, controlling arms, arresting war criminals, dismantling criminal networks, reforming police and security forces, promoting human rights, and protecting civilians and property from common crime. Military support is often necessary for immediate implementation. In post-conflict Iraq, security tasks require a mix of military and policing skills to maintain security. Unlike Bosnia, there is no reported organized criminal network within Iraq's security forces or political party. The linkage between political and criminal groups in Bosnia only surfaced after nationalist leaders attained power, and it took over seven years for the intelligence and legal systems to crack down on the network. This poses a crucial issue for U.S. policymakers. In post-conflict Iraq, security tasks require a mix of military and policing skills to maintain security. The crucial issue for U.S. policymakers is determining who will perform these tasks, especially if U.S. armed forces do not. Questions arise about when and to what extent Iraqi military and police, along with U.S. contracted or international police, will partner with or take over security tasks from U.S. forces. In Germany and Japan, U.S. and allied military forces initially provided security, gradually transferring policing tasks to indigenous police forces. There has been controversy over the use of U.S. forces in peacekeeping operations beyond protecting relief workers and containing warlords. The United Nations has organized peacekeeping forces with contributions from member states, but its inability to establish stability in some operations has raised concerns about its capacity for military activities in hostile environments. Some analysts suggest NATO may take on a security role in Iraq, but disagreements with France and Germany may hinder international cooperation. Military planners are considering when police forces should take over security tasks to avoid the disadvantages of continued military presence. Some analysts suggest NATO may take on a security role in Iraq, but disagreements with France and Germany may hinder international cooperation. Military planners are considering when police forces should take over security tasks to avoid the disadvantages of continued military presence. Military forces in post-conflict periods can sometimes prove counterproductive due to excessive force, risking local consent and indicating problems after violence has been contained. Peacekeeping operations have highlighted the need for a range of different forces carrying out different roles for effective security tasks. In post-conflict periods, a spectrum of forces is needed for effective security tasks. Military forces are effective against military opposition but less so against civilian disturbances. International forces like constabulary forces and U.N. CIVPOLs have also been important for providing security. In post-conflict periods, a spectrum of forces is needed for effective security tasks. International CIVPOLs monitor, assist, mentor, and train local police, mediate disputes, and ensure public order. Vetting local police forces and using reconstructed military forces under international oversight have also been common. Studies suggest a coordinated sharing of powers among military, paramilitary, and police forces, with a focus on constabulary forces for handling civilian crowds in peacekeeping operations. Paramilitary forces are utilized in dealing with civil disturbances and organized crime. International peacekeeping forces have incorporated specialized units, such as the Multinational Specialized Unit (MSU) in Bosnia and Special Police Units (SPU) in Kosovo, to handle tasks that may be challenging for traditional military or local police forces. Analysts suggest strengthening UNCIVPOL or similar units for peacekeeping operations. The National Defense University's Institute for International and Strategic Studies identified a security \"deployment gap\" in peacekeeping operations due to inadequate law enforcement presence. This gap left military forces as the only source of enforcing order early in interventions, making CIVPOL dependent on military backup for credibility. The gap was attributed to a lack of surge capability, international mobility, and experience operating beyond national borders. Recommendations included strengthening the capacity to mobilize CIVPOL personnel and preparing the military to discharge police functions during transition periods. Recent recommendations for post-conflict policy in Iraq include military constabulary forces, special police constabulary units, and U.N. CIVPOLs as components of security forces. There have been ongoing issues with CIVPOL deployments, such as a shortage of trained officers and logistical support. Presidential Decision Directive 71 aimed to strengthen CIVPOL capabilities but was never implemented. H.R. 1414 proposes that the U.S. encourage negotiations with the United States. Houghton proposes the U.S. to negotiate with the United Nations for a U.N. civilian police corps. The size and duration of a military occupation force in Iraq depend on various factors, including tasks assigned to military forces and cooperation from Iraqi citizens. Estimates suggest an initial projection of 100,000 troops for the occupation force, but actual numbers remain uncertain. The estimated number of troops needed for a peacekeeping force in Iraq varies, with figures ranging from 75,000 to 100,000. Factors such as the tasks assigned to military forces and cooperation from Iraqi citizens will determine the size and duration of the military occupation force. Feil suggested 75,000 troops should remain in Iraq. Estimates vary, with the Heritage Foundation proposing 40,000 troops in a 60,000-member coalition force. General Eric Shinseki estimated several hundred thousand soldiers may be needed for control. The Congressional Budget Office estimated the cost of maintaining a force of 75,000-200,000 troops at $17 billion to $46 billion per year. Several factors will determine the size and duration of U.S. and coalition occupation forces in Iraq, including internal security, acceptance by the Iraqi population, deployment of troops from other nations, confidence in Iraqi police, and threats from neighboring countries. The State Department is seeking bids to send former police officers and lawyers to work with Iraqi police, while European countries have pledged small numbers of troops for security and humanitarian tasks. The threat from Iraq's neighbors may manifest as incursions across borders or funding armed groups to influence political events. Disarming and demobilizing Iraqi military forces could impact the size and duration of the occupying force. DDR processes are complex but essential for peace missions. According to one analyst, a large number of forces may be needed for the task, but it may not guarantee success. The DDR challenges in Iraq are expected to be greater than elsewhere due to the size of Iraqi security forces. Reports suggest a four-month demilitarization phase for retraining and reintegration. The size and duration of the coalition force will depend on the use of local security forces. The reports recommend retaining Iraqi security forces for post-war use, potentially in conjunction with U.S. and international forces. Three key issues have emerged for the transition to a permanent Iraqi government: the role of the United Nations, establishing democracy, and the timeline for transitioning to full Iraqi rule. Policymakers are debating caretakers for an interim period and creating permanent governing structures. The Bush Administration is working on creating Iraq's permanent governing structures, with General Tommy Franks currently exercising governmental authority. Jay Garner is overseeing civilian government functions. Plans include a transition phase to transfer control to Iraqis, drafting a new constitution, and holding free elections. The occupation government may last two years. The Bush Administration is promoting the organization of an interim Iraqi \"authority\" with unclear powers and status vis-a-vis the occupation authorities. Some argue for the United Nations to lead in designing Iraq's future government, similar to past peacebuilding processes in Japan and Germany. Others suggest it may resemble UN peacebuilding operations in countries like Kosovo, Afghanistan, and East Timor. The Bush Administration envisions a role for the United Nations in post-war Iraq, but argues that the United States should continue to play a lead role in shaping Iraq's future government. As of April 2003, President Bush had identified a \"participation\" role for the U.N. in selecting members of an interim Iraqi government. The debate on the United Nations' role in post-war Iraq is influenced by various factors, including the Security Council's stance on endorsing military action. Proponents of a continued U.S. lead in Iraq doubt the UN's ability to address security threats posed by the Hussein regime. Some doubt the United Nations' ability to handle a complex transitional administration in Iraq due to its past reputation and lack of coordination. Proponents argue that the UN's international legitimacy would better serve US interests in creating a stable and democratic Iraq. Nations now seek international legitimacy similar to the US in 1945 for support in Iraq's reconstruction. A UN authority is seen as more impartial in reshaping government institutions, potentially gaining broader Iraqi support for new democratic institutions. Proponents believe Iraqis may support new governmental institutions and a democratic ethos. The United Nations has learned from past experiences in peacebuilding operations, with some operations showing positive results over time. Analysts argue that problems in UN peacebuilding operations stem from insufficient mandate and resources, rather than actions of personnel. There are debates over the feasibility of a Western-style democracy in Iraq, with the goal of establishing a democratic government as a model for the Middle East. The Bush Administration aims to establish a democratic government in Iraq as a model for the Middle East. There are debates on whether Iraq can overcome cultural obstacles to democratization, with some believing in Iraqis' potential for creating democratic institutions with international assistance, while others doubt the feasibility due to lack of prior experience and ethnic divisions. Since the early 1980s, there has been a growing international interest in assisting the development of democratic institutions and practices through peacebuilding operations. Challenges in establishing democracies in societies with deep ethnic and religious divisions are highlighted in literature. Examples include Afghanistan, Kosovo, and Bosnia, where ongoing violence hinders the creation of functioning democracies. The durability of ethnic, criminal, and terrorist violence in conflictive regions poses challenges in establishing democratic practices. Despite past U.S. interventions promoting democracy, enduring democracies have not taken root in many cases. Successful democratization in post-World War II Germany and Japan differs from current conditions in Iraq. Despite initial concerns about German and Japanese cultures being anti-democratic, U.S. occupation forces found receptive populations in post-World War II Germany and Japan. The primary threat to democracy was seen as the devastated economies of defeated countries. Recent experiences with conflict resolution highlight the need for a comprehensive approach in democracy-building efforts. Analysts have noted inadequacies in early U.S. democracy-building efforts since the 1990s. Analysts emphasize the need for a wide array of institutions, practices, and attitudes, along with a functioning economy, to make democracy work. Peacebuilding operations must transform the political landscape to leave behind a legitimate political sovereign. Early democratization attempts in post-conflict states have been counterproductive, leading to renewed warfare. In post-conflict states, early democratization attempts have been counterproductive, leading to renewed warfare. Lessons learned from peacebuilding programs in five key areas may be relevant to Iraq's fragile national community and potential sources of discord. These areas include guarantees of the rule of law, the role of civic society, timing and conditions for elections, powersharing arrangements, and international norms. In post-conflict situations, establishing institutions to ensure the rule of law is crucial for creating a secure environment where democracy can thrive. Analysts have identified key gaps in the rule of law in peacekeeping experiences in countries like Cambodia, El Salvador, and Somalia. In post-conflict societies, there are rule of law \"gaps\" that pose challenges, including an \"enforcement gap\" due to inadequate police forces and an \"institutional gap\" with a lack of impartial judges, humane prisons, and a fair legal code. Efforts to strengthen the rule of law require developing all components of the legal system in synchronization, as any unreformed part can lead to injustice. Former U.S. Ambassador William G. Walker emphasizes the complexities and long-term nature of this process. Analysts recommend various means to ensure the rule of law in post-conflict societies like Iraq, including legal assistance from international specialists to train and support Iraqi personnel. The US Army is assessing the judicial system, while the State Department is bidding on assistance for the police, justice, and prison systems. International donors often lack the patience, commitment, and resources needed for long-term rule of law development. The contribution of rule of law assistance programs to strengthening democracy is uncertain. Analysts suggest that while these programs may be helpful for economic development and democratization, the direct causal connections are unclear. The success of democratization programs depends on a country's progress towards democracy. Iraq's ability to establish democratic institutions may hinge on the desire for democratization among its people. The author argues that democracy promotion efforts may not yield dramatic results due to the underlying social, economic, and political structures in other countries. However, the United States should continue its commitment to advancing democracy as a long-term, uncertain venture. Analysts emphasize the importance of fostering a culture of tolerance, idea exchange, human rights respect, and citizen participation for a well-functioning democracy. International democratization efforts support various civic society groups and non-governmental organizations. Efforts to support civic society groups, non-governmental institutions, the press, and particular interest organizations have been crucial in democracy building efforts post-World War II. International donors are currently assisting such groups in countries like Afghanistan, South Africa, Eastern Europe, and Latin America during transitions to democracy. Civil society participation is highlighted as essential for creating representative institutions from the bottom up. Efforts to support civic society groups, non-governmental institutions, and particular interest organizations are crucial in democracy building post-World War II. International donors are aiding local groups in Iraq, which may or may not aid democratization. It is uncertain if existing local organizations based on traditional sources of power will support or hinder Western-style democracy. Iraq already has professional associations that can facilitate transparent consultations and counterbalance traditional ethnic-religious groups, but some analysts doubt their suitability for democratization efforts. Support for civil society groups can promote democracy by enabling populations to take ownership of the process, addressing key issues like reconciliation and human rights, and fostering a culture of democratic governance. The impact of international assistance on democratization in Iraq remains uncertain. The effectiveness of assistance to civil society groups in promoting democracy is uncertain, with evidence suggesting it may not be a major factor. Despite challenges and the need for reforms, benefits include establishing the idea of civil society's role in governance. Structured and supervised elections are crucial in peacebuilding and democratization efforts. The Bush Administration and policymakers are emphasizing elections as the path to democracy in Iraq, but caution is advised due to potential disruptions if held too soon after conflict. Elections may consolidate power of existing leaders and organizations, hindering the emergence of new ones. Iraq, not emerging from civil war, faces challenges in political alternatives to the Baath party. According to analysts, early post-conflict elections in Iraq may entrench extremist leaders and exacerbate societal divisions. Despite potential flaws, elections are seen as imperative for legitimacy in implementing rehabilitation and reconciliation efforts. To ensure propitious circumstances for elections in Iraq, preconditions must be met, including the existence of a capable state, consensus on government structure, political commitment from conflicting parties, and progress on demobilization. Temporary coalition arrangements and reconciliation measures are suggested to confer legitimacy on a temporary government. The utility of powersharing arrangements in post-conflict situations has been reconsidered due to potential problems with elections. Temporary powersharing arrangements have been seen as a bridge to eventual elected government, as seen in Bosnia and Afghanistan. In Afghanistan, interim powersharing arrangements were put in place after the ousting of the Taliban forces in 2001. In Afghanistan, interim powersharing arrangements were established after the Taliban's removal in 2001. An interim administration governed for six months until a national government was chosen by a loya jirga. Hamid Karzai was selected to lead the national government until elections in two years. Some suggest this model could be applied in Iraq. Powersharing arrangements are seen as crucial in resolving civil wars in divided countries. In Iraq, powersharing arrangements may help gain legitimacy for a new government and prevent potential strife among factions. Retaining capable bureaucrats, including Baath party members, is crucial for governmental functions. However, powersharing alone may not ensure a successful transition, as seen in ongoing political violence in Afghanistan. According to studies, third-party security guarantees and power-sharing formulas are essential for stability in peacebuilding operations. Power-sharing provisions in elections can prevent violence by providing positions for both winners and losers in the government. However, tensions exist between power-sharing arrangements and other goals like human rights and justice. Some analysts argue for international norms promoting democracy in peace operations, emphasizing recognition of ethnic differences, legal protections, and inclusive political institutions. Some urge international donors to fund and improve mediation and monitoring practices for peacebuilding in Iraq. Recent evaluations suggest a longer time frame may be needed to establish democratic structures. Success will depend on Iraqis' ability to manage sectarian differences, promote economic growth, and agree on a political structure. Some analysts suggest that the one to two year transition periods for U.N. peacekeeping missions may be too short to make significant progress on reforms prescribed by peace accords. They recommend linking the termination of peace operations to specific objectives, estimating a decade as a minimum in most circumstances. Time constraints and resource limitations create difficulties in retaining high-quality staff. Some analysts recommend linking the termination of peace operations to specific objectives, estimating a decade as a minimum in most circumstances. The study of past experiences can provide valuable guidelines for initiating peacebuilding activities and evaluating their progress."
