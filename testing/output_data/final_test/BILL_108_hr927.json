    "content": "The \"Farm and Ranch Risk Management Act\" is cited as the short title. It introduces Farm and Ranch Risk Management Accounts under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. In eligible farming businesses or commercial fishing, individuals can deduct cash payments to a FARRM Account. Contributions are limited to 20% of taxable income attributable to farming or fishing. Distributions cannot be used for new fishing vessels or expanding fisheries. The Secretary of Commerce will enforce regulations to prevent overcapitalization in fisheries. Eligible farming businesses and commercial fishing can deduct cash payments to a FARRM Account, limited to 20% of taxable income. Contributions cannot be used for new fishing vessels or expanding fisheries. A FARRM Account is a trust in the US for the taxpayer's exclusive benefit, with specific requirements for contributions, trustee qualifications, and asset composition. The FARRM Account trust must consist of cash or interest-bearing obligations, distribute all income to the grantor, and keep assets separate except in a common fund. The grantor is taxed as the owner of the account. Amounts distributed from a FARRM Account are included in the taxpayer's gross income, with exceptions for certain circumstances. Exceptions to the distribution rules for FARRM Accounts include distributions attributable to income of the Account and distributions of contributions exceeding limitations if requirements are met. Distributions are first attributed to income and then to other amounts. Additionally, there are special rules for taxing nonqualified balances in FARRM Accounts not distributed within 5 years. Nonqualified balances in FARRM Accounts are subject to a 10 percent tax if not distributed before the tax return due date. Exceptions exist for distributions of income and contributions exceeding limits. Special rules apply for taxing nonqualified balances not distributed within 5 years. The FARRM Account rules specify that nonqualified balances are subject to a 10 percent tax if not distributed before the tax return due date. Distributions are treated in the order of deposits made, with special rules for taxing nonqualified balances not distributed within 5 years after cessation of an eligible farming business. The FARRM Account rules state that if a taxpayer is not engaged in an eligible farming business or commercial fishing for 2 consecutive taxable years, the balance in the FARRM Account will be deemed distributed. Certain rules apply, similar to those for treatment on death and loss of exemption of account for prohibited transactions. For FARRM Accounts, payments are deemed made on the last day of the taxable year if made before the due date for filing tax returns. The term 'individual' excludes estates or trusts. The deduction for self-employment tax is not allowed. The deduction allowable under subsection (a) does not affect an individual's net earnings from self-employment. The trustee of a FARRM Account must report contributions, distributions, and other matters to the Secretary and the account beneficiary. Tax on excess contributions is addressed in section 4973 of the Code. Section 4973 of the Code addresses excess contributions to FARRM Accounts, defining them as contributions exceeding the allowable amount for the taxable year. Any excess contributions distributed from the account are treated as not contributed.
