    "content": "The \"Farmers Disaster Assistance Act of 2011\" is the short title of the Act. It provides supplemental emergency disaster assistance to farmers. The section defines terms like \"disaster county,\" \"eligible producer,\" and \"qualifying natural disaster declaration\" for agricultural producers affected by natural disasters in the 2011 crop year. The section defines terms like \"qualifying natural disaster declaration\" as declared by the Secretary for production losses and \"specialty crop\" as defined in the Specialty Crops Competitiveness Act of 2004. The Secretary will use funds from the Commodity Credit Corporation to make supplemental payments to eligible producers affected by disasters. The Secretary will provide supplemental payments to eligible producers in disaster counties with a 5% crop loss due to natural disasters, amounting to 90% of the direct payment received for the 2011 crop year. Eligible producers under the Acre program will also receive 90% of the reduced direct payment for the same year. Eligible producers must obtain a policy or plan of insurance for insurable commodities for the next crop year to receive assistance under the program. Eligible producers must obtain insurance coverage for the next crop year to receive assistance under the program. If a producer fails to file paperwork and pay fees for noninsurable commodities by the state deadline, they must obtain coverage for those crops for the next available crop year as determined by the Secretary. Assistance received under this subsection will be included in the calculation of farm revenue for the 2011 crop year. The Secretary will use funds from the Commodity Credit Corporation to provide grants to States for specialty crop producers affected by excessive rainfall in 2011. The program will assist eligible producers and the assistance received will be included in the calculation of farm revenue for that year. The Secretary will provide grants to States for specialty crop producers affected by excessive rainfall in 2011 on a pro rata basis. Grants will be based on the value of specialty crop losses in disaster counties during the 2011 calendar year. The maximum amount of a grant will be determined by the Secretary. The Secretary will provide grants to States for specialty crop producers affected by excessive rainfall in 2011. The maximum grant amount to a State may not exceed $40,000,000. Grants will only be given to States that meet specific requirements, including assisting eligible specialty crop producers and submitting a report to the Secretary within 30 days of providing assistance. The specialty crop producers affected by excessive rainfall in 2011 will receive assistance from States. States must submit a report to the Secretary detailing the assistance provided, amounts given by crop type, and the process for determining assistance levels. Assistance received will be considered in farm revenue calculations for the 2011 crop year under specific laws. SEC. 3. ELIMINATION OF LIMITATIONS ON WAIVERS FOR BORROWERS ELIGIBLE FOR DIRECT FARM OPERATING LOANS IN DISASTER-AFFECTED COUNTIES IN 2011: Numerical and durational limitations on waivers for farming or ranching operations in counties affected by natural disasters in 2011 are waived. SEC. 4. SUSPENSION OF LIMITATION ON PERIOD FOR GUARANTEED FARM OPERATING LOANS IN 2011 DISASTER DECLARED COUNTIES. Section 5102 of the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002 is amended to extend the period for guaranteed operating loans for farming or ranching operations in counties affected by a disaster declaration issued in 2011. The amendment changes the year from 2010 to 2013 and includes provisions for loans in counties substantially affected by natural disasters or emergencies in 2011."
