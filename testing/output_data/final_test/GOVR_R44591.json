    "content": "Interest in the Eastern Mediterranean as a natural gas resource base has been growing since Israel's first large-scale discovery in 2009. Significant discoveries have been made in Israel, Cyprus, and Egypt, with potential for more resources in the region. The USGS estimated up to 122 trillion cubic feet of undiscovered natural gas and 1.7 billion barrels of recoverable oil in the Levant Basin. However, global oil and gas price downturn since 2014 has hindered resource development. The downturn in oil and natural gas prices since mid-2014 has slowed down the development of resources in the Eastern Mediterranean. Companies are facing financial constraints and challenges in developing costly projects. Despite the region's potential for natural gas discoveries, the exploration has been delayed, and efforts to find markets for the gas have increased. Europe is seen as a key market for Eastern Mediterranean gas production, but European gas consumption has been declining since 2010, leading to increased imports in recent years. The Eastern Mediterranean natural gas market saw a 10% increase in 2015, despite previous import drops. The region faces competition from traditional suppliers like Russia, Norway, and Algeria, as well as U.S. LNG exports. Most Eastern Mediterranean countries are either not using natural gas or are self-sufficient, except for Greece and Turkey. Egypt, previously a net exporter, started importing natural gas in 2015 due to subsidized demand. Egypt's situation may change if it reduces subsidies or promotes more gas development. Development of the Eastern Mediterranean's natural gas resources could meet the growing needs of many countries in the region, including Turkey. However, geopolitical hurdles must be overcome, and new infrastructure built. Despite recent discoveries, the region's reserves are small globally. Cyprus is divided politically and territorially, with efforts to agree on offshore energy drilling rights ongoing. Cyprus anticipates future export revenue from drilling in the Aphrodite Field, aiming to reduce its dependence on foreign oil imports for energy generation. Negotiations between Greek and Turkish Cypriots have resumed, with the hope of unification under U.N. mediation. Using natural gas from the Aphrodite Field could potentially replace oil as the primary fuel for power generation, but new infrastructure would be required. Cyprus plans to reduce dependence on oil imports for power generation by utilizing natural gas from the Aphrodite Field. However, new infrastructure, including natural gas-fired power plants and pipelines, would be needed. Cyprus aims to begin exporting gas by 2019 but currently lacks the necessary infrastructure, making domestic use costly. Options include building overland pipelines and LNG export terminals to send gas to Europe. Cyprus is considering exporting gas from the Aphrodite Field either through an LNG terminal in neighboring countries or via a pipeline to Egyptian LNG export terminals. Exporting through Egypt would be more cost-effective due to underutilized terminals. The country concluded its third licensing round for offshore exploration in July 2016, attracting international interest. Cyprus is recognized globally as the legitimate government and a member of the EU, while Turkey does not recognize it. Negotiations to unify Cyprus accelerated in 2015, but no resolution has been reached yet. Turkey opposes Cypriot natural gas development unless Turkish Cypriots benefit financially or the \"Cyprus problem\" is resolved. Turkey is interested in importing Israeli gas through a pipeline in the Cypriot economic zone. Cyprus maintains it will not allow any gas exports. Cyprus has refused to allow a gas pipeline connecting Israel and Turkey in its exclusive economic zone until a Cyprus solution is found. The Egyptian government's efforts to boost economic growth have had mixed results, with a shortage of dollar-denominated currency affecting imports and declining tourism receipts due to terrorism fears. Egypt's economy in 2015 faced challenges due to terrorism fears impacting tourism and declining revenues from the Suez Canal. Despite being a major natural gas producer, Egypt became a net importer due to government subsidies. The country's budget benefited from lower prices for natural gas and oil imports. Egypt heavily relies on natural gas for energy, with 77% of electricity generation fueled by it in 2013. The government's fuel subsidies have led to a natural gas shortage, despite being a former net exporter. Egypt's natural gas production decline is attributed to government subsidies, domestic policies, and political unrest. Production dropped 27% between 2009 and 2015 due to decreasing offshore resources. The shortage led to disruptions in industrial production and power outages. Demand from industrial and power sectors is expected to rise by 22% by 2021. Egypt stopped regular LNG exports in 2014 and is seeking new natural gas sources. Egypt stopped regular LNG exports in 2014 and is actively seeking new sources of natural gas. Currently importing 1.0 to 1.1 bcf/d, projected to increase to 2.0 bcf/d. In 2016, Egypt exported two LNG cargoes from the Idku facility, not indicative of a trend. Expected to remain an LNG importer until at least 2022. Developing 12 natural gas projects, including the Zohr Field discovered in 2015 by Eni SPA. Zohr Field holds up to 30 tcf, valued at over $100 billion, one of the largest natural gas discoveries globally. Egypt aims to bring Zohr Field online quickly to meet high domestic demand. Egypt is working to bring the Zohr Field online to reduce gas imports and supply domestic markets by 2017. Lebanon faces challenges due to disruptions in gas supply from Egypt, leading to heavy reliance on oil imports for energy consumption. Lebanon has potential offshore gas resources but has not authorized exploration work yet due to political gridlock. The country faces challenges with a refugee crisis and must define taxation policies and exploration blocks. Lebanon faces challenges with a refugee crisis and domestic security issues that may hinder gas exploration in the Mediterranean. The parliament's gridlock has prevented the election of a new president, delaying agreements on exploration rights. A dispute with Israel over maritime boundaries, including claims to overlapping waters, has led Lebanon to threaten military action and seek foreign intervention for resolution. Lebanon's boundary dispute with Israel is seen as a hindrance to gas exploration. The Tamar and Leviathan Fields are not in the disputed area. Critics blame mismanagement for Lebanon's lag in gas development. U.S. officials are involved in resolving the dispute over maritime borders. The United States is involved in resolving the maritime border dispute between Israel and Lebanon to create a more favorable commercial environment for all parties, including U.S. energy companies. Israeli officials are optimistic about the economic potential of their energy resources, but they rely on international companies due to the lack of a significant offshore exploration and production sector. Antitrust deliberations and other obstacles may impact the development of Israel's energy sector. Israel has 6.4 tcf of proven natural gas reserves, the second largest in the Eastern Mediterranean region. Natural gas comprises almost 30% of Israel's 2015 primary fuel needs, with discussions on exporting regionally and globally. Antitrust deliberations and regulatory concerns could hinder future energy development. Israel's natural gas consumption grew significantly from 2003 to 2015, with the discovery of the Tamar, Dalit, and Leviathan fields by Noble Energy in 2009 and 2010. This led to the country's potential to become a net exporter of natural gas. Natural gas now makes up almost 30% of Israel's fuel consumption and over half of its electricity production. Production from the Tamar Field began in 2013, and production from the Leviathan Field is expected to start in the next four years. The Leviathan and Tamar fields, along with Israel's other existing natural gas fields, hold up to almost 22 years' worth of gas. Development of the Leviathan Field could increase Israel's energy security in the short term and potentially make Israel a net exporter of natural gas in the long term. Israel's use of natural gas for electric power generation has increased from 33% in 2009 to 42% in 2013. Noble Energy has signed an agreement to export gas from the Leviathan Field to Egypt. Israel's use of natural gas for electric power generation has increased to over 50% by 2016. The Leviathan partners signed agreements worth billions to supply natural gas to power plants in Israel. Switching from coal to natural gas could help reduce greenhouse gas emissions in Israel. Israel is looking to decrease greenhouse gas emissions and export gas, with plans to start exporting by 2019. The development of Leviathan faced delays due to antitrust concerns and legal issues, but a new agreement was negotiated in 2016. This could generate billions in revenue for Israel. The Leviathan Field has the potential to generate billions of dollars in revenue over the next few decades. Israel is considering various destinations for natural gas exports, which could have geopolitical benefits. However, there are concerns about creating energy ties with Arab and Muslim-majority neighbors due to political disputes and anti-Israel sentiment. Israel may involve Noble Energy, a U.S. company, in export deals to reduce vulnerability to anti-Israel populism. Egypt's domestic demand for natural gas forced a halt in LNG exports in 2014. Attacks on the Arab Gas Pipeline have further strained supply, leading Egypt to seek additional gas sources. The Tamar consortium, including U.S. Noble Energy, has signed an agreement to provide Egypt with gas via an undersea pipeline. Despite political opposition, Cairo will not interfere with private agreements to import Israeli gas. Shortfalls in gas supply in Jordan due to pipeline attacks have prompted the country to explore alternative sources. Jordan has faced shortages in natural gas supply, leading to the decision to import LNG. In 2015, Jordan started importing LNG through an FSRU. Noble Energy signed agreements worth $500 million with Jordanian companies and a $15 billion deal with Jordan's National Electric Power Co. Israel approved pipelines to supply gas to Jordan, showing political support. The Palestinian Authority and Noble Energy's Leviathan consortium agreed on a 20-year gas supply deal for a power plant in Jenin. Analysts speculate on the potential for Israeli or PA gas supply to Jordan. Political and security concerns, including Hamas's presence in Gaza, complicate the issue of supplying Israeli gas to the Gaza Strip's power plant. Uncertainty in Israeli-Palestinian relations and the PA's future could impact Israeli control over offshore resources and gas shipments to the West Bank and Gaza. The normalization of diplomatic relations between Israel and Turkey in 2016, partly due to prospects of a natural gas pipeline, could influence energy arrangements in the region. The potential natural gas pipeline between Israel and Turkey could improve relations and allow Israeli gas to reach European markets. However, the project may face obstacles due to the conflict in Cyprus. Israel aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by shifting from coal to natural gas, which emits less CO2. Israel aims to reduce CO2 emissions by converting coal capacity to natural gas, which could decrease emissions by 24.4% of 2005 levels. The United States has shown interest in Israel's natural gas resources, with efforts from Congress and the Obama Administration to establish the U.S.-Israel Energy Center. The U.S. and Israel have made significant advancements in their energy sectors, particularly in natural gas development. Legislation has been introduced to promote closer ties in the energy sector between the two countries, including assistance to protect Israel's offshore natural gas fields. In May 2016, the U.S. Special Envoy for International Energy Affairs encouraged Lebanon to capitalize on its oil and gas resources. According to press reports, Hochstein urged Lebanese officials to utilize their hydrocarbon potential and mediated the maritime dispute between Lebanon and Israel. He also visited Cyprus in November 2014 to discuss energy development, including Cyprus' Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) and its issues with Turkey."
