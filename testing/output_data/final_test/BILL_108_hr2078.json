    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Employees' Pension Equity Act of 2003\". The Congress finds that some large companies prioritize protecting pensions of highly compensated executives over non-executive workers, leading to underfunding of non-executive pension plans. Various supplemental executive retirement plans exist, including unfunded plans, rabbi trusts, secular trusts, and life insurance plans. Comparing funding levels of these plans is challenging. Under current law, companies must disclose pension assets, liabilities, and contributions for regular pension plans in annual reports. However, for executive pensions, companies are only required to disclose the existence of trusts for top executives, not the amount of money in them. Equitable funding requirement for employers with executive pension plans. Equitable funding requirement for employers maintaining an executive pension plan, defined as a plan primarily for deferring compensation of highly compensated employees. The executive pension plan is defined as a plan maintained by an employer for highly compensated employees. The funded current liability percentage and requirements for maintaining both non-executive and executive pension plans are also outlined. The equitable funding requirement for non-executive pension plans is met if the excess executive plan funding percentage is not more than 5 percent or if additional contributions are made to correct the excess funding percentage by a reduction of at least 5 percentage points. The excess executive plan funding percentage is calculated as the difference between the funded current liability percentage of the executive pension plan and the non-executive pension plan. If an employer maintains 2 or more executive pension plans, specific treatment rules apply. When an employer maintains multiple executive pension plans, the funded current liability percentage is calculated as the average of the percentages for those plans. The amendment made by this Act will apply to non-executive pension plans starting after the enactment date of the Act."
