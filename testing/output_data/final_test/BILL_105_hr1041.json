    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Tire Pile Improvement and Remediation Effectiveness Act\". Congress finds that the Solid Waste Disposal Act does not address the current stabilization and removal of tire piles. There are 3 billion scrap tires in the US, with 250 million added annually. Burning tires are hard to extinguish due to oil content and air pockets, leading to high-temperature fires and toxic oil byproducts. Tire piles with millions of tires contain hazardous substances like benzene, toluene, and xylene, posing a significant threat to public health and the environment. Piles exceeding 5,000,000 tires should be promptly stabilized and removed to prevent potential harm. SEC. 3. STABILIZATION AND REMOVAL OF SCRAP TIRE PILES. Amends Section 2004 of the Solid Waste Disposal Act to focus on tire grants. SEC. 3 amends the Solid Waste Disposal Act to provide grants for constructing fire lanes and removing tire piles with 1,000,000 or more tires. Priority is given to piles with 5,000,000 or more tires located within 10 miles of populated areas. The tire pile grant prioritizes locations near sensitive communities, water systems, or facilities on the National Priorities List. The Administrator gives second priority to grants for constructing fire lanes in tire piles with 1,000,000 to 5,000,000 tires, meeting specific criteria. Fire lanes must comply with National Fire Prevention Association guidelines. Grants are supplementary to existing state tire programs and cannot replace state funding for tire pile stabilization. Applications for grants must adhere to specified requirements. The Administrator requires an approved application for grants under this subsection, with regulations to be promulgated. $25,000,000 is authorized for fiscal year 1998 for these grants."
