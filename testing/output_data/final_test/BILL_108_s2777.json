    "content": "The Act titled \"Safety for Americans from Nuclear Weapons Testing Act\" addresses the treatment of actions related to nuclear weapons tests under the National Environmental Policy Act. The \"Safety for Americans from Nuclear Weapons Testing Act\" deems actions of a Federal agency related to nuclear testing as major actions requiring an environmental impact statement. This includes actions such as the resumption of underground nuclear testing at the Nevada Test Site or at a different location. The environmental impact statement must detail the possibility of radiation containment. The environmental impact statement for actions related to nuclear testing must address the possibility of radiation containment failure and long-term effects on the water table from underground radiation leakage. If multiple nuclear weapons or devices are tested, information must be provided separately for each class based on their yield. Weapons and devices with yields ranging from 15 to 50 kilotons fall under one category, while those exceeding 50 kilotons are in another. Federal agencies carrying out actions must provide detailed statements to the public, excluding classified information. Any statements prepared before the enactment of this Act are not considered sufficient. The National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 requires a statement for actions described in subsection (b). The United States cannot resume underground nuclear testing without congressional authorization. Public notice requirements are also mandated. The United States must provide advance public notice of any underground nuclear testing, including details such as date, time, location, and radiation release. Congressional authorization is required for resuming such tests. After an underground nuclear test, the Secretary of Energy must hold a public meeting in southern Utah to discuss the test details, including radiation release. Notice requirements apply despite any laws preventing information disclosure. The National Academy of Sciences will conduct a study on safety, health, and environmental issues related to underground nuclear testing near the Nevada Test Site. Recommendations for additional safety measures will be provided. Additionally, a Nevada Test Site Citizens Review Board will be established. The Secretary of Energy will establish a Nevada Test Site Citizens Review Board within 180 days of the Act's enactment to address environmental, health, and safety issues related to nuclear testing. The Board will consist of nine members appointed by the Secretary, including citizens from Nevada and Arizona with expertise in environmental safety, health, or air quality. The Nevada Test Site Citizens Review Board will consist of nine members appointed by the Secretary of Energy, including citizens from Nevada and Arizona with expertise in environmental safety, health, or air quality. The board will have three members from Arizona and three members from Utah, each with specific qualifications and representation criteria. The members of the Nevada Test Site Citizens Review Board will be appointed based on recommendations from the chief executive officers of Nevada, Arizona, and Utah. The Nevada Test Site Citizens Review Board, jointly established by the Five County Association of Governments and the Six County Association of Governments in Utah, meets annually with the Nevada Test Site Office Manager to discuss environmental, health, and safety issues at the site. Additionally, the Board convenes not later than 180 days before any proposed nuclear test at the Nevada Test Site to address related environmental, health, and safety concerns. SEC. 7. GRANT PROGRAM FOR INDEPENDENT RADIATION MONITORING. The Secretary of Homeland Security authorizes grants for institutions of higher education to acquire and maintain radiation detection equipment for 10 years. Preference is given to institutions in states with high nuclear fallout levels. Each grant recipient must monitor underground nuclear tests conducted by the United States. The Secretary of Homeland Security authorizes grants for institutions of higher education to acquire and maintain radiation detection equipment for monitoring underground nuclear tests. Recipients must use the equipment to monitor radiation levels and make the information available to the public. SEC. 8. MONITORING OF RELEASES OF RADIATION INTO THE ATMOSPHERE. Monitoring of radiation releases into the atmosphere during underground nuclear tests is conducted by the Department of Energy and the Environmental Protection Agency, utilizing various monitoring systems on and off the test site. The Secretary of Energy ensures monitoring stations are established in each county of Utah for assessing radiation containment before and after underground nuclear tests. The Environmental Protection Agency uses ground and airborne sensors for real-time monitoring during tests. The Environmental Protection Agency requires real-time monitoring capabilities for sensors gathering air particles. The placement of sensors must be determined in consultation with other federal agencies. The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency will determine sensor locations based on proximity to agricultural zones, population centers, water resources, and areas with nuclear fallout. Radiation monitoring data must be made available to the public online within 24 hours. If a release of radiation beyond the Nevada Test Site occurs during monitoring, the EPA Administrator must report to Congress, underground nuclear testing will stop, and a compensation program for affected individuals will be implemented similar to the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act. Compensation is provided to individuals affected by the release of radiation. Establishment of Center for the Study of Radiation and Human Health. The Director of the National Institutes of Health will grant funds to a university or consortium in the intermountain west region to establish the \"National Center for the Study of Radiation and Human Health.\" The Center will conduct research on the relationship between radiation and human health, award grants for related studies, study fallout data collection, and coordinate research efforts in this field. The National Center for the Study of Radiation and Human Health will coordinate research efforts, collect and maintain data on fallout from nuclear tests, and report its activities annually to Congress. Appropriations are authorized for its operations. SEC. 10. STUDY OF INDIVIDUALS EXPOSED TO NUCLEAR WEAPONS TESTS. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will conduct a study to estimate radionuclide exposure from US nuclear weapons tests, disaggregate results by organ and demographic variables, report to Congress, and make results public."
