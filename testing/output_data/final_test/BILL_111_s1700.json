The Congress finds that promoting good governance in the extractive industries sector is in the interest of the United States as it strengthens national security, foreign policy, and energy security. Developing countries relying heavily on natural resource extraction often face higher poverty rates, weaker governance, conflict, and poor development due to the \"resource curse\". Transparency in revenue payments in the extractive industries sector is crucial for promoting good governance and accountability. It benefits citizens by holding leaders accountable and is seen as good for business, improving the business climate and fostering good governance. Shareholders also benefit from knowing the amount of revenue payments made by corporations. Shareholders want to know payment amounts to assess financial risk, compare payments between countries, and evaluate if payments contribute to a stable investment climate. Undisclosed payments can be seen as corrupt and devalue the corporation. SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS RELATING TO TRANSPARENCY FOR EXTRACTIVE INDUSTRIES.
