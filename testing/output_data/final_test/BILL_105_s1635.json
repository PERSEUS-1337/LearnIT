The maximum capital gains rate for taxpayers other than corporations is amended to not exceed a certain percentage of the net capital gain or taxable income. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to reduce the alternative capital gain tax for corporations. The maximum capital gains rate for taxpayers is capped at a certain percentage of net capital gain or taxable income. SEC. 1201. ALTERNATIVE TAX FOR CORPORATIONS. SEC. 1201. ALTERNATIVE TAX FOR CORPORATIONS. If a corporation has a net capital gain for a taxable year, a tax is imposed consisting of a tax on taxable income reduced by the net capital gain at regular rates, plus a 14 percent tax on the net capital gain or taxable income, whichever is less. A transitional rule applies for taxable years including January 1, 1999. The capital gain is determined by gains and losses taken into account after December 31, 1998. Special rules apply to pass-thru entities such as regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts, S corporations, partnerships, estates, trusts, and common trust funds. The curr_chunk mentions a common trust fund as part of the cross references in the context of special rules for pass-thru entities like regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts, S corporations, partnerships, estates, and trusts. The curr_chunk discusses the computation of alternative tax for specific entities like life insurance companies, regulated investment companies, and real estate investment trusts. The effective date for the amendments is after December 31, 1998. Additionally, it introduces indexing of certain assets for determining gain or loss in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The curr_chunk discusses the substitution of indexed basis for adjusted basis when selling or disposing of an indexed asset held for over a year. Depreciation deductions are exempt from this rule. An indexed asset includes stock in a corporation and tangible property used in trade. The curr_chunk defines what is excluded from the term 'indexed asset' for tax purposes, such as creditor's interest, options, net lease property, certain preferred stock, and stock in certain corporations. The curr_chunk specifies exceptions for certain types of stock in corporations, including S corporations, personal holding companies, and foreign corporations. It also exempts stock in a foreign corporation listed on major stock exchanges from being considered an indexed asset for tax purposes. The indexed basis for assets under section 1246(b) involves adjusting the asset's basis for inflation. This adjustment is calculated based on the chain-type price index for GDP in the last quarter before the asset is disposed of. The indexed basis for assets under section 1246(b) involves adjusting the asset's basis for inflation. The percentage under subparagraph (B) is rounded to the nearest \\1/10\\ of 1 percentage point. Special rules apply for treating substantial improvements to property as separate assets. The indexed basis for assets involves adjusting the asset's basis for inflation. Special rules apply for substantial improvements to property and contributions to capital. The applicable inflation ratio is reduced for non-indexed assets during certain periods. The taxpayer or spouse selling short substantially identical property triggers a short sale period. Certain distributions with respect to stock are treated as dispositions. The section cannot increase ordinary loss, instead treating it as a long-term capital loss. The taxpayer may be treated as having a long-term capital loss equal to the amount of the ordinary loss. The acquisition date for an asset previously subject to subsection (a)(1) is not earlier than the most recent application. The application of collapsible corporations under section 341(a) is determined without considering this section. Certain conduit entities like regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts, and common trust funds are included. Investment trusts and common trust funds are considered indexed assets based on the fair market value ratio of assets held by the entity. If the ratio is 90 percent or more, it is treated as 100 percent, and if it is 10 percent or less, it remains unchanged. For real estate investment trusts, valuation of assets is required once every 36 months unless the trust ceases to exist. The ratio for months without valuation is based on the trustee's good faith judgment. A qualified investment entity includes regulated investment companies. The adjustment under subsection (a) at the partnership level is passed through to the partners. For electing small business corporations, the adjustment at the corporate level is passed through to the shareholders. Dispositions between related persons are exempt from this section unless the basis of the property in their hands is affected. Transfers of property between related persons may impact the basis of the property. If a person transfers cash, debt, or property to another person to increase a tax adjustment or deduction, the IRS can disallow part or all of the adjustment or increase. The term 'net lease property' is defined as leased real property where the lease term is 50% or more of the property's useful life, and the deductions allowable to the lessor are 15% or less of the rental income. The term 'stock in a corporation' includes any interest in a common trust fund. The Secretary shall prescribe regulations necessary to carry out this section. A clerical amendment is made to the table of sections. Sec. 1022. Indexing of certain assets for determining gain or loss. Amendment made to section 312 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 regarding the effect on earnings and profits of indexed basis. The amendments made by this section apply to the disposition of property with a holding period starting after December 31, 1998. However, they do not apply to property acquired after this date from a related person for less than fair market value. The amendments made by this section do not apply to property in the hands of a related person. The repeal of certain federal transfer taxes under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 applies to estates of decedents, gifts, and generation-skipping transfers made after the enactment of this Act. The Secretary of the Treasury must submit any necessary technical and conforming changes to reflect these amendments within 90 days."
