    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Campus Law Enforcement Emergency Response Act of 2007\". It pertains to law enforcement emergencies. Section 485(f) of the Higher Education Act of 1965 is amended to require institutions of higher education to develop and distribute a statement of policy and statistics on law enforcement emergencies on campus. The term 'law enforcement emergency' in the Higher Education Act of 1965 includes incidents like shootings, armed and dangerous individuals, bomb threats, hazardous materials, lockdowns, and other similar incidents on a higher education campus. The policy for higher education institutions involving law enforcement agencies must address procedures for directing individuals during a law enforcement emergency, including informing them through alerts such as e-mail, telephone, and text messages. Each institution must test their law enforcement emergency response policy annually and report any emergencies to students and employees within 30 minutes. The Secretary and Attorney General are responsible for ensuring compliance with these requirements. The Secretary may provide grants to institutions of higher education for developing and disseminating campus law enforcement emergency response policies and procedures. Grants and contracts under this provision are awarded competitively for up to 1 year. Institutions, consortia, or organizations must submit applications to the Secretary following specified requirements. Efforts are made to ensure equitable participation in the awarding process. The provision ensures equitable participation of eligible institutions of higher education in programs, including geographic and enrollment size considerations. $5,000,000 is authorized for fiscal year 2008, with additional funding for the following 4 years."
