    "content": "On December 15, the House and Senate approved a conference agreement on the Labor-HHS-Education appropriations bill, H.R. 4577, which includes other appropriations measures. The bill includes an across-the-board cut of $520 million in FY2001 defense funding but also allocates an additional $300 million for certain defense programs. Earlier, an agreement was reached on the FY2001 defense authorization bill, H.R. 4205/S. 2549, which was approved by both chambers. The President signed the bill into law on October 30. The President signed the FY2001 military construction appropriations bill, H.R. 4425 (P.L. 106-246), which includes funding for national defense programs and FY2000 supplemental appropriations for military operations. Congress also passes a defense authorization bill annually, which authorizes programs funded in regular appropriations measures and addresses defense policy and funding issues. The annual defense appropriations bill provides funds for military activities of the Department of Defense, including pay, benefits, operation, maintenance, weapons procurement, and research. It also includes funding for other purposes such as the Central Intelligence Agency retirement fund and national foreign intelligence activities. The defense appropriations bill funds military activities of the Department of Defense, including pay, benefits, operation, maintenance, weapons procurement, and research. Additionally, other appropriations bills provide funds for national defense activities of DOD and other agencies, such as military construction, atomic energy defense, civil defense, national security-related activities, and defense-related activities of the Coast Guard. The Administration's FY2001 budget includes $305.4 billion for national defense, with $284.3 billion requested in the defense appropriations bill. The President has signed the FY2001 defense appropriations and military construction bills, with action on the defense authorization bill expected soon. The House and Senate approved a conference agreement on the budget resolution, recommending $309.9 billion for national defense. The Administration had requested $5.3 billion of FY2000 supplemental appropriations, including $2.3 billion for the Department of Defense. The House approved $9.1 billion in supplemental appropriations, with $5.0 billion for the Department of Defense. This included funding for peacekeeping operations in Kosovo and counter-drug activities in Colombia. An additional $4 billion was later added for defense programs, with the Senate deciding to fold supplemental appropriations for FY2000 into regular FY2001 appropriations bills. The House approved $9.1 billion in supplemental appropriations, with $5.0 billion for the Department of Defense, including funding for peacekeeping operations in Kosovo and counter-drug activities in Colombia. An additional $4 billion was later added for defense programs, with the Senate deciding to incorporate it into the regular FY2001 defense appropriations bills. The conference agreement on the FY2001 military construction appropriations bills was approved by the House on June 29 and the Senate on June 30, with the President signing the measure into law on July 13. The House Armed Services Committee approved the defense authorization bill, H.R. 4205, which was later passed by the House and Senate. The President signed the bill into law on October 30 (P.L. 106-398). The Senate also approved its version of the defense authorization bill, S. 2549. The House Defense Appropriations Subcommittee marked up its version of the defense appropriations bill, H.R. 4576. The House and Senate approved the FY2001 defense appropriations bill (H.R. 4576), with the President signing it into law on August 9 (P.L. 106-259). The Senate also passed its version of the bill (S. 2593) on June 13. Additionally, different versions of the military construction appropriations bill were marked up by the House and Senate Appropriations Committees on May 9. The House and Senate passed the military construction appropriations bill, with the President signing it into law on July 13 (P.L. 106-246). The Administration requested $305.4 billion for the national defense budget in FY2001. Comparisons were made to previous defense budgets for context. The Administration requested $305.4 billion for the national defense budget in FY2001, representing an increase of $15.7 billion compared to the FY2000 enacted level. This request included $14.8 billion for the Department of Defense, with a real growth rate of about 1.3% above inflation. The Administration's plan for defense funding in FY2001 included a real growth rate of about 1.3% above inflation. There were projections for defense spending to decline modestly in FY2002 and then remain essentially level through FY2005. Some argue that defense budget should increase to maintain readiness and allow for weapons modernization. Secretary Cohen and other officials agree on the need for this increase. The Administration's plan for defense funding in FY2001 projected an increase in budgets for weapons procurement. The FY2001 request included funding increases for national defense and the Department of Defense, with additional funds allocated for military contingency operations and increased fuel costs. The Defense Department has historically absorbed increased costs within its budget, but adding money to cover expenses is a significant policy change. The FY2001 defense request and long-term plan mostly continued existing priorities, with notable exceptions. The Administration request includes changes in Army National Guard and Reserve force levels, with a decision to defer reductions in troop levels. The Army is undergoing a transformation to develop a more flexible and easily deployable \"mediumweight\" force structure. The Administration is making changes to Army National Guard and Reserve force levels, deferring troop reductions. The Army is transforming to create a more flexible \"medium-weight\" force structure, including buying armored vehicles, accelerating weapons programs, and reducing other programs to offset costs. Adjustments were also made to Navy shipbuilding programs. The Department of Defense decided to maintain 55 attack submarines in the force instead of reducing to 50 as planned. The new shipbuilding plan included a reserve of $1.1 billion for refueling overhauls or converting Trident missile submarines. The Navy extended the development of the DD-21 destroyer and stretched out procurement of current-generation DDG-51 destroyers. No funding was requested for LHD amphibious ship procurement. There were no major changes in fighter aircraft programs, but adjustments were made in cargo aircraft programs. In fighter aircraft programs, DOD made no major changes, but significant adjustments were made in cargo aircraft procurement. DOD requested 12 C-17 aircraft instead of the planned 15, with hopes of British procurement making up for the decline in U.S. purchases. Funds were also requested for 4 C-130 aircraft to avoid production line shutdown. The Navy restructured its trainer aircraft programs. Additionally, DOD increased funding for National Missile Defense by $2.3 billion to support deploying an initial system in Alaska by 2005. In 2005, DOD made changes in theater missile defense programs, including a significant cut in the Air Force Airborne Laser program. Separate funding lines were included for the THAAD system and Navy Theater Wide program. The FY2001 defense plan emphasized a $60.3 billion budget for weapons procurement, a key aspect for a strong defense. The Joint Chiefs of Staff had previously urged an increase in procurement funding to $60 billion a year. The funding for weapons procurement was initially set at $45-60 billion a year starting in FY1998, with the goal of reaching $60 billion by FY2001. However, this target is now considered inadequate by many in Congress, with estimates ranging from $20-100 billion short of what is needed. Discussions have been influenced by a study from the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) titled Averting the Defense Train. The Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) study, titled Averting the Defense Train Wreck in the Next Millennium, estimated that $164 billion per year would be needed over the next decade to replace current weapons with more advanced versions. However, not all weapons will be replaced soon, with strategic nuclear missiles and bombers not projected for upgrades. Army tanks may be replaced after 2010, but possibly with different types of weapons. The costs of tactical aircraft and Navy ships may not increase as much as assumed by CSIS. The Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments estimated that the Administration's procurement program would cost about $80-90 billion a year by the later part of the decade. This includes the need for modern precision munitions to replace older ones on a less than one-for-one basis, keeping weapons in inventory longer with upgrades, and still showing a shortfall in required procurement levels. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that a \"steady state\" budget of about $340 billion a year would be needed over the next 15 years to maintain the current size and composition of the military. This includes an annual procurement budget of around $90 billion. The Defense Department acknowledges that procurement budgets may need to increase further in the future, but there are disputes over projections by outside analysts. In February 2000, Secretary of Defense Cohen stated that procurement budgets will need to increase beyond $70 billion annually after FY2008. DOD Comptroller William Lynn disputed the CBO's projections, suggesting that a one-for-one replacement of current weapons is unlikely due to force transformation efforts. There is a concern about increasing weapons procurement funding without a significant rise in overall defense spending. The Clinton Administration anticipates that savings from improved efficiency in operation and maintenance will be redirected to weapons procurement. Historically, projected O&M savings have rarely materialized, leading to continued growth in O&M costs. The military services are feeling overextended in the post-Cold War international environment, focusing on increasing elements of the force rather than making cuts. Services submit lists of programs for additional funds, guiding congressional additions to the defense budget. In 2000, \"unfunded priorities lists\" totaling over $16 billion were submitted for FY2001. The military services submitted \"unfunded priorities lists\" totaling over $16 billion for FY2001 and over $80 billion for the FY2001-2005 period. The priorities were evenly divided between readiness-related accounts and weapons programs. The House approved $4 billion more for defense in the FY2000 supplemental appropriations bill, providing additional funding through September 30, 2001. The Senate later added $4 billion to its version of the FY2001 budget resolution. The FY2001 budget resolution allowed Congress to add funds for major weapons programs, including restoring funds for programs like Wolverine and Grizzly in the Army and the Airborne Laser in the Air Force. The Administration requested $305.4 billion for national defense programs, with $284.5 billion in defense appropriations. Several key issues emerged during the FY2001 defense debate in Congress. The FY2001 defense budget totaled $305.3 billion, with $284.5 billion requested for defense appropriations. Both the House and Senate aimed to limit discretionary spending, with pressure from defense advocates leading to an additional $4 billion for defense in the pending supplemental appropriations bill. The Senate agreed to increase the FY2001 budget by $4 billion to $309.9 billion, exceeding the Administration's request. A provision was included to establish a point of order against exceeding specified funding levels for defense and non-defense spending. Congress later lifted caps on discretionary spending to accommodate increases in both areas. In the past two years, appropriations committees used various methods to increase defense spending while adhering to spending caps. For example, in FY1999, emergency supplemental appropriations of $21 billion were included in the Omnibus Consolidated Appropriations Act, with $8.3 billion for the Department of Defense. In FY2000, additional funds were provided for defense and non-defense programs through various measures. This year, appropriators have also taken steps to increase funding. The FY2000 defense appropriations bill included emergency funding, with the House adding $4 billion in emergency defense funds to the FY2000 supplemental appropriations bill. The conference agreement on the supplemental also included $1.8 billion and moved the pay date for military personnel back into FY2000. Senator Gramm objected to these provisions, delaying final Senate action. The FY2001 defense appropriations bill faced delays in the Senate due to objections over reversing provisions. The bill included measures to add extra money within spending caps, with $1.779 billion in emergency FY2000 appropriations for Overseas Contingency Operations. Additionally, $1.1 billion was allocated for operations in various regions, while $679 million was for programs removed in conference. The bill also eliminated $1.1 billion in FY2001 funds for the Overseas Contingency Operations Transfer Fund. The FY2001 defense appropriations bill faced delays in the Senate due to objections over reversing provisions. The bill included measures to add extra money within spending caps, with $1.779 billion in emergency FY2000 appropriations for Overseas Contingency Operations. The conference agreement provides $3.3 billion more for DOD than the Administration requested, with a potential increase of $5.1 billion if supplemental funding is counted. Congress made an across-the-board cut of 0.22% in all FY2001 discretionary appropriations, exempting funding for military personnel. The defense reduction amounts to $521 million according to CBO estimates, with additional funds provided for defense programs in H.R. 4577. The FY2001 defense appropriations bill includes $150 million for USS Cole repairs, $100 million for classified programs, and $43.5 million for military construction. It also includes funding for the expansion of the Army's National Training Center at Fort Irwin, California. The total funding for the National Defense Budget Function in FY2001 is estimated in Table 4. The appropriations conference agreement for FY2001 defense funding includes $2.5 billion more than requested for weapons procurement, along with funding for Defense Health Program, Chemical Weapons Demilitarization, Drug Interdiction, and Office of the Inspector General. The Administration focused on improving defense health care, while Congress considered more expansive alternatives. Adjustments in the \"TRICARE\" program of health benefits have been a key issue. The Administration supported TRICARE reform measures for military dependents and retirees, including eliminating co-payments for TRICARE Prime families and extending TRICARE Prime Remote. There were informal proposals to extend TRICARE Senior Prime nationally and provide mail-order pharmacy benefits to retirees over 64. Several measures to reform defense health care programs were proposed in Congress, including a guarantee of lifetime health care for military retirees in the Senate-passed version of the annual defense authorization bill. Ongoing demonstration projects are testing alternative ways of providing retiree health care. The congressional budget resolution reserved limited funds for potential military retiree health benefit increases. The Senate approved a guarantee for DOD to provide care benefits to all retirees, a key issue in the authorization conference. The House Armed Services Committee approved expansion of TRICARE Prime Remote and added benefits for TRICARE participants. The HASC bill added benefits for TRICARE participants, extended current demonstration programs for retiree health care, established a TRICARE Senior pharmacy program, and recommended a roadmap for retiree health care. The SASC version extended TRICARE Remote and established a pharmacy benefit for all retirees, including those eligible for Medicare, with no enrollment fee or deductible. The Senate approved an amendment to eliminate a provision that makes military retirees over age 64 ineligible for military medical care. The Defense Department will provide full health coverage for life to retirees starting on October 1, 2001. Senator Warner added a provision to terminate the program after FY2004, but intended for it to continue permanently with adjustments in mandatory spending caps. The TRICARE Senior Prime demonstration program was also extended. The authorization conference agreement makes the guarantees provided by the Warner amendment permanent and establishes a separate trust fund to cover program costs. The Defense Department will be required to pay into the fund the actuarily determined cost of future benefits for current personnel. The conference agreement provides nationwide pharmacy benefits, extends TRICARE remote, eliminates co-payments for TRICARE Prime for active duty family members, and extends the TRICARE Senior Prime demonstration program. The budget effects of increased health care benefits are complex, with costs for military retiree health care benefits shifting to a new \"mandatory\" account. The Defense Department is projected to provide $24.8 billion in benefits to military retirees over the next ten years. The authorization conference agreement provides an additional $40.4 billion in benefits for military retirees over ten years, with $59.9 billion total to be provided through a new \"Department of Defense Medicare-Eligible Retiree Health Care Fund\" starting in FY2003. Additionally, the Defense Department will make payments of $29.0 billion through FY2010 for future retiree benefits. The funding mechanism known as \"accrual accounting\" will provide $29.0 billion in payments for future retiree benefits through FY2010. Discretionary DOD appropriations will increase by $9.5 billion from FY2001-2010 for retirement and health care benefits, with a shift of spending on health care for retirees to mandatory accounts in FY2003. Total mandatory spending in the federal budget will increase by $59.9 billion from FY2001-2010, triggering a point of order in the Senate under current budget rules. The Senate waived a point of order against the measure in the Senate undercurrent \"pay-as-you-go\" budget rules by a vote of 84-9. The appropriations conference agreement provides $963 million above the request for the Defense Health Program to implement expanded pharmacy access for retirees. The $200 million cost in FY2001 for health care provisions in the authorization conference agreement may be financed in various ways. The Clinton Administration announced a revised NMD development program in 1996, known as the \"three-plus-three\" plan, for a missile defense system. The plan involved three years of development and testing, followed by a decision on deployment. The Deployment Readiness Review was scheduled for June 2000, with a potential initial deployment in 2005. In 2000, the debate over national missile defense focused on whether the President should proceed with the Deployment Readiness Review (DRR) or leave the decision to his successor due to test failures and delays. President Clinton ultimately decided to leave the decision to his successor after a test failure in July. Congressional discussions were influenced by reports questioning the pace of the NMD development program. The NMD program faces high risk and potential delays, with criticism from the Welch panel and Pentagon's Director of operational testing. Debate surrounds the adequacy of planned tests for the NMD system's discrimination capabilities. Negotiations with Russia on changes to the ABM Treaty are ongoing. The new Russian leadership continues to oppose NMD deployment, with some congressional leaders promising to resist any measures extending the ABM Treaty. Key allies are also hesitant about NMD deployment due to cost concerns. The Congressional Budget Office projects higher deployment costs than the Administration's estimates, with an initial system cost of about $30 billion. The Congressional Budget Office estimates NMD deployment costs at $26 billion, increasing to $49 billion with additional systems. Congressional actions include adding funds for NMD risk reduction measures and transferring management of SBIRS-Low. The appropriations bill provides additional funding for risk reduction measures for NMD, with $135 million allocated. The authorization conference agreement also includes $129 million for risk reduction. Congressional debate focused on the test program's adequacy rather than funding, with a Senate amendment for realistic testing against countermeasures being rejected. The status of the THAAD and NTW programs was a recurring issue in Congress, with THAAD being pursued first followed by NTW under the current Administration plan. The current Administration plans to pursue THAAD first, followed by NTW, unless unexpected problems arise. Congress supports accelerating the NTW program, with BMDO proposing a $2.2 billion acceleration plan. Other TMD programs like MEADS and PAC-3 are also under scrutiny for cost concerns. Funding for TMD programs, including the Air Force Airborne Laser program, is a key issue in Congress. Various committees have added money for the Navy Theater Wide program and the Airborne Laser program. The appropriations conference agreement adds $80 million for TMD programs. The appropriations conference agreement adds $85 million for the Airborne Laser program, with a provision earmarking $233.6 million for the program. Representative Curt Weldon's amendment transfers management of the ABL to the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization. Additionally, funding was added for Army space control technology development, laser R&D programs, and MEADS, despite a $10 million cut in funding. Administration officials opposed the cut, warning of potential consequences. The Administration lobbied against a $10 million cut in funding, which would disrupt program administration and endanger allied funding. They requested funds for 12 C-17 cargo aircraft instead of the planned 15, hoping to make up the gap through an agreement with Britain. Congress added funds for C-130 aircraft in recent years, but this year the Administration requested funding for 4 aircraft. Congressional action included adding funds for additional KC-130J and EC-130J aircraft for the Marine Corps and Air Force. The conference agreement establishes the National Defense Airlift Fund for C-17 funding, following SAC's recommendation. The Administration did not request funds for additional F-15 and F-16 aircraft, but Congress has previously added funds to sustain production lines. Lockheed recently received a large order for F-16s from the United Arab Emirates. Lockheed has received a large order for F-16s from the United Arab Emirates, with substantial sales elsewhere. The production line in St. Louis may shut down without additional purchases for F-15s. Congressional committees added funds for aircraft purchases and modifications, with the appropriations conference report providing funds for F-15s and F-16s. The big three theater aircraft modernization programs are the Navy F/A-18E/F, the Air Force F-22, and the multi-service Joint Strike Fighter. The F-22 was a focus of extensive debate. The Administration has requested funds for 10 F-22 aircraft, with the testing program status being of congressional interest. The Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) is now a focus in Congress, with questions raised by the General Accounting Office about the development schedule. DOD officials considered splitting orders between Boeing and Lockheed for the JSF, but decided against it. Senator Feingold has raised concerns about the F/A-18E/F program. The Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) program was a focus of attention in Congress, with the SASC Subcommittee on Airland Forces initially considering measures to reduce funding due to delays. However, after meeting with Secretary Cohen, the full committee decided not to impose any restrictions. The committee-approved bill eliminated $596 million for engineering and manufacturing development (EMD) and increased funding for demonstration and validation by $424 million. HASC provided funding for EMD but required the Secretary of Defense to certify JSF technology maturity. HAC reduced EMD funding by $300 million. The HAC reduced EMD funding by $300 million and increased demonstration and validation funding by $150 million. SAC also provided funding for demonstration and validation, with slightly less money allocated. The appropriations and authorization conference agreements reflected a delay in the EMD phase, resulting in $203 million for EMD and $486 million for demonstration and validation. HASC reduced F/A-18E/F procurement by three aircraft. All committees supported F-22 funding as requested, with SASC including a provision to raise the cost cap on F-22 R&D by 1%. The appropriations and authorization conferences agreements provide funds for 42 F-18s and match the request for F-22 procurement and R&D. The authorization conference agreement also raises the cost cap on F-22 R&D by 1.5%. The V-22 tilt-rotor aircraft's status, mainly for the Marine Corps, has been a topic of discussion following a tragic accident. Congress resisted efforts to terminate the program during the Bush Administration, and the Clinton Administration has continued its development. The Clinton Administration has continued the development program for the V-22 tilt-rotor aircraft, with Congress remaining supportive and occasionally adding funds. Congressional action shows no reduction in V-22 funding, with key issues including funding for LHD-8 and LPD-17-class amphibious ships, as well as decisions on submarine production. Submarine production decisions pending, Navy argues for increase in force size beyond planned 300 ships. Congressional action adds funding for LHD-8. The SAC added $460 million for LHD-8 and eliminated $1.5 billion for two LPD-17-class amphibious ships due to design issues and cost concerns. Instead, $179 million was allocated for advance procurement of two ships in FY2002 and $285 million for cost growth in the first four ordered ships. HASC and SASC authorized a five-year block purchase of New Attack Submarines to ensure funding for Newport News Shipbuilding and General Dynamics Electric Boat Division. The appropriations conference agreement provided $460 million for LHD-8 and followed the Senate by only allocating $560 million for advance procurement of LPD-17 ships. The conference report authorizes $560 million for advance procurement and $460 million for LHD-8. There are concerns about the Army's plan for a new medium weight force, with questions about program planning, schedule feasibility, and funding availability. Army leaders acknowledge a funding shortfall for the program. Congress has urged funds to be restored for Army programs that were trimmed to find money for the medium weight force. They are particularly interested in helicopter procurement plans, with support for the Comanche scout helicopter and higher production of Blackhawk utility helicopters. HASC and SASC restored funds for the \"Grizzly\" and \"Wolverine\" programs that were cut for the medium weight force. The House added funds for the Grizzly program in FY2000 supplemental appropriations. Concerns were raised about potential delays in the Crusader self-propelled artillery program, leading to a reduction in funding from $355 million to $200 million by SAC. The program was redirected to develop a new, lighter vehicle compatible with the Army transformation initiative. Congress has been supportive of Army transformation efforts, with additional funds allocated by HASC, SASC, and SAC for related programs. SASC included a provision for a side-by-side evaluation of alternative armored vehicles for the interim medium-weight brigade, which the Army strongly opposed. The appropriations conference agreement restores funds for the Wolverine Heavy Assault Bridge and provides funds for Grizzly as FY2000 supplemental appropriations. It fully funds Crusader but requires a 30-day delay for fund obligation. Additional funds are allocated for a second Army medium-weight brigade and for accelerating acquisition of a light-weight armored vehicle. Funds are also added for UH-60 Blackhawk helicopters and Comanche. The authorization conference agreement provides $750 million for additional procurement and R&D on medium-weight armored vehicles. The Army is testing new wheeled vehicles for a medium-weight brigade. Congressional support for Army transformation is a key focus. A new agency, NNSA, oversees security at DOE facilities. Congress continues to review security implementation. The NNSA oversees security at DOE facilities, with Congress reviewing security implementation. Congressional action includes new constraints on DOE funding and regulations to ensure NNSA independence from the Secretary of Energy. The NNSA oversees security at DOE facilities, with Congress reviewing security implementation. Congressional action includes constraints on DOE funding and regulations to ensure NNSA independence from the Secretary of Energy. The authorization conference agreement includes Senate-passed provisions with slight revisions. The Administration requested $458 million in Defense Department for the Cooperative Threat Reduction program. The DOE budget includes almost $200 million for related programs like MPC&A and Initiatives for. The Administration is requesting funds for chemical weapons destruction facilities in Russia, with Congress scrutinizing the CTR program closely. HASC eliminated $35 million for this purpose, while SASC approved funding with conditions. The FY2001 budget request includes $4.2 billion for ongoing military contingency operations in Kosovo, Bosnia, and the Persian Gulf, with $2 billion allocated for Kosovo. Allied burden-sharing in Kosovo has been a contentious issue. The FY2001 budget request includes $4.2 billion for ongoing military contingency operations in Kosovo, Bosnia, and the Persian Gulf, with $2 billion allocated for Kosovo. Congressional action focused on Kosovo peacekeeping funding in the FY2001 Military Construction bill, leading to a debate over the mission. On May 18, the Senate eliminated a measure to require the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Kosovo after July 1, 2001. The House approved an amendment requiring the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Kosovo by April 1, 2001 unless certain conditions are met. Funding for contingency operations in Kosovo and elsewhere was approved in the FY2001 defense bills. The appropriations conference agreement provides requested funding, with adjustments reflecting reduced force levels in Bosnia. The authorization conference agreement for FY2000 emergency appropriations does not include the House-passed measure for troop withdrawals from Kosovo. Instead, it includes reporting requirements on allied burden-sharing. The White House reached an agreement with Puerto Rico on Navy live-fire testing in Vieques, with plans for a referendum on Navy activities, economic development programs, and potential transfer of Navy property. Congressional approval is needed for the President's plan. The President's plan for Vieques development program requires congressional approval of land-transfer legislation and funding requests totaling $90 million. The House Appropriations Committee included $40 million in its bill. SASC supported most elements of the plan, while HASC did not fully approve. The House Appropriations Committee approved $40 million for the Vieques development program, but not the additional $50 million requested. The full House later repealed the HASC provisions and included measures to implement the Administration plan. Social issues like abortion, gays in the military, and the role of women in the armed forces have been debated in defense funding bills. This year, the focus is on gays in the military, although there hasn't been a specific proposal in Congress to revise current policy. Congressional action: The HASC military personnel subcommittee failed to approve an amendment to remove the prohibition on abortions in military hospitals abroad. The full committee later rejected the same amendment. The House also rejected a similar amendment. Additionally, an amendment was approved to require Congress to be notified 120 days before allowing women to serve on Navy submarines. The Senate voted to table an amendment to repeal the restriction on using military facilities for privately funded abortions. Secretary of Defense Cohen has urged Congress to approve more rounds of military base closures starting in 2003. In 2003, officials argue that defense infrastructure cuts have not kept pace with force size reductions. Funding for future weapons programs depends on improving efficiency. Congress has rejected additional base closure rounds for the past three years. The White House's politicization of the base closure process in 1995 has been a point of contention. Congressional action on base closures was not addressed by SASC or HASC, and the Senate rejected an amendment to the authorization bill by Senators Levin and McCain. The Senate rejected an amendment to authorize additional closure rounds in 2003 and 2005. The House approved the Taiwan Security Enhancement Act, which would expand U.S.-Taiwan military exchanges and establish direct military communications. China reacted negatively to the bill, warning of strong response if advanced weapons were sold to Taiwan. The Senate has not yet taken up the issue. The PRC government issued a White Paper on the Taiwan issue, offering conciliatory gestures and a threat of force if cross-Strait talks are delayed. Various CRS reports provide insights on China-U.S. relations, Taiwan developments, arms sales, and the \"One China\" policy. The HASC urged the Administration to establish a Center for the Study of Chinese Military Affairs at the National Defense University. Military services are pursuing changes in technology described as a \"revolution in military affairs.\" Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John Warner has urged the development of unmanned systems for ground and aerial combat. Senator Warner plans to have one-third of deep strike aircraft unmanned by 2010 and one-third of ground combat vehicles unmanned by 2015, requiring significant changes in military R&D programs. The SASC is interested in new technologies and has increased funding for unmanned aerial vehicles for surveillance, counter-terrorism, and cyber-warfare protection. A provision mandates the Defense Department to develop a plan to meet Senator Warner's goals for unmanned combat systems. The authorization conference agreement approves funds for programs to strengthen domestic defenses against terrorism, biological weapons, and information warfare. It also includes provisions for the use of unmanned combat systems. H.Con.Res. 290 establishes the congressional budget for FY2001 and sets budgetary levels for fiscal years 2002 through 2005. On March 23, 2000, the Senate passed S.Con.Res. 101, a concurrent resolution setting the congressional budget for fiscal years 2001 through 2005. The House approved the conference report on April 13, 2000. H.R. 3908, an emergency supplemental appropriations bill, was also passed by the House. H.R. 4205 (Spence) A bill authorizing appropriations for military activities of the Department of Defense for FY2001, military construction, and military personnel strengths. Approved by the House and Senate, signed into law as P.L. 106-398 on October 30, 2000. President signed the bill into law (P.L. 106-398) on October 30, 2000. S. 2549 (Warner) authorized appropriations for FY2001 for military activities of the Department of Defense and military construction. Senate approved H.R. 4205 (97-3) on July 13, 2000. H.R. 4576 (Jerry Lewis) made appropriations for FY2001 for the Department of Defense and was approved by the House on June 7, 2000. The bill (H.R. 4576) was approved by the House on June 7, 2000, and by the Senate on June 13, 2000. The conference agreement was approved by both chambers in July 2000, and the President signed it into law on August 9, 2000. The bill made appropriations for the Department of Defense for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2001.
