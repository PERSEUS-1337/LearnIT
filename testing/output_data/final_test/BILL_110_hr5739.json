    "content": "The \"Physician Availability Act of 2008\" requires physician availability in acute care hospitals. Each covered hospital must have a qualified physician available 24/7 for inpatient care. Covered hospitals are defined as those with specific participation agreements or receiving federal funds. The term \"physician\" refers to a doctor of medicine or osteopathy authorized to practice in a hospital, while a \"qualified physician\" is an individual meeting specific criteria for hospital practice. A physician in a hospital must have verified credentials and be physically present to serve inpatients without delay, excluding duties in the emergency room. The hospital's emergency room must have verified credentials and a physician present to serve inpatients without delay. If a hospital violates this requirement, the Secretary of Health and Human Services will provide a warning and monitor compliance. If a hospital knowingly violates certain subsections, it may face a civil money penalty of up to $100,000. The hospital must also submit a remedial plan to prevent future violations. Civil money penalties will be enforced in accordance with the Social Security Act. If a hospital knowingly violates subsections, it may face a civil money penalty of up to $100,000 and be disqualified from participating in certain programs until compliance is assured. Failure to submit a remedial plan may result in further penalties. If a hospital fails to comply with a remedial plan, the Secretary can suspend funds until satisfactory assurances are provided. This section will take effect 180 days after the enactment of the Act."
