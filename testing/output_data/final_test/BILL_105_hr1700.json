    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Federal Lands Transportation Improvement Act\" and introduces the \"Cooperative Federal Lands Transportation Program\" under Chapter 2 of title 23, United States Code. The Cooperative Federal Lands Transportation Program is established to assist the Federal Government in ensuring adequate and safe transportation on State-owned roads across federally owned land and Indian reservations. The Cooperative Federal Lands Transportation Program (referred to as the `program') allows funds for projects on State-owned highways leading to federally owned land or Indian reservations. Projects must be proposed by a State and selected by the Secretary, focusing on highway construction or maintenance projects eligible under this title. The Secretary, in consultation with the Administrator of General Services, distributes funds for projects. The Administrator of General Services, the Secretary of the Interior, and other relevant agency heads determine the percentage of federal land in each state. They calculate the total percentage for states with 4.5% or more federal land and divide it by the state's percentage. The Secretary adjusts state percentages, reducing any over 7.5% to 7.5% and redistributing the points among other states proportionally. The Secretary allocates funds to states for eligible projects based on predetermined percentages and available program funds. States must submit project proposals by specified deadlines to receive funding. The Secretary may distribute funds to other States if a State's estimated project cost is less than 3 times the predetermined amount. States can transfer funds for projects on Federal lands highways. This applies to States with national parks visited by over 2,500,000 people in 1996 and comprising more than 3,000 square miles of land area. The Federal lands highway investment program allocates 50 percent of funds to eligible highway uses within national parks in States meeting specific criteria. The definition of Federal lands highway investment includes funds for the Federal lands highways program or the Cooperative. The text chunk discusses the reordering of paragraphs in the Federal lands highways program and the Cooperative Federal Lands Transportation Program under chapter 2 of title 23, United States Code. A conforming amendment is also mentioned in the context of the Federal lands highway investment program. Authorization of $200,000,000 annually from the Highway Trust Fund for the Cooperative Federal Lands Transportation Program under section 206 of title 23, United States Code for fiscal years 1998 through 2002."
