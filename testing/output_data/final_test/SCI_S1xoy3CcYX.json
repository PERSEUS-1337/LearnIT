    "content": "The research community has been focused on adversarial examples, which are inputs that deceive machine learning models. These examples are related to image classifiers' lack of human-level performance on corrupted images. The study shows a connection between adversarial examples and image corruptions, demonstrating that training methods can improve robustness to both. Improving adversarial robustness should be coupled with enhancing performance in the presence of realistic image corruptions. State-of-the-art computer vision models excel in image classification tasks but lack the robustness of the human visual system to various forms of corruptions. Training methods can enhance robustness to image corruptions, and a model-independent upper bound on the distance from a corrupted image to its nearest error has been presented. This suggests that reducing test error is crucial for further improving robustness for corrupted image distributions. The text discusses the limitations of current image classification models in handling various forms of image corruptions, including noise, blur, pixelation, brightness changes, and adversarial examples. These models are sensitive to perturbations and errors caused by foreign objects in the image. The focus is on improving adversarial robustness and performance in the presence of realistic image corruptions. The text explores the difference between errors caused by image corruptions and adversarial examples, questioning if the closest error to a given point is as expected or surprisingly close. This has implications for improving model generalization and addressing adversarial defense strategies. The text discusses the relationship between test performance in Gaussian noise and adversarial perturbations, suggesting that improving adversarial robustness may reduce test error in noise. This has implications for enhancing model generalization and defense strategies against adversarial attacks. The experiments show that models trained on Gaussian noise exhibit improved adversarial robustness, similar to models trained on adversarial examples. Adversarially trained models on CIFAR-10 also show enhanced resistance to random image corruptions. Additionally, a relationship is established between error rates in the presence of Gaussian noise and the existence of adversarial examples for noisy test set images. Model-independent bounds are proven, showing that tested models are close to optimal performance in noisy image distributions. In this work, various models trained on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet datasets are investigated for adversarial robustness. Different training methods, including adversarial training and Gaussian data augmentation, are explored. While models trained on Gaussian noise show improved robustness, the effects of adversarial training on ImageNet remain unexplored due to the lack of robust open-sourced models. The field of adversarial machine learning studies ways adversaries interact with ML systems, focusing on small adversarial perturbations in input data. Recent research challenges the idea that adversarial examples occupy a small subset of image space, showing that small perturbations exist under certain conditions. Studies have also identified an upper bound on adversarial robustness in specific data distributions, with generalizations to a broader class of distributions. Recent work by BID23 has extended results to a broader class of distributions, showing that adversarially robust generalization requires more data, particularly in a mixture of high dimensional Gaussians. Understanding the relationship between nearby errors and model generalization involves grasping the geometry of error sets in statistical classifiers. The study focuses on the relationship between error sets and model generalization, particularly in the context of adversarial examples and test error. The goal is to reduce test error under a given distribution of inputs, with a consideration of noisy perturbations in training or test points. The study examines the impact of error sets on model generalization, specifically in relation to adversarial examples and test error. It aims to reduce test error under a specific input distribution, considering noisy perturbations in training or test points. The adversarial robustness of the model is a key focus, with a goal of minimizing the probability of a random sample falling within a certain distance of an error set. This is a common theme in adversarial defense literature. The study focuses on the impact of error sets on model generalization, particularly in relation to adversarial examples and test error. It explores how small errors can lead to misclassifications even in accurate models, especially in high-dimensional spaces. The phenomenon of large boundary measure for sets of small volume is highlighted, emphasizing the importance of adversarial robustness in model training. In high dimensions, small adversarial perturbations can consistently be found close to a set, even if the set has a small volume. This phenomenon challenges low-dimensional spatial intuition, as most points can be near a set despite its size. This does not require the set to be unusual; it can be as simple as a ball. Therefore, errors in a noise distribution may indicate a larger error set, even if the set seems small. In high dimensions, small adversarial perturbations can be found close to a set, challenging spatial intuition. Errors in a noise distribution may indicate a larger error set, even if the set seems small. For linear models, errors in Gaussian noise and small perturbations of a clean image have an exact relationship. The distance from an image x to the decision boundary is dependent on the error rate \u00b5 and the standard deviation \u03c3, not directly on the dimension. The dimension does affect the distance to a noisy image and the decision boundary in neural networks. By comparing the ratio between distances for neural networks and linear models, we can investigate the presence of adversarial examples. Experiments on neural image classifiers suggest that adversarial examples occur at expected distances based on error rates in noise. The relationship between image classifiers and adversarial examples was explored by measuring how data augmentation affects this relationship for neural networks. It is challenging to compute the distance to the nearest error precisely, but experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet models show that adversarial examples occur at expected distances based on error rates in noise. The experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet models show that adversarial examples occur at expected distances based on error rates in noise, with interventions increasing d(x) and \u03c3(x, \u00b5). The linear model deviations are towards greater distances to the decision boundary, suggesting no need for complex error set shapes to explain errors found using PGD. The experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet models show that adversarial examples occur at expected distances based on error rates in noise. Visualizing the Decision Boundary in the Gaussian distribution reveals common themes in error sets and their relationship to test error and adversarial robustness. The experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet models demonstrate that adversarial examples occur at expected distances based on error rates in noise. Visualizing the Decision Boundary in the Gaussian distribution reveals common themes in error sets and their relationship to test error and adversarial robustness. The comparison between test error and adversarial robustness involves measuring errors in the l \u221e ball and the volume of the error set in the defined noise distribution. The PGD error is not distinguishable from other errors in the set, suggesting a connection between them. An adversarial perturbation of the center image is visually similar but has a large l 2 distance, yet both errors are classified incorrectly as \"elephant\" by the model. This indicates that they belong to the same connected component. Improving generalization in the presence of noise for statistical classifiers, including neural networks, involves increasing the distance to the decision boundary. Augmenting training data with noisy images can increase this distance, while small-perturbation adversarial examples can improve performance in noise. Analysis of model performance on various datasets supports this idea. The performance of models on different noise distributions was analyzed, including Gaussian noise, pepper noise, and stAdv adversarial attack. The models' robustness to small perturbations was measured using PGD with 100 steps. The adversarially trained CIFAR-10 model was used for testing. Gaussian data augmentation improves robustness to noise corruptions in ImageNet, with heavy Gaussian noise being most effective. Adversarial training on CIFAR-10 models showed comparable results to standard Gaussian data augmentation. The adversarially trained CIFAR-10 models performed well on worst-case perturbations in the l \u221e metric. Gaussian data augmentation improved small perturbation robustness on MNIST BID18, but its effect on generalization in PCA noise was minimal. Adversarially trained models may learn to project away high-frequency information, which doesn't help in PCA noise. The MNIST adversarially trained model from BID22 increased robustness to small perturbations but did not improve generalization in noise due to violating linearity. Failed Adversarial Defenses Do Not Improve Generalization in Noise. Previous adversarial defense strategies were analyzed, showing that they mask gradients and do not enhance small perturbation robustness. Performance of these defenses in Gaussian noise was compared, along with a model trained specifically on Gaussian noise at \u03c3 = 0.4. The study analyzed previous adversarial defense strategies, including bitdepth reduction, JPEG compression, Pixel Deflection, total variance minimization, representation-guided denoising, and random resizing/padding, all of which were found to not improve adversarial robustness in Gaussian noise. The results suggest that future defense efforts should evaluate on out-of-distribution inputs like noise distributions. The study suggests that evaluating on out-of-distribution inputs such as noise distributions is crucial for measuring progress in adversarial defense strategies. Gaussian data augmentation does not reduce error rates in Gaussian noise to zero, as observed in experiments on CIFAR-10. Previous work has shown that achieving perfect generalization in large Gaussian noise is challenging, similar to the difficulty in generalizing small perturbation robustness to the test set. This highlights the non-trivial nature of obtaining zero test error in noise. The model, while \"superhuman\" in clean test accuracy, still makes mistakes that a human wouldn't. Examples are in Appendix I, with more detailed results in Appendices C and H. Small adversarial perturbations exist due to non-zero test error rates on noisy images. This is independent of model assumptions and is a result of the Gaussian Isoperimetric Inequality. The presence of errors in Gaussian noise implies the existence of small adversarial perturbations around noisy images, leading to incorrect model outputs despite low error rates among random Gaussian perturbations. The Gaussian Isoperimetric Inequality provides a bound on the error rate in Gaussian noise, relating it to the distance to the nearest error. This is crucial for defending against adversarial perturbations in noisy images. The Gaussian Isoperimetric Inequality provides a bound on error rate in Gaussian noise, with indirect dependence on dimension. A half space minimizes surface area under Gaussian measure, making it the most robust error set. Comparing Neural Networks to the Isoperimetric Bound, models with error set as a half space are most robust on this distribution. Most noisy images are correctly classified and close to visually similar images that are not. An estimate of * q was obtained using PGD with 200 steps on 1,000 samples from a Gaussian for each test image. The relationship between the estimate of * q and error rates in Gaussian noise is close to optimal for the models considered on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet. Adversarial training improves robustness to small perturbations, primarily by improving error rates in Gaussian noise rather than decreasing the surface area of the error set. The graphs show that adversarial training on small perturbations improved generalization to large random perturbations. The plots visualize the relationship between error rates in noise and the distance from noisy points to the decision boundary. The models considered on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet show improved robustness to small perturbations, primarily in Gaussian noise. The plots compare error rates in noise to the distance from noisy points to the decision boundary. Data from models trained on clean images, adversarially trained models, and models trained on Gaussian noise are included. Adversarial examples would be a distinct phenomenon from test performance in certain cases. Adversarial examples are different from test performance as they are far from optimal. Designing defenses to smooth out decision boundaries may not be effective as image models are already close to optimal robustness. Current defense strategies, like randomly resizing inputs, have been shown to be ineffective in improving model generalization. The defense strategy against adversarial attacks has been proven ineffective against stronger adversaries. A fundamental relationship between generalization in noisy image distributions and small adversarial perturbations was established. Results suggest that small-perturbation adversarial robustness is closely linked to generalization in the presence of noise, and future defense efforts should focus on measuring progress by testing error in different noise distributions. Our work suggests that adversarial defense and improving generalization in noise involve attacking the same set of errors in two different ways. Adversarial training on small perturbations on CIFAR-10 improved generalization in noise, and training on noise improved robustness to small perturbations. The isoperimetric inequality connects these two perspectives, indicating that improvements in adversarial robustness should result in improved generalization in noise and vice versa. In high dimensions, errors are found close to test points despite low test error. The Gaussian distribution is a special case where all sets have large -boundary measure. Other distributions may not have large -boundary measure for every set. The authors recommend reporting generalization in noisy image distributions, such as the common corruption benchmark, instead of just empirical estimates of adversarial robustness. Measuring test error in noise is easier than computing adversarial robustness perfectly, which is an NP-hard problem. Only one paper has reported robustness numbers confirmed by a third party out of hundreds of adversarial defense papers published. Measuring test error in noise can help determine if defense strategies improve generalization outside natural data distribution. Failed defense strategies did not enhance generalization in noise, casting doubt on claims of improved robustness. Errors in the presence of noise indicate model insecurity in adversarial settings. The presence of noise indicates model insecurity in adversarial settings. Models need to be robust in average-case corruptions to be secure in worst-case scenarios. The interest in l p robustness is limited when attackers can make significant modifications. Statistical classifiers make errors outside their training data, and small adversarial perturbations are common. Models trained on ImageNet and CIFAR-10 were tested with Gaussian noise, showing the impact on model performance. Models were trained on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet using different models and hyperparameters. Wide-ResNet-28-10 was trained for 200 epochs with specific augmentation techniques, while ResNet-50 was trained for 90 epochs with different parameters. Gaussian noise was applied independently for each image in every minibatch during training. The stAdv attack shifts pixels of an image based on a flow field parameterized by a latent Z. Accuracy is measured against a randomized variant of this attack using noise sampled from a multivariate Gaussian distribution. PCA-100 noise samples noise from a Gaussian distribution and projects it onto the first 100 PCA components of the data. For ImageNet, a PCA decomposition is performed on 30x30x1 patches from different color channels to generate noise. In Section 5, the noise is generated by sampling from a 900 dimensional Gaussian and projecting it onto the top 100 PCA components. Each color channel is constructed independently in this manner. The performance of models trained and tested on various scales of Gaussian noise is presented in TAB2. MNIST models can become robust to small perturbations by learning to threshold the input. The model from BID22 generalizes worse than a naturally trained model in different noise distributions, as shown in TAB4. Future work should focus on demonstrating improved generalization outside the natural data distribution. The Gaussian isoperimetric inequality will be discussed in more detail, presenting geometric intuition and showing how it follows from the usual form of the inequality. The earliest version of the isoperimetric inequality is about areas of subsets of the plane and is unrelated to Gaussians. The isoperimetric inequality deals with finding subsets of the plane with the smallest possible perimeter for a given area. It involves defining the perimeter of a set using the concept of boundary measure. The goal is to use as little fence as possible when fencing off a region with a specific area. The isoperimetric inequality bounds the quantity inside a limit for a set in R^2 in terms of what it would be for a ball. It is a generalization to subsets with minimal surface area for a given volume, such as balls and spherical caps. The focus in this paper is on the generalization to a Gaussian distribution. The Gaussian isoperimetric inequality in this paper focuses on the relationship between the probability mass in a set E and its -extension. It states that sets with the smallest -extensions are half spaces, aiming to minimize the probability of landing in a set E for a given probability p. The Gaussian isoperimetric inequality states that half spaces minimize the probability of landing in a set E for a given probability p. It involves the standard normal distribution q on R n and a measurable subset E. The inequality is expressed as a bound on the probability of landing in E for an arbitrary measurable set E. The optimal bound from the isoperimetric inequality provides strong bounds for worst-case l2 perturbations and error rates in Gaussian noise. Visualizing images sampled from noisy data and at various l2 distances from the clean image shows that even with large noise levels, test error must be very low to have significant worst-case perturbations. Images minimizing similarity according to the SSIM metric are visualized to show worst-case perturbations at different l2 distances. The curr_chunk discusses the process of finding optimal curves on Imagenet for different values of \u03c3 using gradient descent to minimize the SSIM metric. It includes visualizations of images at different l2 distances from the clean image, showing minimal perceptible changes despite minimizing visual similarity. The section also mentions additional visualizations of church window plots and predictions of an ordinarily trained model on CIFAR test points. Figure 8 and Figure 9 show visualizations of clean test points, errors found using different methods, and the model's prediction probabilities. The images display the impact of Gaussian noise on error rates and the model's confidence in its predictions. The images in Figure 8 and Figure 9 illustrate the impact of Gaussian noise on error rates and model prediction probabilities. The clean image is correctly classified with high probability, while the average and PGD errors are misclassified with lower probabilities. Moving errors into the orange region significantly increases misclassification probabilities. The impact of Gaussian noise on error rates and model prediction probabilities is illustrated in Figure 8 and Figure 9. The clean image is correctly classified with high probability, while errors are misclassified with lower probabilities. Random errors found using Gaussian noise lie close to the decision boundary, affecting error rates in the test set. Visualizations show the impact of \"pepper noise\" on error rates as well. In the visualization, noisy images were analyzed with different types of noise: Gaussian, pepper, and random errors. Models trained on noise still showed errors in classifying images from the CIFAR test set, indicating reduced performance even with noise training. The curr_chunk discusses the iid test errors for the ResNet-50 model on the ImageNet validation set and visualizes different noise distributions and model errors."
