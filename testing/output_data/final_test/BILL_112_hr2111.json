Congress finds that thirteen salmon and steelhead species in the Columbia and Snake River Basin are listed as endangered due to factors like hydroelectric projects, habitat degradation, and unsound hatchery practices. The original range of Snake River salmon included habitat in the upper Columbia River and upper Snake River Basins. Since the construction of Federal dams on the lower Snake River, all salmon and steelhead populations have been affected. Snake River in Washington has salmon and steelhead populations that are either extinct or endangered/threatened under the Endangered Species Act. Climate change and rising water temperatures are negatively impacting North American coldwater fish species, including Snake River salmon. These populations are crucial for maintaining and rebuilding salmon populations in the Columbia River Basin. Salmon and steelhead have significant economic, ecological, recreational, and cultural importance to the Nation. The salmon and steelhead populations in the Snake River are vital for communities in several states, generating millions of dollars in benefits. Restoring these populations could bring billions in additional revenue. Treaties with Indian tribes and Canada legally require the restoration of salmon populations. Time is running out to protect and restore these populations, with some facing extinction in less than 20 years. Snake River salmon populations are at risk of extinction within 20 years if action is not taken. Over $10 billion has been spent on recovery efforts in the Columbia and Snake River Basin. Removing the 4 lower Snake River dams is recommended by scientists to protect and recover the salmon and steelhead populations. Sediment buildup behind the Lower Granite Dam poses a flood risk to Lewiston, Idaho, with potential costs of nearly $2 billion. A study by the Army Corps of Engineers found that buildings and infrastructure worth nearly $2 billion are at risk of major damage from levee breaching. The costs of river-dredging and levee-raising to protect this area could amount to hundreds of millions of dollars. A Federal court determined that the 4 lower Snake River dams violate water quality standards. Removing these dams would open up over 100 miles of free-flowing river ways and improve freight transportation systems. Studies have found that the Northwest has ample clean renewable energy sources to replace the electricity generated by the 4 lower Snake River dams in a cost-effective and environmentally sound manner. Completing the planning and evaluation required under this Act will better prepare the region to manage salmon recovery and implement necessary Federal actions. The Act aims to protect and restore wild Columbia and Snake River salmon and steelhead to self-sustaining levels while ensuring clean renewable energy, reliable transportation, and economic sustainability. It also seeks to maximize economic benefits by removing the lower Snake River dams. The Act aims to protect and restore wild Columbia and Snake River salmon and steelhead to self-sustaining levels while ensuring clean renewable energy, reliable transportation, and economic sustainability. Additionally, it seeks to maximize economic benefits by removing the lower Snake River dams. The Act also includes a provision for scientific analysis of federal salmon recovery actions. The Secretary of Commerce will collaborate with the National Academy of Sciences for a scientific analysis of Federal salmon recovery actions, including reviewing the impact of removing the lower Snake River dams on salmon and steelhead populations. The National Academy of Sciences will submit a report on the results within 10 months of the Act's enactment. Scientific analysis conducted under the agreement will be provided to the Secretary of the Army, Secretaries of Commerce, Transportation, Energy, and the Interior, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, and Congress for consideration. SEC. 4. STUDY OF RAIL, HIGHWAY, AND BARGE IMPROVEMENTS. The Secretary of Transportation will conduct a study on infrastructure improvements for rail, highway, and Columbia River barge systems to ensure efficient transportation for shippers using barge transportation between Lewiston, Idaho, and the Snake and Columbia Rivers. The study will also assess potential cost increases if the lower Snake River dams were removed and explore options to minimize impacts on shippers. The Secretary of Transportation will incorporate input from farmers, shippers, state departments of transportation, and other stakeholders in the agricultural and business communities. A report on the study results will be submitted to the Secretary of the Army and Congress within 12 months of the Act's enactment. The study of energy replacement will be conducted and a report on the results will be submitted to the Secretary of the Army and Congress within 12 months. The Secretary of Energy will conduct a peer-reviewed study on energy replacement options for the lower Snake River dams, reviewing clean renewable energy resources and projects. A report on the study results will be submitted to the Secretary of the Army and Congress within 12 months. The Secretary of Energy will conduct a study on energy replacement options for the lower Snake River dams, focusing on clean renewable energy resources and projects. The study results will be submitted to the Secretary of the Army and Congress within 12 months. The Secretary of the Army, in consultation with relevant State and local governments, will conduct a study on riverfront revitalization opportunities and costs post-removal of the 4 lower Snake River dams. The focus will be on Lewiston, Idaho, and Clarkston, Washington, with potential impacts on other communities along the river. The study will undergo peer review for accuracy. The Secretary of the Army will conduct a study on riverfront revitalization opportunities and costs post-removal of the 4 lower Snake River dams. A report on the study results, including engineering options and costs, will be transmitted to Congress within 12 months of the Act's enactment. The Secretary of the Interior will conduct a peer-reviewed study on the options and costs of modifying affected irrigation systems, cooling systems, and private wells if the 4 lower Snake River dams are removed. A report on the study will be submitted to the Secretary of the Army and Congress within 12 months. Congress authorizes the Secretary of the Army to remove the 4 lower Snake River dams. The Secretary, in consultation with other agencies, will update the feasibility study on salmon migration, considering climate change impacts on the populations and habitat. The curr_chunk discusses various aspects related to the potential removal of the 4 lower Snake River dams, including impacts on steelhead populations and habitat, replacement of energy output with renewable resources, maintaining irrigated acreage, costs of sediment/flood risk mitigation, Passive Use Values, and alternate dam removal methods. The 2002 environmental impact statement includes options for full dam removal or removing/notching concrete portions. The Secretary of the Army is required to complete a re-evaluation, submit a report to Congress within 24 months, determine engineering options and costs, and undergo peer review for accuracy. SEC. 9. DEFINITIONS. Clean renewable energy resources defined in the Act include incremental electricity from efficiency improvements in hydroelectric projects, wind, solar energy, geothermal energy, landfill gas, wave/ocean/tidal power, gas from sewage treatment facilities, and biomass energy. The term \"Federal salmon recovery actions\" refers to Federal actions necessary to protect and restore salmon and steelhead in the Columbia and Snake River basin listed under the Endangered Species Act. The term excludes certain energy sources and is not limited to actions solely aimed at avoiding jeopardy to these populations. The term \"4 lower Snake River dams\" refers to specific dams on the Snake River in Washington: Ice Harbor, Lower Monumental, Little Goose, and Lower Granite. A \"peer-reviewed study\" is a study reviewed according to guidelines issued by the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. \"Salmon and steelhead populations\" are evolutionarily significant units in the Columbia and Snake River basin. Salmon and steelhead populations in the Columbia and Snake River basin are listed under the Endangered Species Act of 1973."
