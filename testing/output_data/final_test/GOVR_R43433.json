    "content": "The United States and Vietnam have strengthened relations across various sectors since establishing diplomatic ties in 1995. Interest in enhancing cooperation in nuclear energy has grown, leading to the signing of a civilian nuclear cooperation agreement in 2014. This agreement, known as a \"123 agreement,\" allows for the export of nuclear technology and reactors. Congressional review of the U.S.-Vietnam 123 agreement began in May 2014, with a potential entry into force after a 90-day review period. The U.S.-Vietnam 123 agreement on nuclear cooperation was subject to a congressional review period that ended on September 9, 2014. Key issues during the review included nonproliferation commitments, human rights considerations, strategic relations, and potential benefits for U.S. companies. Vietnam also has nuclear cooperation agreements with other countries. The U.S. nuclear industry sees significant export opportunities in Vietnam. The U.S. nuclear industry sees export opportunities in Vietnam through the 123 agreement. The agreement aims to strengthen nuclear safety and regulatory framework in Vietnam, with U.S. experts advising Vietnamese officials. Services could be provided as part of a reactor supply agreement signed with Japan in 2010. The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) trained Vietnamese officials on nonproliferation and nuclear safety best practices for power plant operation. Vietnam's Atomic Energy Law was passed in June 2008 with U.S. assistance. A Memorandum of Understanding was signed in 2010 to increase cooperation on nuclear safety. Vietnam's current nuclear infrastructure includes a research reactor and research institutes. The United States provided South Vietnam with a 250 kilowatt research reactor under the Atoms for Peace program in the 1960s. The reactor, located in Dalat, used highly enriched uranium fuel for training, research, and radioisotope production. After the Vietnam War, the Vietnam Atomic Energy Commission was established in 1976 for civilian nuclear research. The International Atomic Energy Agency has been providing technical assistance to Vietnam since 1978. In the early 1980s, the Soviet Union helped upgrade the research reactor to a 500 kw Russian design powered by highly enriched uranium. Vietnam converted the Dalat research reactor from highly enriched uranium (HEU) to low enriched uranium (LEU) with U.S. assistance, removing 11 kg of HEU in July 2013. This cooperation advanced U.S.-Vietnam nuclear nonproliferation efforts. Vietnam plans to build nuclear power plants to meet its growing energy demands, aiming for nuclear power to provide 20%-30% of its electricity by 2050. Vietnam's government endorsed nuclear power in a study in 1995, with plans to introduce nuclear energy by 2015. Feasibility studies were conducted in the late 1990s and early 2000s. By 2020, the goal was to have 2,000 megawatts of electric generating capacity, eventually reaching 20,000 MWe by 2040. The National Assembly approved plans in 2009 to build two 1,000 MWe reactors in Ninh Thuan province, with additional reactors planned for 2026. The Vietnamese government's nuclear energy plan includes three phases: Phase I (2010-2015) focused on training specialists and setting up regulatory frameworks, Phase II (2015-2020) involved constructing nuclear plants at Phuoc Dinh and Vinh Hai, and Phase III (2020-2030) planned for additional reactor construction. The master plan issued in July 2011 called for the construction of two reactors at Phuoc Dinh by 2025, two more at Vinh Hai by 2027, and two larger reactors at another site by 2029. The country aimed to reach a generating capacity of 14,800 megawatts by 2030, with a potential delay in the construction of the first plant at Phuoc Dinh until 2020. The Russian firm AtomStroyExport is set to build two 1,200 MWe light-water reactors at the Ninh Thuan 1 power plant in Phuoc Dinh, Vietnam. The construction may be delayed until 2020, affecting the planned completion of the first reactor in the mid-2020s. Training staff for the nuclear power program has been a challenge, and Rosatom will establish a training center in Vietnam to help prepare specialists. The contract includes provisions for fuel supply and spent fuel management. Cost estimates for the power plants vary. Rosatom's cost estimate for the first two-reactor power plants in Vietnam is up to $8 billion, with total costs including infrastructure development reaching $10 billion. Russia's Ministry of Finance is expected to finance most of the costs. AtomStroyExport will also build two additional reactors at the site. A Japanese consortium plans to build four light-water reactors at Ninh Thuan 2, with support from the Japanese government. Vietnam has no plans for a full fuel cycle capability and will store spent nuclear fuel on-site for at least 30 years. Russia will take back the spent fuel. Vietnam is exploring options for spent fuel storage as Russia will take back the spent fuel from Russian-built plants. They are also looking into exploiting domestic uranium reserves and collaborating with Canadian and Japanese firms for exploration. Additionally, Vietnam has signed a memorandum of understanding with India on uranium ore processing technologies. Despite concerns from the Champa ethnic group about potential infringements on their villages, Vietnam's nuclear energy plans have not faced significant domestic opposition as of mid-2014. The U.S. nuclear industry and Japanese supply consortium, JINED, are involved in reactor projects in Vietnam. Japan offers boiling water reactor (BWR) and pressurized water reactor (PWR) designs for Ninh Thuan 2, with the possibility of using some U.S. components and services. Hitachi, a JINED member, collaborates with GE for nuclear business. A U.S.-Vietnam 123 agreement would be beneficial for the project. A U.S.-Vietnam 123 agreement is crucial for U.S. participation in Ninh Thuan 2 due to export license requirements for reactor components. South Korea is also planning a nuclear power plant in Vietnam using designs licensed from Westinghouse. South Korea's nuclear power plant export project in Vietnam may require a consortium similar to the one in the UAE, involving Westinghouse and U.S.-based firms. A U.S.-Vietnam 123 agreement would likely be necessary for this project. The potential for U.S. job creation in Vietnam's nuclear power projects is uncertain, but the Barakah project in the UAE, led by a Korean consortium, could serve as a model. The Export-Import Bank of the United States approved $2 billion in financing for U.S. involvement in nuclear projects. The Export-Import Bank of the United States approved $2 billion in financing for U.S. equipment and services for the Barakah project, supporting approximately 5,000 American jobs across 17 states. Westinghouse and other U.S. companies will supply reactor components, controls, engineering services, and training. The Fukushima nuclear disaster raised concerns about safety in new nuclear energy countries, including Vietnam's capacity to regulate its nuclear energy sector. Vietnam reaffirmed its commitment to nuclear power post-Fukushima disaster, sparking global reexamination of emergency preparedness. Concerns raised about Vietnam's ability to regulate nuclear sector, especially in light of past tsunamis and climate change vulnerability. Collaboration with International Atomic Energy Agency to meet safety standards and ensure adequate infrastructure and expertise. After multiple visits by the International Atomic Energy Agency, Vietnam announced a delay in the start-up date for its first nuclear reactors to enhance regulatory infrastructure and train personnel. Vietnam aims to be the first in Southeast Asia to operate a nuclear power plant, with uncertainties about regional concerns and considerations for neighboring countries' energy needs. Vietnam opposes dams built by neighbors for hydroelectric power along the Mekong River due to potential negative impacts. The Obama Administration's nuclear cooperation agreement spurred Vietnam to strengthen nonproliferation policies. Vietnam supports nuclear disarmament and nonproliferation, with a law forbidding nuclear weapons development. Vietnam is actively involved in nonproliferation efforts, being party to major treaties such as the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and having agreements with the IAEA. It is also collaborating with the IAEA and South Korea on a tracking system for radiological materials. Additionally, Vietnam is a member of various international initiatives like the Global Nuclear Energy Partnership and the Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism. Vietnam joined the Proliferation Security Initiative in 2014 to enhance international cooperation in intercepting weapons of mass destruction. They have also removed weapons-usable nuclear material from the country and established cooperation with the US for converting their research reactor to LEU fuel. Vietnam has converted its research reactor to LEU fuel and removed weapons-usable nuclear material. The US is assisting Vietnam in strengthening its export control system to prevent illicit transfers of nuclear materials. There is debate over whether countries like Vietnam should renounce enrichment and reprocessing technology. The United States is discussing a nuclear cooperation agreement with Vietnam, but there is debate over whether Vietnam should commit to refraining from enriching uranium. Vietnamese officials have stated they do not plan to pursue uranium enrichment. The United States is discussing a nuclear cooperation agreement with Vietnam, but there is debate over whether Vietnam should commit to refraining from enriching uranium. Vietnamese officials have stated they do not plan to pursue uranium enrichment. A commitment to forgo enrichment is not required for bilateral nuclear cooperation agreements under U.S. law or the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). The recent agreement with the United Arab Emirates included a provision that would preclude enrichment or reprocessing in the UAE. Some Members of Congress and outside experts argue that including a promise not to build enrichment and reprocessing facilities should be emulated in other agreements. The U.S.-Taiwan 123 agreement includes \"gold standard\" prohibitions on enrichment and reprocessing within Taiwanese territory. The U.S.-Taiwan 123 agreement includes prohibitions on enrichment and reprocessing within Taiwanese territory. The U.S. will continue to pursue incentives like multilateral fuel banks to discourage countries from developing their own fuel-making technology. The Nuclear Suppliers Group has also tightened restrictions on transfers of these technologies. Assistant Secretary of State Thomas Countryman testified on January 30, 2014. Assistant Secretary of State Thomas Countryman testified on January 30, 2014 about the U.S. policy to pursue 123 agreements that minimize the proliferation of ENR technologies worldwide. The United States encourages nations interested in civil nuclear power to rely on the international market for fuel services instead of developing indigenous ENR capabilities. The agreement with Vietnam includes a commitment to rely on international markets for nuclear fuel supply, with U.S. support to ensure a reliable supply. Vietnam does not make a binding legal commitment to forswear ENR in the text of its 123 agreement. The United States and Vietnam have improved relations across various issues, with Vietnam identified as a strategic partner in the U.S. \"pivot\" to the Asia-Pacific. The 123 agreement with Vietnam prohibits the enrichment or reprocessing of U.S.-obligated nuclear materials without specific U.S. consent. President Obama and President Truong Tan Sang announced a bilateral \"comprehensive partnership\" in 2013. In Washington, DC, a bilateral \"comprehensive partnership\" was established to enhance cooperation in various areas, including nuclear energy. The agreement reflects the strength of the U.S.-Vietnam Comprehensive Partnership, with a focus on maritime security and economic ties. The United States and Vietnam have collaborated in opposing China's actions in the South China Sea. Bilateral economic ties between the United States and Vietnam have strengthened, with bilateral trade reaching over $29 billion in 2013. Both countries are part of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade agreement negotiations. The U.S. has increased efforts to clean up sites contaminated by Agent Orange/dioxin from the Vietnam War. The U.S.-Vietnam nuclear cooperation agreement is seen as expanding ties between the two countries. The 123 agreement between the U.S. and Vietnam is crucial for their growing relationship, but concerns over Vietnam's human rights record could hinder cooperation. The Vietnamese Communist Party allows some personal and religious expression but represses dissenters, posing a challenge to closer ties. In recent years, repression against dissenters and protestors in Vietnam has intensified, with bloggers and lawyers representing human rights activists being targeted. Many of those targeted have criticized Vietnam's policy towards China or have ties to pro-democracy groups. The Cham ethnic minority group has faced harassment for opposing the construction of nuclear plants in their village. Despite calls for reducing the Communist Party's influence, Vietnam was elected to the UN Human Rights Council and ratified new constitutional amendments in 2013. Many observers believe recent constitutional changes in Vietnam did little to weaken the Communist Party's monopoly on power and ability to deny basic freedoms. The Obama Administration has expressed concerns about human rights in Vietnam, with disagreements in formal human rights dialogues. Despite these differences, the overall relationship between the United States and Vietnam has improved. Despite concerns about Vietnam's human rights record, U.S. officials view it as a limitation on long-term accomplishments rather than a barrier to short-term cooperation. Criticisms from Members of Congress have influenced the Administration to delay or oppose certain items desired by Hanoi. The debate over a TPP agreement may be complicated by concerns over Vietnam's human rights record. It is uncertain if the Obama Administration has directly linked TPP negotiations to improvements in Vietnam's human rights conditions. Analysts have varying opinions on the impact of U.S. pressure on Vietnam's domestic policies. The debate over human rights in Vietnam has not affected the 123 agreement negotiations between the two governments. Some Senators have called for a separate human rights bill to be passed alongside the U.S.-Vietnam nuclear cooperation agreement. The President determined in February 2014 that the nuclear cooperation agreement with Vietnam would not pose an unreasonable risk to common defense and security. The White House sent documents to Congress regarding a nuclear cooperation agreement with Vietnam. The agreement complies with the Atomic Energy Act and may enter into force after a 90-day review period unless a resolution of disapproval is passed. Members of Congress can introduce resolutions during this time. Members of Congress have discussed the U.S.-Vietnam nuclear cooperation agreement, with some proposing changes to approval procedures for such agreements. A Senate hearing focused on issues surrounding the Vietnam nuclear cooperation accord. Some Senators proposed a human rights bill on Vietnam as a condition for approving the nuclear cooperation agreement. Three bills were introduced to approve the agreement with Vietnam, including S.J.Res. 36 introduced by Senator Menendez and passed by the Senate on July 31, 2014. Another bill, S.J.Res. 39, was introduced by Senator Reid, and H.J.Res. 116 was introduced by Representative Kinzinger and Ranking Member Engel. The agreement may enter into force after the 90-day congressional review period ended on September 9, 2014."
