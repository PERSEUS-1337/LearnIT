    "content": "In 1996, Congress amended the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act to allow civil suits by U.S. victims of terrorism against certain States responsible for such acts. The amendment was initially resisted by the executive branch but was signed into law by President Clinton after a civilian plane was shot down by the Cuban air force. The Flatow Amendment was later passed to create a cause of action for plaintiffs, leading to numerous court judgments awarding substantial compensatory and punitive damages. The D.C. Circuit's interpretation in 2004 made it harder for plaintiffs to win further awards. Plaintiffs now rely on state law, leading to disparities in relief for victims of terrorist attacks. Despite State sponsors of terrorism not appearing in court, U.S. courts have awarded over $19 billion to victims, with most remaining uncollected due to a lack of assets in U.S. jurisdiction. Efforts to enforce judgments against terrorist States in U.S. jurisdiction face challenges due to a scarcity of assets. Calls for fair compensation for terrorism victims clash with U.S. foreign policy goals and business interests. Congress passed a rider to provide a cause of action against terrorist States. The National Defense Authorization Act for FY2008 (H.R. 1585) allows for a cause of action against terrorist States and facilitates enforcement of judgments. After the President vetoed the bill, Congress passed a new version (H.R. 4986) authorizing the President to waive its provisions with respect to Iraq. The President signed the bill into law (P.L. 110-181) and issued a waiver for Iraq. The Administration now seeks a waiver for Libya and other States. The Court of Appeals ruled that the waiver for Iraq does not affect pending cases under the FSIA. This report discusses foreign State immunity, exceptions for suits against terrorist States, legislative initiatives to assist claimants, legal arguments in Roeder v. Islamic Republic of Iran, and efforts to override the Algiers Accords. It also covers the Administration's actions regarding Iraq's frozen assets. The report discusses actions vesting title to Iraq's frozen assets in the United States, making them unavailable to former POWs and other plaintiffs who have won judgments against Iraq. It also mentions an effort by Iran to void a judgment against it and the laws in certain terrorist States that allow suits against the U.S. for similar acts. The issue of providing fair compensation to victims of terrorism is ongoing. Additionally, the report includes a list of cases covered by the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000, detailing the compensation paid in each case and the source of the compensation. It also mentions judgments handed down later that are not covered by earlier legislation, with creditors likely to compete to satisfy claims.

It also mentions judgments handed down later that are not covered by earlier legislation, with creditors likely to compete to satisfy claims out of scarce blocked assets. Customary international law historically afforded sovereign States complete immunity from being sued in the courts of other States. Sovereigns enter foreign territory under express license or implied immunities, waiving some territorial jurisdiction for mutual intercourse. This principle of sovereign immunity has been gradually limited in the last century. The principle of sovereign immunity, which has been gradually limited in the last century, was further restricted after World War II to allow domestic courts to exercise jurisdiction over suits against foreign States for claims arising from their commercial activities. The United States adopted this \"restrictive principle\" of state immunity in 1952. The Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (FSIA) was enacted in 1978, codifying the principle that a foreign state is immune from U.S. court jurisdiction, with exceptions for cases where immunity is waived, commercial activities in the U.S., or tortious acts causing injury or damage in the U.S. This Act replaced the State Department's previous role in determining immunity on a case-by-case basis. The Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (FSIA) allows for claims against a foreign State in the United States due to tortious acts by officials or employees. Commercial property of a foreign State in the U.S. can be attached to satisfy judgments. Exceptions exist for assets of separate instrumentalities of a foreign government. In 1996, the FSIA was amended to allow U.S. courts to exercise jurisdiction over foreign States and their agencies in civil suits by U.S. victims of terrorism. The Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 amended the FSIA to remove immunity for foreign States in cases seeking money damages for acts of torture, extrajudicial killing, etc. committed by officials of the foreign State. The Act required the State to be designated as a State sponsor of terrorism, the claimant or victim to be a U.S. national, and the defendant State to have prior notice. The Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 amended the FSIA to remove immunity for foreign States in cases seeking money damages for acts of terrorism. The act required the victim to be a U.S. national and allowed for compensatory and punitive damages. The Clinton Administration agreed to these changes, and Congress passed the Civil Liability for Acts of State-Sponsored Terrorism. The Flatow Amendment, part of the Omnibus Consolidated Appropriations Act for Fiscal 1997, allows for suits against officials of foreign states designated as state sponsors of terrorism for terrorist acts committed within the scope of their office. Cuba and Iran faced lawsuits under this provision, despite not recognizing U.S. court jurisdiction. The FSIA allows for default judgments in cases where states refuse to appear in U.S. courts. Iran and Cuba were held culpable for acts of terrorism in default judgments, but refused to pay damages. Plaintiffs sought to attach their assets in the U.S. to satisfy the judgments. In Flatow v. Islamic Republic of Iran, plaintiffs sought to attach Iran's embassy and diplomatic properties in Washington, DC, rental proceeds, and an award from the Iran-U.S. Claims Tribunal. The Clinton Administration opposed, citing sovereign immunity and obligations under international conventions. The Clinton Administration argued that funds set aside to pay an award to Iran were still U.S. property and immune from attachment due to sovereign immunity. Efforts were made to attach assets of Iran and Cuba in the U.S. that had been blocked by sanctions regulations. Iran's assets in the U.S. had been frozen under the IEEPA since the hostage crisis in 1979. Most of Iran's assets were returned or placed in an escrow account in England under the Iran-U.S. Claims Tribunal. Cuba's assets in the U.S. had been blocked since the 1960s. The Clinton Administration opposed access to these assets, citing their usefulness as leverage in foreign policy disputes and negotiations with Iran and Cuba. Numerous U.S. nationals had legitimate claims against these countries that could be affected if the assets were accessed. The 105th Congress in 1998 further amended the FSIA to allow frozen assets of terrorist States to be used for compensating victims of State-sponsored terrorism, despite objections from the Administration about potential risks to U.S. assets. Section 117 of the Treasury Department Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 1999 mandated assistance to judgment creditors against terrorist States. President Clinton signed legislation into law in 1998 allowing frozen assets of terrorist States to compensate victims of State-sponsored terrorism. Section 117 of the Treasury Department Appropriations Act mandated assistance to judgment creditors against terrorist States, with the President having the authority to waive requirements in the interest of national security. Clinton immediately executed the waiver, citing concerns about potential encroachment on his constitutional authority regarding foreign embassy properties. Section 117 of the Treasury Department Appropriations Act, signed into law in 1998 by President Clinton, allows frozen assets of terrorist States to compensate victims of State-sponsored terrorism. The President has the authority to waive requirements in the interest of national security. However, applying section 117 to foreign diplomatic or consular property could breach international treaty obligations and jeopardize protection at embassies and consulates worldwide. It could also hinder the use of blocked assets for national security purposes and impede global claims settlements, potentially leading to U.S. taxpayer liability. The President aims to interpret section 117 in a manner consistent with his constitutional authority and U.S. interests. President Clinton's exercise of the waiver authority under section 117 of the FY1999 Treasury Department appropriations act blocked default judgments against Cuba and Iran from attaching diplomatic property and frozen assets. Members of Congress pushed for amendments to the FSIA to override the waiver and allow judgments against terrorist States to be satisfied from frozen assets. The Justice for Victims of Terrorism Act was considered, but the Clinton Administration opposed it. The Clinton Administration opposed the Justice for Victims of Terrorism Act, which aimed to amend the FSIA to allow the attachment of all assets of terrorist States to satisfy judgments. Instead, negotiations led to the enactment of section 2002 of the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Against Women Act of 2000, which created an alternative compensation system for some judgment holders. This included the payment of damages awarded in certain judgments out of Cuba's frozen assets and U.S. appropriated funds for judgments against Iran. Default judgments against Iran continued to be issued, and new suits against terrorist States were filed. The Justice for Victims of Terrorism Act aimed to amend the FSIA to allow attachment of assets of terrorist States to satisfy judgments. The Clinton Administration faced criticism for opposing efforts of terrorism victims to collect on judgments. Senator Mack, a cosponsor, expressed disappointment in the President's failure to support victims as promised. The Clinton Administration faced criticism for prioritizing terrorist assets over justice for victims of terrorism. Victims' families and officials expressed disappointment in the Administration's actions, stating that the Victims of Terrorism Act was flawed and had negative effects. The Victims of Terrorism Act was criticized for being flawed and having five principal negative effects. It would undermine the President's ability to combat terrorism, violate international treaty obligations, and put diplomatic and consular property at risk. The Victims of Terrorism Act was criticized for putting diplomatic and consular property at risk of attachment, creating a race to the courthouse, and breaching the principle of sovereign immunity for the U.S. Government. This would impact the ability to conduct diplomatic relations and protect personnel and facilities, potentially leaving no assets for compensation claims. The United States Government's sovereign immunity prevents it from fulfilling debts and international obligations, potentially burdening taxpayers with financial liability. The legislation is scored at $420 million by the Congressional Budget Office, mainly affecting the Foreign Military Sales Trust Fund. Waiving sovereign immunity could expose the Trust Fund to attachment writs, creating uncertainty in the FMS program and disregarding the legal status of States and their agencies. The Justice for Victims of Terrorism Act overturns Supreme Court precedent by holding state majority-owned corporations liable for state debts. The House Judiciary Committee passed a slightly amended version of the bill, citing the President's waiver power as a hindrance to victims' rights. The legislation aims to prevent blockage of attachment of assets while still allowing the President to block embassies. H.R. 3485 amends the law to prevent blockage of attachment of proceeds from assets used for non-diplomatic purposes. The bill was passed by the House but faced opposition from the Clinton Administration, leading to negotiations. An alternative compensation scheme was added to an unrelated bill and signed into law by President Clinton. Section 2002 of the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act directed the Treasury Secretary to pay portions of judgments against Cuba and Iran. Section 2002 of the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act directed the Treasury Secretary to pay portions of judgments against Cuba and Iran. The judgments were handed down by July 20, 2000, in cases such as Alejandre, Flatow, Cicippio, Anderson, and Eisenfeld. Claimants had three options for compensation, including receiving 110 percent of compensatory damages if they relinquished further rights to collect damages. The Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act directed the Treasury Secretary to pay portions of judgments against Cuba and Iran. Claimants had three options for compensation, including receiving 110 percent of compensatory damages if they relinquished further rights to collect damages. They could also agree to relinquish rights to further compensatory damages and certain categories of property in satisfaction of their judgments for punitive damages. The Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act directed the Treasury Secretary to pay portions of judgments against Cuba and Iran. For the ten designated cases against Iran, \u00a72002 provided for payment out of U.S. funds, including using proceeds from the rental of Iranian diplomatic property in the U.S. and funds from Iran's Foreign Military Sales account. The FMS Fund had about $377 million in 2000, with funds deposited by Iran and additional funds provided by Congress to pay contractors for goods and services. Disposition of military equipment procured for Iran through the FMS fund remains unresolved between the U.S. and Iran. The unresolved issue between the United States and Iran before the U.S.-Iran Claims Tribunal involves Iran's claims for billions of dollars related to alleged overcharges and nondeliveries of military equipment. The United States has filed counterclaims to recover amounts it claims Iran owes on the contracts. Section 2002 allows the United States to pursue subrogated rights for payments made out of U.S. funds and bars the release of funds to Iran from frozen assets or the Foreign Military Sales account. Section 2002 prohibits the release of funds to Iran from frozen assets or the Foreign Military Sales Fund until subrogated claims are satisfied. It also states that relations between the US and Iran should not be normalized until these claims are resolved to the satisfaction of the US. Additionally, it reaffirms the President's authority to manage foreign assets in the US to assist victims of terrorism and modifies the mandate for the State and Treasury Departments to assist judgment creditors of terrorist States. President Clinton signed legislation into law on October 28, 2000, which granted him the authority to waive certain provisions in the interest of national security. This included the ability to use blocked assets of Cuba to satisfy a judgment, but did not eliminate the bar to attaching diplomatic property. In November and December 2000, the Office of Foreign Assets Control issued a notice detailing procedures for obtaining partial payment of judgments against terrorist States. The federal government liquidated $96.7 million of blocked Cuban assets to compensate claimants in the Alejandre suit and their attorneys. Claimants in cases against Iran received over $380 million in compensation. After receiving over $380 million in compensation from U.S. funds, additional default judgments were handed down in suits against terrorist States under the FSIA exception. Some judgments were covered by the compensation scheme set forth in the Victims of Trafficking statute, while others were not. Pressure for compensating additional claimants led to the enactment of several pieces of legislation by the 107th Congress. In November 2001, Congress directed President Bush to submit a legislative proposal for fair compensation for US victims of international terrorism since November 1, 1979. This directive was added to the appropriations bill for FY2002, replacing an amendment for partial payment of judgments in specific cases. The conference report called for a legislative proposal to provide fair compensation to all U.S. victims of international terrorism, emphasizing the need for a system similar to the one in place for September 11 victims. President Bush signed the measure into law, citing his commitment to fulfilling the directive. President Bush signed the Foreign Relations Authorization Act for Fiscal 2003 into law, allowing cases filed against Iran to be compensated under \u00a72002. One such case involved Navy divers who were hijacked in 1985 and tortured by terrorists. Another case, involving the murder of Robert Stethem during the same hijacking, was also included for compensation under \u00a72002. The amendment enacted into law as part of the foreign relations authorization bill rectified the omission of the Navy divers' case from compensable cases under \u00a72002. The Terrorism Risk Insurance Act (TRIA) signed into law by President Bush made frozen assets of terrorist States available to satisfy judgments for compensatory damages against such States. The amendment allows blocked assets of terrorist parties to be used to satisfy judgments for compensatory damages against them, with limited waiver authority for the President in the national security interest. The amendment allows blocked assets of terrorist parties to be used to satisfy judgments for compensatory damages against them, with limited waiver authority for the President in the national security interest. Only property subject to the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations or the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations is included in the amendment. Additionally, it amended the Victims of Trafficking Act to make compensable all suits against Iran filed before October 28, 2000, allocating 90 percent of the remaining fund for compensatory damages and setting aside 10 percent for compensation under the same formula. During the 108th Congress, Senator Lugar introduced a proposal to establish an administrative procedure for compensating victims of international terrorism as an alternative to lawsuits under the terrorist State exception to the FSIA. The proposal aimed to provide compensation to victims who obtained judgments against terrorist States after the bill's introduction, allowing them to receive compensatory damages without having to relinquish their right to punitive damages. The bill introduced during the 108th Congress aimed to establish a new compensation scheme for victims of international terrorism. It would prevent claimants from collecting compensatory damages from terrorist States' blocked assets and instead offer up to $262,000 through the \"Benefits for Victims of International Terrorism Program.\" Accepting benefits from the program would prohibit individuals from suing terrorist States for the same act. The compensation system for victims of international terrorism was criticized as inequitable, unpredictable, and costly to taxpayers. Stuart Eizenstat and Allan Gerson raised concerns about the insufficiency of compensation and denial of plaintiffs' day in court. No further action was taken on the bill, but the Flatow Amendment in 1996 allowed for a cause of action against foreign officials for terrorist conduct. Iran was held liable in the Flatow case and awarded compensatory and punitive damages. The Flatow Amendment in 1996 allowed for a cause of action against foreign officials for terrorist conduct, leading to compensatory and punitive damages awarded against Iran. However, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia ruled in 2004 that the amendment does not provide a cause of action against terrorist States themselves, including governmental agencies and separate commercial \"agencies and instrumentalities\" under the FSIA. The case involved claims for damages by the adult children and siblings of Joseph Cicippio, a hostage victim who had previously won a $30 million judgment against Iran for financing Hezbollah terrorists. The district court dismissed the case for failure to state a claim, but the appellate court ruled that the Flatow Amendment does not provide a cause of action against terrorist States themselves. The court remanded the case to allow the plaintiffs to amend their complaint and awarded them $91 million in compensatory damages for intentional infliction of emotional distress under Pennsylvania law. The court also limited the Flatow Amendment's private right of action against officials, employees, and agents of foreign states to claims against officials in their individual capacities. Establishing that an official-capacity claim against a government official is essentially a claim against the government itself, as it would be responsible for paying any damages awarded. Some judges have awarded punitive damages against foreign officials in their official capacity, while others have found them liable in their personal capacities under the Antiterrorism Act. The Cicippio-Puleo ruling complicated plaintiffs' efforts to sue designated State sponsors of terrorism by requiring a source of law outside the FSIA for a cause of action. Some plaintiffs awarded default judgments had to amend complaints to establish liability under state laws. Disparity in damages availability due to state tort laws. Federal statutes outside FSIA resulted in lower damages. Plaintiffs in a lawsuit related to the U.S.S. Cole attack were awarded less than $8 million for economic damages, with no compensation for pain and suffering. A separate case against Iran for damages related to embassy hostage situations was initially granted a default judgment, but the U.S. government intervened to have the judgment vacated and the case dismissed. The U.S. government intervened in a lawsuit related to embassy hostage situations to have the judgment vacated and the case dismissed. Congress passed an amendment specifying that the case should be included within the terrorist State exception to the FSIA. The amendment specifies that a foreign state not designated as a state sponsor of terrorism at the time of the act occurred should not be immune from suit, as in the case related to the 1979 Tehran hostages. President Bush acknowledged this provision when signing the appropriations act into law. Iran's immunity from suit in a case brought by the 1979 Tehran hostages in the District Court for the District of Columbia is being challenged. The government argues that the suit is barred by the Algiers Accords, with Judge Sullivan expressing concern about the lack of clarity in the recent Congressional enactment. The 107th Congress made a minor technical correction in the reference to the Roeder case in the fiscal 2002 appropriations act for the Department of Defense. The conference report clarified the effect of the earlier FSIA amendment regarding the Roeder case, affirming the validity of the plaintiffs' judgment and allowing for damages under the Antiterrorism Act of 1996. President Bush signed the Department of Defense appropriations measure into law on January 10, 2002, making a technical correction to a provision but not altering its effect. The executive branch has encouraged courts to act in line with the Algiers Accords, leading to a motion to vacate a default judgment against Iran in April 2002. The court granted the government's motion to vacate the default judgment against Iran and dismiss the suit, citing lack of jurisdiction, inapplicability of the cause of action, and the Algiers Accords as substantive law. Congress's enactments were deemed too ambiguous to override the international commitment. The court suggested that Congress's enactments in the Roeder case may have interfered with its adjudication, raising separation of powers concerns. The U.S. Court of Appeals affirmed the decision, emphasizing that the legislative history plaintiffs sought to use does not carry the force of law. Executive agreements are like contracts between nations and are expected to be honored. Congress or the President may abrogate an executive agreement, but legislation must be clear. The court emphasized that legislation must be clear to abrogate an executive agreement, ensuring that Congress and the President have considered the consequences. Efforts have been made in multiple Congresses to enact legislation explicitly abrogating provisions of the Algiers Accords. The Senate Appropriations Committee proposed an amendment to the FSIA in the \"Fiscal 2003 Appropriations Act for the Departments of Commerce, Justice, and State\" (S. 2778) that would allow United States citizens held hostage in Iran after November 1, 1979, to claim money damages against the government of Iran, despite any provisions in the Algiers Accords or other international agreements. The Senate proposed an amendment to the FSIA in the \"Fiscal 2003 Appropriations Act\" to allow US citizens held hostage in Iran to claim damages against the Iranian government, despite the Algiers Accords. Legislation in subsequent Congresses attempted to abrogate the Algiers Accords, but no action was taken. H.R. 3358 sought to declare the Algiers Accords void and compensate the hostages. The proposed legislation in the 110th Congress, such as H.R. 394, H.R. 6305, and S. 3878, aimed to provide compensation to victims of hostage-taking, including the Iran hostages. The bills did not mention the Algiers Accords and would have prohibited recipients from suing a foreign State in U.S. court. Payment from Iran's FMS fund could potentially violate the Algiers Accords if deemed Iran's property by the U.S.-Iran Claims Tribunal. Similar bills were introduced in the 110th Congress as H.R. 3369 and H.R. 3346. The 110th Congress introduced legislation such as H.R. 3369 and H.R. 3346 to create a federal cause of action against terrorist States. Despite the dismissal of the Roeder case, jurisdiction was carried over from former statutes. President Bush issued an executive order in 2003 for the confiscation of Iraq's frozen assets for post-war reconstruction. According to the Terrorist Assets Report 2002, Iraq's blocked assets totaled $1.73 billion at the end of 2002. The President's order excluded certain assets from confiscation, totaling about $300 million, to be used to assist the Iraqi people. This made Iraq's frozen assets unavailable to those who obtained judgments against the State for terrorism post-March 20, 2003. Subsequent actions by the President reinforced this executive order. The President took additional actions to complement the executive order, declaring certain provisions inapplicable to Iraq under the EWSAA. This included making Iraq's assets unavailable to victims of terrorism and protecting the Development Fund of Iraq from judicial processes. The legality of restoring Iraq's sovereign immunity and blocking its assets from terrorism victims is questioned. In Acree v. Republic of Iraq, a federal court awarded $653 million in compensatory damages and $306 million in punitive damages to American POWs for Iraq's imprisonment and torture during the Gulf War. A temporary restraining order was issued to retain Iraq's assets in the U.S. pending further court decision. The court denied the government's motion to intervene in the Acree v. Republic of Iraq case, stating that Iraq's sovereign immunity could not be retroactively restored by Congress or the President. The court held that the Presidential Determination effectively prevented the plaintiffs from enforcing their judgment against frozen Iraqi assets, citing Congressional authorization for the President to make TRIA inapplicable to Iraq. The court of appeals reversed the President's Determination nullifying FSIA provisions for Iraq, allowing the government to intervene. However, the plaintiffs were unable to collect their judgment due to a lack of cause of action against Iraq and Saddam Hussein's retained immunity. The court of appeals reversed the President's Determination nullifying FSIA provisions for Iraq, allowing the government to intervene. However, the plaintiffs were unable to collect their judgment due to a lack of cause of action against Iraq and Saddam Hussein's retained immunity. The terrorism exception to the FSIA combined with the Flatow Amendment created a private right of action against officials, employees, and agents of a foreign government for their private conduct, but not against the foreign government itself or officials in their official capacity. The Supreme Court declined to review the decision, and the Plaintiffs' motion to reopen their case at the district court level was dismissed as moot. Two bills were introduced during the 108th Congress in the House of Representatives to provide relief for the plaintiffs, expressing Congress's resolve to oversee the application of \u00a71503 to ensure it is not misinterpreted. Additionally, the Senate passed language in \u00a7325 of the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations for Iraq and Afghanistan Security and Reconstruction Act, 2004, calling for negotiations with citizens affected by Iraqi terrorism. The Attorney General should negotiate with citizens affected by Iraqi terrorism to provide compensation for damages incurred, potentially using assets of Saddam Hussein's regime. Bills in the 108th Congress aimed to allow plaintiffs and POWs to recover damages from frozen Iraqi assets for reconstruction. No similar legislation was introduced in the 109th Congress. H.Con.Res. 93 and H.R. 1321 aimed to compensate American prisoners of war for torture by the Government of Iraq during the 1991 Gulf War. The bills proposed payment from unobligated funds in the Iraq Relief and Reconstruction Fund, but were not enacted into law. Smith v. Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan initially targeted Al Qaeda, Afghanistan, and the Taliban for damages from the 2001 terrorist attacks, later adding Iraq and Saddam Hussein as defendants. Saddam Hussein's dismissal was based on the Flatow Amendment provision. The judge dismissed Saddam Hussein from the case based on the Flatow Amendment provision, which precludes lawsuits against foreign officials. The case against Iraq continued, with the plaintiffs proving that Iraq supported Al Qaeda. A final judgment awarded the plaintiffs $104 million, with Iraq responsible for $63.5 million. However, the President had already frozen Iraq's funds, making it difficult for the plaintiffs to collect their damages. The Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment in favor of the Federal Reserve Bank and Treasury Department without ruling on the President's order restoring Iraq's immunity. The court ruled on the validity of the President's order restoring Iraq's sovereign immunity, finding that the funds in question were not blocked assets under TRIA \u00a7 201. Judgment creditors can still seek to satisfy their judgments from other assets. A similar case, O'Neill v. Republic of Iraq, is still pending. Hill v. Republic of Iraq involved U.S. citizens held hostage by Iraq after the Kuwait invasion in 1990, resulting in compensatory and punitive damages awarded in a default judgment. In Vine v. Republic of Iraq, 237 plaintiffs, including U.S. nationals used as \"human shields\" by Iraq, were denied class action status and a moratorium was imposed on adding new plaintiffs. Iraq moved to dismiss the claims, and the court dismissed causes of action based on the Flatow Amendment. The court dismissed causes of action based on the Flatow Amendment and federal common law in the Vine v. Republic of Iraq case. Claims based on U.S. state and foreign law were permitted to proceed, while several other claims were dismissed as untimely. Two journalists alleged they were illegally seized and tortured by Iraqi officials in 1991, but the court ruled the statute of limitations had expired. The court in Beaty v. Iraq determined that the statute of limitations for filing a suit against Iraq did not run until 10 years after the enactment of the terrorism exception to the FSIA. The lawsuit was brought by five children of two men held hostage in Iraq during the 1990s, based on claims of intentional infliction of emotional distress under state common law and violations of customary international law. The court in Beaty v. Iraq addressed claims of intentional infliction of emotional distress under state common law and violations of customary international law. Iraq moved to dismiss the complaint citing nonjusticiability under the political question doctrine and lack of jurisdiction due to a presidential order. The court rejected the federal common law claims but allowed the case to proceed. The court in Lawton v. Republic of Iraq allowed the lawsuit to continue under state claims, with facts from a previous case deemed established. Iraq's appeal was unsuccessful, but a petition for certiorari has been filed at the Supreme Court regarding the President's order restoring Iraq's sovereign immunity. The lawsuit alleges damages from the bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Building in Oklahoma City in 1995, with claims that Iraq was involved in orchestrating the attack. The plaintiffs in a lawsuit against the Republic of Iraq sought a default judgment after Iraq failed to appear in court. The court initially denied the motion but later entered a default judgment against Iraq. Iraq requested to set aside the default judgment, which was granted. Changes in the National Defense Authorization Act for FY2008 made it easier for plaintiffs to attach defendant State assets and refile claims that were dismissed for lack of a federal cause of action. The National Defense Authorization Act for FY2008 made it easier for plaintiffs in a lawsuit against Iraq to refile their claims under new provisions, including a cause of action against terrorist States. President Bush vetoed the first version of the FY2008 NDAA due to concerns about Iraq's economic development and security. Congress passed H.R. 4986, allowing the President to waive any provision of \u00a71083 concerning Iraq's economic development and security. The waiver must be in the national security interest of the United States, promote democracy in Iraq, and be retroactive. The President signed the FY2008 NDAA into law, and a waiver was issued justifying the exercise of the waiver authority for Iraq. The waiver was deemed necessary for national security interests and to prevent negative impacts on Iraq's ability to use funds for security forces and U.S. troops in the field. The waiver of section 1083 is necessary to prevent interference with political and economic progress in Iraq, redirect financial resources for reconstruction, maintain macroeconomic stability, support private sector development, and promote democracy in Iraq. The waiver of section 1083 is crucial to prevent hindrance to political and economic progress in Iraq, redirect financial resources for reconstruction, maintain stability, support private sector development, and promote democracy. This waiver also aims to protect vocational training, job placement programs, and community reintegration efforts essential for counterterrorism initiatives. The waiver may impact pending lawsuits like the Acree case under previous provisions, but recent court decisions suggest potential avenues for these cases to proceed. The court disagreed with Iraq's interpretation of the NDAA, allowing plaintiffs with pending claims against defendants other than Iraq to pursue claims under both the repealed \u00a7 1605(a)(7) and new \u00a71605A. Iraq may seek Supreme Court review of the decision. Final judgments against Iraq are not affected by the presidential waiver, but enforcement may remain difficult. Some avenues for enforcing terrorism judgments are unaffected by \u00a7 1083, but may not apply to Iraq. The executive orders protect Iraq's frozen assets from attachment by judgment creditors. However, 28 U.S.C. \u00a71610(a)(7) could still allow attachment of Iraqi government assets used for commercial purposes in the U.S. not covered by E.O. 13303, for valid terrorism judgments against Iraq. Another executive order could protect all Iraqi assets from attachment. Congress included in \u00a71083 its sense that the President could issue another executive order to protect all Iraqi assets from attachment to satisfy judgments related to terrorism cases. Iran has not defended itself in court against terrorism cases, but challenged a decision allowing a judgment-holder to collect part of a judgment against Iran. The Ministry of Defense and Support for the Armed Forces of Iran asked the Supreme Court to overturn a decision allowing a judgment-holder to collect part of a judgment against Iran from an award owed to Iran by a third party. Dariush Elahi sought to attach a $2.8 million arbitral award issued in Iran's favor by the International Chamber of Commerce for a breach of contract in 1979, while also holding a default judgment of $311.7 million against Iran and its Ministry of Intelligence and Security for the assassination of his brother. The court denied Flatow's petition to attach Iranian assets in satisfaction of judgments, citing waiver under the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act. Elahi, however, retained the right to pursue the remaining compensatory damages from Iranian blocked assets. Iran claimed immunity under the FSIA for military purposes, but the court rejected this, noting the funds would be deposited in Iran's central bank. The court rejected Iran's arguments regarding the attachment of judgment, citing that the funds would be deposited in Iran's central bank. MOD's attempts to invoke blocking regulations and contest the jurisdiction of the court were also dismissed. The court affirmed the decision in favor of Elahi as MOD failed to show inconsistencies with due process or lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. MOD petitioned the Supreme Court challenging the Ninth Circuit's classification of MOD as an \"agency or instrumentality\" of Iran and its liability for debts of MOIS under the FSIA. Iran challenged the assessment that the judgment due on a military contract is not military property under the FSIA. The Supreme Court granted certiorari only on MOD's status as an \"agency or instrumentality\" of Iran. The Court vacated the decision below, stating MOD had not had an opportunity to present arguments. The Ninth Circuit erred by assuming MOD was an \"agency or instrumentality\" of a foreign State, leading to a misunderstanding of the FSIA exception to sovereign immunity. On remand, it was clarified that MOD is a foreign State, not an agency, requiring the judgment owed to MOD in the Cubic Defense arbitration to qualify as property used for commercial activity for the exception to apply. The court found that the judgment was a \"blocked asset\" under TRIA \u00a7 201, allowing the judgment holder to attach the entire sum as it represented an interest in military equipment acquired by Iran before 1981. One dissenting judge argued that the judgment should be considered \"at issue\" before the Iran-U.S. Claims Tribunal in a case involving Iran's claims against the United States for non-delivery of military equipment. The Supreme Court granted certiorari to review whether an arbitral award is a \"blocked asset\" under TRIA \u00a7 201 and if it is \"at issue\" before the Iran-U.S. Claims Tribunal, making it off-limits for attachment in satisfaction of a judgment against Iran. The Solicitor General supported certiorari on the first issue but advised against reviewing the second issue. In the 109th Congress, bills addressing the Acree decision and providing compensation in the Roeder case were discussed. In the 109th Congress, bills were introduced to address the Acree decision and provide compensation in the Roeder case. H.R. 865 / S. 1257 aimed to repeal the Flatow Amendment and establish a cause of action against foreign terrorist States and their agents for personal injury or death, allowing for money damages including economic, solatium, pain and suffering, and punitive damages. It would have also held foreign States vicariously liable for such actions. The bill in the 109th Congress aimed to provide compensation for victims of hostage-taking by foreign States or terrorist parties, allowing for awards of up to $500,000. It also included provisions for punitive damages and attachment of property to enforce judgments. The bill in the 109th Congress aimed to provide compensation for victims of hostage-taking by foreign States or terrorist parties, allowing for awards of up to $500,000. Plaintiffs with unsatisfied judgments against terrorist States would have been permitted to bring a claim for compensation from the Hostage Victims' Fund, funded by various sources including blocked assets and fines for violations of laws and regulations. Members of the Armed Services taken hostage after August 2, 1990, would not have been eligible for compensation under the plan. The Justice for Victims of State Sponsored Terrorism Act, S. 1944, was passed to facilitate lawsuits against terrorist States. President Bush vetoed the initial bill due to concerns about its impact on Iraq's economy, but a new version, H.R. 4986, was passed and signed into law on January 28, 2008. Section 1083 of the bill creates a new section 1605A in title 28, U.S. Code, incorporating the terrorist State exception to sovereign immunity under the FSIA. The Justice for Victims of State Sponsored Terrorism Act, S. 1944, created a new section 1605A in title 28, U.S. Code, incorporating the terrorist State exception to sovereign immunity under the FSIA. This exception allows for lawsuits against designated State sponsors of terrorism seeking money damages for personal injury or death caused by defined terrorist acts or material support provided by State officials. The cause of action covers foreign terrorist States and their agents, officials, and employees, holding them liable for such acts within U.S. jurisdiction. The Flatow Amendment allows for punitive damages against officials, employees, or agents of foreign states. Courts have awarded punitive damages by holding foreign states vicariously liable for the actions of their officials. Personal injury claims can also be brought for reasonably foreseeable damages. The Flatow Amendment allows for punitive damages against officials, employees, or agents of foreign states for personal injury claims and property loss. New 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1605A expands jurisdiction to include U.S. nationals, members of the Armed Forces, and government employees and contractors. Claims must be heard in cases related to terrorism acts in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. The Flatow Amendment allows for punitive damages against officials, employees, or agents of foreign states for personal injury claims and property loss. New 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1605A expands jurisdiction to include U.S. nationals, members of the Armed Forces, and government employees and contractors. Claims must be heard in cases related to terrorism acts in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. The statute of limitations for claims under the act requires the commencement of an action within 10 years after April 24, 1996 or 10 years from the date on which the cause of action arose. The Flatow Amendment allows for punitive damages against officials, employees, or agents of foreign states for personal injury claims and property loss. New 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1605A expands jurisdiction to include U.S. nationals, members of the Armed Forces, and government employees and contractors in cases related to terrorism acts. Section 1083 provides for the appointment of special masters to determine civil damages for the bombing of the Marine barracks in Lebanon in 1983, funded by the Victims of Crime Act. Interlocutory appeals are subject to limitations, and an automatic lien of lis pendens can be established on property subject to attachment in aid of execution. The doctrine of lis pendens allows for the attachment of property in aid of execution under federal law, specifically in cases involving State sponsors of terrorism. The enforcement of lis pendens is governed by state law, with varying rules across different states. Lis pendens typically applies to specific property in dispute, which must be described clearly for potential buyers to identify. Lis pendens is filed in civil litigation to notify third parties that a property is subject to a lawsuit, preventing its sale. It does not act as a lien or attachment, but binds anyone acquiring an interest in the property to the lawsuit's outcome. In civil litigation, lis pendens is filed to notify third parties of a property's involvement in a lawsuit, affecting its value and enjoyment. Courts may require a bond from the lis pendens proponent if damages are likely due to unjustified notice. Some states allow for expunging the notice if the litigation doesn't meet statutory requirements. Additionally, the court can cancel the notice if the defendant provides alternative security. The clerk of the district court must file a notice of action indexed by defendants and their controlled entities. It is unclear how to ensure adequate notice to potential buyers or determine if the property is subject to attachment. Federal law typically requires compliance with state recordation procedures for real property notices. The notice of lis pendens affecting real estate must be properly recorded with the local registry of deeds to be effective. If the filing requirement in section 1605A(g) replaces state statutes, prospective purchasers without actual notice of the lis pendens could raise due process claims. State courts are less frequently the venue for lawsuits under the terrorism exception to the FSIA, but lis pendens will be available under applicable state law for qualifying property. State sponsors of terror already have substantial limitations on property transactions. The primary utility of a lis pendens notice is to establish a priority among lien-holders in collecting from the defendant's assets. It preserves priority for plaintiffs over subsequent lienors, purchasers, and encumbrancers. The notice \"relates back\" to its filing date, giving priority to plaintiffs with pending cases against the defendant. However, extending lis pendens to property owned by entities believed to be controlled by the defendant State could impact unsanctioned property. The lis pendens provision, if broadly construed, could deter transactions and threaten lawful transactions for States no longer under terrorism sanctions. It may impose barriers to trade by affecting property not already subject to sanctions, making it effectively inalienable. This could lead to litigation against U.S. companies doing business with such States, potentially impacting their assets. The amendment to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1610 under P.L. 110-181 allows for the attachment and execution of judgments against foreign States or their agencies, including property held directly or indirectly by separate entities, regardless of economic control. The amendment to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1610 under P.L. 110-181 allows for the attachment and execution of judgments against foreign States or their agencies, including property held directly or indirectly by separate entities, regardless of economic control. This provision enables execution on property where the foreign State has beneficial ownership, except for diplomatic and consular property. It does not provide the President with waiver authority, except for Iraq, and does not abrogate sovereign immunity of other States holding assets of a defendant State. The amendment to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1610 allows for the attachment and execution of judgments against foreign States or their agencies, including property held directly or indirectly by separate entities, regardless of economic control. This provision enables execution on property where the foreign State has beneficial ownership, except for diplomatic and consular property. The language renders subject to execution any property of the defendant foreign State regardless of specific criteria, with courts considering these criteria in determining liability. The new language in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1610 allows for the attachment and execution of judgments against foreign States or their agencies, including property held by separate entities, regardless of economic control. This provision enables execution on property where the foreign State has beneficial ownership, except for diplomatic and consular property. The criteria for determining liability in cases involving entities related to foreign governments are clarified. The new language in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1610 allows for the attachment and execution of judgments against foreign States or their agencies, including property held by separate entities, regardless of economic control. The conferee's intent to enable execution on property in which the defendant state has beneficial ownership seems contradicted by the statement that the property is subject to execution regardless of whether the \"profits of the property go to that government\" or \"whether that government is the sole beneficiary in interest of the property.\" Subparagraph (3) addresses the rights of third parties who also have an interest in the property that may be subject to levy in execution on a judgment. The conferees aimed to protect the property interests of innocent third parties by allowing courts to use their authority to execute judgments on foreign States or their agencies, including indirectly held property. However, there is ambiguity in how this provision applies to assets of foreign governments and their instrumentalities. Subsection (g)(2) states that U.S. sovereign immunity does not apply in these cases. The new subsection (g)(2) aims to prevent regulated property from being immune from execution to satisfy a judgment due to U.S. sanctions. It does not waive U.S. sovereign immunity but is designed to counter provisions in sanctions regulations that protect blocked property from court action. This provision differs from current laws and allows assets to be attached to enforce punitive damages. It is unlikely to affect funds in the U.S. Treasury. The new subsection (g)(2) aims to prevent funds in the U.S. Treasury from being reachable by judgment creditors, even if U.S. sovereign immunity is waived. This provision protects U.S. property and upholds obligations under the Algiers Accords. The VTVPA \u00a7 2002 amendments affect those who received U.S. funds for judgments against Iran, barring them from collecting punitive damages. Subsection (c) of \u00a7 1083 applies to pending cases under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1605(a)(7) or the Flatow Amendment. The VTVPA \u00a7 2002 amendments impact cases involving U.S. funds for judgments against Iran, preventing the collection of punitive damages. The federal district court must treat cases as if under new provisions, potentially reinstating vacated judgments and waiving certain defenses. It is unclear how pending state court cases are to be handled, and refiling actions may not override strict statute of limitations decisions. Post-judgment relief could allow for increased awards, including punitive damages, under the Flatow Amendment. The Flatow Amendment allows for the amending of judgments against officials to hold foreign States responsible for debts related to State-supported terrorism. It also permits the filing of new cases for terrorism incidents, even if the statute of limitations has expired, as long as another victim has filed suit in time. This may benefit previously uncovered claimants, such as foreign nationals injured in terrorist attacks while working for the U.S. government overseas. Additionally, it allows plaintiffs with previous judgments to pursue new judgments for the same terrorist incident. The Flatow Amendment allows for new judgments to be pursued by plaintiffs with previous judgments for the same terrorist incident, even if the foreign State is no longer designated as a State sponsor of terrorism. Actions must be filed within sixty days after enactment or the date of entry of judgment in the original action. Subsection (c) allows for relief from final judgment in cases where litigants have filed a motion for relief under Rule 60(b) or any other available motion. The Flatow Amendment allows for new judgments to be pursued by plaintiffs with previous judgments for the same terrorist incident, even if the foreign State is no longer designated as a State sponsor of terrorism. Actions must be filed within sixty days after enactment or the date of entry of judgment in the original action. Subsection (c) allows for relief from final judgment in cases where litigants have filed a motion for relief under Rule 60(b) or any other available motion. Appeals are no longer possible under the new law, and there are concerns about the provision's potential vulnerability to invalidation due to an improper exercise of judicial powers by Congress. The Emergency Wartime Supplemental Appropriations Act (EWSAA) does not authorize the removal of court jurisdiction or the restoration of Iraq's sovereign immunity. The Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2008 prohibits funds for Libya unless certified by the Secretary of State. The Secretary of State must certify that Libya has settled payments to victims' families and is engaging in settlement discussions for terrorism cases before any assistance can be provided. Additionally, the State Department must report on efforts to resolve these cases and U.S. commercial activities in Libya's energy sector within 180 days. New lawsuits are barred six months after a state is removed from the list of terrorism sponsors, but new cases related to existing terrorism lawsuits can be filed within 60 days of the NDAA enactment. Without intervention by Congress, a State could face new lawsuits related to acts of terrorism until 60 days after final judgment in pending cases. This could hinder trade with the State, as new laws may make commercial transactions more challenging. Judgment holders may seek to attach goods purchased by the debtor government to satisfy prior judgments. If judgment holders seize property or debts from a U.S. company, the contracting government may hold the company liable for breach of contract. The government could also justify its own breach of contract, leading to losses for the U.S. company. Litigation risks exist, especially if disputes are resolved according to foreign law or international arbitration. The risk of litigation, even if successful, may deter trade with former State sponsors of terrorism. This could make trade between U.S. companies and these countries more difficult and riskier. Concerns have been raised that certain regulations may harm U.S.-Libya trade, despite efforts to promote investment and growth in bilateral trade with Libya. Nearly $1.7 billion has been awarded against Libya, along with $5.3 billion against certain Libyan officials, with 20 pending cases. Settlement negotiations are ongoing to resolve outstanding cases, and a bill was enacted to exempt Libya from terror-related lawsuits if it compensates U.S. victims under a claims settlement agreement. The United States enacted a bill to settle terrorism-related claims and provide fair compensation to U.S. nationals with claims against Libya. The statute allows the Secretary of State to designate entities to assist in compensation distribution, but does not specify their role in adjudicating claims or the details of compensation agreements. Funds received from Libya would be transferred to the designated entity for dispersal to claimants, with the entity's property related to the claims agreement being immune. The statute provides immunity to Libya and its entities from judicial attachment and lawsuits related to implementing a claims agreement. It also grants immunity to property belonging to Libya and its agents from attachment in aid of execution. The bill aims to protect Libyan funds from being seized for terrorism-related claims, ensuring they cover settlements for Pan Am 103 and La Belle Disco bombings. The Secretary of State has discretion over fair compensation, but it's unclear how funds will be dispersed among claimants. The bill aims to protect Libyan funds from being seized for terrorism-related claims, ensuring coverage for settlements in the Pan Am 103 and La Belle Disco bombings. There is no requirement for the designated entity to disperse the funds, and it is inferred that only claims meeting certification requirements will be compensated. Claimants without pending cases under \u00a7 1605A for wrongful death or physical injury may not receive compensation. Finally adjudicated cases are not covered, potentially rendering unsatisfied judgments against Libya unenforceable. Claimants may have limited recourse in court. The bill aims to protect Libyan funds from seizure for terrorism-related claims, ensuring coverage for settlements in specific bombings. Claimants may have limited recourse in court, with potentially unenforceable judgments against Libya. H.R. 3346 and H.R. 3369 contain provisions for returning assets from the Hostage Victims' Fund to a foreign State after its terrorist designation has been lifted. H.R. 3369 includes provisions for frozen assets and expands compensation eligibility for hostages, specifically including plaintiffs in Hegna v. Islamic Republic of Iran. It covers individuals kidnapped by Hezbollah in 1984 and transferred to Iran. Children and spouses of victims at the time of the hostage-taking could receive 50% of the compensation. The Hegna plaintiffs may be excluded from compensation under H.R. 394, which aims to abrogate the Algiers Accords and establish a fund for former hostages and their families. S. 1839 requires regular reports on legal claims against Libya by American victims. The status of legal claims by American victims against Libya for acts under section 1605(a)(7) of title 28, United States Code, is required to be reported regularly. H.R. 5167, the Justice for Victims of Torture and Terrorism Act, would repeal the waiver provision for Iraq and nullify existing waivers. Some states affected by the FSIA exception have enacted legislation allowing citizens to sue the United States for human rights violations. Cuba reportedly allows similar lawsuits. Cuba and Iran allow lawsuits against foreign states for human rights violations and interference in internal affairs. Judgments have been awarded against the U.S., including one for half a billion dollars in damages to an Iranian businessman. The businessman sued the U.S. for various offenses related to his arrest by U.S. Customs agents in the Bahamas. The 1996 amendments to the FSIA allowed victims of terrorism to sue designated foreign States for damages in U.S. courts. Difficulties in obtaining payment of damages and efforts in Congress to facilitate payment from frozen assets have raised complex issues involving effectiveness, fairness, diplomacy, and U.S. foreign policy goals. U.S. courts have awarded victims of terrorism over $19 billion in judgments against State sponsors of terrorism under the terrorism exception to the FSIA. Claimants have faced challenges in collecting their judgments, with blocked assets of terrorist States often insufficient to satisfy compensatory damages. Iran and Iraq's assets are largely unavailable for payment, while Cuban assets made available by \u00a7 2002 have been liquidated to pay judgment creditors. The appellate court decision in 2004 clarified that no cause of action exists under the FSIA to sue terrorist States directly. This led to the application of domestic state tort law in lawsuits against terrorist States based on the victim's domicile, causing disparity in relief available to victims. The confusion surrounding the definition of an \"agency or instrumentality\" of a foreign State also added uncertainty to these lawsuits. The Supreme Court's Elahi case emphasized the distinction between \"agencies and instrumentalities\" and foreign States, but did not address other issues related to the terrorism exception to the FSIA. Section 1083 of the FY2008 National Defense Appropriations Act is expected to clarify the existence of a federal cause of action against State sponsors of terrorism. The total amount of judgments against State sponsors of terrorism and former State sponsors of terrorism is likely to increase more rapidly, especially if \u00a7 1803(c) is deemed valid to permit the refiling of cases, the reinstatement of vacated judgments, or the upward amendment of final awards. Making the assets of separate agencies and instrumentalities available to satisfy judgments may increase the total assets available for levy in the short term, but may also lead such entities to avoid future transactions that would put their assets at risk. An increase in transactions with debtor States may occur only with those no longer under anti-terrorism sanctions, potentially hindering trade despite lifted sanctions. The terrorism exception to the FSIA could lead to a decrease in terrorist attacks affecting U.S. interests, reducing judgments over time. Judgments Against Terrorist States and Assets of Terrorist States are detailed in the appendices."
