SEC. 3. REDUCTION IN NUMBER OF WARHEADS IN ARSENALS OF UNITED STATES AND RUSSIA. Repeal of prohibition against reductions in nuclear warheads and weapons delivery systems between the US and Russia. Policy to reduce nuclear arsenal to lowest possible number while ensuring national security. Bilateral agreements for transparency, predictability, and verification of reductions. Permanent reductions in US nuclear weapons force. The policy calls for reductions in the US nuclear weapons force in line with the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. Any unilateral reductions should aim to facilitate bilateral agreements with Russia, with enhanced consultation and cooperation. Transparency and confidence-building measures are also encouraged for stable strategic relations. The United States policy aims to ensure the safe, secure, and accountable removal and eventual destruction of any nuclear warheads from weapon systems through formal agreements with Russia. These agreements can be made through existing agreements or new ones between the two nations. SEC. 4. REDUCTION IN ALERT STATUS OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS OF UNITED STATES AND RUSSIA. The policy of the United States is to pursue formal arrangements with Russia to reduce the immediate launch-ready status of nuclear weapons, starting with those designated for dismantlement under the START II treaty. Any changes in alert status should be transparent and verifiable. If the President changes the alert status of US nuclear weapons, it should align with national security and be part of efforts to persuade Russia to do the same. Formal arrangements with Russia are sought to reduce the immediate launch-ready status of nuclear weapons. Security and verifiability measures must ensure the secure removal of weapons from high alert status and their accountability, which should be verifiable by both nations. SEC. 5. ACCELERATION OF PROGRAMS TO PREVENT DIVERSION OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS, MATERIALS, AND EXPERTISE FROM RUSSIA. The United States aims to cooperate with Russia to prevent the diversion of nuclear weapons, materials, and expertise. This involves identifying and securing all elements of Russia's nuclear arsenal, prioritizing safeguards for weapons most susceptible to proliferation. The United States aims to cooperate with Russia to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons and materials. This involves identifying, accounting for, and securing all elements of Russia's nuclear stockpile, with a focus on safeguarding the elements most susceptible to proliferation. The United States aims to cooperate with Russia to prevent nuclear proliferation by identifying and securing Russia's nuclear weapons expertise and reducing its nuclear production capacity. Additionally, efforts are made to render unused nuclear materials and weapons systems permanently unusable. Authorization of appropriations is provided for these activities. Authorization of appropriations for cooperative threat reduction programs in fiscal year 2002: $600 million for the Department of Defense, $1.2 billion for the Department of Energy, and $200 million for the Department of State. The President must submit a plan by April 15, 2002, to secure and neutralize all nuclear weapons and materials in Russia over the next eight years. The plan required by subsection (a) aims to prevent the outflow of nuclear material and scientific expertise from Russia that could be used for developing weapons of mass destruction. It includes specific goals, measurable objectives, criteria for success, and a strategy for eventual termination of US contributions to these programs. The President plans to make administrative and organizational changes to coordinate programs effectively with Russia. Coordination with Russia is necessary for the plan's practicability, and consultation with Congress is required. Additionally, the President will conduct a study on the Debt-for-Security Program. The President will conduct a study on the feasibility of creating a new source of funds for nuclear nonproliferation programs in Russia through a debt forgiveness program in exchange for payments into a fund supporting agreed-upon programs. Consultation with Russia and other nations is required, and a report on presidential determinations is due by April 15, 2002. The President will submit a report to Congress by April 15, 2002, detailing determinations on creditor nations' participation in debt forgiveness, payments by Russia in Russian currency, ratio of payments to debt forgiven, fund expenditure purposes, and means of ensuring proper fund use. The report to Congress will include a legislative proposal for implementing any program recommended by the President based on determinations regarding creditor nations' participation in debt forgiveness and fund expenditure purposes."
