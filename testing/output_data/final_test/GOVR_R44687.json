    "content": "President Theodore Roosevelt and subsequent Presidents have designated over 100 national monuments under the Antiquities Act of 1906, protecting millions of acres of land and marine areas. These monuments are declared through public proclamations, with some recent ones including detailed management terms and restrictions. Controversies have arisen over the size, location, creation process, and management terms of some national monuments. The authority of a President to establish, abolish, or significantly diminish national monuments under the Antiquities Act remains unresolved. While courts have generally upheld monument proclamations, it is debated whether a President can lawfully revoke or diminish a monument. The scope of a President's authority to take actions such as reducing acreage or changing monument uses is still a topic of ongoing debate. The Antiquities Act of 1906 allows the President to unilaterally reserve federal land as national monuments, which are conservation units preserving significant resources or attractions. Most national monuments are managed by the National Park Service, although other agencies also oversee some monuments. The Antiquities Act of 1906 allows the President to declare national monuments on federal land, preserving historic landmarks and structures. Presidential authority to designate national monuments has been broadly interpreted by courts. President Theodore Roosevelt's proclamation of over 800,000 acres around the Grand Canyon as a national monument was challenged in Cameron v. United States in 1920. The Antiquities Act empowers the President to establish national monuments, as seen in the case of the Grand Canyon. The Supreme Court upheld the Act's broad application, allowing presidential proclamations for monuments without triggering usual procedural requirements. The Antiquities Act empowers the President to establish national monuments, with the overriding management goal being the protection of the objects described in the proclamations. Limitations on certain uses may be included in the proclamations, management plans, agency policies, or other sources. Recent proclamations have stated that federal lands reserved as national monuments are withdrawn from various forms of entry and disposition, subject to valid existing rights. The question has arisen whether a President could lawfully revoke or substantially alter these proclamations. The Antiquities Act empowers the President to establish national monuments for the protection of objects described in the proclamations. Recent proclamations have withdrawn federal lands from various forms of entry and disposition, subject to valid existing rights. The question has arisen whether a President could lawfully revoke or modify these proclamations. While Presidents generally have authority to revoke or modify their own executive orders and proclamations, the authority to revoke national monument proclamations is more limited due to a specific statute. No President has attempted to abolish a national monument by proclamation, and there is no definitive judicial interpretation on whether such action would be authorized under the Antiquities Act. Analyses have shown that a presidential proclamation of a national monument under the Antiquities Act can only be undone by Congress. In 1938, President Franklin Roosevelt considered abolishing the Castle-Pinckney National Monument in South Carolina, but the Attorney General at the time, Homer Cummings, determined that the President did not have the authority to do so. This was based on the fact that the statute does not explicitly grant the President the power to abolish national monuments. President Roosevelt did not attempt to abolish the monument. Some analysts argue that the President may not have the authority to abolish a national monument proclamation under the Antiquities Act, as Congress later abolished the Castle-Pinckney National Monument. The debate over the President's authority to undo national monuments remains unresolved due to the Act's silence on the matter. The debate over abolishing national monuments remains unresolved. Presidents have expanded or reduced monuments over time, citing the Antiquities Act as authority. For example, Bandelier National Monument was established by President Woodrow Wilson and later expanded by Presidents Hoover, Eisenhower, and Kennedy. Kennedy added acres to the monument, stating it was in the public interest due to its scenic and geological features. The Antiquities Act allows for the addition of new acres to national monuments, similar to creating monuments initially. However, reducing the size of national monuments may raise unique issues as the Act does not explicitly address changes in monument size. For example, Bandelier National Monument had approximately 3,925 acres excluded from the detached Otowi section due to limited archaeological values that were fully researched and not essential to the interpretive story. The Antiquities Act allows for the addition of new acres to national monuments, but reducing their size may raise unique issues as the Act does not explicitly address changes in monument size. The provision governing monument size states that reservations of land for monuments should be confined to the smallest area compatible with proper care and management of the objects to be protected. While some argue against presidential modification of national monuments to diminish their size, the 1938 Attorney General opinion allows for reduction of monument size in accordance with the \"smallest area\" language. Despite potential ambiguity in the Antiquities Act, there is precedent for Presidents to reduce the size of national monuments by proclamation. This is based on the determination that the areas to be excluded represent the President's judgment as to \"the smallest area compatible with the proper care and management of the objects to be protected.\" It is uncertain if removing a significant portion of a monument's acreage could effectively abolish the monument. National monuments could also be modified in other ways, such as transferring management between agencies or allowing for new land uses. The authority to modify national monument restrictions through proclamations has been a matter of debate, with some arguing that greatly reducing restrictions or expanding uses could effectively abolish the monument. President Roosevelt modified restrictions on the Katmai National Monument in 1936, and the issue of monument management modifications has become more prominent over time as proclamations have become more detailed and specific. Obama's 2016 proclamation for the Northeast Canyons and Seamounts Marine National Monument includes management provisions and regulated activities. Deviating from these provisions may face legal opposition. Management details not in the proclamation can be addressed in a management plan. Presidential authority to modify national monuments cannot be delegated to other officials, as per the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976. The Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (FLPMA) prohibits the Secretary of the Interior from modifying or revoking national monuments created under the Antiquities Act. This provision ensures that Congress retains the authority to make changes to these monuments. The Antiquities Act grants the President the power to establish national monuments, while FLPMA focuses on the Secretary of the Interior's actions. The committee report language suggests that controlling revocations by the Secretary may control the actions of the President regarding national monument withdrawals. Congress can establish national monuments on federal land through its authority under the Property Clause of the U.S. Constitution. Congress has the authority to modify or abolish national monuments, including redesignating them as national historic sites or parks. They can also revoke monument proclamations, transfer lands to states, and adjust acreage. Funding restrictions can influence monument implementation. Congress has the authority to modify or abolish national monuments, including redesignating them as national historic sites or parks. Funding restrictions can influence monument implementation, such as limiting funding for specific monuments like Jackson Hole National Monument. Congress has also considered legislation to amend the Antiquities Act, including proposals to restrict the designation of national monuments in certain states without express authorization. Proposed modifications to the Antiquities Act include imposing new procedural requirements, raising the standard for protected areas, creating sunset provisions for national monument proclamations, imposing size limitations, and narrowing the scope of \"objects of historic or scientific interest.\" For more information on legislative activity related to national monuments, refer to CRS Report R41330, National Monuments and the Antiquities Act."
