The Intercity Passenger Rail Trust Fund is created in the Treasury of the United States to finance expenses of the National Railroad Passenger Corporation and eligible States. Amounts in the Trust Fund are available for qualified expenses through appropriation Acts. The Intercity Passenger Rail Trust Fund is created to finance qualified expenses for eligible States. The available amounts for fiscal years are as follows: 1996 - $131,000,000, 1997 - $663,000,000, 1998 - $667,000,000, 1999 - $670,000,000, 2000 - $672,000,000. Each eligible State receives an amount based on their qualified expenses for the fiscal year. The Intercity Passenger Rail Trust Fund allocates a portion of funds to eligible States based on their qualified expenses for the fiscal year. The amount is determined by calculating 1/12 of 1 percent of the lesser of the aggregate amounts transferred and credited to the fund or appropriated from the fund, multiplied by the number of months the State was eligible in the previous fiscal year. If the calculated amount exceeds the initial amount, the higher amount is used for that fiscal year. The Intercity Passenger Rail Trust Fund increases the amount for the following fiscal year by any excess amount from the previous year. Qualified expenses refer to expenses for capital improvements in intercity passenger rail service certified by the Secretary of Transportation. The term 'eligible State' refers to any State without intercity passenger rail service from the National Railroad Passenger Corporation. The Secretary will determine the amount in the Intercity Passenger Rail Trust Fund by October 1, 2000, to cover outstanding qualified expenses, transferring any excess to the Mass Transit Account. The Secretary is also mandated to transfer funds from the Highway Trust Fund for intercity passenger rail purposes. The Secretary will transfer the intercity passenger rail portion of taxes imposed after December 31, 1995, and before October 1, 2000, from the Highway Trust Fund to the Intercity Passenger Rail Trust Fund. The intercity passenger rail portion is determined at a rate of 0.5 cent per gallon for taxes imposed under sections 4041 and 4081. The Mass Transit Account outlays for the fiscal year are reduced by the available funds in the account, as estimated by the Secretary. Section 9503(e)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to include transfers to the Mass Transit Account.
