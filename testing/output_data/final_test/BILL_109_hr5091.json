Hyde Scholarships for Haiti Act of 2006\" establishes an undergraduate scholarship program to bring talented students from Haiti to the US for higher education, aiming to improve educational opportunities, assist Haiti's development, build a well-educated middle-class, and promote positive US-Haiti relationships.

The literacy rate was below 52% for individuals over 15 years old, and the net primary school enrollment rate was 68%. Women in Haiti are disproportionately affected by these challenges. Women in Haiti are disproportionately affected by dire economic and social conditions. Women in Haiti are disproportionately affected by dire economic and social conditions.
