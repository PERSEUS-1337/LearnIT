    "content": "In FY2013, 362 million travelers entered the United States, with 205,000 aliens denied admission and 24,000 persons arrested at ports of entry. U.S. Customs and Border Protection's Office of Field Operations oversees immigration inspections at 329 POEs, with 21,464 CBP officers conducting inspections. Foreign nationals visiting the U.S. are subject to screening before arrival at a POE. The U.S. Customs and Border Protection's primary immigration enforcement mission at ports of entry is to confirm travelers' eligibility to enter the United States and exclude inadmissible aliens. Balancing strict enforcement with facilitating the flow of lawful travelers is a challenge that varies across different regions and modes of travel. This dual mission is crucial in response to evolving threats and legal immigration flows. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is responsible for implementing an electronic entry-exit system at ports of entry (POEs) to manage the U.S. immigration system. Despite Congress' requirement since 1996, a fully automated, biometric system has been challenging to achieve. The report reviews the legislative history of immigration inspections requirements and the entry-exit system, detailing provisions such as pre-travel screening, trusted traveler programs, and outbound enforcement. Congress faces issues related to immigration admissions and enforcement at POEs. The Supreme Court has long held that Congress has absolute authority to control immigration by establishing rules for admission, exclusion, and deportation of non-citizens. Early federal laws authorized the President to arrest and deport aliens deemed dangerous. Laws starting in 1875 excluded various classes of aliens, including criminals, prostitutes, and those from certain countries. The core policy goal of U.S. immigration law is to prevent the entry of aliens who threaten U.S. interests, including criminals, prostitutes, anarchists, communists, and aliens engaged in espionage. Enforcement priorities have focused on unauthorized immigration, transnational crime, and preventing unlawful entries at Ports of Entry (POEs). The unauthorized population in the U.S. has increased significantly since 1980, with a significant number entering lawfully through POEs and overstaying their visas. The primary goal of U.S. immigration law is to prevent the entry of aliens who threaten U.S. interests, including criminals, terrorists, and immigration violators. CBP officers at Ports of Entry (POEs) are the first line of defense against illegal flows, such as drug trafficking and terrorism. The 9/11 attacks highlighted the importance of constraining terrorist travel to prevent attacks within the United States. However, there is no consensus on how to prioritize enforcement targets due to the unknown likelihood of each type of illegal entry. The unknown likelihood of various illegal entry threats makes it challenging to prioritize enforcement targets. Enforcement must balance security concerns with facilitating legal flows to support the U.S. economy, particularly in international tourism. Smooth processing at Ports of Entry is crucial for both security and economic reasons. Smooth processing at Ports of Entry is crucial for security and economic reasons. Immigration agents at POEs play a diplomatic role by defining visitors' first impressions of America. Balancing enforcement and travel facilitation is a challenge as efforts to identify unlawful travelers can impede the flow of legitimate admissions. Congress and DHS must decide how to prioritize threats and balance enforcement with legitimate travel facilitation. CBP's response to balancing enforcement and travel facilitation emphasizes \"risk management,\" which involves screening travelers to distinguish between low- and high-risk individuals. Low-risk travelers may qualify for expedited processing, while higher-risk travelers may face more extensive inspections. Unauthorized migrants at Ports of Entry may be subject to expedited removal. Unauthorized migrants at Ports of Entry may be subject to expedited removal and other immigration enforcement procedures outlined in 8 C.F.R. Section 235, derived from the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952. Entry requirements for both aliens and citizens are specified under various sections of the Act, with immigration officers authorized to interrogate and arrest individuals believed to be aliens attempting to enter the United States. Prior to 2002, the Attorney General was responsible for controlling U.S. borders and enforcing immigration laws. After the Homeland Security Act of 2002, these responsibilities were transferred to DHS. The INA authorizes the consular processing system for visa issuance, giving State Department consular officers sole authority to issue visas to aliens. DHS is charged with issuing regulations on visa issuances and advising consular officers, while the State Department remains in charge of actual visa issuance. U.S. citizens and citizens of Canada and Bermuda entering the U.S. by land or sea are historically exempt from certain entry requirements. Following the 9/11 attacks, the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 directed DHS to develop the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative, requiring adult travelers entering the US from the hemisphere to present a passport or secure document. The 1996 IIRIRA required the development of an automated entry and exit control system to track alien arrivals and departures, identify visa overstayers, and report to Congress annually. Congress has amended the system's requirements over the years, including adding biometric technology and interoperability with other databases. Despite ongoing attention from Congress, the entry-exit system remains incompletely implemented. In response to national security concerns post-9/11, Congress directed the use of technologies to facilitate lawful cross-border movement without compromising safety. Congressional findings emphasized the priority of expediting travel for known travelers across U.S. borders. The United States prioritizes border security to focus on preventing terrorists from entering the country. DHS is directed to develop a registered traveler program and increase preinspection stations to facilitate the travel of admissible aliens. Travelers must go through an immigration inspection process before entering the U.S. Foreign nationals seeking to enter the United States must obtain a visa or use the Visa Waiver Program. All travelers undergo inspection by a CBP officer, with some selected for additional screening. Trusted traveler program participants can receive expedited processing. Pre-travel screening is required for most foreign nationals, except for certain exceptions like U.S. LPRs and certain Canadian citizens. Foreign nationals seeking entry to the United States must apply for a nonimmigrant visa at a U.S. consulate abroad or through the Visa Waiver Program. Air passengers undergo screening before U.S.-bound flights. Visa applicants must provide biographic and biometric data, attend an interview, and may undergo examinations to ensure eligibility for entry. The Department of State uses the Consular Consolidated Database (CCD) to screen visa applicants for various inadmissibility reasons, including health, criminal history, security concerns, and more. The CCD contains over 100 million visa and passport records and links to other databases like the Consular Lookout and Support System (CLASS) for security watchlist checks. The Arrival and Departure Information System (ADIS) and the Automated Biometric Identification System (IDENT) are used by CBP officers to screen travelers at POEs. Consular officers refer high-risk cases to DHS and other law enforcement agencies for Security Advisory Opinions (SAOs). Some consulates also utilize the DHS Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Visa Security Program (VSP) to examine visa applications for fraud and coordinate with local law enforcement partners. The Visa Waiver Program (VWP) allows nationals from certain countries to enter the United States without a visa, aiming to facilitate travel and tourism while reducing consular costs. However, concerns have been raised about security risks due to the lack of biometric data requirements and visa overstays. The Visa Waiver Program (VWP) allows nationals from certain countries to enter the United States without a visa. Aliens under the VWP must submit biographic information through ESTA and provide biometric data at the port of entry. The program enhances security by screening applicants and partner countries for document security. CBP conducts pre-travel screening for all air travelers to the U.S. Upon purchasing an airline ticket, commercial airlines must provide Passenger Name Record (PNR) data to CBP 72 hours before travel. Passenger and crew manifests are transmitted to CBP before international flights depart. Biographic traveler data is submitted to the Advance Passenger Information System (APIS) for vetting against intelligence databases at CBP's National Targeting Center (NTC) to identify risky travelers. The National Targeting Center (NTC) uses ATS to identify risky travelers and issue no-board recommendations to air carriers. In FY2011, 3,181 recommendations were issued, followed by 4,199 in FY2012 and 5,378 in FY2013. The Immigration Advisory Program (IAP) and Joint Security Program (JSP) work to identify high-risk travelers and recommend actions to air carriers and law enforcement agencies. The Joint Security Program (JSP) was launched by CBP in 2009 and operates in Mexico City and Panama City. It issues no-board recommendations to travelers on international flights not bound to or from the United States. The IAP and JSP issued a total of 19,998 no-board recommendations since 2004. CBP officers at ports of entry conduct interviews and background checks on arriving travelers using the TECS system. Since 2010, CBP has intensified primary inspection activities at land POEs, inspecting documents for 100% of travelers and conducting law enforcement database queries on 97% of land travelers in FY2013. Southern border protocols focus on threats from drug trafficking organizations and unauthorized immigrants. Travelers are validated against visa records and the APIS database. Travelers arriving at air and sea ports must provide biometric data for vetting against databases. Admissible travelers enter the US, while those suspected of inadmissibility undergo secondary inspection. Some travelers from select airports can be pre-cleared by CBP officers abroad. CBP officers based abroad conduct preclearance inspections at partner airports, including document and secondary inspections. They do not have law enforcement authority but can refer individuals suspected of criminal violations to local authorities. Travelers can directly enter the U.S. after preclearance, similar to domestic flights. Preclearance facilities are established at the request of host governments, who are responsible for providing secure facilities. CBP covers officer salaries and certain overseas expenses for these programs. In April 2013, DHS agreed with the UAE to establish a preclearance facility at Abu Dhabi International Airport. Some Members of Congress have concerns about the program giving UAE-owned Etihad Airlines a competitive advantage and UAE not being a signatory to the United Nations Refugee. House appropriators included language in the House's FY2014 DHS Appropriations report to limit funding for preclearance operations in new locations unless an economic impact analysis of the new location on U.S. air carriers has been conducted and provided to the committee. Certain classes of nonimmigrants visiting the United States are issued an I-94 arrival/departure record upon admission, which includes important information such as the date of admission, visa category, and expiration date. However, the system of tracking nonimmigrant exits and visa overstays using paper I-94 records has proven difficult to implement. In 2013, CBP discontinued issuing paper I-94 forms for travelers arriving at air and sea ports. CBP now uses the APIS system and information collected by the State Department and CBP officers to create electronic arrival/departure records. CBP relies on carrier exit manifests for exiting air and sea travelers. Travelers triggering alarms in the ATS or arousing suspicion may be referred for secondary inspection. Travelers at certain POEs are randomly selected for secondary inspection, especially those required to obtain I-94 arrival/departure records. This involves a more extensive interview, physical search, and vetting against additional databases. At land POEs, selected travelers must provide fingerprints for vetting against biometric databases. Primary and secondary inspections at air and sea POEs slightly decreased in FY2008. Overall, inspections at air POEs increased by 19% from FY2005 to FY2013, while inspections at land ports fell sharply during FY2005-FY2011 before recovering slightly. Land inspections in FY2013 were down 31% from FY2005. The total number of inspections fell from 420 million in FY2005 to 340 million in FY2011 before climbing back to 362 million in FY2013. The proportion of all primary inspections at land POEs fell from about 75% in FY2005 to about 67% in FY2013. Additionally, an increasing share of travelers underwent secondary inspections during FY2005-FY2013. The proportion of travelers undergoing secondary inspection increased at air, sea, and land ports from FY2005 to FY2013. The highest increase was seen at air POEs, where it peaked at 6.4% in FY2010 before dropping to 5.2% in FY2013. Sea POEs saw an increase from 0.49% in FY2007 to 1.3% in FY2010, then down to 0.7% in FY2013. Land POEs had an increase from 11.9% in FY2005 to around 14% in FY2010-FY2012, then decreased to 12.3% in FY2013. The rise in land port secondary inspections was due to a decrease in total travelers, not an increase in inspections. The approval rate for travelers inspected at POEs remained steady at 99.94% to 99.95% from FY2005 to FY2013. Travelers must prove their eligibility for admission, with denial resulting in potential sanctions. An alien applying for admission can withdraw their application and leave the US without facing additional penalties. However, the withdrawal will be noted in their file and could impact future visa eligibility. If deemed inadmissible at a Port of Entry, the alien may face removal proceedings under INA \u00a7240, initiated by a CBP officer serving a notice to appear. Removal may result in ineligibility for a visa. An alien who is formally removed from the United States is generally ineligible for a visa for at least five years and may face criminal charges if they illegally reenter. Expedited removal allows for immediate removal by a CBP officer without appearing before an immigration judge. CBP can arrest individuals at POEs based on various reasons, including criminal warrants or suspected immigration-related crimes. Table 2 shows fluctuating trends in immigration enforcement outcomes at ports of entry from FY2005-FY2013, including the number of aliens denied admission, issued notices to appear, and arrested on criminal charges. There are no clear sustained trends in these categories, with numbers varying over the years. The number of aliens permitted to withdraw their applications for admission has decreased from about 96,000 in FY2005 to about 52,000 in FY2013. This reduction is partly due to a 2008 directive allowing officers to use discretion in cases of minor documentary deficiencies. Additionally, the number of aliens placed in expedited removal dropped by about one-third between FY2005 and FY2009, remaining relatively stable since then. The data in Table 2 does not show a significant shift towards \"high consequence\" enforcement outcomes at ports of entry. The Border Patrol has implemented CBP's Consequence Delivery System more systematically between ports of entry. CBP's Random Compliance Examination (COMPEX) program was established in 1999 to assess passenger inspections and expanded to include immigration and agricultural inspections after the creation of DHS. The COMPEX program selects a random sample of vehicles and air passengers for detailed secondary examination to estimate undetected violations. In FY2012, it was operational at 19 commercial airports and 105 land POEs, conducting over 640,000 random secondary inspections. Overall, a small percentage of travelers in the sample committed major violations, making it a powerful tool for estimating illegal flows and CBP's effectiveness at POEs. Developing accurate estimates of illegal flows and enforcement effectiveness between POEs is challenging due to uncertainty about unobserved inflows. Detailed secondary inspections at POEs can provide an accurate count of violations within a sample group. However, the COMPEX program, which covers air passengers and personal vehicles at land POEs, has limitations as it does not include sea passengers, pedestrians at land POEs, or most cargo operations. Biometric data collection during COMPEX secondary inspections is not systematic, affecting the program's ability to detect certain types of illegal migration. The COMPEX program, designed to detect illegal migration at POEs, has limitations in detecting certain types of illegal inflows and measuring violations within specific subcategories. Sampling bias may be introduced at airports due to manual case selection by port managers and senior officers. The COMPEX program has limitations due to manual case selection by port managers and senior officers, leading to sample bias. Inspections may be suspended at certain ports to speed up processing times, making it difficult to draw reliable inferences about total illegal inflows through POEs. Information about the program is not widely available, hindering evaluation and potential reforms. CBP manages trusted traveler programs under \u00a77209(k) of the IRTPA, allowing low-risk travelers expedited admission at POEs. Global Entry is the main program open to various nationalities, including U.S. citizens, LPRs, Dutch citizens, South Korean citizens, and Mexican nationals. Canadian nationals can also benefit by joining NEXUS. Applicants must meet nationality requirements and have no criminal history or immigration violations. Global Entry applicants must meet specific criteria and undergo biometric data collection and in-person interviews. They are checked against security databases and can access expedited processing at designated ports of entry. Global Entry and NEXUS are trusted traveler programs that allow members to use automated kiosks for expedited processing at airports. NEXUS members also receive a secure RFID photo ID card for expedited processing. The SENTRI program is a trusted traveler program similar to NEXUS, offering expedited processing at U.S.-Mexico border crossings. SENTRI members receive a WHTI-compliant RFID card for use at 11 land POEs, but must register their vehicles with the program and adhere to stricter application requirements. Unlike NEXUS, SENTRI is not jointly managed by the United States and Mexico. Table 3 shows significant growth in trusted traveler program membership from FY2009 to FY2013, with NEXUS and SENTRI increasing five-fold and seven-fold, respectively, and Global Entry growing by a factor of 45. By FY2013, Global Entry and NEXUS each had over 900,000 members, while SENTRI had almost 360,000. Table 4 illustrates the rise in travelers admitted through NEXUS and SENTRI lanes and Global Entry kiosks from FY2010 to FY2013, with Global Entry flows increasing seven-fold during this period. The Outbound Programs Division within the Office of Field Operations manages outbound enforcement at certain land ports on the Southern border. The division focuses on addressing violence in Mexico and the drug trade by intercepting illegal currency, arms, and ammunition outflows. Approximately 700 CBP officers participate in the outbound enforcement program, with annual seizures including 5,100 kilograms of illegal drugs, $221 million worth of illegal currency exports, and 8,210 illegal weapons from FY2009 to FY2013. The United States has seen an increase in seizure incidents of illegal drugs, currency, and ammunition since FY2009. However, the average seizure size fell sharply in FY2013. Some experts believe the US is becoming a transshipment country for illegal drugs. There is a debate on whether the drop in illegal drug volume and seizures reflect changes in tactics by drug trafficking organizations or are statistical anomalies. Some suggest focusing on outbound enforcement to disrupt transnational criminal operations. Preventing U.S.-Mexico money flows could disrupt criminal operations by reducing drug flows and firepower. Outbound enforcement faces challenges in enforcing laws on currency transfers, diverting resources from inbound inspections, and lacking inspection infrastructure. Limited outbound lanes lead to long waits for travelers, prompting short-term enforcement surges followed by reduced inspections. Some analysts argue that criminal organizations can evade enforcement surges by monitoring outbound lanes and suspending high value outflows. The INS previously collected entry-exit data manually before implementing an automatic biometric system required by Section 110 IIRIRA. The INS initiated a pilot program in 1997 to automate I-94 data collection with magnetic stripe cards from airlines. The system faced challenges with airlines' participation, unreliable collection of departure cards, and lack of coverage for land travelers. The US-VISIT program was established in 2004 within DHS to manage the entry-exit system, later renamed OBIM in 2013. CBP collaborates with OBIM to collect and manage entry-exit data. CBP collaborates with OBIM to collect and manage entry-exit data stored in two DHS databases: ADIS and IDENT. ADIS includes biographic traveler information and arrival/departure details, with a FINS identifier for cross-referencing with IDENT. ADIS is a biographic database populated by reading identity documents. As of September 30, 2013, ADIS contained over 280 million records. IDENT is a biometric database with biographic and biometric data of travelers, including fingerprints and photographs. It also includes information on immigration enforcement histories. As of September 30, 2013, IDENT had over 160 million unique records. Initially designed for tracking foreign visitors, it now uses fingerprint scanners and digital cameras for data collection. After the integration of IDENT and IAFIS databases in 1999, IDENT was reconfigured as a ten-print system. By 2010, all CBP and Border Patrol locations had fully integrated IDENT/IAFIS workstations. The entry-exit system became a national security tool post-9/11, with the USA PATRIOT Act requiring background checks and identity verification during visa processes. As of September 30, 2013, the IDENT security watchlist included 7.2 million people. As of September 30, 2013, the IDENT security watchlist included 7.2 million people. Entry data collection has been enhanced post-9/11 to combat document and identity fraud by requiring machine-readable passports for entry to the United States. Since 2004, US-VISIT deployed biometric workstations at ports of entry to collect biometric data from non-U.S. citizens entering the United States, with exceptions for certain individuals. This rule requires almost all arriving non-citizens at air and seaports to provide biometric data. Since 2004, US-VISIT deployed biometric workstations at ports of entry to collect biometric data from non-U.S. citizens entering the United States. Arriving passengers at air and seaports are required to provide biometric data during primary inspection, while at land ports, biometric data is provided in secondary inspection. The United States does not have a history of collecting exit data from departing travelers, leading to challenges in implementing exit data collection as required by law. Since 2004, DHS has tested six exit data pilot programs. Four programs were discontinued, but two involving biographic information sharing with air carriers and Canada are ongoing. US-VISIT tested biometric exit technologies at airports and seaports between 2004 and 2007, successfully capturing biometric and biographic information. The GAO concluded in 2007 that the Increment 1B air and sea pilot for biometric and biographic data collection was not managed well. They recommended that DHS discontinue the program due to concerns about planning, oversight, and low traveler compliance with exit procedures. DHS suggested integrating biometric data collection into normal departure flow to improve compliance, especially at land POEs. Between August 2005 and November 2006, DHS conducted a land exit proof-of-concept project at five ports of entry to test RFID technology for tracking departures. RFID tags were added to 200,000 I-94 forms, but data collection was unreliable with low success rates. GAO concluded that RFID is not suitable for exit data collection. The RFID technology used for exit data collection in a demonstration project was deemed inappropriate. US-VISIT, CBP, and TSA collaborated on biometric air exit pilot programs at Detroit and Atlanta airports. CBP officers collected biometric data from selected international flights' passengers at departure gates, while TSA officers screened travelers at Atlanta airport to identify those subject to US-VISIT requirements. During the biometric air exit pilot program, CBP and TSA officers collected data from departing travelers, with only one refusal. Data collection was quick and produced quality results for enrollment in IDENT. However, challenges included extensive interaction to identify US-VISIT subjects, staffing limitations, flight delays, and early boarding by pilots and crew. The DHS faced challenges with the biometric air exit system, including early boarding by pilots and crew, impact on U.S. citizens, and high costs. They decided to focus on biographic data collection and research on biometric technology for future use. The DHS initiated a pilot program in December 2009 to collect biometric data from exiting temporary workers. The program used kiosks at specific ports of entry and aimed to inform future land exit program planning. Additionally, air and sea carriers are required to provide electronic passenger manifests to CBP under the APIS program. The DHS collects biometric data from exiting temporary workers through a pilot program. Air and sea carriers must provide electronic passenger manifests to CBP under the APIS program. CBP vets passenger manifests against terrorist watchlist data and adds arrival and departure information to the ADIS database. The APIS program is effective in identifying visa overstays, but it lacks mechanisms for biometric authentication and ensuring passengers who check-in actually board flights. The Beyond the Border agreement, signed by President Obama and Canadian Prime Minister Harper, aims to develop an integrated entry-exit system for the US and Canada. The first phase of the program ran from September 2012 to January 2013, focusing on exchanging biographic records for third country nationals and permanent residents. The U.S.-Canada integrated entry-exit system pilot program in 2013 exchanged biographic records for third country nationals and permanent residents at designated POEs. Canada reconciled 94.5% of U.S. entries, and the U.S. reconciled 97.4% of Canadian entries. Phase 2 expanded data collection to all automated POEs on the border, seen as a promising approach by DHS. Information sharing is limited to biographic data, relying on the organizational capacity of CBSA and trust between agencies. The U.S.-Canada integrated entry-exit system pilot program in 2013 exchanged biographic records for third country nationals and permanent residents at designated POEs. Canada reconciled 94.5% of U.S. entries, and the U.S. reconciled 97.4% of Canadian entries. Phase 2 expanded data collection to all automated POEs on the border, seen as a promising approach by DHS. Information sharing is limited to biographic data, relying on the organizational capacity of CBSA and trust between agencies. Border Services Agency (CBSA) and U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) collaborate closely. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement's (ICE's) Overstay Analysis Unit identifies potential visa overstayers by matching arrival and departure records. ICE's Counterterrorism and Criminal Exploitation Unit (CTCEU) investigates certain overstay leads. DHS's enhanced biographic exit program reviewed 1.6 million potential overstay records in 2011, identifying 839,000 records for further investigation, with 1,901 prioritized as possible national security or public safety risks. The GAO found that 1,013 individuals had left the US or adjusted their migration status, 9 were arrested, and 481 were still under ICE enforcement efforts. Around 1.2 million ADIS arrival records couldn't be matched to departure data, raising concerns about DHS's overstay data quality. DHS hasn't provided required reports on visa overstays since 1994, but promised to do so in 2013. Concerns about health screening for arrivals in the US have increased due to Ebola cases in West Africa. Foreign nationals wishing to enter the United States must meet criteria specified in the Immigration and Nationality Act and not be deemed inadmissible, including on health-related grounds. An outbreak of an infectious disease poses challenges for CBP and CDC in monitoring travelers for health risks and containing potential spread of diseases. The CDC is responsible for protecting against communicable diseases at ports of entry, but they are not present daily. Quarantine stations are located at some international airports and land ports, but they are a small fraction of all ports. CDC trains CBP inspectors to watch for ill travelers instead of staffing all ports. The Inspector's Field Manual states that CBP officers are responsible for observing travelers for signs of quarantinable diseases, such as fever, jaundice, respiratory problems, bleeding, weakness, or paralysis. CBP officers are not qualified to physically examine or diagnose illnesses. CDC officials are stationed at the border during immigration emergencies to ensure public health. In response to the Ebola outbreak in West Africa, new screening procedures have been established at five airports for travelers originating from Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. Passengers are escorted to a separate area for additional screening, including filling out a questionnaire and temperature checks. CDC staff is present to assist with the screening, and travelers without symptoms are monitored for 21 days by state and local health departments. Travelers from West Africa are provided with a kit containing Ebola tracking tools and symptoms information. Those with symptoms will be isolated. Congressional concerns persist about the entry-exit system, with limitations on biometric data collection and overstay analysis by DHS. Progress has been made on real-time overstay analysis, but estimated overstay rates have not been published as expected in 2013. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has limited ability to track and remove visa overstayers. Exit data collection is a concern, especially at southern border land ports. Biographic data sharing with Canada and carriers is used for exit tracking, with DHS relying on biographic information for immigration screening. DHS believes biographic data meets exit tracking needs at an acceptable cost, while also recognizing the importance of biometric information. The DHS believes biographic data sharing with Canada and carriers is sufficient for exit tracking, but questions remain about the priority of biometric data collection. Members of Congress are debating whether an upgrade to machine-readable biographic data would be an improvement and if DHS should collect exit data directly. Concerns also exist about implementing a similar information-sharing model on the U.S.-Mexico border and the infrastructure and personnel needed for effective exit tracking. The 114th Congress is considering legislation (H.R. 399) that would require the implementation of a biometric exit data system by the Secretary of Homeland Security. The bill includes a pilot program to test the system before full implementation within five years. Discussions on immigration control and border security also address unauthorized entry through ports of entry. Unauthorized immigrants can enter through ports of entry using fraudulent documents or by evading inspection. A 2006 study estimated that 40-50% of unauthorized immigrants were visa overstayers. Interviews in 2009 found that one out of four illegal entrants from Mexico entered through a port. One out of four illegal entrants from Mexico entered through a port, either hidden in a vehicle or using fraudulent documents. DHS has not published estimates on visa overstayers or illegal immigration through ports of entry. The COMPEX program is not designed to estimate illegal flows through ports, but could be modified if Congress prioritizes it. Recent border security bills in the 113th Congress have focused on enforcement between ports of entry, with some legislation targeting Border Patrol sectors. While some bills like S. 744 aim for \"effective control\" between ports, others like H.R. 1417 prioritize metrics for enforcement at ports of entry. One potential strategy to enhance border security and expedite migration flows is to increase personnel and infrastructure at ports of entry. Increasing personnel and infrastructure at ports of entry is crucial for border security. A 2008 GAO report highlighted how staffing shortages and infrastructure weaknesses could allow terrorists, inadmissible travelers, and illicit goods to enter the country. DHS has been working to address these concerns, but challenges remain in developing performance metrics. The CBP Workload staffing model indicates a need for 3,811 additional officers at ports of entry in FY2014. In FY2014, CBP officers at POEs faced resource competition with Border Patrol and ICE. The Administration proposed hiring 3,477 additional officers, but Congress approved slower growth. Recent fiscal pressures hindered POE personnel increases. Congress authorized a pilot program for staffing augmentation. In FY2014, CBP faced resource competition with Border Patrol and ICE. Congress approved slower personnel growth with reduced funding. A pilot program was authorized for CBP to enter public-private partnerships and accept donations to expand port operations. Trusted traveler programs are used for risk management at POEs. Trusted traveler programs like NEXUS and SENTRI aim to expedite processing for low-risk travelers, allowing CBP officers to focus on higher-risk individuals. Legislation in the 113th Congress sought to promote membership in these programs, but challenges include the risk of mala fide actors exploiting reduced inspections for trusted travelers. Trusted traveler programs like NEXUS and SENTRI aim to expedite processing for low-risk travelers, allowing CBP officers to focus on higher-risk individuals. Legislation in the 113th Congress sought to promote membership in these programs, but challenges include the risk of mala fide actors exploiting reduced inspections for trusted travelers. Congress has enacted legislation concerning an entry-exit system, requiring the development of an automated control system to collect records of alien arrivals and departures. CBP faces limitations in adding dedicated lanes at land POEs due to urban space constraints, but uses active lane management systems to adjust lane assignments based on real-time demand. The entry-exit control system collects records of alien arrivals and departures to identify visa overstayers. Legislation amended the system's details and extended deadlines for implementation. The Visa Waiver Permanent Program Act imposed new documentary requirements on travelers to the United States and set deadlines for implementing the entry-exit system at airports, seaports, and land ports of entry. It also authorized the Attorney General to share system data with law enforcement officials for enforcement purposes. The USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 focused on implementing an entry-exit system with biometric technology and tamper-resistant documents to identify national security threats. The EBSVERA Act of 2001 required the development of technology standards to verify identities for U.S. visa applicants and individuals seeking admission at ports of entry. The EBSVERA Act of 2001 mandated the use of technology standards for identity verification at ports of entry and consular posts. The IRTPA Act of 2004 emphasized the implementation of a biometric entry-exit system and required the collection of biometric data for all individuals, with a deadline for developing an interoperable data system. The 9/11 Act of 2007 imposed a two-year deadline for developing an interoperable data system among relevant agencies within DOS, DHS, and DOJ. Section 711 amended INA \u00a7217 to require DHS to establish an exit system for air travelers in the Visa Waiver Program within one year."
