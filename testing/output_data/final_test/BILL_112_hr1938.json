    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"North American-Made Energy Security Act\". Congress declares that the United States heavily relies on oil imports, making it vulnerable to supply disruptions from unstable countries. The increasing oil consumption in developing nations leads to tight market conditions and higher prices, emphasizing the importance of oil and gas delivery from Canada to the US. The United States relies on oil imports and needs to secure oil supplies to fill projected needs. Continued development of North American energy resources, including Canadian oil, improves fuel supply certainty for the Department of Defense. The trading relationship between Canada and the United States is significant, with 90 cents returned to the US economy for every dollar spent on Canadian products, including oil. Increased Canadian oil exports to China will lead to higher US crude oil imports from other foreign sources, particularly the Middle East. This reduces the need for wealth transfers to distant foreign sources due to lower import costs. US companies heavily invest in Canadian oil sands, benefiting businesses across the country. The Keystone XL pipeline project from Hardisty, Alberta, to Steele City, Nebraska, aims to meet market demand for crude oil in US refineries and potentially bring over 100,000 barrels per day of Bakken crudes to market. The completion of this high-capacity pipeline would increase oil supply and benefit businesses throughout the country. The Keystone XL pipeline project aims to increase total pipeline capacity by 700,000 barrels per day, providing employment opportunities, government revenues, and access to Canadian oil reserves. Analysis shows no significant impact on greenhouse gas emissions. The Keystone XL pipeline project is state-of-the-art with high safety standards. Prompt approval is recommended due to national interest in early Canadian oil delivery to US markets. The Keystone XL pipeline project is recommended for prompt approval due to national interest in early Canadian oil delivery to US markets. SEC. 3 outlines an expedited approval process. The President, through the Secretary of Energy, will coordinate with Federal agencies to expedite the decision on the Keystone XL pipeline. Each agency must meet deadlines set by the Secretary of Energy. A final decision on the Presidential Permit for the pipeline must be made within 30 days of the final environmental impact statement, but no later than November 1, 2011. The decision on the Keystone XL pipeline must be made by November 1, 2011. No action by the Secretary of Energy shall affect the duty to conduct environmental review. Congress believes the US should reduce dependence on oil from hostile countries and increase access to energy resources from Canada to create jobs. The House of Representatives passed the bill on July 26, 2011. Karen L. Haas is the Clerk."
