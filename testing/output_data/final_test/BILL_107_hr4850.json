    "content": "The \"MediFair Act of 2002\" may be cited as the official title of this legislation. Key findings are outlined in the Act. The \"MediFair Act of 2002\" finds that regional inequities in Medicare reimbursement create barriers to care for seniors and the disabled, penalize cost-effective states, and result in significant cost differences per beneficiary. These inequities have led to varying Medicare programs based on location and allowed some beneficiaries access to different plans. Regional inequities in Medicare reimbursement have created unfair advantages for providers in states with higher payments, leading to disparities in benefits for beneficiaries. This can limit access to new technology and services for those in states with lower reimbursement rates, impacting overall Medicare access. Regional inequities in Medicare reimbursement, whether rural or urban, can limit access to services and impact healthy outcomes for beneficiaries. Many states with large urban centers have below-average per beneficiary costs. The Social Security Act is amended to improve fairness in payments to providers under the Medicare fee-for-service program by enhancing payment equity. The Secretary is required to establish a system for adjusting payment amounts for items and services under Medicare Parts A and B. If a state's average payment amount is below the national average, the Secretary must increase payments to ensure parity. The Secretary must ensure that payments do not cause overall expenditures to increase or decrease by reducing payments in states with higher average beneficiary amounts compared to the national average. The Secretary will not reduce payments to states with higher average beneficiary amounts compared to the national average if they have healthy outcome or quality care measurements indicating efficient use of services. The Secretary determines State and National average per beneficiary amounts each year to assess the use of payments in improving beneficiary access to quality care under the original Medicare fee-for-service program. Each year, the Secretary determines the national average per beneficiary amount based on State averages. Definitions include applicable payments and the meaning of \"State.\" Beneficiaries are held harmless by the provisions of this section. The Secretary determines the national average per beneficiary amount annually based on State averages. Beneficiaries are held harmless by the provisions of this section, ensuring entitlement to items and services without affecting liability. The Secretary, in consultation with the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, will promulgate regulations to carry out this section, with special consideration given to rural areas. MEDPAC will develop recommendations to promote healthy outcomes and quality care in states where Medicare payments are reduced. The recommendations will also focus on efficient use of Medicare payments in these states. The Commission must submit these recommendations to Congress within 9 months of the Act's enactment."
