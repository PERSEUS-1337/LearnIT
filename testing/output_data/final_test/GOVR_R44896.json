    "content": "Infrastructure refers to longer-lived, capital-intensive systems and facilities, which can be publicly or privately owned. It includes traditional public sector services like highways and water treatment facilities, as well as privately owned systems like electricity production. Infrastructure also encompasses research and development expenditures, benefiting businesses by reducing production costs, especially transportation costs. Infrastructure investments are crucial for businesses and households, reducing production costs like transportation. Governments at all levels share the costs, with the majority coming from state and local governments. The federal government contributes through direct spending, grants, loan guarantees, and tax benefits. Tracking government spending on infrastructure can be challenging due to its ambiguous definition. The Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) tracks government investment in infrastructure, which is divided into consumption expenditures and investments. Consumption expenditures involve spending on goods and services, while investment spending is on fixed assets like roads and bridges. Investment is further categorized into structures, equipment, and intellectual property. The Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) tracks government investment in infrastructure, divided into consumption expenditures and investments in structures, equipment, and intellectual property. BEA reports annual investment flow and tracks the total value of productive investments, adjusting the capital stock as projects depreciate or new funds are invested. The overall capital stock will either increase or decrease over time depending on the flow of investment funds relative to depreciation. Nondefense gross government investment in the United States has been declining since the 1960s, falling from above 4% of GDP to about 2.5% in 2016. Nondefense gross government investment in the United States has been declining since the 1960s, falling from above 4% of GDP to about 2.5% in 2016. In 2016, about 54% of federal investment was directed to national defense purposes, whereas about 46% was directed to nondefense purposes. Government investment in structures in the United States has been declining since the 1960s, dropping to about 1.5% of GDP in 2016. Direct federal investment in structures peaked in the 1930s and 1960s before gradually decreasing to about 0.7% of GDP in 2016. It has remained relatively flat at around 0.1% of GDP since 2000. Federal investment in structures peaked in the 1930s and again in the late 1940s and 1960s, reaching above 1.0% of GDP briefly. Direct federal investment has been declining, with transfers to state and local governments for capital investments exceeding direct federal spending since the mid-1950s. Transfers peaked in the 1960s at about 0.6% of GDP, declined through the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s, rose in the 2000s, and decreased to around 0.4% of GDP in recent years. Federal investment in structures peaked in the 1930s and late 1940s and 1960s, exceeding 1.0% of GDP briefly. Direct federal investment has been decreasing, with transfers to state and local governments for capital investments surpassing direct federal spending since the mid-1950s. By 2012, the federal government spent approximately $126 billion on nondefense investments, with transportation receiving the largest share at about $63 billion and energy at $14 billion. The mix of investments through direct federal spending and grants to state and local governments varies by budget function. State and local investment in structures followed a similar pattern to federal investment, peaking in 1939 at 3.3% of GDP before decreasing during and after World War II. It increased back to about 2.7% of GDP in the late 1960s, declined in the 1970s to 1.5% of GDP, and then rose between 1994 and 2009 to 2.0% of GDP. Since 2009, it has decreased to 1.4% of GDP. Despite this, the federal government transferred 0.4% of GDP to state and local governments in 2016 for capital investments. State and local governments invest more in structures than the federal government. State and local governments invested about 1.8% of GDP in 2016, with additional funds transferred from the federal government. Overall, state and local governments spent approximately 1.1% of GDP on structure investments, while the federal government contributed around 0.5% of GDP to investment in structures. The capital stock level, representing productive investments as a percentage of GDP, increased post-World War II. Federal nondefense structures declined from 7% to 4% of GDP by 2016, while state and local structures rose from 36% to 54% of GDP. This shift is attributed to the federal government moving towards grants to state and local governments. The United States lags behind many advanced economies in transportation infrastructure investment as a percentage of GDP, spending about 0.6% compared to a G7 average of 0.8% in 2014. The United States has lower infrastructure investment rates compared to other countries, but may have a higher stock of infrastructure due to past investment rates. Infrastructure is crucial for economic well-being, enabling efficient production of goods and services. The impact of additional infrastructure investments on economic output and employment varies based on factors like financing and timing. Increased public capital stock, such as new roads and bridges, boosts economic output in the short term and enhances long-term productivity. For instance, improved infrastructure can reduce commute times for truck drivers, leading to quicker deliveries and lower costs. Public infrastructure investments, such as new roads and bridges, benefit drivers by allowing quicker deliveries and lower costs. Research shows that a 1% increase in public capital stock in the United States could lead to a 0.083% increase in short-term economic output and a 0.122% increase in long-term economic output. Public infrastructure investments, like new roads and bridges, can boost economic output. A 1% increase in public capital stock could lead to a 0.122% increase in long-term economic output. The impact depends on how the investment is financed and the type of infrastructure invested in. Financing can be done by national or regional governments directly. The economic impact of government infrastructure investment depends on how it is financed, either through deficit financing or deficit-neutral financing. The type of financing used can significantly affect the short-term impact of the investment. Deficit financing for infrastructure investments can have a mixed economic impact. It can stimulate economic output in the short term through direct government spending on projects and indirectly through the multiplier effect. The total economic impact is uncertain due to conflicting forces on economic output. Government spending on infrastructure projects can lead to a larger GDP increase as funds flow from the government to contractors, employees, and suppliers. However, the impact may take longer to materialize compared to other types of government spending, as projects require time for selection and implementation. Deficit-financed investments may boost short-term economic output but could be limited in the long term due to potential crowding out effects. Government spending on infrastructure projects can lead to a larger GDP increase as funds flow from the government to contractors, employees, and suppliers. However, the long-term impact may be reduced due to the \"crowding out\" of private investment. Higher interest rates resulting from government borrowing for infrastructure investments can decrease private investment and interest-sensitive consumer spending. The CBO estimates that a $1 increase in the federal deficit decreases private investment by about 33 cents. The replacement of private investment with public investment is a concern because private investment is generally considered more productive. Deficit-financed investments may produce short-term gains in economic output but impose long-term costs by replacing private investment. Alternatively, deficit-neutral infrastructure investments are unlikely to affect economic output in the short term. Deficit-neutral public investments may not impact short-term economic output but could have positive or negative effects on long-term output depending on spending cuts or tax increases. These investments are less likely to crowd out private investment and are expected to have a larger positive impact on long-term economic output compared to deficit-financed investments. The IMF researchers found that deficit-financed public investments can increase GDP by 0.9% in the first year and 2.9% after four years. However, deficit-neutral investments show no significant impact on GDP. The CBO's analysis suggests that the long-term impact of deficit-financed federal investment spending can vary depending on the structure and size of the investment. For example, a $100 billion deficit-financed increase in public investment could increase GDP by $20 billion in the short term. In public investment of $100 billion, GDP would increase by about $20 billion in the short term and $1 billion higher after 10 years compared to baseline. Deficit-neutral investment would not increase GDP in the short term but result in GDP being $4 billion higher after 10 years. The difference in results between CBO and IMF researchers is due to varying estimates on public capital's impact on productivity and crowding out private investment. CBO assumes public capital is less effective at increasing productivity and more likely to crowd out private investment than IMF researchers. Another downside of deficit-financed investments is the potential increase in the debt-to-GDP ratio. Economists are concerned with the debt-to-GDP ratio rather than absolute debt levels. The U.S. debt-to-GDP ratio increased significantly from about 35% in 2006 to over 76% in 2016. Despite this, interest rates on the debt have remained low, indicating confidence in the country's ability to meet obligations. Concerns arise regarding deficit-financed infrastructure investments impacting the debt-to-GDP ratio, but such investments may not necessarily increase it if economic output grows more than debt. Some research suggests deficit-financed investments may not impact the debt-to-GDP ratio and could even decrease it, while others argue they may increase the ratio. The timing of public investments in the business cycle can affect the economic output, with investments during a recession expected to have a larger short-term impact due to underutilized economic inputs. During a recession, public investments can quickly boost production as unemployed workers are available and factories are under capacity. In contrast, during economic expansion, the impact may be smaller due to less excess capacity. Research shows larger output responses to public investment in recessions compared to expansions, with estimates suggesting a 1.5 times larger impact during a recession. During a recession, public investment has a larger impact on economic output compared to an expansion. A 1% increase in public investment could boost output by 3.4% during a recession and 2.3% during an expansion. However, recent IMF research suggests a smaller impact during an expansion. In the U.S., the economy has been in an expansion since June 2009, with slower growth but near full employment. This situation may argue against additional infrastructure spending to avoid potential inflation. Increased infrastructure spending could potentially lead to higher inflation or require the Federal Reserve to increase interest rates. Some economists believe the U.S. economy is facing obstacles to faster growth, and expansionary fiscal policy like infrastructure investment could help. The impact of infrastructure investment on economic output depends on its effectiveness in increasing productivity. Different types of infrastructure have varying relationships to economic output. Researchers have attempted to distinguish between \"core\" infrastructure, such as roads, railways, airports, and utilities, and other types of infrastructure like hospitals and schools. Core infrastructure has a larger impact on private-sector economic output compared to all types of infrastructure. A 1% increase in public capital stock is expected to increase private-sector economic output by 0.083% in the short term and 0.122% in the long term, with core infrastructure showing a greater impact. Increased public investment in core infrastructure is expected to boost private-sector economic output by 0.131% in the short term and 0.170% in the long term. This growth in economic output is typically accompanied by an increase in employment, following Okun's Law, which states that economic growth leads to more jobs. Increased public investment in core infrastructure is expected to boost private-sector economic output, leading to a change in employment. Faster productivity growth is also anticipated to reduce long-term unemployment rates, allowing the economy to sustainably operate at lower levels of unemployment without increasing inflation. GDP is a key measure of economic output, representing the total cost of goods and services produced in a specific time period. Another way to measure economic output is through total income received within all sectors of the economy. Both measures are expected to produce the same amount, as money paid for goods and services eventually circulates back into the economy through salaries, wages, dividends, and rental payments. Increased public investment in core infrastructure is expected to boost private-sector economic output, leading to a change in employment. Research on the employment impact of public investment varies, with estimates ranging from positive to no impact. A recent study by IMF researchers suggests that a 1 percentage point increase in public investment decreases the unemployment rate by 0.11% in the short term and 0.35% in the medium term among OECD countries. Increased public investment in core infrastructure is expected to boost private-sector economic output, leading to a change in employment. Researchers estimated that a 1% increase in public capital would increase labor demand by 1.13% in the short term, 1.07% in the medium term, and 0.08% in the long term. The impact of additional public investment on overall demand is likely to be minimal in the short term if deficit neutral, shifting jobs to construction and infrastructure-related areas. Economists estimate that deficit-financed public investment can increase employment by boosting short-term demand for labor. IMF researchers found that a 1% increase in public investment could decrease the unemployment rate by nearly 2% over four years when deficit financed, with no impact when deficit neutral. The method of financing also affects long-term employment outcomes due to differing impacts on productivity growth. Deficit-neutral investments are likely to decrease long-term unemployment more than deficit-financed investments, as they do not crowd out private investments, leading to faster productivity growth. Deficit-financed investments may also reduce unemployment, but to a lesser extent due to crowding out effects on private investment. Estimates of public investment impact on long-term unemployment are imprecise and influenced by various economic factors. During a recession, public infrastructure investments can boost employment by utilizing idle workers. However, in an economic expansion, these investments are less likely to create new jobs as there are fewer unemployed individuals. Public infrastructure investments during a recession can boost employment by utilizing idle workers. Researchers at the IMF found that increasing public investment during a recession decreased the unemployment rate by 0.5% after one year and 0.75% after four years. Despite the U.S. unemployment rate being below full employment, there is still room for employment growth as prime age adults may return to the labor force. Public infrastructure is a valuable resource for consumers and businesses. Public infrastructure investments can boost economic growth by improving efficiency for businesses and consumers. Increased infrastructure investment can lead to higher GDP over the long term. Short-term impacts on GDP depend on financing, economic conditions, and infrastructure type. Deficit-financed investments during a recession focusing on core infrastructure can result in the largest short-term gains in GDP. Infrastructure investments during a recession, particularly deficit-financed ones, can have a significant impact on short- and medium-term employment by creating jobs for architects and construction workers. However, in the long term, the employment outcomes from infrastructure investment are less pronounced."
