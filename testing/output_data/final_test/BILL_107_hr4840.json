    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Sound Science for Endangered Species Act Planning Act of 2002\". The Endangered Species Act of 1973 is amended to prioritize scientific and commercial data that is empirical, field-tested, or peer-reviewed in making determinations. Listing petitions must meet specific criteria. The Endangered Species Act of 1973 is amended to require listing petitions to provide clear and convincing evidence of species ranges, population estimates, population trends, and reasons for the petitioned action. Petitions must also include a bibliography of scientific sources. The Endangered Species Act of 1973 is amended to require listing petitions to provide clear and convincing evidence, including scientific literature, to support the petitioned action. Petitions must contain information on species ranges, population estimates, and population trends. The Endangered Species Act of 1973 is amended to require listing petitions to provide clear and convincing evidence, including scientific literature, to support the petitioned action. Petitions must contain information on species ranges, population estimates, and population trends. Additionally, regulations will be established for the use of sound science in listing determinations, including criteria for scientific and commercial data to be considered. The Secretary must use field data to determine if a species is endangered or threatened. Data collected by landowners must be acknowledged and included in the decision-making process. Additionally, sound science must be used in recovery planning, with criteria for data publication and consideration in proposed regulations. The Secretary must use field data to determine if a species is endangered or threatened. Landowners' data must be acknowledged and included in decision-making. Additional scientific and commercial data can be submitted to assist in recovery planning, with steps outlined for data acquisition. Data collected will be considered in the preparation of the recovery plan. SEC. 3. INDEPENDENT SCIENTIFIC REVIEW. The Endangered Species Act of 1973 is amended to include Independent Scientific Review Requirements for covered actions related to endangered or threatened species. This includes determining species status, removal from lists, developing recovery plans, and assessing actions that may harm their existence. The Endangered Species Act of 1973 is amended to include Independent Scientific Review Requirements for covered actions related to endangered or threatened species, such as determining species status, removal from lists, developing recovery plans, and assessing actions that may harm their existence. The proposal of any reasonable and prudent alternatives by the Secretary under section 7(b)(3) is required if there is significant disagreement or potential economic impact, and a determination that a proposed action is not likely to harm listed species or critical habitat must also consider significant disagreement. The Endangered Species Act of 1973 is amended to include Independent Scientific Review Requirements for covered actions related to endangered or threatened species. A qualified individual is defined as someone meeting the National Academy of Sciences standards for independent scientific review, excluding those with conflicts of interest. The Secretary is responsible for maintaining a list of qualified individuals and seeking nominations for independent review boards. The Endangered Species Act of 1973 is amended to include Independent Scientific Review Requirements for covered actions related to endangered or threatened species. Before any covered action becomes final, the Secretary appoints an independent review board to review and report on the scientific information and analyses. The board is composed of 5 members, 3 appointed from a list maintained by the Secretary and 2 appointed by the Secretary from qualified individuals nominated by the Governor of the State where the species is located. The Secretary appoints members to an independent review board to review scientific information for covered actions related to endangered species. If an individual declines appointment, the Secretary appoints another. The selection and activities of the board are not subject to the Federal Advisory Committee Act. Members may receive compensation not exceeding the daily equivalent of GS-14 pay. The Secretary cannot delegate appointment authority to officials below the level of the Director of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. Each independent review board appointed by the Secretary must provide their opinion on relevant scientific information within 90 days. The Secretary is required to develop a protocol for scientific review, including methodology adequacy and conclusion validity assessment. The independent review boards appointed by the Secretary must follow National Academy of Sciences guidelines for report reviews. Recommendations made by the boards regarding a covered action must be evaluated by the Secretary within 90 days. The rulemaking record for the covered action should include a summary of the board's review results and an explanation if the majority recommendation is not followed. The Endangered Species Act of 1973 is amended to include provisions for independent review boards to follow National Academy of Sciences guidelines. Recommendations must be evaluated by the Secretary within 90 days, and the board's report should be included in the rulemaking record for public review. Additionally, agencies must solicit and review relevant scientific and commercial data for biological assessments. The Endangered Species Act of 1973 is amended to extend periods from one year to 18 months for certain clauses and subparagraphs. The Endangered Species Act of 1973 is amended to extend periods to 18 months for certain clauses and subparagraphs, by changing \"one-year\" to \"18-month\" in subparagraph (C)(ii). SEC. 4. IMPROVED INTERAGENCY COOPERATION. In amending the Endangered Species Act of 1973, the Secretary must actively seek information from State agencies during consultations. Additionally, individuals seeking authorization for actions under consultation must be given the opportunity to participate before a draft biological opinion is developed. Before the development of a draft biological opinion, individuals can submit relevant information to the Secretary and the Federal agency regarding the impact of the proposed action on the species and potential alternatives to avoid violations. They can also request information on the species' status, threats, and conservation measures used to develop the biological opinion. Additionally, they have the right to receive a copy of the draft biological opinion. Individuals can submit comments on the draft biological opinion and discuss findings with the Secretary and the Federal agency. If proposed alternatives are not included in the final opinion, the Secretary must provide a reasonable justification. Comments and information submitted by those seeking authorization or funding for an action will be maintained by the Secretary and made available to the public. The Secretary will maintain comments and information submitted by individuals seeking authorization or funding for an action, which will be available to the public."
