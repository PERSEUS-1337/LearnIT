    "content": "Before the enactment of TANF, American Indians and Alaska Natives received family cash welfare under the program of Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) with benefits set by the state. Some Wisconsin tribes independently provided AFDC on their reservations. In FY1994, 1.3% of the national AFDC caseload were American Indians and Alaska Natives. Over 80 tribes ran their own work and training programs. Under TANF, Indian tribes and Alaska Native Villages in 16 states operate their own tribal family assistance programs with federal funds. Tribes running their own JOBS program receive annual appropriations for work and training activities. Additionally, Welfare-to-Work grants were awarded to tribal governments for work participation without standard TANF rules. Tribal TANF grants are available to over 330 federally recognized tribes in the US. As of September 2004, 45 grants were approved for 230 tribes and some non-reservation Indians in various states. The annual federal funding for these grants totals $134.2 million, serving an estimated 33,510 families. The number of Indian families served by state governments under regular TANF programs decreased by 50% from FY1996 to FY2000. Tribal TANF programs are operated by recognized tribes and tribal organizations, with grants based on federal AFDC payments. These programs have fewer required elements than state plans, but still follow regular TANF data collection rules. Work participation rules, time limits, and penalties are established by the HHS Secretary in collaboration with tribes. Indian tribes in Alaska must adhere to state TANF rules, a provision that the National Congress of American Indians has requested to be removed. The National Congress of American Indians has requested the removal of a provision in TANF law that defines an \"eligible Indian tribe\" in Alaska as one of 12 specified regional nonprofit corporations plus a reservation. Tribal TANF regulations allow for a higher percentage of grant funds to be used for administrative costs compared to state TANF programs. State governors must ensure equitable access to the TANF program for Indians not eligible for tribal assistance. State TANF programs are permitted to use money from the TANF loan fund to aid Indian families. The TANF law allows state programs to use TANF loan funds to aid Indian families who have moved out of a tribe's service area. Tribes are eligible for TANF loans but not for performance bonuses or cutting non-marital births. HHS allows state funds in approved tribal assistance plans to count towards state spending requirements. Tribes can reserve TANF grants for ongoing assistance and supportive services, and since 2001, can reserve unobligated funds for future assistance. The House-passed TANF reauthorization bill and the Senate Finance Committee substitute version renew tribal grants at current levels. Both bills make Indian tribal organizations eligible for marriage promotion grants and employment achievement bonuses. The Senate Committee bill authorizes $100 million annually for five years for a tribal TANF improvement fund. The American Indian Welfare Reform Act proposes federal payments to states contributing to Indian tribal assistance programs. The 1996 welfare law allows Indian tribes to receive federal funds for various assistance programs, including child care, foster care, adoption assistance, and eligibility determination for food stamps, Medicaid, and SCHIP. $96 million was allocated to tribes in FY2002, with 2% of mandatory and discretionary funds reserved for them. Tribes can also use CCDBG funds for construction with HHS approval. Additionally, the law authorizes direct federal funding for child support operations to Indian tribes and Alaska Native organizations. Funding for child support operations is provided to Indian tribes and Alaska Native organizations with approved plans. Tribes receive 90% federal funding for the first three years and 80% for later years. As of March 2004, 9 tribes received direct federal funding and handled over 21,000 cases. Most tribal TANF plans have adopted a 60-month lifetime time limit for federally funded TANF to adults. Some tribes, like the Klamath tribes and Confederated Tribes of Siletz Indians in Oregon, have a limit of 24 months within an 84-month period. Work activities in tribal plans are similar to TANF law, with some tribes adding activities like teaching cultural activities and barrier removal services. The Tanana Chiefs Conference in Alaska includes work activities such as subsistence hunting and fishing. Some tribal TANF plans serve only Indians, while others like the Red Cliff Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians and White Mountain Apache Tribe serve all families. The Sisseton-Wahpeton Sioux Tribe serves one-parent families, with 2-parent families aided by BIA's General Assistance program. Most tribal TANF plans have work participation rates below state TANF programs in FY2002. Table 1 shows TANF grants for tribal family assistance programs in FY2002. 36 of the 45 tribal grantees receive state funds for their programs, with some tribes also receiving federal funds for employment and training programs. Funding for these programs increased progressively over the years 2005-07."
