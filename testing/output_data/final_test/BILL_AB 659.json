    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The office of Inspector General for Veterans Affairs is created within the department, appointed by the Governor, and responsible for reviewing operations and financial conditions of California veterans homes and programs. The Inspector General for Veterans Affairs is responsible for reviewing the operation and financial condition of all veterans programs supported by the state, investigating employee misconduct, and conducting reviews or investigations upon request from the Governor, board members, or the secretary. Reports of findings are submitted to requesting parties. Beginning January 1, 2017, the inspector general must submit annual reports to the board and Legislature with recommendations for improving veterans programs. The reports must comply with Section 9795 of the Government Code. This requirement is in effect until January 1, 2020, unless extended by a later statute. Section 73.6 is added to the Military and Veterans Code, outlining additional responsibilities. The inspector general may receive confidential communications regarding information that warrants a review or investigation of a veterans program supported by the state. The identity of the informant will be kept confidential and disclosed only to specific authorities as deemed appropriate by the inspector general. The inspector general must establish a toll-free telephone number for reporting alleged wrongdoing in veterans programs. The number should be prominently displayed in California veterans homes, department and county veterans service offices, and issued to participants of home purchase programs. Written requests for investigations will be kept confidential and not subject to disclosure under the California Public Records Act. The inspector general must establish a toll-free telephone number for reporting alleged wrongdoing in veterans programs, with confidentiality guaranteed. The identity of the informant initiating the review shall remain confidential unless permission is granted, except when disclosed to law enforcement. The Legislature acknowledges the limitation on public access imposed by this act and justifies it under the California Constitution. Limitations on public access imposed by this act are necessary to protect the privacy of individuals reporting wrongdoing in veterans programs to the Inspector General for Veterans Affairs."
