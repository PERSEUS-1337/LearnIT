The \"STOP Act\" requires high-risk prescription drug users to be enrolled in a Medicaid Lock-in Program, limiting them to one pharmacy for medication. Exceptions include increased dosage prescriptions from the same physician or other circumstances determined by the Secretary. The State, in conjunction with the Secretary, must develop procedures to ensure high-risk prescription drug users can receive prescriptions without restrictions. Existing State programs must comply with appropriate procedures determined by the Secretary. Existing State restricted recipient programs established before the Stop Trafficking of Pills Act can be reviewed and certified by the Secretary for compliance. If not certified, necessary enhancements must be identified. Programs must include procedures for drug-related offenses.

The Secretary establishes procedures for notice, appeals, and hearings for individuals in the program.

The effective date for the policies established by the Secretary for high-risk prescription drug users will be determined. The amendments made by this section will take effect 120 days after the enactment of the Act, with an extension for State plans under title XIX of the Social Security Act that require State legislation to meet additional requirements. In the case of a State with a 2-year legislative session, each year is considered a separate regular session of the State legislature."
