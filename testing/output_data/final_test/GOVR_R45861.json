    "content": "Relations between the United States and Russia have shifted over time, with Russia being seen as the only nation posing an existential threat to the US due to its arsenal of nuclear weapons. Despite a decline in quantity since the Cold War, Russia still has thousands of nuclear weapons, with over 1,500 warheads capable of reaching US territory. The US has maintained a nuclear deterrent and signed arms control treaties to reduce the threat. The possible expiration of the INF Treaty and New START in 2021 may end mutual restraint on nuclear weapons. The 2018 National Defense Strategy highlights strategic competition with Russia and China as a major challenge to US security. Russia's aggressive behavior, including nuclear threats, poses a significant threat according to the 2018 Nuclear Posture Review. The NPR discusses Russia's nuclear doctrine changes and modernization efforts, increasing warhead delivery capacity. Congress is concerned about Russia's challenges, compliance with arms control agreements, and potential arms race. Members question the impact of U.S. and Russian nuclear modernization on strategic stability. This report provides information on Russia's nuclear doctrine, force structure, and modernization programs. It covers Russia's nuclear strategy, historical Soviet Union force structure, current long-range ICBMs, SLBMs, heavy bombers, and nonstrategic nuclear weapons. It also discusses infrastructure elements and modernization efforts to maintain and expand its nuclear capabilities. The Soviet Union valued nuclear weapons for political and military reasons, using them to demonstrate status and achieve influence internationally. They also saw nuclear weapons as crucial for winning conventional wars that escalated to nuclear conflict. Soviet views on nuclear weapons evolved during arms control talks with the US in the 1960s, leading to the concept of \"Mutually Assured Destruction\" (MAD). The agreements during the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks (SALT) codified the reality that neither side could initiate a nuclear war without facing devastating retaliation. The 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty was signed, solidifying this understanding. The Soviet Union supported nonuse of nuclear weapons during the 1960s and 1970s, gaining moral high ground in negotiations. The US and NATO maintained a \"flexible response\" policy allowing for nuclear weapons use in response to a massive conventional attack. US analysts doubted Soviet influence on warfighting plans despite their support for nonuse. The Soviet Union's nuclear weapons influenced warfighting plans, despite their conventional forces advantage. US and NATO doubted Soviet nonuse policy due to their vast arsenal of battlefield nuclear systems. Soviet military officials aimed to deter NATO's first nuclear use and maintain conventional warfare. US analysts feared a surprise Soviet attack on US territory. Some military analysts doubt Soviet capability for a disarming attack on US nuclear forces. Soviet Union likely planned for retaliatory strikes, but some scholars suggest they kept the option for a first strike. US ballistic missile accuracy improvements raised concerns in the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union's concerns about the vulnerability of their missile silos led to General Secretary Leonid Brezhnev announcing a no-first-use policy for nuclear weapons in the 1980s. This shift in doctrine aimed to keep conflicts conventional, especially in Europe, and may have been influenced by the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant accident and the leadership of Mikhail Gorbachev. After the Chernobyl accident, Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev feared the consequences of nuclear weapons. Russia has since adjusted its nuclear doctrine, rejecting the no-first-use pledge in 1993 due to weak conventional forces. Subsequent revisions to military doctrine have shown a greater reliance on nuclear weapons, allowing their use in defense of the Russian Federation's sovereignty. In 2000, Russia expanded circumstances for nuclear weapon use, including in response to attacks with weapons of mass destruction or large-scale aggression critical to national security. Questions arose about preemptive nuclear strikes in regional wars, but the 2010 military doctrine did not specifically allow for this, only reserving the right to use nuclear weapons. The 2014 Russian military doctrine allows for the use of nuclear weapons in response to attacks with weapons of mass destruction or aggression threatening the state's existence. This marks a shift from the 2000 doctrine, which permitted nuclear use in critical national security situations. Analysts attribute Russia's increased reliance on nuclear weapons in the 1990s to economic collapse and the loss of effective conventional capabilities after the Soviet Union's demise. Russia's economic collapse led to a loss of effective conventional forces, prompting a shift towards reliance on nuclear weapons. Concerns over NATO enlargement and threats from neighboring states also contributed to Russia's sense of vulnerability. Russia's growing weakness and NATO's increasing willingness to threaten Russian interests led to Russia's 2000 National Security Concept emphasizing the need for nuclear forces to deter aggression. The potential threat from NATO remained a concern for Russia in its 2010 and 2014 military strategies. The 2010 Russian military doctrine expressed concerns about NATO's global military potential and the deployment of foreign troops near Russian borders. Russia also worried about U.S. missile defense systems in Poland, Romania, and near Russian territory. Russia's possession of nonstrategic nuclear weapons and dual-capable systems, along with recent statements emphasizing their strength, suggests an increased role of nuclear weapons in Russia's military strategy. Military exercises simulating nuclear weapon use against NATO members have raised concerns that Russia may use its shorter-range nuclear weapons to coerce or intimidate neighbors before or during a conflict. Russia's possession of nonstrategic nuclear weapons and dual-capable systems, along with recent statements emphasizing their strength, suggests an increased role of nuclear weapons in Russia's military strategy. Analysts argue that Russia may adopt an \"escalate to de-escalate\" nuclear doctrine, threatening to use nuclear weapons to coerce NATO members to withdraw from the battlefield. However, Russia does not explicitly use this phrase in its military doctrine, leading to debate about the accuracy of this characterization of Russian thinking on nuclear weapons. Russia's military doctrine allows for the use of nuclear weapons in response to a nuclear attack, an attack with other weapons of mass destruction, or aggression with conventional weapons that threaten the state's existence. Any use of nuclear weapons against Russia or its allies will be considered a nuclear attack, with immediate retaliation. Putin and Russian officials have used \"nuclear messaging\" to signal Russia's willingness to protect its interests. While Putin has stated that brandishing nuclear weapons is harmful rhetoric, Russia's military doctrine allows for their use in response to a nuclear attack or aggression with conventional weapons threatening the state's existence. Putin has emphasized the use of nuclear weapons as a deterrent for peace and security, stating that Russia would only use them in response to a nuclear attack. He clarified that Russia's nuclear doctrine is based on retaliatory counter strikes, ruling out preventive strikes. The Soviet Union conducted its first nuclear test in 1949, followed by the production of nuclear devices and thermonuclear weapons. Their nuclear arsenal grew rapidly, peaking at over 40,000 warheads in 1986. The Soviet Union developed a triad of nuclear forces by the 1960s, including land-based ICBMs, SLBMs, and nuclear-equipped bombers. The Tu-95 Bear strategic bomber, with a longer range, entered service in 1956. The Soviet Union developed a triad of nuclear forces by the 1960s, including land-based ICBMs, SLBMs, and nuclear-equipped bombers. The Tu-95 Bear bomber, introduced in 1956, became a key component of the Soviet/Russian nuclear triad's air leg. The Soviet Union tested and deployed various ballistic missiles with nuclear warheads, extending their missile ranges and developing ICBMs. The undersea leg of the triad progressed with the deployment of SLBMs on different classes of nuclear-powered submarines. The Soviet Union rapidly expanded its force of land-based ICBMs from 1961 to 1971, with over 1,500 launchers and eight missile types. There were concerns that the Soviet Union might use these missiles in a first strike against the US, as they were initially based on vulnerable launch pads. The US believed that Soviet ICBMs could potentially execute a successful disarming first strike against US land-based forces. The Soviet Union expanded its land-based ICBM force rapidly from 1961 to 1971, with concerns about a potential disarming first strike against US land-based forces. The US was particularly worried about the SS-9 ICBM's high yield and accuracy, leading to concerns throughout the Cold War. The Soviet sea-based leg of the triad also saw growth in the 1960s with the deployment of SLBMs on submarines. The Soviet Union rapidly expanded its land-based ICBM force from 1961 to 1971, increasing the number of missile launchers on submarines. By the end of the 1960s, negotiations between the US and Soviet Union began to limit the numbers of long-range missile launchers, leading to the Interim Agreement on Offensive Arms in 1972. The Soviet Union continued to modernize and expand its nuclear forces in the 1970s, commissioning new strategic missile submarines, developing bomber aircraft, and deploying intermediate-range ballistic missiles. The land-based ICBM force was extensively expanded with new missile types and multiple warheads. In the 1970s, the Soviet Union expanded its nuclear forces by deploying new strategic missile submarines, developing bomber aircraft, and increasing its land-based ICBM force with missiles carrying multiple warheads. The heavy SS-18 ICBM with 10 warheads raised concerns in the U.S. defense community about vulnerability to Soviet missile capabilities. The U.S. defense community debated a \"window of vulnerability\" in the U.S.-Soviet nuclear balance due to Soviet throwweight advantage. Some believed Soviets could dominate with warheads after an initial attack, while others argued U.S. sea-based systems could survive a first strike, deterring Soviet aggression. During the 1980s, Soviet missile developments focused on achieving a second-strike capability by hardening missile silos and developing an early warning system. Concerns arose about maintaining this capability due to U.S. strategic offense and missile defense programs, including the Strategic Defense Initiative announced by President Reagan in March 1983. In March 1983, President Reagan introduced the Strategic Defense Initiative to counter ballistic missiles. The Soviet Union developed the SS-18 ICBM with multiple warheads and improved its nuclear triad with submarines, bombers, and mobile ICBMs. By the late 1980s, they had established the foundation for the Russian nuclear triad before the 1991 START treaty. The Soviet Union completed the backbone of the Russian nuclear triad in the 1990s, consisting of bombers, submarines with MIRV SLBMs, and ICBMs. They deployed a wide range of delivery vehicles for nonstrategic nuclear weapons during the Cold War, including devices small enough to fit into a suitcase-sized container, nuclear mines, artillery shells, ballistic missiles, air-delivered missiles, and gravity bombs at nearly 600 bases. The Soviet Union and Russia maintained a triad of nuclear forces with over 20,000 weapons by 1991. The number of warheads began to decline in the late 1980s due to various treaties and the retirement of older missiles. Russia's nuclear forces were affected by the fiscal crisis in the late 1990s, slowing down the deployment of new missiles and submarines. The Nunn-Lugar program helped move Soviet-era nuclear weapons back to Russian territory. Russia is modernizing its nuclear triad, with the current phase starting in 1998. The pace of modernization has been slower than during the Soviet era. During a financial crisis in the late 1990s, Russia's Strategic Rocket Forces (SRF) faced delays in modernization. The SRF, a key part of Russia's nuclear triad, consists of three missile armies and 11 divisions spread across the country. With an estimated 60,000 personnel, the SRF currently has 318 ICBMs in its force. Russia's ICBM force comprises 318 missiles with 1,165 warheads, of which 860 are deployed. Over half are MIRVed, with Russia modernizing its force by replacing Soviet-era missiles with new single and multiple warhead missiles. The modernization is expected to be completed by 2022, with the force relying on the SS-27 Mod 1 (Topol-M) and SS-27 Mod 2 (Yars) missiles. A new heavy ICBM, the Sarmat (SS-X-30), is being developed with 10 or more warheads per missile and may carry the Avangard hypersonic glide vehicle. The Russian Strategic Naval Forces consist of 10 strategic submarines of Delta, Typhoon, and Borei class, capable of carrying over 700 warheads. The Typhoon class submarine is used for testing the Bulava missile, deployed on the Borei-class submarines. The Delta and Borei-class submarines can each carry 16 SLBMs with multiple warheads. Russia's submarine fleet may carry up to 600 warheads, with most submarines being older Delta class. The Delta IV submarines carry the four-warhead SS-N-23 missile, with potential for up to 10 warheads with the Liner modification. The lead ship in the Borei class of ballistic missile submarines joined the Northern Fleet after construction delays. Russia's Borei-class missile submarines, with plans for 10 total, are being deployed in the Northern and Pacific Fleets. Currently, three submarines are in service, with five more in various stages of construction as an improved Borei-A/II version. The first of these has completed sea trials, with plans to finish all 10 submarines by 2027. These submarines can carry 16 Bulava missiles, each with six warheads. The Bulava missile had test failures before entering service in 2018. Russia's strategic aviation units are part of the Long-Range Aviation Command, including Tu-160 divisions. Russia's Long-Range Aviation Command consists of Tu-160 and Tu-95MS aircraft, with around 60 to 70 bombers in inventory. Tu-95MS Bear bombers can carry up to 16 AS-15 nuclear-armed cruise missiles, while Tu-160 Blackjack bombers can carry up to 12 AS-15 missiles. Both bombers have been modernized with new cruise missile systems. Russia's Long-Range Aviation Command has Tu-160 and Tu-95MS aircraft, with around 60 to 70 bombers in inventory. The Tu-160 is set to be fitted with a new cruise missile system, including conventional AS-23A (Kh-101) and nuclear AS-23B (Kh-102) versions. A newer version of the Tu-160 with improved stealth characteristics and longer range is expected to begin production in the mid-2020s. Russia's fleet is projected to have 50-60 aircraft, with plans for a new stealth bomber, the PAK-DA. Russia possesses various delivery systems for nuclear warheads, known as nonstrategic nuclear weapons, not covered by U.S.-Soviet or U.S.-Russian arms control treaties. Reports indicate Russia is modernizing its nuclear weapons for use by its military forces. Russia is modernizing its nonstrategic nuclear weapons, with estimates of 1,830 warheads. Lt. Gen. Robert P. Ashley stated that Russia's stockpile of nonstrategic nuclear warheads is likely to grow significantly over the next decade, with new military capabilities being added. Russia is modernizing its nonstrategic nuclear weapons, including theater- and tactical-range systems, with an eye towards greater accuracy, longer ranges, and lower yields. The stockpile is large and diverse, with dozens of systems deployed or in development, such as short- and close-range ballistic missiles, ground-launched cruise missiles, and antiship and antisubmarine missiles. It is uncertain if Russia will deploy these weapons. Russia is modernizing its nonstrategic nuclear weapons, including dual-capable missile systems that can carry nuclear or conventional warheads. The purpose of Russia's retention and potential expansion of these weapons is unclear, with some suggesting they bolster its less capable conventional military forces. As Russia develops more advanced conventional weapons, it may limit its nonstrategic modernization program. Russia is modernizing its nonstrategic nuclear weapons, including dual-capable missile systems. It operates an extensive early warning system with satellites and ground-based radars for missile launches and monitoring low-earth orbits. The Okno observation station in Tajikistan monitors objects orbiting at higher altitudes. The Russian President has authority over nuclear weapons use, with the General Staff overseeing the nuclear triad's status. Russia's Perimetr system ensures retaliatory launches during a nuclear attack. The process of transferring warheads for launch authorization remains unclear. Russia has an extensive infrastructure for nuclear weapons production and storage, with improved security measures in place. They have research institutes for designing nuclear components and no longer produce highly enriched uranium or plutonium. Nuclear weapons are stored at national central and base-level storage sites. Russia maintains 34 base-level storage facilities for nuclear warheads, overseen by the 12th Main Directorate (GUMO). They ratified the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty in 2000 but conduct hydrodynamic tests on Novaya Zemlya. The US suspects Russia may not be adhering to the nuclear testing moratorium. Russia is developing new nuclear delivery vehicles, including the Sarmat ICBM, to replace aging Soviet-era systems. President Putin unveiled these systems during his 2018 State of the Nation address, showcasing a range of weapons under development. The U.S. intelligence community has no specific evidence of low-yield nuclear tests by Russia but believes they have the capability. President Putin linked Russia's new strategic weapons programs to the U.S. withdrawal from the ABM Treaty in 2002, expressing disappointment at failed attempts to maintain trust and dialogue with the U.S. despite rejected proposals. The U.S. denied creating a global BMD system against Russia and stated it would presume Russia's actions are not targeted at the U.S. Russia is concerned about the US's uncontrolled growth of anti-ballistic missiles, which could devalue Russia's nuclear potential. Russia has developed effective systems to overcome missile defense and is continuously improving them. President Putin has linked Russia's strategic weapons programs to the US's withdrawal from the ABM Treaty in 2002. The Avangard hypersonic glide vehicle is part of Russia's ongoing modernization programs to counter U.S. ballistic missile defenses. President Putin emphasized the need for new high-precision weapons systems that can hit targets at intercontinental distances and adjust their altitude and course. This is seen as a response to the U.S. withdrawal from the ABM Treaty in 2002. The Avangard hypersonic glide vehicle is part of Russia's modernization programs to counter U.S. ballistic missile defenses. It could potentially be used as a first strike system against missile defenses, but some analysts believe it adds little to Russia's existing nuclear force structure. The program has been under development since 2004 and has undergone numerous tests, with the most recent test in December 2018 launching the glider over 3,500 miles away. Russia may deploy the Avangard on various missile systems. The Avangard hypersonic glide vehicle, part of Russia's modernization programs, may be deployed on the SS-18, SS-19, and Sarmat ICBMs. President Putin claims it can maneuver intensively at speeds exceeding Mach 20. The weapon was announced to be added to Russia's nuclear arsenal in 2019. The Avangard has been integrated onto the SS-19 force, with the Dombarovskiy Missile Division set to deploy it in 2019. Two SS-19 missiles equipped with Avangard were activated by the Russian military on December 27, 2019. Rocket Forces activated two SS-19 missiles with Avangard hypersonic glide vehicles, likely from the 13th regiment of the Dombarovskiy missile division in the Orenburg region. The regiment received two retrofitted SS-19 ICBMs armed with Avangard warheads, with plans for four more. By 2027, two missile regiments are expected to have six Avangard systems each. Each converted missile will carry one HGV, counting under the New START Treaty. Russian officials exhibited the system for U.S. inspectors as required by the treaty. The exhibition showcased the RS-28 Sarmat missile, a replacement for the SS-18 heavy ICBM, with each missile carrying one Avangard HGV. Russia has reduced its SS-18 missiles since the 1990s, retaining 46 under New START while awaiting the Sarmat. The Sarmat is capable of carrying 10-15 warheads and potentially multiple Avangard HGVs. Putin announced the development of the Sarmat missile in 2018, weighing over 200 tons. Testing began in 2016, and deployment is expected in 2021 at the Uzhur and Dombarovsky Missile Divisions. Russia plans to have seven Sarmat regiments with 46 missiles, consistent with New START limits. There are concerns that Russia may exceed treaty limits by expanding Sarmat deployment or increasing warhead numbers. President Putin highlighted the Sarmat missile's ability to evade missile defense systems and attack targets from unexpected directions. He emphasized its short boost phase, making it difficult to intercept, and stated that it is untroubled by advanced defense systems. The Sarmat missile is designed with a large number of warheads and penetration aids to increase its chances of reaching its target. Additionally, Putin mentioned the missile's capability to fly over both the North and South Poles, evading radar detection. The Poseidon autonomous underwater vehicle, also known as Status 6 or Kanyon, was leaked in 2015 and can reach depths of 1,000 meters, travel at 100 knots, and has a range of 10,000 km. Russia has been testing the system since 2016 and may deploy it on four submarines by 2027, each carrying eight drones armed with nuclear or conventional payloads. Russia has developed the Poseidon autonomous underwater vehicle armed with a two-megaton nuclear or conventional payload that could be detonated below the surface, potentially causing a radioactive tsunami along the U.S. coast. This system is seen as a second- or third-strike option to ensure a retaliatory strike against U.S. cities, in response to U.S. advancements in ballistic missile defenses. In March 2018, President Putin highlighted Russia's development of advanced unmanned submersible vehicles and the Burevestnik nuclear-powered cruise missile with \"unlimited\" range. Putin emphasized the missile's stealth capabilities, unpredictable trajectory, and ability to bypass missile defenses, making it \"invincible\" against existing systems. Russia has been conducting tests with a prototype missile. Russia has been testing a prototype missile with an electric power source since 2016, with most tests ending in failure. The use of a nuclear power source is unlikely due to the risk of spreading deadly radiation. Deployment of the cruise missile is not expected for at least another decade, and the high cost may limit its introduction into the Russian arsenal. Russia is also developing a nuclear-capable air-launched ballistic missile called Kinzhal, a variant of the Iskander short-range ballistic missile. The Russian Armed Forces have developed a hypersonic missile capable of maneuvering at supersonic speeds, making it difficult to intercept by U.S. defenses. President Putin highlighted its capabilities in a 2018 speech, mentioning its ability to deliver nuclear and conventional warheads over 2,000 kilometers. The missile is primarily intended to target naval vessels and entered service in the Southern Military District in December 2017. Russia's MiG-31 crews have taken the Kinzhal on air patrols over the Black and Caspian seas. The Tsirkon, an anti-ship hypersonic cruise missile, is designed for naval vessels and submarines, capable of striking targets over 1,000 km away at speeds of Mach 9. Putin announced its development in a 2019 address, mentioning its potential launch from submarines and land-based platforms. Russia is developing the Tsirkon, an anti-ship hypersonic cruise missile, for naval vessels and submarines. President Putin announced its development in 2019, mentioning potential launch from submarines. Russia is also developing a rail-mobile ICBM system to replace the SS-24 Mod 3 Scalpel, with an ejection test conducted. Additionally, Russia is working on a two-stage version of the RS-24 Yars ICBM, with successful flight tests conducted in the early part of the decade. Russia developed a missile program that raised concerns about violating the INF Treaty, which was later cancelled in 2018. The number of warheads on Soviet nuclear delivery vehicles peaked in the mid-1980s and declined due to arms control agreements. The United States and the Soviet Union signed bilateral arms control agreements in May 1972, including the Interim Agreement and the ABM Treaty to limit nuclear weapons. The Interim Agreement froze the number of launchers for ICBMs to prevent an offense-defense arms race. The Interim Agreement between the United States and the Soviet Union froze the number of ICBM and SLBM launchers, allowing for the addition of SLBM launchers if old ICBM launchers were retired. However, it did not restrict the growth of warheads on the missiles. Both nations increased the number of warheads by deploying missiles with multiple warheads (MIRVs), leading to a significant rise in warheads between 1972 and 1979. The SALT II treaty aimed to limit the number of missiles with multiple warheads between 1972 and 1979. It would have capped all strategic nuclear delivery systems at 2,400 and limited each side to 1,320 MIRVed ICBMs, MIRVed SLBMs, and heavy bombers equipped to carry nuclear-armed ALCMs. Despite controversy, some analysts believed the treaty would not reduce nuclear warheads or curb the arms race. After the SALT II treaty aimed to limit the number of missiles with multiple warheads, President Carter withdrew it from Senate consideration following the Soviet Union's invasion of Afghanistan in 1979. President Reagan then planned to expand U.S. nuclear forces to counter Soviet advantages, eventually leading to negotiations and the signing of the INF Treaty in his second term. Reagan's second term saw the signing of the INF Treaty in 1987, where the US and Soviet Union agreed to eliminate intermediate-range ballistic missiles. The treaty resulted in the destruction of 1,846 missiles by the Soviet Union, reducing deployed warheads by over 3,100. The INF Treaty was a significant arms control milestone with intrusive verification measures and the elimination of modern weapons classes. Negotiations on the START treaty began in 1982 but were halted from 1983 to 1985 due to a Soviet walkout in response to US intermediate-range missile deployment. Negotiations for the START treaty began in 1982 but were paused between 1983 and 1985 after a Soviet walkout in response to US intermediate-range missile deployment. The US and Soviet Union had differing views on the treaty, with the US seeking deep reductions in missiles and warheads, while the Soviet Union proposed limits on delivery vehicles, MIRVed ballistic missiles, and heavy bombers. Despite adjustments in positions and some convergence after the 1986 Reykjavik summit, an agreement was not reached by the end of the Reagan Administration. The negotiations for the START treaty began in 1982 but were paused between 1983 and 1985 after a Soviet walkout. President George H. W. Bush continued the negotiations, and the United States and the Soviet Union signed START in July 1991. The treaty allowed each side to deploy up to 6,000 warheads on 1,600 ballistic missiles and bombers, with reductions in heavy ICBMs. When the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, about 70% of the strategic nuclear weapons covered by START were deployed in Russia. In May 1992, the newly independent countries and the United States signed a protocol making all four post-Soviet states parties to the treaty. Ukraine, Belarus, and Kazakhstan agreed to eliminate all nuclear weapons on their territory. The United States and Russia signed START II in January 1993, limiting each side to 3,000-3,500 warheads with a deadline extension to 2007 if a new protocol was approved. START II would have banned all MIRVed ICBMs. The START II treaty, signed in January 1993, aimed to eliminate the Soviet SS-18 heavy ICBMs and limit each side to 3,000-3,500 warheads. However, its full consideration was delayed until the end of 1994 due to disputes. The U.S. Senate ratified it in January 1996, while the Russian Duma faced delays and objections over economic costs and limits. Russia's financial crisis in the late 1990s made it difficult to invest in new systems to maintain forces at START levels. The START II treaty aimed to reduce nuclear forces, but disputes and delays prevented its entry into force. The United States and Russia then signed the Moscow Treaty in 2002, agreeing to reduce strategic nuclear warheads. President Bush pledged to decrease warheads, while President Putin sought a legally binding agreement for transparency and predictability in arms control. The United States and Russia signed a treaty to reduce nuclear forces, with the US preferring a flexible process while Russia sought a legally binding agreement for transparency. The resulting treaty codified reductions to 1,700-2,200 warheads without specific guidelines for implementation, monitoring, or verification. In late 2009, the United States and Russia began discussions on arms control after the expiration of the START Treaty. Russia wanted a new treaty to further reduce deployed forces, while the US was initially hesitant to negotiate a new treaty but willing to extend some monitoring provisions. Talks between the two countries started in early 2009, leading to the signing of a new treaty. The United States and Russia began talks in early 2009, leading to the signing of the New START Treaty in April 2010. The treaty limits each side to 800 deployed and nondeployed ICBM and SLBM launchers, 700 deployed ICBMs, SLBMs, and heavy bombers, and 1,550 deployed warheads. It also includes a monitoring regime for verification of compliance. The New START Treaty differs from the original START Treaty in several ways. It now only has a single limit on the total number of deployed warheads, allowing each nation more flexibility in their strategic forces. Additionally, while START counted attributed warheads based on launchers, New START simply requires the declaration of deployed launchers without calculating attributed warheads. The total number of warheads deployed across Russia's strategic nuclear forces has declined over the last 20 years, as shown in Figure 4. Comparing force sizes across treaties is challenging due to differing definitions and counting rules. Despite Russia's fiscal crisis in the late 1990s and delays in modernization programs, reductions in warhead numbers have been observed since the implementation of arms control treaties. Congress has raised concerns about Russian nuclear weapons in recent hearings. In recent years, concerns have been raised about Russian nuclear weapons and the pace of Russia's nuclear modernization programs. Questions have been raised about a potential arms race between Russia and the United States as both countries upgrade their forces. The future size and structure of Russia's nuclear forces after the New START Treaty expires in 2021 is also a topic of discussion. Both countries are modernizing their nuclear forces to replace aging systems from the Cold War era. Russia and the United States have extended the life of their aging nuclear systems through modernization programs. Russia plans to retire many ballistic missiles from the 1980s in the next 10 years, while the US has extended the life of its Ohio-class submarines and missiles. Analysts see an arms race dynamic in these modernization efforts, with some blaming Russia for deploying new systems earlier than the US. The US plans to field new systems in the late 2020s. In the early 2000s, the United States will not field similar systems until the late 2020s, as Russia is developing new and more exotic systems. David Trachtenberg, the Principal Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Policy, emphasized the need to avoid a nuclear arms race with Russia's advancements in nuclear weapons systems. Franklin Miller, a former Pentagon and National Security Council official, also highlighted that the US program is not creating a nuclear arms race, as Russia and China began modernizing their nuclear forces earlier. Russia has been expanding its nuclear forces since 2008 and deploying new strategic nuclear systems. The United States, on the other hand, has not deployed a new nuclear delivery system this century and its modernization program won't be ready until the mid to late 2020s. Some argue that the US modernization program could fuel an arms race, as noted by former Secretary of Defense William Perry in 2015. The modernization programs of both the United States and Russia are not necessarily evidence of an arms race. Former Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter emphasized the importance of investing in maintaining nuclear deterrence in the 21st century. Russia has also been slowly pursuing modernization programs since delaying a planned cycle in the late 1990s. The New START Treaty, set to expire in 2021, is under review by the Trump Administration to determine its extension. Key considerations include Russia's violation of the INF Treaty, the treaty's impact on U.S. national security interests, and the effectiveness of monitoring data. The debate over extending the New START Treaty revolves around its value for U.S. national security interests, particularly in light of Russia's nuclear modernization programs. General John Hyten believes the treaty provides transparency and predictability regarding Russian nuclear forces, but has expressed concerns about Russia's new nuclear delivery systems. The Burevestnik nuclear-powered cruise missile, Kinzhal air-launched ballistic missile, and Tsirkon hypersonic cruise missile are not covered by New START limits. General John Hyten suggests expanding the treaty to include these weapons to address potential threats to the United States. Russia's deployment of Avangard hypersonic glide vehicle and Sarmat heavy ballistic missile will be counted under New START if it remains in force. If New START expires, Russia could increase its deployment of long-range missiles and heavy bombers, potentially adding more warheads to its force. This could include increasing the number of warheads per missile and deploying new warheads on the Sarmat missile. Without the treaty, Russia may add over 1,000 warheads to its arsenal by 2026. The 2018 Nuclear Posture Review (NPR) suggests that Russia may increase its warheads by over 1,000 without deploying more missiles. It highlights Russia's \"escalate to de-escalate\" strategy and recommends developing low-yield nonstrategic weapons to deter miscalculations by Russian leadership. Some experts disagree with the assessment of Russian nuclear doctrine in the Nuclear Posture Review, arguing that it overstates or is inconsistent with Russian statements and actions. They believe that evidence of a lowered threshold for Russian nuclear use is weak and that Russia may actually raise its nuclear threshold while strengthening its conventional forces.
