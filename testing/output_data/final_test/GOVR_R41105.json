    "content": "The report provides an overview of the proposed FY2011 budget request for DHS programs assisting state and local governments, focusing on first responders. It includes funding amounts and discusses potential policy issues, such as the elimination of grant programs and reduced funding for the Assistance to Firefighters Program. The Administration's FY2011 budget request for DHS programs includes three categories of grants: State and Regional Preparedness Programs, Metropolitan Statistical Area Preparedness Programs, and Training, Measurement, and Exercise Programs. The request mirrors current fiscal year appropriations, with funding increases for six programs and no funding for seven programs. Congress may consider issues such as the elimination of programs and reduced funding for the Assistance to Firefighters Program. The Administration's FY2011 budget request for DHS programs includes reductions in funding for some programs, such as the Assistance to Firefighters Program, and the elimination of selected programs. The total appropriation proposed is $4.0 billion, which is $164 million less than the previous year. Proposed reductions are offset by increases in funding for programs like the State Homeland Security Grant Program and the Urban Area Security Initiative. The Administration's proposed reduction in assistance programs aims to consolidate and expand eligible activities, increasing competition among homeland security projects. For example, the Interoperable Communications Program may be eliminated as both the State Homeland Security Grant Program and Urban Area Security Initiative allow for communication equipment purchases. The consolidation would give states and localities more discretion in prioritizing investments to meet specific homeland security needs. This could lead to states and localities trying to continue funding all their homeland security projects. Congress could address the issue of reduced funding for homeland security projects by increasing total appropriations for remaining programs. This would ensure baseline funding for numerous projects but may result in less funding for larger programs. Alternatively, Congress could continue funding programs identified for elimination to maintain funding for all eligible projects. The Administration proposed reducing funding for firefighter assistance programs in FY2011, which could lead to grantees prioritizing projects based on their needs. This may result in some projects being unfunded. The FY2011 budget proposes a decrease in funding for the Staffing for Adequate Fire & Emergency Response Grant Program (SAFER) by $105 million, making it the lowest amount since FY2001. The reduction in funding for firefighter assistance programs could lead to increased competition among fire departments for federal grant money, potentially resulting in fewer departments receiving grants for equipment, training, and recruitment purposes. The FY2011 budget proposes a decrease in funding for firefighter assistance programs, which could lead to fewer fire departments receiving federal grants for equipment, training, and recruitment. Congress may choose to increase funding to prevent a drop in the number of departments receiving assistance, or agree with the Administration's request and shift more funding burden to the local level."
