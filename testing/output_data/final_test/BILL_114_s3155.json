    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Foreign Cultural Exchange Jurisdictional Immunity Clarification Act\" and clarifies the jurisdictional immunity of foreign states. The \"Foreign Cultural Exchange Jurisdictional Immunity Clarification Act\" amends Section 1605 of title 28, United States Code, to provide jurisdictional immunity for certain art exhibition activities involving works imported into the United States for temporary display from foreign states deemed culturally significant by the President or their designee. The \"Foreign Cultural Exchange Jurisdictional Immunity Clarification Act\" provides jurisdictional immunity for art exhibition activities involving culturally significant works imported into the United States for temporary display from foreign states. Any activity associated with such exhibitions is not considered commercial activity by the foreign state. Exceptions apply in cases asserting jurisdiction under subsection (a)(3) involving property rights taken in violation of international law. The subsection outlines conditions for jurisdiction over foreign states in cases involving culturally significant works exhibited in the US. It requires the court to determine if the exhibition activity is commercial and if jurisdiction is necessary under subsection (a)(3) for property rights violations. The paragraph exempts cases asserting jurisdiction under subsection (a)(3) involving property rights violations of culturally significant works taken in violation of international law. It applies when the work in question was taken by a foreign government as part of a systematic confiscation or misappropriation similar to actions of a covered group. The paragraph outlines conditions for jurisdiction under subsection (a)(3) for cases involving culturally significant works taken by a foreign government after 1900. It requires a determination that the exhibition or display is commercial activity and defines terms like 'work' and 'covered government'. The term 'covered government' refers to governments in Europe during the period from January 30, 1933, to May 8, that were occupied, established with assistance, or were allies of the Government of Germany. The amendment made by this section applies to civil actions starting from the enactment date of the Act."
