    "content": "The international tax law is divided into sections on basic rules, allocation and anti-abuse rules, tax treaties, deemed repatriation rules, and anti-inversion rules. Countries may have a territorial or worldwide tax system for corporate profits, with most using a territorial system. The U.S. had elements of both systems in its prior tax system. The U.S. tax system was a hybrid, combining elements of residence-based and source-based taxation. Income earned in the United States was taxed regardless of the firm's location. Territorial features were introduced through deferral of income from foreign subsidiaries and cross-crediting of foreign taxes. Certain types of income, such as royalties and interest payments, were taxed currently. Subpart F income, easily shifted income, was also included in taxable income. The U.S. tax system included Subpart F income in taxable income and allowed a foreign tax credit to prevent double taxation of income from foreign subsidiaries. This credit ensured firms were not taxed more than the greater of the foreign tax or U.S. tax due. A worldwide system with a foreign tax credit would result in firms paying the tax of their country of residence, with refunds for excess tax in higher tax rate countries and payments for the difference in lower tax rate countries. The U.S. tax system allows for a foreign tax credit to prevent double taxation of income from foreign subsidiaries. Cross-crediting can offset U.S. tax due on income earned in a low-tax country with credits from a high-tax country. Foreign tax credit limits are applied to different income categories, such as passive and active baskets. Royalties on active business operations fall under the active basket and can benefit from this credit. The U.S. tax system allows for a foreign tax credit to prevent double taxation of income from foreign subsidiaries. Multinational firms benefit from excess credits against U.S. tax from foreign taxes on active income. The combination of deferral and cross-crediting results in a low effective U.S. residual tax of 3.3%. Foreign tax credit limits impact the tax liability of firms with excess credits based on the share of foreign-source income. Deductions can also affect foreign-source income. After December 31, 2020, interest paid by foreign subsidiaries is allocated between U.S. and foreign income based on asset size. This change includes worldwide interest allocation, increasing foreign-source income for the foreign tax credit limit. The title passage rule allows half of export income to be eligible for foreign tax credit offsets. The new law significantly changes the foreign tax credit system, allowing half of export income to be eligible for credit offsets. It also shifts towards a territorial system for certain profits, while maintaining a minimum worldwide tax for other income. Deferral is virtually eliminated under the new law. The new law introduces a minimum worldwide tax and maintains existing treatment of included income. It allows a 100% deduction for dividends for U.S. firms owning at least 10% of a foreign firm. Certain income is excluded from taxation, and a reduced rate applies to income of foreign subsidiaries. GILTI income is included in currently taxed income with a 50% deduction. GILTI income is included in currently taxed income with a 50% deduction, resulting in a 10.5% rate at the new 21% corporate tax rate. For taxable years after December 31, 2025, the deduction will be reduced to 37.5%, resulting in a higher rate of 13.125%. Foreign tax credits are allowed for 80% of foreign taxes paid, leading to a residual U.S. tax when foreign tax rates are below 13.125%. GILTI income is in a separate foreign tax credit basket, and if income allocation rules produce a smaller foreign-source taxable income, GILTI applies at lower rates. The new tax law introduces GILTI rates lower than 13.125% (or 16.406%) for foreign income. The law also allows a deduction for intangible income produced in the U.S. but derived from abroad, based on a formulary measure of domestic intangible income. Deemed intangible income is defined as deduction-eligible income exceeding 10% of tangible depreciable assets. The new tax law introduces GILTI rates lower than 13.125% for foreign income and allows a deduction for intangible income produced in the U.S. but derived from abroad. Deemed intangible income is defined as deduction-eligible income exceeding 10% of tangible depreciable assets. Foreign-derived deduction-eligible income is aimed at measuring income from the export of goods and services, eligible for a deduction of 37.5% for taxable income. The new tax law introduces GILTI rates lower than 13.125% for foreign income and allows a deduction for intangible income produced in the U.S. but derived from abroad. FDII is eligible for a deduction of 37.5% for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, and through taxable years beginning before January 1, 2025. The deduction declines to 21.875% for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025. The deduction for FDII and GILTI is limited if the sum of these amounts exceeds taxable income excluding GILTI. Several revisions are made in the foreign tax credit system, including the elimination of taxes paid on dividends as credits. The new tax law introduces lower GILTI rates for foreign income and allows a deduction for intangible income produced in the U.S. but derived from abroad. It also eliminates the ability to shield exports with excess credits and requires assets to be valued on an adjusted tax basis for determining sourcing for the foreign tax credit limit. The allocation of income of multinational firms between different countries determines where taxes are paid. The concept of nexus is crucial in determining a country's right to tax a firm's profits. A firm must have a connection with a country through a permanent establishment, typically requiring a physical presence. If nexus is established, the amount of income sourced in that country must be determined according to U.S. tax law. In U.S. tax law, the establishment of a presence for income sourcing is crucial. Once the right to tax is established, income allocation between countries must be determined. Related firms can manipulate profits through shifting passive income, setting transfer prices, and locating deductions in high-tax countries to lower their overall tax burden. The United States has anti-abuse rules to tax income that can be easily shifted, primarily focusing on Controlled Foreign Corporations (CFCs) and Passive Foreign Investment Companies (PFICs). CFC rules apply to foreign firms where U.S. shareholders collectively own at least 50% of the voting power. The United States has anti-abuse rules to tax income that can be easily shifted, primarily focusing on Controlled Foreign Corporations (CFCs) and Passive Foreign Investment Companies (PFICs). Subpart F of the tax law targets income primarily passive, including foreign base company income such as dividends, interest, rents, royalties, and income from business operations like sales and services subsidiaries in foreign countries. It also includes income from insurance of risks outside the country and income invested in U.S. property. The Subpart F of the tax law focuses on income from Controlled Foreign Corporations (CFCs) and Passive Foreign Investment Companies (PFICs), targeting primarily passive income like dividends, interest, rents, royalties, and income from foreign business operations. The scope of Subpart F has been reduced with the adoption of check-the-box rules since the late 1990s, allowing foreign subsidiaries to elect to disregard their own subsidiaries for tax purposes. The current tax system requires firms to set hypothetical transfer prices to approximate prices agreed upon by unrelated parties. This can be challenging, especially for transactions involving intangible assets. The tax system requires firms to set transfer prices for intangible assets, making it difficult to establish prices. Shifting profits can be done through interest deductions in high-tax countries. Rules limit the amount of interest deductions a firm can claim, with a 50% limit for firms with a debt-to-equity ratio above 1.5. The new tax law introduces a general anti-abuse provision focused on U.S. subsidiaries of foreign parents, with a high limit on interest deductions based on EBITDA. This provision may also impact U.S. multinationals with foreign-source income from higher-tax locations. The BEAT provision imposes a minimum tax on corporations with average annual gross receipts of at least $500 million over the past three tax years. The tax rate is 5% in 2018 and 12.5% for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025. Base erosion payments include payments to related foreign parties. Base erosion payments include payments to related foreign parties that result in a deduction under the Internal Revenue Code. This covers interest, rents, royalties, services, purchase of depreciable property, certain reinsurance payments, and payments to inverted firms. Cost of goods sold and certain services are excluded. Disallowed interest under thin capitalization rules is allocated to unrelated parties first. Withholding taxes reduce base erosion payments. A related person is someone who owns 25% of the taxpayer or another entity. The Base Erosion and Anti-Abuse Tax (BEAT) targets taxpayers with large base erosion payments relative to their taxable income, affecting transactions between U.S. subsidiaries and foreign parents by including interest and royalty payments in the BEAT base. BEAT aims to prevent profit shifting out of the U.S. through these payments. BEAT is aimed at profit shifting out of the United States through royalty and interest payments to foreign parents. Tax can be reduced by research credit and 80% of certain credits, but not others. Taxpayers under BEAT minimum tax won't be eligible for foreign tax credits on foreign-source income. Subpart F is retained with minor modifications, excluding foreign oil-related income and eliminating a provision for recapturing prior shipping income. The 30-day holding period is also eliminated. The new law modifies rules for determining ownership based on stock value or voting power, adds intangible assets like goodwill and workforce value, allows aggregation of intangible assets for valuation, and permits the use of alternative valuation principles by the Secretary of the Treasury. The thin capitalization rules have been revised to apply to more firms by eliminating the safe-harbor debt-to-equity-ratio rule, reducing deductible interest, and disallowing deductions for depreciation, amortization, and depletion in adjusted taxable income starting after December 31, 2021. The provision has exceptions for floor plan financing for motor vehicles. Real estate can elect a longer depreciation period instead of limits on interest deductions. Concerns about earning stripping are not typically directed at real estate. Hybrid entities and instruments can confer tax advantages on related parties by being treated differently in different jurisdictions. The tax revision disallows deductions for interest or royalty payments to foreign recipients not taxed in their country. Tax treaties aim to prevent double taxation, covering issues like withholding taxes and corporate profits taxes. Changes in domestic law can override treaty provisions. The new tax law may conflict with treaties, allowing U.S. firms to defer paying taxes on foreign income by reinvesting earnings abroad. Taxes are only due when earnings are repatriated to the U.S. parent corporation. Foreign tax credits can be claimed for taxes paid on repatriated dividends. This incentivizes U.S. firms to invest in countries with favorable tax conditions. The ability to defer U.S. tax incentivizes firms to invest abroad in low tax rate countries. Proposals to cut taxes on repatriations aim to stimulate repatriations by reducing the tax burden on foreign earnings. A deemed repatriation is imposed on post-1986 foreign earnings without requiring actual distribution, under the new participation exemption system. The transition rule mandates inclusion of deferred foreign income as Subpart F income, taxed at reduced rates based on the nature of the assets held. In response to corporate inversions, the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 enacted Section 7874 of the Internal Revenue Code, imposing negative tax consequences on inverted companies. This section creates two taxing regimes for inverted corporations, with reduced tax rates on foreign income and the ability to defer taxes for S corporations. Section 7874 of the Internal Revenue Code imposes tax consequences on inverted corporations based on ownership thresholds. If 60% of the foreign parent's stock is held by former U.S. company shareholders, the U.S. subsidiary is limited in claiming credits and deductions. If the ownership threshold is 80%, the foreign parent is treated as a domestic corporation for U.S. tax purposes. The section applies to companies that inverted after March 4, 2003, and aims to prevent tax benefits for inverted firms. Additional regulations have been implemented since 2004 to discourage inversion transactions. The Treasury has implemented regulations to reduce incentives for inversion transactions and their benefits. Measures include increasing the safe harbor for substantial business activities test, limiting access to earnings of U.S. foreign subsidiaries, and implementing anti-inversion rules targeting groups engaged in inversion transactions. The new law also affects inverted firms not treated as U.S. firms, with a special recapture rule in place. The recapture rule applies to newly inverted firms, increasing the tax rate to 35% on deemed repatriations. No foreign tax credit is allowed for this increase. An additional 20% excise tax rate on stock compensation for insiders in expatriated corporations is effective post-enactment. Dividends from certain foreign firms and inverted corporations are not eligible for lower tax rates. Base erosion payments do not include reductions in gross receipts, except for certain payments to expatriated entities. The provision disallows lower tax rates on dividends from certain foreign firms and inverted corporations. It applies to base erosion payments made by a taxpayer to a surrogate foreign corporation or a foreign person in the corporation's expanded affiliated group. A surrogate foreign corporation is defined as a foreign entity that acquires most of the assets of a U.S. corporation or domestic partnership, with the former shareholders or partners owning at least 60% of the foreign entity. The corporation's expanded affiliated group must not have substantial business activities in the country of organization. The 2017 tax revision expanded constructive ownership rules for determining 10% U.S. shareholders, CFC status, and relatedness tests. It includes downward attribution of stock owned by a foreign person to a U.S. entity. The downward attribution rule allows stock owned by a foreign person to be attributed to a U.S. corporation, U.S. partnership, or certain U.S. trusts. This rule was originally created to address inversions, ensuring that a subsidiary maintains its Controlled Foreign Corporation (CFC) status despite changes in ownership. The international tax system is subject to tax rules for Controlled Foreign Corporations (CFCs). Concerns include the impact of taxes on investment location in the US, with a focus on lowering the high tax rate. Questions arise about the effects of tax changes on investment allocation and efficiency. Comparisons of US tax rates with other countries are made to analyze these issues. The first section compares U.S. tax rates with other countries and emphasizes effective tax rates. The next section analyzes the impact of new tax revisions on U.S. domestic investment. The final section discusses the effects of new international rules like thin capitalization rules, GILTI, FDII, and BEAT. The U.S. corporate tax rate of 39% was higher than any other major country. The OECD and G-20 countries have average statutory tax rates of 27% and 28% respectively. The effective tax rate is crucial for investment location decisions, with measures like average and marginal effective tax rates capturing different aspects of tax liabilities. However, the average effective tax rate may not fully account for timing issues related to deductions and credits. To address this, a forward-looking tax rate based on expected tax payments for investments is needed. A marginal effective tax rate measures the difference between pre-tax and after-tax returns on an investment. It is based on expected tax payments and considers the time value of money. This measure requires detailed information on depreciation practices and is used to determine how corporate income tax affects investments. Studies often use a representative equipment investment due to variations in tax treatment and equipment durability. The marginal effective tax rates vary based on equipment durability and tax treatment. Studies show that the U.S. marginal effective tax rate for equity investment is estimated at about 22%, which is higher than the OECD average by 6 percentage points. These estimates assume the same tax base for federal, state, and local taxes. The marginal effective tax rates for equipment and buildings in the United States compared to other OECD countries show differences of 3.6 and 4.8 percentage points, respectively. In 2016, the Treasury estimated a marginal effective tax rate in the United States of 18.1%, compared to 19.4% in the rest of the G-7. The U.S. rate allowed for bonus depreciation. In 2017, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) studied tax rates for the G-20 countries. The study compared tax rates for the G-20 countries, showing a weighted statutory tax rate of 27.9% outside the US and 39.1% in the US. The average tax rate was 29% in the US and 22.2% in the rest of the G-20. The marginal effective tax rate was 18.6% in the US and 10.9% in the rest of the G-20. The CBO report compared marginal effective tax rates for tangible assets in the United States and the rest of the G-20. Rates for equipment were lower in the US (10.5% vs. 17.3%), while rates for buildings were higher (20.1% vs. 11.1%). The study suggests that US tax rates were higher for all asset categories and buildings but lower for equipment. The estimates were based on changes in domestic investment treatment, including a reduction in the statutory tax rate and the repeal of certain deductions. The CBO report compared marginal effective tax rates for tangible assets in the United States and the rest of the G-20. The report highlighted the reduction in the tax rate from 35% to 21%, the repeal of certain deductions, and changes in equipment expensing. Bonus depreciation was phased out and eliminated after 2019. The amortization provision for research and experimentation will begin in 2022. Table 1 shows effective tax rates on equity-financed investments under different provisions, including bonus depreciation and expensing. Public utility structures are considered equipment. Investment in tangible assets under 2017 law is subject to positive effective tax rates ranging from 38% to 88% with or without bonus depreciation. These differences reflect the acceleration of present value. The effective tax rates on equity-financed investments vary depending on provisions such as bonus depreciation and expensing. Tangible assets have accelerated depreciation compared to intangible investments, resulting in different tax rates. With bonus depreciation, the effective tax rate is 15.6%, while without it, the rate is 19.7%. The tax on tangible investment is significantly higher than on intangible assets. The tax rate on tangible investment is much higher than on intangible investment. Temporary provisions would lower the effective tax rate on equity-financed investment to 3%, while permanent provisions would reduce it to 11%. Comparing the 2017 rate with bonus depreciation to the new law's temporary provisions shows a decrease from 15.6% to 3%. With assets financed by debt, corporate investment is subsidized rather than taxed. The effective tax rate on debt-financed investments is zero in a world without inflation and with tax depreciation equal to economic depreciation. However, inflation and accelerated depreciation cause debt-financed investments to be subsidized. The effective tax rates for debt-financed assets are negative, but they rise under the new provisions. The overall tax rates under the new temporary provisions change little from 2017 law without bonus depreciation. The tax rates for debt-financed investments are affected by inflation and accelerated depreciation, resulting in a subsidy. Under the new provisions, the effective tax rates for debt-financed assets increase. Table 3 and Table 4 show the combined debt and equity investment with different leveraging rates. The temporary provisions of the new law provide an overall subsidy, while the permanent provisions result in a small effective tax rate. Taxes on equipment and nonresidential structures would decrease significantly under the new law. The tax burden on domestic versus foreign investment is affected by various elements, including the deductibility of interest. The revenue estimate for the first year is $17.7 billion, accounting for 14% of net interest paid. This provision is significant as it could impact effective tax rates for firms. If interest is not deductible, effective tax rates would be similar to equity rates. The overall effective tax rate could rise to around 11% under permanent provisions and fall to 3% for temporary ones. The new tax law could cause overall tax rates to increase by about two percentage points, impacting investment location choices. The exemption of dividends and deduction for tangible assets under GILTI would make investing in plants and equipment abroad largely exempt from U.S. tax. This shift to a zero rate for foreign investment returns may not significantly impact the residual rate. Moving to a zero rate for foreign investment returns may not significantly impact the tax treatment of foreign earnings, as the residual rate is around 3%. The international provisions aim to make the location of intangibles in the United States more attractive than in past law, with tangible investments affecting GILTI coverage and FDII deduction based on their returns. The international provisions aim to make the location of intangibles in the United States more attractive than in past law. Intangible returns are subject to the GILTI tax rate, with a subsidy allowed for intangibles licensed abroad. Intangible returns earned abroad may face a current tax without a foreign tax credit under BEAT. The concern for economic activity lies in where intangibles are created, as those subject to a lower statutory rate in the US due to FDII would experience higher overall tax burdens. The benefits from debt finance are lost with expensing, making the overall subsidy smaller and increasing the burden. Equity investment is not affected by the lower tax rate with expensing, but the lower rate reduces the subsidy for debt. With five-year amortization for research and development, the benefit of the lower rate on equity finance would offset the burden of the lower rate on debt. The lower rate on equity finance would offset the burden of the lower rate on debt. A separate basket for GILTI would have reduced opportunities under the title passage rule, but that rule has been repealed. The loss of tax benefits for exports may encourage more production abroad, but the location of investment is unlikely to be significantly affected by the tax change. Equity investment in tangible assets, especially temporary investments for equipment, could increase. These effects are smaller when debt is included, and even smaller when intangible assets are added. Restrictions on the deductibility of interest further narrow these differences. Other international provisions are probably not important to the location of investment, and the importance of capital flows to the economy would also be limited. Capital flows to the economy would be limited due to constraints on labor resources and imperfect substitutes for capital investments globally. The reduction in equity capital could lead to a contraction in the corporate-sector capital stock, as debt-finance costs would also rise for the noncorporate sector. The impact on the capital stock in the United States is uncertain. Lower tax rates make equity finance more attractive but debt finance more costly, potentially leading to a contraction in the corporate-sector capital stock. Global trends show a momentum towards lower corporate tax rates, with countries like Belgium, France, China, Australia, and Israel already reducing their rates. The impact on the capital stock in the United States is uncertain. The United States is considering reducing its tax rate, following global trends of lower corporate tax rates. Israel recently reduced its tax rate, and Germany agreed to phase out a surtax. The tax changes aim to create a more efficient and optimal system, with different methods like capital export neutrality and national neutrality being considered. Investment in equipment was already favored in the United States, and the impact of the tax changes on the capital stock is uncertain. The United States had higher tax rates on buildings compared to other countries, but lowering the rates increased efficiency. The tax changes aim to create a more efficient system, with different methods being considered. For outbound capital, taxes should be optimized. For outbound capital, taxes should be imposed by allowing a deduction for foreign taxes paid to equalize returns from domestic and foreign investments. The optimal tax rate for inbound investment is 1/E, where E is the elasticity of capital inflow with respect to the after-tax rate of return. A lower tax rate might attract more equity capital but reduce tax revenue collected in the United States. The optimal tax rate for equity is around 50%. The optimal tax rate for inbound investment is around 50%, with the system moving towards a more optimal one in the case of debt. By reducing the subsidy for debt, the system gets closer to an optimal one, leading to efficiency gains. Overall, there are welfare gains for the United States due to corporate rate reduction and reduction of subsidies for debt, bringing tax rates across asset types closer together. The effects on efficiency and optimality are mixed, with gains in some cases and losses in others. Companies were reported to be using the tax cut to increase investments. The tax cut at the end of 2017 and early 2018 led to companies increasing employees' pay through bonuses. Economic theory suggests that cash availability should not directly impact pay. Employee compensation is deductible and should remain consistent regardless of tax rate or cash flow. Planned pay raises before the 35% rate change were advantageous. Other reasons for pay increases include planned raises due to a tightening labor market. Pay raises were already planned due to a tightening labor market and new minimum-wage increases in 2018. Tying them to the tax cut was a PR measure, especially for firms in heavily regulated industries. Cash should not directly affect investment unless firms were liquidity constrained. Most of the tax cut and cash flow is being used for share repurchases, similar to paying dividends. According to a study following the 2004 repatriation holiday, most of the repatriated funds were used for stock buybacks. Firms have repurchased $290 billion in stock compared to $6.7 billion in bonuses. Financial analysts estimate buybacks in 2018 to be between $650 billion and $800 billion. Shifting profits through leveraging and transfer pricing of intangible assets is a common practice to recognize more profit in low-tax jurisdictions. The technique of profit shifting involves U.S. multinational firms locating debt in the United States and foreign parents of U.S. subsidiaries locating debt in their U.S. subsidiaries. Transfer pricing methods determine the price of goods and assets transferred between related firms, aiming for arm's length pricing. Intangible assets pose challenges as they are unique and lack a market for reference prices. Various methods are used to determine transfer prices, with the goal of maximizing profits in low-tax jurisdictions. Transfer pricing involves the transfer of intangible assets abroad, with buy-in payments and cost-sharing arrangements. Profit shifting is influenced by leveraging and intangible asset pricing, with estimates suggesting a 25% and 75% split respectively. Lowering tax rates could reduce profit shifting, with the U.S. rate at 21% plus state and local taxes. The U.S. statutory tax rate, currently at 21% plus state and local taxes, is positioned in the middle compared to other countries. Profit shifting, mainly to low-tax countries, may not be significantly impacted by rate reductions alone. Estimates suggest that a rate reduction alone could recover between 0.5% and 5% of profits in the U.S., but the cost of the rate cut may outweigh the potential revenue gain. Other provisions also play a role in addressing profit shifting. The U.S. statutory tax rate is currently at 21% plus state and local taxes, positioned in the middle compared to other countries. Profit shifting to low-tax countries may not be significantly impacted by rate reductions alone. Other provisions like thin capitalization rules, BEAT, GILTI, FDII, and transfer pricing also affect profit shifting. FDII acts as a carrot to reduce profit shifting, providing a similar tax rate on intangibles in foreign and domestic locations. GILTI is designed to encourage intangibles. GILTI is part of base erosion provisions to keep intangibles in the US, raising taxes for firms in tax havens. The tax rate under FDII and GILTI differs, with GILTI being below the standard corporate tax rate for firms investing abroad. The new provisions aim to reduce profit shifting incentives by tightening thin capitalization rules and including interest payments in the BEAT. Moving intangibles back to the US incurs a tax, and allocating interest within firms based on earnings or assets could be an effective method. Certain provisions were dropped in conference, but overall, significant steps have been taken to address profit shifting. The new provisions aim to reduce profit shifting incentives by tightening rules and including interest payments in the BEAT. Concerns were raised about the prior law's deferral principle allowing firms to delay taxation of earnings in foreign subsidiaries, leading to $2.6 trillion in unrepatriated earnings. After the deemed repatriation tax in the 2017 revision, U.S. companies now have unrestricted access to these funds. Corporate inversions involve U.S. firms restructuring to have a foreign parent company for tax savings, including earnings stripping and repatriating foreign subsidiary earnings. U.S. policy since 2004 has aimed to limit inversion benefits, with the 2017 tax revision reducing incentives for newly inverted firms. The 2017 tax revision has made corporate inversions less attractive for U.S. firms, especially in the next 10 years due to retroactive taxation triggers. The new law includes provisions such as lower corporate rates and tightened thin capitalization rules to discourage inversions. The United States has bilateral tax treaties with approximately 65 countries to reduce double taxation and prevent tax evasion. Residents of foreign countries are taxed at a reduced rate or exempt from U.S. taxes on certain income, while U.S. residents are taxed at a reduced rate or exempt from foreign taxes on certain income. Legal scholars and practitioners have pointed out conflicts between the new tax law and international agreements. The WTO, established in 1995, succeeded the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT, established in 1947), which aimed to foster an open international framework and settle disputes affecting trade practices. The United States had disputes over tax provisions like DISC, FSC, and ETI, which were found to be prohibited export subsidies by GATT and WTO. The OECD, with 34 member countries including the United States, sets standards for tax practices like transfer pricing. Recently, the OECD initiated a project to combat base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS), with 102 countries agreeing to minimum standards, including countering harmful tax practices like patent boxes. There is debate over whether BEAT violates tax treaties, particularly regarding nondiscrimination rules. The BEAT tax may violate nondiscrimination rules by treating foreign and domestic partners differently. It is uncertain how this issue will be addressed, especially considering constraints from EU agreements. Additionally, there are concerns that parts of BEAT may conflict with WTO rules, particularly as a tax on imports. However, the practical impact of these conflicts may be limited. The United States agreed to minimum standards to counter harmful tax practices, including patent boxes in countries where intangibles are not created. The FDII regime may conflict with this agreement as it lacks a connection to economic activity in the US. The OECD will assess if FDII violates preferential regime standards. Various technical issues have been raised about the new tax legislation, including GILTI, FDII, BEAT, and other provisions. Some lawmakers have proposed more basic changes. Representative Doggett and Senator Whitehouse introduced the \"No Tax Break for Outsourcing Act\" to make significant changes to the tax law, including increasing the GILTI rate to 21%, eliminating certain deductions, treating foreign corporations managed in the US as domestic, and limiting interest deductions. These proposals were not included in the final legislation, despite being discussed by many individuals. Some critics have raised concerns about the bill, particularly regarding the territorial tax system and its impact on businesses. The new law makes it more expensive to incorporate a new business and eliminates certain exceptions in the tax code. Changes in asset transfers and IRS authority over transfer pricing will affect the value of assets being transferred. The new tax law impacts asset transfers by treating individual owners of foreign corporations differently from corporations with 10% ownership. The repatriation tax applies to shareholders with at least one U.S. corporate shareholder owning 10% of the firm, with no deduction for dividends. GILTI is treated as Subpart F income, imposing taxes on individual shareholders without foreign tax credits or GILTI deduction. Individual shareholders are not eligible for a FDII deduction. The new tax law impacts asset transfers by treating individual owners of foreign corporations differently from corporations with 10% ownership. Individual shareholders are not eligible for a FDII deduction and the sale of stock will not be eligible for a dividend deduction. GILTI has been criticized for being too complex. The new tax law impacts asset transfers differently for individual owners of foreign corporations compared to corporations with 10% ownership. GILTI has faced criticism for being too harsh, particularly regarding the foreign tax credit rules and allocation of deductions. Unused foreign tax credits are lost without carryback or carryforward options, and no credits are allowed for loss CFCs. Critics of GILTI have raised concerns about the reduction of foreign tax credits and the offsetting of interest against deemed tangible income. They suggest allocating interest based on tangible income shares and overall income. GILTI is criticized for capturing excess profits and income from finance or insurance, not just intangible income. Additionally, the use of cost less depreciation for tangible property valuation is seen as providing slower recovery compared to domestic equipment. The GILTI provision is criticized for potentially undervaluing tangible property due to the lack of inflation adjustment, leading to a small tangible exemption. Cross-crediting under GILTI allows for blending operations in high-tax and low-tax countries, incentivizing shifting operations to countries with similar tax rates to generate foreign tax credits. The GILTI provision faces criticism for various reasons, including concerns about the tax rate in zero-tax-rate countries, the fixed deemed return on tangible income, and the potential encouragement of low-margin tangible investments to move abroad for deductions. Additionally, there are suggestions to adjust the tax rate to protect the U.S. tax base and to set the deemed return rate at a riskless return plus a fixed risk premium. Some suggestions to address criticisms of the GILTI provision include eliminating FDII and GILTI deductions, allowing a 100% foreign tax credit, or adjusting foreign tax credits in proportion to income taxed. Technical issues like unclear foreign tax allocation methods have also been raised. Other revisions, such as allowing foreign tax credit carryforwards and exemptions for loss CFCs, could help address these concerns. Some suggestions to address criticisms of the GILTI provision include eliminating FDII and GILTI deductions, adjusting foreign tax credits in proportion to income taxed, and addressing technical issues like unclear foreign tax allocation methods. Other potential revisions include allowing foreign tax credit carryforwards and exemptions for loss CFCs. FDII has faced criticism for potentially violating WTO rules, leading some to recommend its elimination. FDII mechanisms include round tripping, selling unfinished goods to foreign manufacturers, and buying goods from foreign suppliers for resale abroad. It encourages high-margin tangible investment in the US and is available to firms without US manufacturing or employees. Concerns include potential violations of WTO rules against export subsidies and being viewed as a harmful tax regime abroad. The FDII tax regime, while aiming to remove tax incentives for locating intellectual property, may be seen as noncompliant due to its mechanical rule and lack of nexus requirement. Germany has a provision disallowing deductions for royalties paid to related firms benefiting from noncompliant patent box regimes, potentially offsetting the benefits of FDII. Concerns about FDII violating WTO rules as an export subsidy have led some to argue against its enactment. The FDII tax regime has faced criticism for potentially violating WTO rules as an export subsidy. Suggestions to address this issue include eliminating FDII and GILTI deductions, imposing GILTI on a per-country basis, and making FDII elective. These changes could help eliminate incentives for locating intangibles abroad and ensure compliance with international tax standards. One option to address potential violations of international tax standards is to make FDII elective and add active royalties back to the foreign tax credit basket containing GILTI income. This would simplify tax law and reduce disputes with tax authorities. BEAT was designed to prevent profit shifting out of the United States through excessive royalties and inflated prices for goods and services by U.S. subsidiaries of foreign parents. Concerns have been raised about the lack of a foreign tax credit under BEAT, potentially triggering it for companies with significant international operations. BEAT is triggered for companies with foreign-source income from high tax countries and modest base erosion payments, acting as a tax on foreign-source income. It excludes cost of goods sold from its base, leading to criticism for potentially allowing royalties to be embedded in inventory to avoid inclusion in the base. The BEAT tax targets companies with foreign-source income from high tax countries and modest base erosion payments. It excludes cost of goods sold from its base, which has led to debates on whether royalties can be embedded in inventory to avoid taxation. There are discussions on whether services with markups should be included in BEAT, with differing interpretations from legislative history. Issues also arise regarding the aggregation of individual payments, especially for financial institutions. BEAT tax impacts intragroup interest payments made by financial institutions, leading to potential penalties for routine lending between groups. Firms may seek alternative financing methods like leases or convertible debt to avoid BEAT. There are concerns about the lack of look-through rules for final suppliers in related party transactions. The BEAT tax impacts intragroup interest payments by financial institutions, leading to penalties for routine lending between groups. Concerns include the lack of look-through rules for final suppliers in related party transactions, with criticisms of the high revenue threshold and broad application of BEAT. The BEAT tax primarily affects firms with thin margins due to a large amount of deductible base erosion payments compared to taxable income. Various revisions to BEAT are being considered, such as allowing a foreign tax credit and clarifying the treatment of services with a mark-up. Interest payments may be removed from BEAT coverage, with a suggestion for a worldwide allocation of interest instead. The BEAT tax primarily targets firms with thin margins and high deductible base erosion payments. Proposed revisions include a foreign tax credit and clarifying service treatment. Suggestions to avoid interest restrictions include leasing assets, using floating-rate debt, borrowing outside the US, or issuing preferred equity. The thin capitalization rules target multinational firms to prevent interest deductions in higher-tax countries. A provision aimed at international profit shifting was considered but not included in the final version. The rules are coordinated with BEAT by treating disallowed interest as associated with unrelated parties and NOLs, strengthening the effect of BEAT. Uncertainty remains regarding the inclusion of GILTI in the earnings base. The proposed tax measures include a worldwide interest allocation based on income and a deemed repatriation tax of 15.5% on cash equivalents held abroad. Concerns have been raised about the broad definition of cash equivalents and the potential unintended inclusion of income in the tax. The 2017 tax revision rules may inadvertently expand the scope of taxpayers subject to the deemed repatriation tax, according to the AICPA. Concerns also exist regarding the calculation dates for the tax base, potentially leading to overstatement of cash positions subject to a higher tax rate. The IRS guidance addresses issues related to foreign taxes allocation for a pending acquisition and testing dates for taxpayers with different tax years. Firms like Microsoft and Apple can avoid cash accumulations by paying out dividends before January 1, 2018. Some individuals may face the deemed repatriation tax if they own 10% or more of a foreign parent company. The deemed repatriation tax may apply to individuals owning 10% or more of a foreign corporation, without eligibility for foreign tax credits. Researchers have questioned the constitutionality of this tax. The legislation grants the Secretary authority to define cash equivalents, distinguishing between liquid and illiquid assets. The regulatory process is ongoing, with a focus on financial assets and excluding certain transactions like hedging. Limiting downward attribution rules to corporations may be a suitable approach to address the rules' scope. The 2017 tax revision changes in attribution rules are likely to result in more CFCs than under prior law, with the foreign subsidiary becoming a CFC due to downward attribution of shares to the U.S. subsidiary. This could subject U.S. shareholders to the deemed repatriation tax, potentially impacting individual shareholders under rules like GILTI. Consideration of cash movements and investments may address issues with two testing dates. The change in attribution rules was likely intended to prevent decontrolling transactions post-inversion, but commentators anticipate broader implications for corporate structures. After the 2017 tax revision changes in attribution rules, more CFCs are expected due to downward attribution, potentially subjecting U.S. shareholders to the deemed repatriation tax. Commentators anticipate broader implications for corporate structures beyond inversion transactions. Congress may consider revisiting the scope of downward attribution rules and implementing additional measures to discourage inversions. The text suggests that proposals are being considered, including codifying regulations on related party interest as equity."
