    "title": "SB 637",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. In August 2009, Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger signed Senate Bill 670, establishing a temporary ban on vacuum or suction dredge equipment until an environmental review was completed by the Department of Fish and Wildlife. In July 2011, Governor Schwarzenegger signed Assembly Bill 120, extending the prohibition on vacuum or suction dredge equipment until June 2016 or until certain conditions are met. In March 2012, the Department of Fish and Wildlife completed the environmental review and adopted updated regulations for its permitting program under the Fish and Game Code. The department found that the use of vacuum or suction dredging equipment would result in significant and unavoidable environmental effects beyond its regulatory reach. The department certified an environmental impact report in March 2012, considering it the most comprehensive review of suction dredge mining in California. The Department of Fish and Wildlife found that the use of vacuum or suction dredge equipment could have significant and unavoidable effects, including the resuspension of mercury and trace metals, turbidity, adverse impacts on archaeological resources, riparian habitat, nonfish wildlife, and public exposure to excessive noise levels. In June 2012, Governor Brown signed Senate Bill 1018, which removed the sunset provision from Assembly Bill 120 and directed the department to provide recommendations to the Legislature by April 1, 2013, regarding statutory changes necessary for suction dredge regulations. The recommendations were to include ways to mitigate environmental impacts and establish a fee structure to cover program administration costs. The department submitted a report to the Legislature on April 1, 2013, with recommendations for modernizing suction dredge mining regulations under the Fish and Game Code. The report included input from various state agencies, including the State Water Resources Control Board, which emphasized its role in regulating activities that may affect water quality. In January 2015, the California Supreme Court reviewed whether federal law preempts state regulations on suction dredge mining. Urgent legislative action is needed to clarify laws regulating small-scale motorized gold mining in California's waterways to protect water supply, cultural sites, and wildlife. Section 5653 of the Fish and Game Code is proposed to be amended. Section 5653 of the Fish and Game Code is amended to prohibit the use of vacuum or suction dredge equipment in California's rivers, streams, or lakes without a permit issued by the department. Applicants must specify the equipment type and size in their permit application. The department requires a complete permit application for the use of vacuum or suction dredge equipment, including necessary permits and certifications from relevant water quality control boards and the Army Corps of Engineers. If determined unnecessary by the State Water Resources Control Board or regional water quality control board, a letter signed by the Executive Director stating no waste discharge requirements are needed for the use of vacuum or suction dredge equipment. The department designates areas for vacuum or suction dredge equipment use with permits, specifying equipment size and timing. Unauthorized use is a misdemeanor. The department issues permits for suction dredging activities with base fees ranging from $25 to $130 for residents and $100 to $220 for nonresidents, depending on the need for an onsite investigation. The fees may be adjusted to cover the department's regulatory costs. It is illegal to possess a vacuum or suction dredge in restricted areas or within 100 yards of closed waters. Permits issued by the department do not allow activities that violate other regulations set by the State Water Resources Control Board or regional water quality control boards. Agencies will collaborate to share information on potential violations related to vacuum or suction dredge equipment. The use of vacuum or suction dredge equipment is defined as the mechanized removal of material from water bodies to recover minerals. Nonmotorized recreational mining activities are not affected by this definition. Section 13172.5 of the Water Code prohibits the use of vacuum or suction dredge equipment for mineral recovery in water bodies to protect water quality. The state board or regional board may adopt waste discharge requirements to address mercury loading and methylmercury formation in affected water bodies. Nonmotorized recreational mining activities, such as gold panning, are not restricted by this section. The use of vacuum or suction dredge equipment for mineral recovery in water bodies is prohibited to protect water quality. The state board or regional board may adopt requirements to address mercury loading, methylmercury formation, and resuspension of metals in affected water bodies. Certain conditions or areas where discharge of waste is prohibited, and specific uses or methods of dredge equipment extraction that impact water quality objectives may also be restricted. The state board and regional boards must gather stakeholder input through public workshops in various cities before taking action on mineral recovery equipment use in water bodies. This includes reaching out to mining groups, environmental organizations, and California Native American tribes. Before taking proposed actions, the state board or regional board must conduct public hearings in accordance with the Bagley-Keene Open Meeting Act. Collaboration between the state board and regional boards is encouraged to avoid duplicating efforts in public workshops or hearings. The Department of Fish and Wildlife may determine that environmental impacts from the use of vacuum or suction dredge equipment for mineral extraction are mitigated if regulations require compliance with all applicable laws."
