    "content": "The \"Home Energy Generation Act\" aims to enable small businesses and individuals to sell surplus electric energy, promote investment in renewable energy, stimulate economic growth, diversify energy resources, and remove regulatory barriers for net metering. The \"Home Energy Generation Act\" defines terms like customer-generator, net metering, and qualified generation unit as part of enabling small businesses and individuals to sell surplus electric energy and promote renewable energy investment. The \"Home Energy Generation Act\" defines terms like customer-generator, net metering, and qualified generation unit for small businesses and individuals to sell surplus electric energy from renewable sources like solar, wind, or biomass. The qualified generation unit must have a capacity of 100 kilowatts or less, be located on the customer-generator's premises, operate in parallel with the retail electric supplier, and primarily offset the customer-generator's energy requirements. Retail electric supplier sells energy to consumers, and the local distribution system distributes electricity to consumers. Retail electric suppliers must comply with requirements to offer net metering capabilities to customers with energy generation units. This includes providing electric energy meters for net metering on a first-come-first-served basis. Existing electrical meter cannot perform that function. Rates, charges, and contract terms for the sale of electric energy to customer-generators must be the same as if they did not own a qualified generation unit. Retail electric suppliers or distribution companies can install additional meters to monitor electricity flow. Energy generated by systems entitled to credits under a Federal renewable energy requirement will be treated as total generated energy. The retail electric supplier must calculate the net energy measurement for customers with net metering systems by comparing electricity produced and consumed during the billing period. If the supplier's electricity supply exceeds the customer's generated electricity, the customer will be billed for the difference. The customer-generator will be billed for customer charges if their generated electricity exceeds the electricity supplied by the retail electric supplier. They will receive a credit for excess energy generated, which will appear on the following bill. Transmission losses will not be charged, and if using a real-time meter, the credit will be based on retail rates. At the beginning of each calendar year, any remaining unused kilowatt-hour credit accumulated by a customer-generator may be sold to an electric supplier. If not sold, the credit will be assigned to the retail electric supplier that supplied energy to the customer-generator the previous year. A local distribution company retail electric supplier is not required to provide service to additional customer-generators beyond a two percent limitation in any calendar year. The local distribution company retail electric supplier is not obligated to provide service to additional customer-generators beyond a two percent limitation if the total generating capacity of all customer-generators with qualified generation facilities and net metering systems reaches a certain threshold. Retail electric suppliers must maintain records of customer-generators using net metering systems and notify the Commission when the total generating capacity reaches 2 percent of the necessary capacity to meet customer peak demand. Retail electric suppliers must ensure that customer-generators using net metering systems comply with safety and performance standards established by relevant organizations. The Commission may also adopt additional regulations in consultation with state authorities and distribution systems. The Commission may adopt additional control and testing requirements for customer-generators to protect public safety and system reliability. They can also prohibit additional charges by electric suppliers for safety or performance equipment/services. States can establish extra incentives for qualified generation and net metering. Interconnection standards must be established within one year. The Commission shall publish model standards for the physical connection between local distribution systems and qualified generation units within one year. States must adopt these standards within two years, with or without modification, to ensure safety and reliability. The Commission may enforce model standards in a State if its own standards are not approved within 2 years. The safety and reliability measures for equipment and distribution systems must align with national standards. The Commission may enforce model standards in a State if its own standards are not approved within 2 years. Standards must ensure generation units isolate during power outages and allow interruptions for maintenance or emergencies without additional charges by local distribution systems. The Commission may enforce model standards in a State if its own standards are not approved within 2 years to ensure generation units isolate during power outages and allow interruptions for maintenance or emergencies without additional charges by local distribution systems for interconnection equipment or services. Interconnection can be made by the owner/operator at their expense or by the local distribution system with reimbursement from the generating unit owner/operator. The Commission will enforce model standards in a State if its own standards are not approved within 2 years to ensure generation units isolate during power outages and allow interruptions for maintenance or emergencies without additional charges by local distribution systems for interconnection equipment or services. Simplified contracts will be used for interconnection of electric energy by systems and facilities with a power production capacity not greater than 250 kilowatts, to be performed by qualified electrical personnel certified or licensed by a State or local government authority."
