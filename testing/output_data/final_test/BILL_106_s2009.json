    "content": "The \"Rural Education Development Initiative for the 21st Century Act\" aims to provide increased learning opportunities for rural school students in the United States. Congress finds that there is a lack of federal education policy focusing on the specific needs of rural school districts serving poor students. 46 percent of public schools in the US are in rural areas, facing challenges such as hiring and retaining qualified teachers, especially in science and mathematics. Rural schools also struggle with shrinking tax bases. High-poverty schools face challenges like shrinking tax bases, transportation costs, and limited resources. Data from NAEP shows significant achievement gaps between high-poverty schools and others, making it difficult for these schools to prepare students for state and national assessments. SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, definitions are provided for terms such as \"elementary school\", \"local educational agency\", \"secondary school\", and \"State educational agency\" as per the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. Additionally, the term \"eligible local educational agency\" is defined as a local educational agency serving a school age population with 15 percent or more from families below the poverty line and in a rural locality or with 800 or fewer students. The curr_chunk provides definitions for terms such as \"metropolitan area\", \"poverty line\", \"rural locality\", \"school age population\", and \"Secretary\" in relation to education. The curr_chunk states that a program is authorized. The Secretary reserves 0.5 percent of funds for awards to Bureau of Indian Affairs schools. Grants are awarded to State educational agencies for local activities. Each State agency receives a grant based on a formula. The Secretary reserves funds for awards to Bureau of Indian Affairs schools and State educational agencies for local activities based on a formula. If a State agency does not participate, the Secretary may award funds competitively. The Secretary may award funds to eligible local educational agencies on a competitive basis under section 7. Each agency receiving a grant must match the Federal funds awarded. Grant funds can be used for educational technology, professional development, technical assistance, teacher recruitment, retention, and parental involvement activities. The funds received under this Act by State or local educational agencies shall not affect their eligibility for other Federal funding. State distribution of funds under this Act will not impact State or local educational agencies' eligibility for other Federal funding. State educational agencies will award grants to eligible local educational agencies based on a formula approved by the Secretary. In the first year, 99% of the grant funds will go to local agencies, with up to 1% for state activities. In subsequent years, 99.5% of the funds will be allocated to local agencies. The State may use up to 0.5 percent of grant funds for administrative costs related to the program. Each State or local educational agency eligible for a grant must submit an application to the Secretary with required information. Additionally, there are provisions for reports, accountability, and a study under this Act. Each State educational agency receiving a grant under this Act must submit an annual report to the Secretary detailing the method of awarding grants, fund usage by local educational agencies, provision of technical assistance, and actions taken against non-compliant agencies. The local educational agency must provide an annual report to the Secretary detailing fund usage and coordination with other funds. The Secretary will make State reports available to Congress and the public. The Secretary must submit an annual report to Congress detailing the methods used by State educational agencies to award grants, how funds were utilized by local educational agencies, and the progress made in meeting performance goals. After three years, only State agencies that met performance goals for two consecutive years will be allowed to continue participating in the program. The Comptroller General of the United States will conduct a study on the impact of assistance provided under this Act on student achievement and report the results to Congress. Authorization of appropriations for $300,000,000 for each fiscal year from 2001 to 2004 is granted to carry out this Act."
