    "title": "AB 1894",
    "content": "The State of California enacts the following. Section 33704 of the Food and Agricultural Code in California is amended to exempt certain products like ice cream, frozen dairy dessert, frozen dessert, frozen yogurt, and nondairy frozen dessert from specific regulations if they are served directly in a semifrozen state on the premises without packaging for consumption. All mixes, except for nondairy frozen dessert mix, must be obtained from a licensed manufacturer of milk products. Ice cream mix, frozen yogurt mix, frozen dairy dessert mix, frozen dessert mix, and nondairy frozen dessert mix must be manufactured into a semifrozen state without adulteration. A limited packaging permit may be issued to a semifrozen milk products plant for on-premises manufacture and packaging of hard frozen dairy products or novelties, subject to compliance with specific permit conditions. The hard frozen products can only be sold for consumption, not for resale. Frozen dairy product mixes must be dispensed from single service containers at a licensed milk products plant. Reconstitution of dry or condensed mix is prohibited at a semifrozen milk products plant with a limited packaging permit. Facilities for producing and packaging hard frozen dairy products must meet good manufacturing practices. The facilities should have proper utensil washing, sterilization, storage, and a sanitary work area dedicated to making these products. Sanitation guidelines from the Code of Federal Regulations must be followed for obtaining and renewing the limited packaging permit. Each hard frozen novelty must be labeled with the product name and manufacturer's information. Nondairy frozen dessert mix must be obtained from licensed manufacturers and reconstituted on-site using approved equipment. Water used for reconstitution must meet quality standards, and the product must be frozen or refrigerated until frozen. The secretary may authorize approved milk inspection services to enforce requirements for retail establishments manufacturing multiple products. Fees collected for enforcement will cover costs, with 15% remitted to the secretary for administration. Section 33704.5 of the Food and Agricultural Code is repealed. Section 36806 of the Food and Agricultural Code is amended to regulate the production of ice cream mix, frozen yogurt mix, frozen dairy dessert mix, and frozen dessert mix. These products must meet all requirements for their respective frozen products. Section 48003 of the Food and Agricultural Code is also amended. Section 48003 of the Food and Agricultural Code is amended to hold handlers personally liable for payment of assessments and inspection fees. Handlers must pay penalties for late payments and are prohibited from charging producers administrative fees for collecting or remitting assessments. A producer disputing an assessment amount can file a claim with the secretary and must prove it with evidence. Producers cannot sue handlers for damages related to assessments. \"Educational and research activities\" in dairy management include practices for environmental sustainability. Section 61345 of the Food and Agricultural Code is amended. Section 61345 of the Food and Agricultural Code is amended to ensure that Chapter 2, Chapter 2.5, and Chapter 3 are complementary and constitute a comprehensive scheme for regulating milk production and related activities. If any part of these chapters is deemed invalid, it will not affect the validity of the other chapters. Section 61412 of the Food and Agricultural Code is amended to require milk handlers to deduct assessments from payments to producers for manufacturing milk and pay fees to the secretary. Moneys collected by the secretary under this chapter can be used for its administration and enforcement. The purpose of the chapter is to provide funds for its administration and enforcement through assessments paid by milk producers and handlers. The secretary is authorized to prescribe marketing areas and determine minimum prices for market milk based on various factors. The goal is to achieve uniformity of cost to handlers within each marketing area, but lack of uniformity does not invalidate the minimum prices set. The secretary is authorized to formulate stabilization and marketing plans for the dairy industry to maintain stability and prosperity in milk production. Handlers must deduct an assessment from payments to producers for market milk. Handlers subject to stabilization and marketing plans must pay a fee of $0.008 per hundredweight of market milk, which is due to the secretary within 45 days of receiving the milk. The fees collected are used to administer and enforce the regulations. Section 76259 of the Food and Agricultural Code is amended to set the term of office for commission members at two years, with the first members serving staggered terms. Section 51203 of the Government Code is also amended. Section 51203 of the Government Code is amended to require the assessor to determine the fair market value of land without contractual restrictions, with input from the Department of Conservation or the landowner. Within 45 days of receiving the assessor's notice, the Department of Conservation or the landowner can request a formal review if they believe the current fair market valuation is inaccurate. They must provide reasons and additional information for the reassessment. The assessor may recover reasonable costs for the review from the requesting party. The city or county can deduct costs from cancellation fees before depositing in the Soil Conservation Fund. A deposit may be required from the landowner for potential cancellation fee non-payment. Assessor costs for formal reviews cannot be passed on to the nonrequesting party. If no request is made within 45 days of receiving notice by certified mail of the valuation, the assessor\u2019s valuation will be used to calculate the fee. Upon receiving a request for formal review, the assessor will review the valuation if it may impact the property's value. Parties must submit information within 30 days, with responses allowed within 30 days. Ex parte contacts are to be avoided during the formal review process. The assessor will conduct a formal review of the valuation within 120 days of receiving the request, avoiding ex parte contacts during the process. The assessor will conduct a formal review of the cancellation valuation, either revising it or confirming its accuracy. The revised valuation or determination will be sent to the department, landowner, and board/council involved in the contract cancellation petition. A brief narrative of the considerations and responses related to the valuation will be included, with no consideration given to information not shared between parties. If a formal review is denied, a brief explanation will be provided upon request. (c) The valuation date for any revised valuation after formal review or judicial challenge remains the date of the assessor's initial valuation. A cancellation value is considered current for one year after certification by the assessor. (d) The department and landowner can agree on a cancellation valuation, which will serve as the official valuation for contract cancellation. The agreement must be submitted to the board or council handling the cancellation petition. (e) If the department and landowner agree on a cancellation value for a contract with a city or county, the department must provide a preliminary valuation to the county assessor and the board of supervisors or city council at least 60 days before the final cancellation valuation. The assessor and board/council can provide comments on the valuation before the final determination is made. When determining the valuation for a contract cancellation, the department will take into account any feedback from the board or council on the preliminary and final valuations. The Department of Conservation handles appeals for cancellation valuations, representing the state's interests in administrative and legal challenges."
