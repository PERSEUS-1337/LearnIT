    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 14103 of the Financial Code is amended to prescribe the conduct of business for credit unions, including membership qualifications, annual meeting details, director requirements, committee responsibilities, and bylaws amendment procedures. Section 14252 of the Financial Code requires credit unions with assets over $10 million to file an audit report within 105 days after each fiscal year. The report must include audited financial statements prepared according to accounting principles specified by the commissioner. The audit report for credit unions with assets over $10 million must be based on generally accepted auditing standards and any additional requirements set by the commissioner. It must be prepared by an independent certified public accountant or public accountant approved by the commissioner and include a satisfactory certificate or opinion. If the certificate is qualified, the commissioner may require actions to address the qualification. A credit union with total assets under $10 million must file an audit report within 105 days after each fiscal year. The report can comply with specific provisions or alternative procedures approved by the commissioner, including being performed by an independent certified public accountant, public accountant, or the credit union's supervisory or audit committee. The commissioner has the authority to reject an alternative procedures audit deemed unsatisfactory and can order a credit union to obtain a satisfactory audit. Exemptions from this requirement may be granted by the commissioner if deemed unnecessary or advisable. The board of directors of every credit union has the general management of the affairs, funds, and records of the credit union. They must meet regularly, appoint an executive committee, and have special duties unless reserved to the members. The board of directors of a credit union manages affairs, funds, and records. They can delegate membership approval and expel members for specific reasons. Expelled members can appeal to the members for reinstatement. The board of directors of a credit union has the authority to determine interest rates, fix share and obligation limits, declare dividends, amend bylaws, fill committee vacancies, and direct fund deposits or investments. The board of directors of a credit union has the authority to direct fund deposits or investments, designate alternate credit committee members, and perform duties not reserved by the bylaws. Additionally, every credit union must have a supervisory committee of at least three members elected by the credit union members. An audit committee can be established as an alternative. Section 14556 of the Financial Code allows the board of directors to establish an audit committee in place of a supervisory committee. The audit committee must meet certain requirements and upon approval by a majority vote of members, the supervisory committee is dissolved. The audit committee must consist of at least three members, who are credit union members and appointed by the board of directors. It can include directors and non-directors, but the majority must be directors. Members cannot serve in certain roles within the credit union. The committee is responsible for ensuring compliance with specific sections of the Financial Code. The credit union must comply with Section 14252 and maintain an effective internal audit program. The board of directors can establish a supervisory committee instead of an audit committee, which requires membership approval. Section 14804 of the Financial Code is amended. Section 14804 of the Financial Code is amended to require credit unions to hold an annual meeting for the election of directors, a supervisory committee, and a credit committee if provided for in its bylaws. Section 14950 is also amended to allow credit unions to enter into obligations with members upon approval of the credit committee or credit manager, subject to terms established by the board of directors. The board of directors of a credit union must adopt a policy for accepting notes receivable from nonmembers as payment for asset sales. Transactions must comply with this policy and are not considered loans to nonmembers under Section 14750. A credit union may allow a nonmember to participate in a loan with a member as a joint applicant, co-obligor, coborrower, surety, or guarantor without violating regulations. However, the credit union cannot provide any other benefits to the nonmember unless they become a member. Section 14951 of the Financial Code is repealed, and Section 15050 is amended to define terms for this provision. In Section 15050, definitions for \"credit manager,\" \"obligation,\" and \"official\" are provided, clarifying roles and responsibilities within a credit union. No credit union can enter into obligations with any official unless the obligation meets specific requirements, including compliance with division laws, equal terms as other members, and adherence to a written policy. Additionally, the total obligations to officials, excluding fully secured ones, cannot exceed 20 percent of the credit union's savings capital. The maximum obligation to credit union officials must not exceed set limits and any obligation over $50,000 must be approved by the credit committee and board of directors. Officials cannot be involved in decisions regarding their own credit applications. The names of approving members must be recorded in the meeting minutes. The board of directors of a credit union must establish written policies regarding obligations offered to members, including maximum amounts and terms. Officials are prohibited from becoming surety for obligations for anyone other than immediate family members. Obligations with credit managers or officers must comply with division requirements and not be more favorable than those for other employees. The written policies for loans in a credit union must outline terms for unsecured and secured loans, interest rates, maximum maturity, limitations on loan officers' authority, and individual limits on obligations for all members. The policies should ensure equal access to funds for all credit union members based on creditworthiness. The board of directors of a credit union must set interest rates and terms for obligations offered to members, as required by regulations. Policies cannot allow obligations exceeding 10% of the credit union's savings capital with individual members. No credit union policy can allow total obligations with any one family to exceed the limit set by regulations. \"Family\" is defined as the marital couple or head of household with dependents, including those attending school away from home."
