    "content": "The \"Energy Infrastructure Tax Fairness Act\" limits discriminatory taxation of oil pipeline property. The \"Energy Infrastructure Tax Fairness Act\" defines key terms related to property tax assessments, including assessment, assessment jurisdiction, commercial and industrial property, and oil pipeline property. The \"Energy Infrastructure Tax Fairness Act\" defines public utility property as property devoted to public service, excluding oil pipeline property, and owned or used by entities regulated by governmental agencies. This excludes oil pipeline property and includes property subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. The \"Energy Infrastructure Tax Fairness Act\" prohibits discriminatory acts by governmental agencies that unreasonably burden and discriminate against interstate commerce, including assessing oil pipeline property at a higher ratio than other commercial property and imposing excessive property tax rates on oil pipeline property. The \"Energy Infrastructure Tax Fairness Act\" prohibits discriminatory acts against oil pipeline property, including assessing it at a higher tax rate than commercial and industrial property in the same jurisdiction. SEC. 3. JURISDICTION OF COURTS; RELIEF. The district courts of the United States have jurisdiction to prevent violations of section 1, regardless of the amount in controversy or citizenship of the parties. Relief may be granted if the assessed value of oil pipeline property exceeds by at least 5 percent the assessed value of other commercial and industrial property in the same jurisdiction. If the true market value of oil pipeline property cannot be determined through a sales assessment ratio study, violations of section 1 may include assessing the oil pipeline property at a higher ratio than other property and collecting ad valorem property tax on the oil. Relief can be granted by district courts if the assessed value of oil pipeline property exceeds other commercial and industrial property by at least 5 percent. The ad valorem property tax on oil pipeline property should not exceed the tax rate for other taxable property in the jurisdiction, excluding public utility property."
