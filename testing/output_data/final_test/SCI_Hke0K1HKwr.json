The model can track prior and posterior knowledge distribution, reducing ambiguity and leveraging response information effectively. Experimental results show state-of-the-art performance on the Wizard of Wikipedia benchmark. In knowledge-grounded dialogue research, the effectiveness of a model is validated on the Holl-E dataset. Previous works have focused on combining knowledge and dialogue context to generate informative responses. Dinan et al. (2019) proposed a method to tackle knowledge-grounded dialogue tasks. In knowledge-grounded dialogue, Dinan et al. (2019) proposed a method to select knowledge and generate responses. This work focuses on developing a sequential latent variable model for knowledge selection, aiming to improve engagement and accuracy in conversation. Sequential latent variable model for knowledge selection in dialogue systems aims to improve accuracy by leveraging response information and updating knowledge candidates based on prior and posterior distributions. This approach reduces the scope of probable knowledge candidates at each turn, leading to more accurate knowledge selection. The study introduces a novel model called sequential knowledge transformer (SKT) that leverages a sequential latent variable model for knowledge selection in dialogue systems. Experimental results demonstrate that the SKT model enhances knowledge-grounded chit-chat, improving accuracy in selecting knowledge sentences. The proposed model, Sequential Knowledge Transformer (SKT), improves knowledge selection accuracy and utterance generation performance. It achieves state-of-the-art results on Wizard of Wikipedia and Holl-E datasets, serving as a testbed for open-domain multi-turn knowledge-based dialogue. The datasets evaluate the algorithm's ability in knowledge selection and response generation. The WoW dataset focuses on knowledge-grounded dialogue, where a Wizard and an Apprentice discuss a chosen topic using an information retrieval system over Wikipedia. The conversation flow involves selecting a topic, retrieving relevant knowledge, and engaging in a dialogue. The task involves modeling a wizard who selects relevant knowledge and generates responses in a conversation. This approach is used in open-domain TextQA and has been shown effective for single-document TextQA. The task involves modeling a wizard who selects relevant knowledge and generates responses in a conversation. This approach is effective for single-document TextQA. In knowledge-grounded dialogue, there can be one-to-many relations between the dialogue context and the knowledge to be selected. The proposed sequential latent variable model for knowledge selection aims to capture the diverse nature of knowledge in dialogue and track the topic flow of knowledge in multi-turn conversations. The proposed model, sequential knowledge transformer (SKT), aims to improve knowledge selection in conversation by sequentially conditioning on previously selected knowledge to generate responses. This model suggests that knowledge selection should be jointly modeled with response generation in multi-turn conversations. The proposed model, sequential knowledge transformer (SKT), aims to improve knowledge selection in conversation by conditioning on previously selected knowledge to generate responses. The model utilizes BERT for sentence encoding and average pooling for embedding apprentice and wizard utterances. The focus is on the knowledge selection model, while leveraging existing techniques for text encoding and utterance decoding. The proposed model, SKT, enhances knowledge selection in conversation by using BERT for sentence encoding and average pooling for embedding utterances. It treats knowledge selection as a sequential decision process with latent variables, enabling joint inference of multi-turn knowledge selection and response generation. This approach differs from previous works and leverages sequential latent variable models for improved performance. Sarawagi (2019) propose a posterior attention model for seq2seq models, while the SKT model enhances knowledge selection in conversation using BERT for encoding. The model sequentially infers likely knowledge to generate responses, deriving a variational lower bound and sampling knowledge for the decoder during testing. The model generates responses by selecting knowledge with the highest probability. Training with true labels significantly improves knowledge selection accuracy. Previous research has used auxiliary losses over latent variables for training latent models. The training objective involves a combination of variational lower-bound and auxiliary knowledge loss. Knowledge is sequentially sampled from attention distribution. The model is trained using mini-batch gradient descent and Gumbel-Softmax function for posterior sampling. Evaluation is done on Wizard of Wikipedia and Holl-E datasets. The curr_chunk discusses the comparison of two chit-chat datasets, Wizard of Wikipedia and Holl-E, in terms of dialogues and document information. Test sets are split into Test Seen and Test Unseen subsets. Holl-E dataset includes spans in the document for additional information. The curr_chunk discusses the process of collecting ground-truth knowledge for generating responses, addressing inconsistencies in span labels. The evaluation metrics follow the protocol of WoW dataset, measuring unigram and bigram F1 scores. The evaluation protocol for response generation in WoW dataset includes measuring unigram and bigram F1 scores, perplexity, and knowledge selection accuracy. The test set for Holl-E is divided into single reference and multiple reference subsets, with multiple references evaluated by taking the best score. Knowledge accuracy is determined by matching the model's prediction with at least one correct answer. In comparison to two state-of-the-art knowledge-grounded dialogue models, the study evaluates various model variants including E2E Transformer MemNet, PostKS, and their combinations with BERT and knowledge loss. The evaluation includes replacing GRU layers with Transformers, utilizing a copy mechanism with Transformer decoder, and assessing knowledge accuracy by matching predictions with correct answers. Table 2 shows the performance comparison of different methods on the Wizard of Wikipedia dataset. Our model, which incorporates BERT, PostKS, and Copy mechanism, outperforms other models in knowledge selection accuracy and utterance generation metrics. PostKS without knowledge labels performs poorly on knowledge selection, but still outperforms E2E Transformer MemNet with knowledge loss in the WoW Test Seen. Leveraging prior and posterior knowledge distribution proves to be effective. The study demonstrates the effectiveness of leveraging prior and posterior knowledge distribution for knowledge-grounded dialogue. Sequential latent variable modeling significantly improves accuracy in knowledge selection and utterance generation. The E2E Transformer MemNet + BERT + PostKS + Copy model performs well, but our model surpasses it, especially in Test Unseen scenarios. The addition of a copy mechanism enhances utterance generation accuracy, highlighting the importance of sequential latent variables. Our model outperforms baselines in all metrics on the Holl-E dataset, with BERT significantly reducing perplexity. Human evaluation complements automatic language metrics in assessing utterance generation aspects. In a study evaluating utterance generation, 100 test examples were randomly sampled and evaluated by human annotators on Amazon Mechanical Turk. The quality of each utterance was rated based on engagingness and knowledgeability. Annotator bias was mitigated using Bayesian calibration. The human evaluation results in Table 4 confirm that annotators prefer the results of the sequential latent model over baselines. Performance gaps are larger in Test Unseen due to the model's better generality. Dialogue examples in Figure 3 demonstrate the model's ability to capture changes in dialogue topics for more appropriate responses. Recent works have focused on developing new models and datasets to improve knowledge-based conversations. For example, some models have incorporated external knowledge memory networks or utilized Incremental Transformers to enhance response informativeness. Additionally, a dataset called Wizard of Wikipedia has been introduced along with a model to leverage it. Dinan et al. (2019) introduce a dataset and model for knowledge selection and response generation in dialogue. Their model outperforms related works by incorporating a sequence decision process with latent variables and knowledge loss. Previous studies have explored sequential latent variable models like VRNN, SRNN, and Z-Forcing. The study introduces a novel sequential latent variable model, named sequential knowledge transformer (SKT), for knowledge-grounded chit-chat problems. It addresses knowledge selection in multi-turn dialogue and achieved state-of-the-art performance on the Wizard of Wikipedia benchmark. The study introduces a sequential latent variable model, SKT, for knowledge-grounded chit-chat problems. It achieved state-of-the-art performance on the Wizard of Wikipedia benchmark and Holl-E dataset. Future directions include exploring other inference models and studying the interpretability of knowledge selection. Incorporating BERT, the model adjusts learning rates and initializes weights accordingly. Label smoothing is applied for knowledge selection and utterance generation. Gumbel-Softmax temperature and knowledge loss hyperparameter are set. Dialogues are batched for efficiency, and the model is trained for 5 epochs on a GPU. The model consistently outperforms others in knowledge selection accuracy on the Wizard of Wikipedia benchmark. Our model consistently outperforms others in knowledge selection accuracy, especially after the first turn. Results on the Wizard of Wikipedia show better performance with more labeled knowledge data, but competitive performance with less labels. This suggests that our model can be used in a semi-supervised method without a significant drop in performance. The study includes human evaluation results in a multi-turn setting using the Wizard of Wikipedia toolkit. Participants rate their dialogue partner on a scale of 1-5 after chatting about specific topics for 3-5 dialogue turns. 110 conversations were sampled from 11 different turkers for evaluation. Selected examples of knowledge selection and utterance prediction are shown in figures 4 and 5, displaying dialogue context, human response, and generated utterances by the models."
