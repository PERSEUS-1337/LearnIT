    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Removing Barriers to Allergy Diagnostic Testing Act of 2018\". Congress finds that allergies, if not properly diagnosed, can lead to severe and sometimes fatal reactions. Allergies can worsen other illnesses like asthma and emphysema, causing social and economic burdens. Clinical guidelines recommend specific IgE tests and percutaneous tests for confirmation, but some Medicare and Medicaid policies do not align with these recommendations. In vitro specific IgE tests and percutaneous tests should be equally accessible to clinicians and patients to improve health outcomes, reduce costs, and address disparities in healthcare coverage. MEDICAID coverage for allergy diagnostic testing services is addressed in Section 3. Title XIX of the Social Security Act is amended to provide equality in the treatment of in vitro specific IgE tests and percutaneous tests for allergy diagnostic testing services under the State plan. Title XIX of the Social Security Act is amended to provide equality in the treatment of in vitro specific IgE tests and percutaneous tests for allergy diagnostic testing services under the State plan. This includes establishing frequency and allergen unit limits for such tests. Allergy diagnostic testing services are defined as specific IgE tests and percutaneous tests cleared under section 501(k). The amendments made to Title XIX of the Social Security Act provide equality in the treatment of specific IgE tests and percutaneous tests for allergy diagnostic testing services under the State plan. These tests must be cleared under specific sections of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and are used to evaluate immunologic response to certain antigens. The effective date for these amendments is January 1, 2019, with exceptions for State legislation requirements. The plan's compliance with Title XIX of the Social Security Act is not affected by its failure to meet additional requirements before the first day of the first calendar quarter after the State legislature's session. Each year of a 2-year legislative session is considered a separate regular session. SEC. 4. MEDICARE COVERAGE FOR ALLERGY DIAGNOSTIC TESTING SERVICES. Medicare coverage for allergy diagnostic testing services is expanded to include specific IgE tests and percutaneous tests that meet certain regulatory criteria. Medicare coverage is extended to include specific IgE tests and percutaneous tests meeting regulatory criteria for evaluating immunologic response to antigens. The Secretary ensures equality in treatment of these tests regarding medical necessity, coverage requirements, frequency limits, and allergen unit limits. Medicare coverage now includes specific IgE tests and percutaneous tests for evaluating immunologic response to antigens. These tests are treated as clinical diagnostic laboratory tests and physicians' services for payment purposes. The amendments apply to items and services provided on or after January 1, 2019."
