    "content": "The \"Underage Drinking Prevention Act of 2006\" may be cited as the short title. The findings of the Act are outlined in section 2. The Congress finds that underage alcohol consumption is a national concern, with 10.8 million Americans aged 12 to 20 reporting current alcohol use. Despite the seriousness of the issue, there have been significant declines in binge drinking and past month drinking among 8th, 10th, and 12th graders over the past decade. 42 percent of college students have had five or more drinks in a row in the past two weeks, with 68 percent reporting alcohol consumption in the past month. Sixty-five percent of underage youth obtain alcohol from family and friends, while seven percent get it from retailers who do not check identification. Most youth who drink get alcohol from non-commercial sources like family and friends. In 2000, $71 million in federally appropriated funding was dedicated to preventing underage drinking. Federal agencies have program activities targeting alcohol prevention, with $769 million used for activities addressing alcohol and drug use prevention for youth and the broader community. The Department of Health and Human Services/Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration emphasized the need for rigorously evaluated programs. Based on evidence of effectiveness, Federal funding should be reallocated to programs and grants in States with effective measures to prevent underage drinking. The Act will be administered by the Secretary of Health and Human Services through the Interagency Coordinating Committee on the Prevention of Underage Drinking. The Secretary will consult with various entities including States, colleges, public health organizations, and the beverage alcohol industry. Additionally, there will be an evaluation of federal underage drinking programs. The Secretary will evaluate federal programs aimed at preventing underage drinking, identifying programs that award grants to states, local governments, and private entities. The evaluation will determine program costs and require grantees to include evaluation costs in grant proposals. The Secretary will work with funded entities to develop evaluation criteria for programs, ensure timely completion of evaluations, and require modifications for ineffective programs. A report summarizing evaluation results will be submitted to Congress, including recommendations for reallocating funding towards underage drinking prevention programs. The evaluated and evidence-based programs should be listed online and reviewed regularly for effectiveness. SEC. 5. Incentive grants to states for preventing underage drinking. The Secretary may provide grants to eligible States to prevent and reduce underage drinking by reallocating funding from ineffective grants and programs. States must implement at least five out of ten specified policies, including coordination among agencies to enforce laws related to underage drinking. The State must have penalties for adults providing alcohol to minors and for minors possessing or consuming alcohol in violation of State law. The State enforces penalties for underage drinking violations, including driver's license penalties and escalating fines for repeat offenses. Monetary fines collected fund programs to prevent underage drinking. Parental notification is required for minors attempting to fraudulently obtain alcohol. The State publicizes laws and penalties for underage drinking, including consequences for those providing alcohol to minors. Collaboration mechanisms are established between licensed retailers. The State collaborates with licensed retailers and law enforcement to detect and prevent the use of false IDs. Incentives are provided for retailers to train employees and use age verification when selling alcohol. The State also educates parents on underage drinking. SEC. 6. FUNDING. The Secretary can terminate ineffective Federal underage drinking prevention programs and transfer funds to effective programs, evidence-based programs, and incentive grants for states. States will manage their Federal funds after a two-year grace period to reallocate resources from ineffective programs. Unused funds must be obligated before the fiscal year ends. Unused funds must be obligated before the fiscal year ends to be carried over to the next fiscal year and used within a four-year period. Improved collection and reporting procedures are outlined in Section 7. Improved collection and reporting procedures for federally funded surveys require data to be collected and reported consistently for users to compare results. Demographic categories for those under 21 include Early teens (12-14 years), Teens (15-17 years), and Underaged adults (18-20 years). The age groupings for federally funded surveys should not limit the use of other age groups or a comprehensive age range of 12 to 20. The groups should also include gender, ethnic, and other demographic data. Activities include collecting data from national surveys like Monitoring the Future Survey and State data using Federal funds. SEC. 8. DEFINITIONS. The Act defines key terms such as \"Secretary\" as the Secretary of Health and Human Services, \"underage drinking\" as illegal consumption of alcohol by minors, \"underage drinking programs\" as programs mentioned in section 4(a), \"minors\" as individuals under the legal drinking age in a State, and \"beverage alcohol industry\" as entities involved in the production and distribution of alcohol. The Act defines key terms related to underage drinking and the beverage alcohol industry, including control state jurisdictions of beer, wine, and distilled spirits. An incentive grant refers to funding reallocated from ineffective programs."
