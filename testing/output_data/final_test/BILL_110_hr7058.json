Congress found that after the attack on Pearl Harbor, Japanese-Americans in the military were discharged, segregated, and ordered to report to assembly centers for relocation. The Hawaii Provisional Infantry Battalion, consisting of Americans of Japanese ancestry, was sent to Oakland, CA, where the 100th Infantry Battalion was activated in June 1942. The 100th Infantry Battalion's training record and petitions from influential figures led to the re-opening of military service to Nisei volunteers, who joined the 442nd Regimental Combat Team in February 1943. The 100th Infantry Battalion was then moved to Camp Shelby, Mississippi, for further training before being refused deployment by General Eisenhower. The 100th Infantry Battalion, initially refused deployment by General Eisenhower, later trained at Camp Shelby and entered combat in Italy in September 1943. Their bravery led to 6 Distinguished Service Cross awards in the first 8 weeks of combat. They fought at Cassino and Anzio, and later joined forces with the 442nd Regimental Combat Team to push the German Army north of Rome in 1944.
