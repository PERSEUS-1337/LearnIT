    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Taxpayer's Right To View Act of 1993\". The Congress finds a growing trend towards pay-per-view television, with an increasing number of homes equipped to receive it. Pay-per-view revenue is expected to reach $1.1 billion by 1996, and events are being made exclusively available on this platform. Professional sports leagues are also turning to pay-per-view as a new revenue source. Some media analysts predict that premier sports events may move to pay-per-view, limiting access to events like the Super Bowl and World Series. Taxpayers fund many event facilities, so it's unfair for them to pay extra for pay-per-view. Nonprofit and public organizations are exempt from corporate income tax. Nonprofit and public organizations are tax exempt and can deduct donations to college sporting events. It is unfair for taxpayers to pay again for pay-per-view events held in taxpayer subsidized facilities. Congress should ensure free access to events sponsored by tax-exempt organizations. SEC. 3. PAY-PER-VIEW CHARGES PROHIBITED. Section 623 of the Communications Act of 1934 is amended to prohibit cable operators from charging separate fees for video programming of events held at facilities funded by tax revenues or public financial support. The Commission and local authorities have the authority to determine the applicability of this prohibition. The facility must be constructed on government-donated land or leased at below market rates, or receive public infrastructure/services at below market rates. Events by tax-subsidized nonprofits must involve tax-exempt organizations. The Commission will establish procedures for the administration of this subsection regarding tax-exempt facilities constructed with tax revenues."
