The Secretary of Veterans Affairs will implement a pilot program to assess the effectiveness of using service dogs to address mental health issues in veterans. The program will run for five years at three to five VA medical centers, providing training for veterans with mental health conditions. The pilot program aims to educate veterans with mental health conditions in assistance dog training. It includes indoor grooming and training space, wheelchair accessibility, classroom space, office space, equipment storage, outdoor exercise area for dogs, and transportation for field trips. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs will oversee the program's design and implementation. The Secretary will administer the program through the Recreation Therapy Service, establish a director of service dog training, ensure certified dog trainers at each site, and use certified assistance dogs in the program. The pilot program for assistance dogs requires purpose-bred dogs with proper health and temperament, taught 90 commands, housed at the program site or nearby, includes lecture and hands-on training, and aims to maximize therapeutic benefits for veterans. The pilot program provides well-trained assistance dogs to veterans with disabilities, specifically those with post-traumatic stress disorder or other post-deployment mental health conditions. Veterans can volunteer if resources are available, and hiring preference is given to veterans who have graduated from treatment programs and received certification in assistance dog training. Data collection is done to evaluate the program's effectiveness for participating veterans. The program aims to assist veterans by reducing stigma related to mental health conditions, improving emotional regulation, patience, and sense of purpose, providing opportunities to help fellow veterans, reintegrating into the community, building relationship skills, relaxing hyper-vigilance, improving sleep patterns, and reducing the use of pain medication.
