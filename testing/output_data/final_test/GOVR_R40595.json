    "content": "The Supreme Court ruled in Cuomo v. The Clearing House Association that states can enforce non-preempted anti-discrimination and consumer protection laws against national banks, as long as they do not interfere with the OCC's regulatory powers. Administrative oversight is not allowed as a state enforcement tool. The Supreme Court ruling in Cuomo v. The Clearing House Association allows states to enforce fair lending laws against national banks, despite preemption by federal laws. National banks are subject to various federal laws and state laws, with preemption determined by the presence of explicit statements in federal legislation or direct conflicts between federal and state laws. The Supreme Court has established criteria for determining when state laws apply to national banks in the absence of federal preemption language. This was exemplified in McCulloch v. Maryland, where the Court considered the interference of state laws with federally granted powers. The Supreme Court, in cases like McCulloch v. Maryland and Watters v. Wachovia Bank, has emphasized that state laws cannot impede or control the operations of national banks as per the U.S. Constitution's Supremacy Clause. The Court ruled in Watters v. Wachovia Bank that state regulations cannot be applied to a national bank's real estate subsidiary, citing congressional intent to protect the national banking system from interference. The visitorial powers clause protects national banks from state laws, allowing only federal law or authorized state auditors to review records for compliance with certain laws. The Supreme Court has consistently upheld the immunity of the federal bank system from state laws that negatively impact operations. The Supreme Court has consistently upheld the federal bank system's immunity from state laws that negatively affect operations, emphasizing that states can regulate national banks as long as it does not significantly interfere with their powers. The standard for determining if a state law is preempted under the NBA involves whether it significantly interferes with national banks' powers. The enforcement of state laws against national banks that have not been preempted has not been extensively litigated. Previous cases have shown that state laws not conflicting with federal laws can be enforced, and state regulators can enforce laws that prohibit national banks from certain activities. The state bank regulator can enforce laws that do not interfere with national banks' powers, as determined by the NBA. The court found that state statutes can be applied to national banks unless they conflict with federal laws or the purpose of their creation. The enforcement of state laws against national banks is valid and enforceable if they do not impair their efficiency as federal agencies. The state bank regulator can enforce laws that do not interfere with national banks' powers, as determined by the NBA. The state is seeking to enforce its own law, not the national government's, by examining disparities in lending practices among different racial groups. The Clearing House Association (CHA) and national banks, including Wells Fargo, HS-BC, J.P. Morgan Chase, and Citigroup, refused to provide non-public information on lending policies to the AG, citing the AG's request as involving \"visitation\" and challenging the authority of the AG to investigate national banks for violations of state laws. The CHA, with support from OCC, succeeded in securing rulings at trial and appellate levels enjoining the AG from investigating national banks. The district court granted OCC's request for an injunction against the state AG's enforcement of fair lending laws, based on the visitorial powers clause of the NBA. The New York AG challenged OCC's regulatory interpretation of the visitorial powers clause, which limits state authority over national banks. State auditors and examiners may review a bank's records to ensure compliance with unclaimed property laws. The courts-of-justice exception limits state authority over national banks, as stated in the implementing regulation 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 7.4000. In The Clearing House Association, L.L.C. v. Cuomo, the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the OCC regulation under Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, stating that courts must defer to agency interpretations of federal statutes under certain conditions. The AG's argument against preemption was rejected. The appellate court upheld the OCC's regulation, rejecting the AG's argument against preemption based on state sovereignty. It cited Barnett Bank of Marion County, N.A. v. Nelson for the standard of explicit statutory grants preempting state law. The court found that the visitorial powers clause does not limit states from interfering with OCC's authority and that the AG's inquiry involves visitation. The investigation did not fall within the courts-of-justice exception. The court upheld the OCC's regulation, citing Barnett Bank of Marion County, N.A. v. Nelson for preemption based on state sovereignty. The AG's investigation did not fall within the courts-of-justice exception, comparing it with Guthrie v. Harkness. Circuit Judge Cardamone dissented, criticizing the majority's view as altering the relationship between state and national governments. The Court, led by Justice Scalia, questioned OCC's regulatory preemption of state enforcement under the NBA's visitorial powers provision. The Court questioned the interpretation of the visitorial powers provision of the NBA, finding ambiguity in the term \"visitorial powers\" and rejecting OCC's interpretation. It explored the historical concept of visitation and distinguished it from sovereign authority. The Supreme Court questioned the interpretation of the visitorial powers provision of the NBA, finding ambiguity in the term \"visitorial powers\" and rejecting OCC's interpretation. It cited a case for the principle that state statutes not preempted should be enforced by the state, not the National Government. The Court distinguished a previous case involving the preemptive effect of an OCC regulation on a national bank's mortgage subsidiary. It carefully examined inconsistencies in OCC's interpretation of its regulation. The Supreme Court questioned the interpretation of visitorial powers provision of the NBA, finding ambiguity and rejecting OCC's interpretation. It contrasted state laws applied to national banks without state enforcement to permitting \"bark\" without \"bite.\" The Court identified practical differences between visitorial powers and litigation, emphasizing access to books and records. The Supreme Court ruled that the Attorney General did not have the authority to issue a subpoena for national bank records, affirming an injunction against such actions. Justice Thomas, Chief Justice Roberts, Justice Kennedy, and Justice Alito concurred with this decision but dissented on the issue of OCC's preemption of state enforcement power. The dissent disagreed with the majority's interpretation of previous cases and the structure of visitorial powers. The dissenting opinion disagrees with the majority's interpretation of previous cases and the structure of visitorial powers, supporting OCC's interpretation as reasonable and precluding state enforcement of anti-discrimination laws against national banks. The dissent argues that the term 'visitorial powers' is open to multiple interpretations and criticizes the majority's historical analysis, suggesting that OCC's broad view aligns with historical practices. The dissent supports OCC's broad interpretation of visitation powers, arguing that it aligns with historical practices and is permissible under Chevron. The Dodd-Frank Act includes provisions to codify the Supreme Court's ruling in Cuomo regarding the National Bank Act. The Dodd-Frank Act clarifies that the National Bank Act's visitorial powers clause does not prevent state enforcement actions against national banks for violating non-preempted state laws. It also allows state attorneys general and regulators to take legal action against individuals, state institutions, national banks, and federal savings associations for violations of Title X and its regulations. Additionally, the legislation sets standards and procedures for the OCC to follow when preempting state consumer protection laws. This legislation builds on previous efforts in Congress to address OCC preemption of state consumer protection laws. State efforts to enforce consumer protection laws against national banks have been strengthened through legislation such as the Consumer Financial Protection Agency Act of 2009 and H.R. 4173, the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2009. These laws allow state attorneys general to bring judicial actions against national banks for potential violations of state or federal consumer protection laws. The Dodd-Frank Act also clarifies that state enforcement actions against national banks for violating non-preempted state laws are permitted. The Consumer Financial Protection Agency Act of 2009, part of the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, aimed to transfer oversight of federal consumer protection laws to a new agency. It specified that state consumer financial laws would only be preempted if discriminatory towards national banks. Additionally, OCC regulations could not preempt state laws without substantial evidence. The Restoring American Financial Stability Act of 2009 proposed transferring consumer protection functions to a single regulatory agency, the Consumer Financial Protection Agency. It included provisions to prevent preemption of state consumer laws unless discriminatory towards national banks. Senator Christopher Dodd presented the draft proposal. The draft legislation, H.R. 3310, introduced by Representative Spencer Bachus, aims to maintain federal banking regulators' oversight of consumer protection compliance for banking institutions while consolidating bank regulation. It includes provisions to prevent preemption of state consumer laws unless discriminatory towards national banks and clarifies the authority of state attorneys general to enforce relevant laws. The draft legislation, H.R. 3310, introduced by Representative Spencer Bachus, aims to consolidate bank regulation by establishing a Financial Institutions Regulator (FIR) to oversee consumer protection laws. It does not change visitorial authority over national banks or preempt state consumer protection laws. Congress may focus on coordination between the OCC, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and states under the new rules. The Dodd-Frank regime aims to improve consumer protection in the financial services industry without overly burdening it."
