    "content": "The Act titled \"Medicare Access to Community Health Centers (MATCH) Act of 2007\" is established. Key findings are outlined in the Act. Congress finds that community health centers serve as the medical home to over 16,000,000 people nationally, including low-income, uninsured, Medicaid beneficiaries, minorities, and rural residents. Federally qualified health centers are located in medically underserved areas and cater to disproportionately low-income, uninsured, and minority patients with complex medical needs, playing a crucial role in the healthcare safety net. Federally qualified health centers serve all patients regardless of insurance status or ability to pay, including Medicare beneficiaries who tend to have more complex healthcare needs. Medicare patients often have multiple chronic conditions, take multiple medications, and see more than one prescribing physician. There is a need to improve payment for Federally qualified health centers based on nearly 15 years' worth of cost report data. The agency has failed to update and improve the Medicare FQHC payment system despite having cost report data from Federally qualified health centers. Expansion of Medicare-covered primary and preventive services at Federally Qualified Health Centers. The term 'Federally qualified health center services' includes services described in the Social Security Act and preventive primary health services required under the Public Health Service Act when provided by a Federally qualified health center to an individual.

The paragraph discusses the application of a per visit limit or productivity screen for Federally Qualified Health Centers under Medicare, with adjustments based on percentage increases in the MEI for primary care services and a market basket of health center costs for each fiscal year. The Secretary develops regulations for payment adjustments to Federally Qualified Health Centers under Medicare, considering changes in services provided during the fiscal year. Payment cannot exceed 80% of the determined amount, excluding copayments.

This amendment applies to services furnished on or after January 1, 2008."
