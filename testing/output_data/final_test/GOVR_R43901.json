    "content": "The Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2016, signed into law on December 18, 2015, allocated $52.83 billion for the Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs. This amount includes $14.90 billion designated as Overseas Contingency Operations funds. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, signed into law on November 2, 2015, raised the overall revised discretionary spending limit. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, signed into law in October, increased discretionary spending limits for FY2016 and FY2017 by $50 billion and $30 billion respectively. It raised both security and nonsecurity funding levels, as well as OCO funding by $32 billion. Additionally, a supplemental appropriations bill was introduced to provide an extra $1 billion in emergency funding for refugees. Emergency funding was proposed to address the refugee crisis in the Middle East, but no action was taken on the legislation. A minibus bill introduced in the Senate bundled various appropriations bills, including those for Defense and Homeland Security. Continuing Resolutions were approved to provide temporary FY2016 appropriations through December 11, 2015. The Continuing Resolution (CR) for FY2016, including SFOPS, maintained authorities and conditions from the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015 (P.L. 113-235), with exceptions. Most programs were funded at FY2015 levels with a 0.2108% reduction, excluding OCO funds. SFOPS FY2016 discretionary budget authority was estimated at $40.6 billion, with an additional $9.3 billion of OCO funds. Anomalies in the CR allowed for accelerated funding for Ukraine and extended authority for certain activities. The Continuing Resolution (CR) for FY2016 extended authorities for various commissions and provided Foreign Military Financing aid to Israel. Congress passed two additional CRs to allow time for voting on the final omnibus appropriation. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved its FY2016 SFOPS bill, totaling $49.77 billion before rescissions, which was below the FY2015 level and the President's FY2016 request. The House and Senate passed budget resolutions for FY2016, with differing recommendations for International Affairs funding. The House approved an FY2016 SFOPS bill totaling $48.19 billion, while the Senate bill totaled $48.01 billion. The House bill was below the FY2015 enacted level and the President's FY2016 request. The FY2016 budget authority for International Affairs enduring funds was set at $40.20 billion in a conference report, which was agreed upon by the Senate on May 5, 2015. The conference report also included $96.287 billion in Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) topline levels. Secretary of State John Kerry and Acting USAID Administrator Alfonso Lenhardt testified before various committees on the FY2016 SFOPS request. The President submitted his FY2016 budget to Congress on February 2, 2015, which included $54.08 billion for the State Department. The FY2016 budget request included $54.08 billion for the State Department and Foreign Operations. $17.54 billion was for State operations and related agencies, and $36.53 billion was for Foreign Operations. 13% of the request was for Overseas Contingency Operations. Figures show funding for the past 10 years and a breakdown of the FY2016 budget request. Congressional actions are also highlighted in the report. The FY2016 budget request for State Department and Foreign Operations included $54.08 billion, with $17.54 billion for State operations and $36.53 billion for Foreign Operations. The Obama Administration's budget request exceeded the Budget Control Act caps, raising concerns about sequestration if Congress appropriated funds exceeding the caps. The report will be updated to reflect congressional actions on FY2016 SFOPS appropriations. The Budget Control Act (BCA) established a reduction process involving sequestration and lower discretionary spending caps. Sequestration was triggered in FY2013 but avoided in FY2014 and FY2015 due to less stringent spending caps set by the Bipartisan Budget Act. In FY2016, potential standoff over budget caps was averted by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, which raised both defense and nondefense spending caps for FY2016 and FY2017. This paved the way for the omnibus appropriations agreement. In FY2016, the Administration distinguished between core funding and overseas contingency operations (OCO), with $7.05 billion designated as OCO, representing a 23.9% decline from FY2015. The OCO funds were for activities in Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, anti-terrorism efforts, and countering the Islamic State. In FY2016, the Administration proposed a 10.6% increase in funding for the State Department and Related Accounts category, totaling $17.55 billion. The budget request included growth in both base and overseas contingency operations (OCO) funding. Diplomatic and Consular Programs (D&CP) would have grown by 9.6% to $8.6 billion, while Public diplomacy (PD) spending would have increased by 3.2% to $1.37 billion. Embassy Security, Construction and Maintenance (ESCM) was allocated $2.22 billion, a 4.5% decrease from the previous year. The FY2016 budget proposal included a 4.5% decrease in funding for Embassy Security, Construction, and Maintenance (ESCM), with significant cuts to the \"Related Programs\" account. The proposed budget also included reductions for non-governmental institutions such as the East-West Center, the Asia Foundation, and the National Endowment for Democracy. Additionally, H.R. 2772 would have allocated $8.04 billion for Diplomatic and Consular Programs, including funds for Worldwide Security Protection. Section 7077 of the legislation, \"Preservation and Transparency of Department of State Records,\" would withhold 15% of non-Worldwide Security Protection funds until the Secretary of State certifies compliance with record preservation regulations. It also requires a plan to reduce information request backlog and improve response time. Section 7077 of S. 1725 prohibits funding for email accounts or servers outside the .gov domain. The Senate bill requests reports on pending congressional committee information requests and reducing the State Department's FOIA request backlog. Section 7077 of P.L. 114-113 requires a report on email and record-keeping practices, withholding $10 million until provided. Funding is prohibited for email accounts or servers outside the .gov domain. The State Department's focus remains on operations in Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Iraq, with almost 18% of the department's funding allocated to these countries. The FY2016 request of $963 million aimed for a Kabul-only presence, reflecting a more conservative approach due to the U.S. military drawdown. An increase of 23% in enduring funding was requested to support the Embassy's operations. The State Department requested a 21% increase in funding for operations in Pakistan and a 113% increase for operations in Iraq in FY2016. The request aimed to compensate for reduced carryover funding and shift OCO funding to enduring funding. H.R. 2772 did not provide specific funding recommendations for operations in frontline states due to staffing and programmatic fluidity. The Senate recommended full funding for operations in Afghanistan and Iraq under the Diplomatic and Consular Programs and Embassy Security headings. The measure included reporting requirements for U.S. personnel in Afghanistan and limitations on funding for diplomatic facilities in Iraq without land-use agreements. P.L. 114-113/H.R. 2029 designated $2.56 billion in OCO funds for the Diplomatic and Consular Programs account. The Senate recommended full funding for operations in Afghanistan, Iraq, and other high-risk areas. The FY2016 request allocated $595 million for operations in these regions. The International Organizations accounts were set to receive a significant increase in funding to $4.62 billion, with a 29% growth over FY2015 levels. The Contributions to International Organizations account sought $1.54 billion, a 5% increase from the previous year. The CIO request for funding to U.N. and Affiliated Agencies, NATO, and other organizations did not include funds for UNESCO. The request increased by 38% to $2.93 billion, with reasons including outstanding assessments, differences in U.S. share of peacekeeping costs, and growth in peacekeeping missions in Central African Republic, Somalia, and South Sudan. Additionally, a $150 million Peace Operations Response Mechanism was included in the Administration's FY2016 request. The FY2016 request included a $150 million Peace Operations Response Mechanism to support urgent peacekeeping needs. The proposal was not funded by appropriators in FY2015. House appropriators did not provide the requested increase for these accounts in H.R. 2772. Senate appropriators would have provided $1.51 billion for the CIO account. The FY2016 budget request included funding for the CIO and CIPA accounts, with the Senate proposing $1.51 billion for the CIO account. The House and Senate differed in their funding allocations, with the final appropriation providing $1.45 billion for the CIO account and $2.46 billion for the CIPA account, including OCO funds. No funds were allocated for a Peace Operations Response Mechanism. In the aftermath of the 2012 Benghazi attack, efforts to enhance security for U.S. diplomats and facilities abroad have continued. The FY2016 budget sought funding to implement security initiatives and meet the Accountability Review Board's recommendations, including $3.4 billion for Worldwide Security Protection (WSP) and $1.4 billion for Worldwide Security Upgrades (WSU). The WSP funding would increase by 9% over FY2015 levels to support Diplomatic Security Bureau functions globally. The FY2016 budget requested a 9% increase in funding for Worldwide Security Protection (WSP) to $3.4 billion. The funding included $99 million for the construction of the Foreign Affairs Security Training Center (FASTC) and $50 million for security enhancements at the U.S. Embassy in Tripoli, Libya. Additionally, $1.4 billion was requested for Worldwide Security Upgrades (WSU), a 4.5% decrease from the previous year. The FY2016 budget requested a 4.5% decrease in funding for Worldwide Security Upgrades (WSU) to $1.4 billion. $1 billion was allocated for the Department of State's share of the Capital Security Cost Sharing (CSCS) program, meeting the $2.2 billion level recommended by the post-Benghazi Accountability Review Board. The FY2016 budget requested a decrease in funding for security measures, including Worldwide Security Protection and Worldwide Security Upgrades. House appropriators provided full funding for these accounts, while Senate appropriators also supported the Worldwide Security Protection account. The bill prohibited funds for the development of FASTC without specific authorization from Congress. If not authorized by September 30, 2016, funds could be used to expand training at existing sites. The bill allocated $1.3 billion for Worldwide Security Upgrades. The bill provided $1.3 billion for Worldwide Security Upgrades, meeting the President's request for enduring funding. It did not include an additional $124 million in requested OCO funding. The act also granted authority for the Department of State to award local guard contracts globally based on best value. P.L. 114-113 / H.R. 2029 allocated $3.40 billion for Worldwide Security Protection, with a greater proportion going to OCO funds. Additionally, $1.48 billion was provided for Worldwide Security Upgrades, slightly more than requested. The bill granted authority for the State Department to award local guard contracts globally based on best value. The Foreign Service and Civil Service experienced growth to address personnel shortfalls and fill overseas positions in frontline states. The Administration's FY2016 request for Human Resources was 1% higher than FY2015, totaling $2.4 billion. The department sought 39 new positions, with 21 realigned from existing positions in Afghanistan. Funding was also requested to address pay gaps for Locally Employed Staff at overseas posts. The department's request for additional funding for Overseas Comparability Pay (OCP) was not included in the FY2016 budget. OCP adjustment aims to equalize base pay for Foreign Service personnel abroad with those in Washington, DC. The department had sought $81.4 million in FY2014 for the third phase of OCP adjustment, but it has not been supported by Congress. The FY2016 budget for Department of State human resources has not been fully supported by congressional appropriators. H.R. 2772 allocated $2.32 billion, S. 1725 allocated $2.24 billion, and P.L. 114-113 / H.R. 2029 allocated $2.18 billion for human resources. The legislation does not provide funds for new non-security positions beyond those explicitly described. The Foreign Operations budget includes traditional foreign aid programs, security assistance, and administrative accounts for USAID. The Administration requested about $36.53 billion for FY2016. The Administration requested $36.53 billion for Foreign Operations accounts in FY2016, with $5.2 billion designated as OCO. The House approved $32.22 billion, including $5.55 billion for OCO, while the Senate approved $32.92 billion, with $6.82 billion for OCO and $759 million for humanitarian and emergency response. This was less than requested and FY2015 funding. The enacted legislation appropriates $37.53 billion for foreign operations accounts in FY2016, with $9.61 billion designated as OCO and $1.18 billion as emergency funding. This is about 3% more than requested for FY2016 and 4% above FY2015 foreign operations estimates. The House committee bill matched the Administration's requested security assistance increase and exceeded the humanitarian assistance request by 18%. The Senate committee bill, S. 1725, recommended less funding than requested for all aid categories except humanitarian assistance, which it exceeded by 8%. Multilateral assistance would have been significantly reduced, with a recommended funding level 58% below the request. The Economic Support Fund (ESF) account would also have been reduced significantly, though the specific programs affected were unclear. The Senate recommendation for multilateral aid was only about 55% of the amount requested and 31% less than FY2015 enacted funding. The enacted legislation, P.L. 114-113 / H.R. 2029, provides more funding than requested for humanitarian assistance and security assistance, exceeding the House and Senate proposals. Multilateral funding includes $1.18 billion for an IMF quota increase, surpassing the House and Senate committee levels. The FY2016 budget request includes significant foreign assistance funding, with top recipients being Israel, Afghanistan, Egypt, Jordan, and Pakistan receiving varying amounts for security and stability purposes. Israel would receive $3.1 billion, Afghanistan $1.5 billion, Egypt $1.5 billion, Jordan $1.0 billion, and Pakistan $804 million. The FY2016 foreign operations budget request included $804 million for Pakistan, a 10% cut from FY2014, with other top recipients being Kenya, Nigeria, and Tanzania. Ukraine was a new addition to the top recipient list with $514 million requested. Funding allocation among regions changed slightly, with Europe/Eurasia and the Western Hemisphere increasing their share by 2% each, while Africa's share declined by about 5% from FY2014 estimates. The House committee-passed bill did not include comprehensive country allocations, but specified aid levels for Israel ($3.1 billion) and Jordan (no less than $1 billion) and emphasized support for Ukraine, Afghanistan, Mexico, and Colombia. The Senate-passed legislation provided detailed account allocation tables for countries like Israel, Afghanistan, Jordan, Iraq, Egypt, Lebanon, Pakistan, Ukraine, and West Bank/Gaza, among others. It also recommended up to $675 million to support the U.S. Strategy for Engagement in Central America. The Senate bill recommended up to $675 million to support the U.S. Strategy for Engagement in Central America and reestablished the Assistance to Europe, Eurasia and Central Asia (AEECA) account with a total of $853.93 million. The AEECA funding included programs requested under the ESF and INCLE accounts. P.L. 114-113 / H.R. 2029 funded a reestablished AEECA account at $930 million and indicated potential growth in foreign assistance to Europe/Eurasia and the Western Hemisphere in FY2016. Israel received $3.10 billion as requested. In FY2016, Israel received $3.10 billion in Foreign Military Financing aid, Egypt may receive up to $1.30 billion in FMF and $150 million in ESF, Jordan is to receive no less than $1.275 billion, and Ukraine no less than $658 million in economic and security assistance. The Obama Administration's foreign assistance initiatives accounted for about 30% of the total foreign operations request, with House and Senate appropriators expressing differing views on these initiatives in their FY2016 legislation. The FY2016 foreign assistance initiatives requested $8.18 billion for Global Health Programs, with a focus on HIV/AIDS, maternal and child health, and infectious diseases. The proposed reduction in funding would mainly come from a decreased U.S. contribution to the Global Fund for AIDS Relief. The U.S. contribution to GAVI would have increased by 18%, or $35 million, reflecting a four-year commitment made in 2014. Both House and Senate committee-approved bills included more funding for global health programs than requested by the Administration. The House bill recommended $8.454 billion, while the Senate recommended $8.468 billion. Both committees rejected the Administration's proposed reduction in the U.S. contribution to the Global Fund for HIV/AIDS programs. The House proposal also provided more funding for maternal and child health, nutrition, and vulnerable children. The Senate committee recommended funding for global health programs, matching the request for family planning and reproductive health, recommending more for nutrition, vulnerable children, and some infectious diseases, and less for maternal and child health. H.R. 2029 / P.L. 114-113 appropriated $8,503.5 million for global health programs, slightly below the FY2015 estimate. Funding increases were allocated to maternal and child health, nutrition, malaria, and infectious diseases. The Administration's food security initiative, Feed the Future, would have received just over $1 billion in the FY2016 request, an 8% drop from the FY2014 funding level. The initiative promotes agricultural productivity, expanding markets, improved nutrition, and economic resilience in vulnerable rural communities. Funds requested for FY2016 would have supported programs to build agriculture sector resilience to climate change, promote nutrition-sensitive agriculture, and adapt to recurring shocks such as droughts and floods. The FY2016 funding request for the Administration's food security initiative, Feed the Future, aimed to shift funding towards countries needing additional funds for targeted goals, reduce funding for countries with expected available funds, and provide new funding for Guinea and Sierra Leone to enhance food security and resilience post-Ebola crisis. The request also included $43 million for the Global Agriculture and Food Security Program (GAFSP) and $30 million for the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD). The committee report highlighted that bilateral funds may have been used to provide grants to GAFSP for activities in Feed the Future countries. S. 1725 allocated $1.00 billion for bilateral assistance for food security and agricultural development, with an additional $21.5 million for a U.S. contribution to GAFSP. H.R. 2029 / P.L. 114-113 allocated $1.00 billion for bilateral food security and agricultural development, along with $53.0 million for GAFSP and $31.9 million for IFAD. GCCI would have received a significant funding increase to $1.29 billion in FY2016, focusing on adaptation, clean energy, and sustainable landscapes. The total funding increase in FY2016 was largely due to a proposed contribution to a multilateral Green Climate Fund, aimed at succeeding the Climate Investment Funds. The Administration viewed this contribution as a demonstration of U.S. leadership and a way to leverage contributions from other donors and binding emission reduction targets from countries like China and India during U.N. climate change negotiations. The House Appropriations Committee's H.R. 2772 did not mention the Green Climate Fund or multilateral climate investment funds. Senate appropriators in S. 1725 recommended reduced U.S. contributions to climate funds. H.R. 2029 / P.L. 114-113 did not specify funding for global climate change initiatives. The Administration requested funding for various climate change initiatives, including $59.62 million for the Strategic Climate Fund, $170.68 million for the Clean Technology Fund, and $168.26 million for the GEF. Additionally, $77 million was requested for Power Africa to increase access to power in sub-Saharan Africa. The U.S. requested $47 million for Trade in Africa, with additional funding from prior-year sources. $110 million was also requested for an African Peacekeeping Rapid Response Partnership and $24 million for a Security Governance Initiative. H.R. 2772 did not specify funding levels for these initiatives. The legislation supported various initiatives including the Global Peace Operations initiative and the African Peacekeeping Rapid Response Partnership. Funding was allocated for Power Africa, the African Peacekeeping Rapid Response Partnership, and the Security Governance Initiative. Additionally, OCO funding was requested for assistance in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Syria, Iraq, Jordan, and Ukraine. The requested foreign operations OCO funding for frontline states like Afghanistan, Iraq, and Pakistan decreased from previous years. Significant portions were allocated for humanitarian accounts, including funds for Syria, South Sudan, the Central African Republic, and Iraq. Additionally, OCO funds were included for opposition support in Syria. The request for OCO funds included support for opposition in Syria, economic and military activities in Jordan, a Counterterrorism Partnership Fund, and assistance to Ukraine. H.R. 2772 allocated $5.55 billion as OCO in Foreign Operations accounts, with increases for Migration and Refugee Assistance, International Narcotics Control, Foreign Military Financing, and Peacekeeping Operations. The legislation provided less OCO funding than requested for the Nonproliferation, Antiterrorism, Demining and Related (NADR) account. The Senate committee bill designated $6.82 billion as OCO, with increases in IDA, MRA, and Foreign Military Financing. The Senate bill also designated $759 million in additional IDA and MRA assistance as emergency response, totaling about 23% of foreign operations funding outside the BCA caps. The enacted legislation, P.L. 114-113, designates $9.612 billion as OCO within foreign operations accounts, a notable increase attributed to The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015. An additional $1.18 billion was designated as emergency funding. The increase in OCO was offset by decreases in base budget accounts, suggesting funds were used to free up base budget authority. The FY2016 foreign operations request aimed to increase U.S. financial commitments towards addressing the crisis in Syria and combating the Islamic State. The Administration requested $1.82 billion for these purposes, including $255 million for non-humanitarian assistance to Syrian opposition groups. Additionally, $65 million was requested from the peacekeeping operations account to provide non-lethal assistance to vetted members of the armed Syrian opposition. The majority of the funding would have been used to help Syria's neighboring countries, with $1 billion designated for Jordan to counter IS and address Syria-related economic and security challenges. The Administration requested $335 million for Iraq's counterterrorism capabilities, $211 million for Lebanon to assist Syrian refugees and address the IS threat, and a 17% increase in funding for Syria and Counter-ISIL activities. An additional $1.6 billion was requested for humanitarian assistance in the region. The House committee-passed bill did not specify funding for Syria-related activities but allocated $104 million for foreign fighters and maintained funding for Migration and Refugee Assistance at a historically high level. The Senate committee allocated $100 million in Economic Support Fund money for Syrian refugee host communities in Iraq, Jordan, and Lebanon. The bill also included $1.175 billion for Jordan and $355.4 million for Iraq, with provisions to address needs in areas affected by the Syria crisis. Additionally, the Senate bill included $1.895 million for IDA and $2,644 million for MRA in humanitarian accounts. The Senate bill allocated $298 million for IDA and $461 million for MRA as emergency spending. It also included a provision for countering violent extremism with a recommended funding of $141.152 million. The bill identified $100 million in ESF funds and $65 million in PKO funds for non-lethal programs aimed at strengthening civil society and governance. The Senate bill allocated funds for programs to strengthen civil society and governance in Syria, including assistance to Jordan for the Syrian crisis. The enacted funding level for MRA is $3,059.0 million, with a large portion likely used for the Syrian refugee crisis. The FY2016 foreign operations request for Afghanistan was $1.514 billion. The FY2016 foreign operations request for Afghanistan was $1.514 billion, with funding primarily from the Economic Support Fund account. The request also included $804 million for Pakistan to support regional stability and counterterrorism. The funding for both countries was described as consistent with a responsible glide path, showing the U.S. commitment to the region despite declining military presence. H.R. 2772 did not specify assistance levels for Afghanistan and Pakistan. The committee report (H.Rept. 114-154) directed continuous review of funding for Afghanistan and Pakistan, with $939 million for Afghanistan and $625.8 million for Pakistan recommended in new assistance funds. Improved relations between the two countries were noted, with encouragement for continued cooperation on mutual interests. The P.L. 114-113 and accompanying report have provisions to restrict U.S. assistance to Afghanistan and Pakistan. Funding in the act is available for promoting rule of law, women's rights, regional linkages, and revenue collection in Afghanistan. Specific funding levels are only mentioned for rule of law programs. Funding from ESF and INCLE accounts for Afghanistan is contingent on corruption, human rights, and sustainability conditions, with $10 million allocated (and $7.5 million for Pakistan). The FY2016 enacted legislation includes an unprecedented level of OCO-designated foreign operations funds for Pakistan and Afghanistan, with little guidance provided. The budget request also includes a significant increase in funding to bolster Ukraine, Moldova, and Georgia against Russian aggression and pressure. Specifically, $513.5 million was allocated for Ukraine to promote economic reforms and advance democracy. The FY2016 enacted legislation allocated significant funds to Ukraine, Moldova, and Georgia to promote economic reforms, democracy, and security. H.R. 2772 included $524 million for security and economic stability assistance to Ukraine, as well as funds for broadcasting to counter Russian propaganda. Foreign Military Financing was also provided to address military equipment shortfalls and improve interoperability with NATO. The Senate bill, S. 1725, allocated funds for Ukraine, Georgia, and Moldova to counter Russian influence. The bill included $47 million for Ukraine, $20 million for Georgia, and $12.75 million for Moldova. Additional funding from various programs would bring total assistance to Ukraine to $513.5 million. The bill provides $658 million for Ukraine assistance and funds for Eastern Partnership countries to implement trade agreements with the EU, reduce vulnerability to Russian pressure, and support democracy. Additionally, the bill authorizes the use of funds to support loan guarantees for Ukraine. The Administration's FY2016 proposal included $1 billion for Central America, a notable shift in regional funding. The request for funding for Central America was 225% more than the FY2014 level, aimed at promoting economic prosperity, security, and good governance to reduce undocumented migration. The primary recipients would have been El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras, with $287 million allocated for the Central American Regional Security Initiative. The bill emphasized security concerns in the region, allocating $296.5 million for CARSI and additional assistance for Mexico's southern border security. Non-security assistance for the three countries was not specified. In S.Rept. 114-79, Senate appropriators detailed $675.3 million in foreign operations funds allocated to implement the Plan of the Alliance for Prosperity in the Northern Triangle of Central America. Specific allocations included $231.5 million for CARSI, $84 million for security and military assistance, and $360 million for development and health programs in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras. H.R. 2029/P.L. 114-113 provides up to $750 million in assistance to implement the U.S. Strategy for Engagement with Central America, with $222 million allocated for CARSI. $222 million is allocated for CARSI in the Triangle by unaccompanied minors. The funding breakdown is in Section 7045 of the explanatory statement."
