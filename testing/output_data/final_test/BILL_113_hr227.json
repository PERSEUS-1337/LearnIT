    "content": "The \"Buyback Our Safety Act\" is the short title of the Act. It establishes a Gun Buyback Grant Program. The Attorney General will establish a gun buyback grant program to assist law enforcement agencies in funding programs where guns are purchased or surrendered. Agencies must submit applications for grants to the Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Justice Programs. The Assistant Attorney General may grant funds to law enforcement agencies for gun buyback programs, with specific requirements such as public advertising, administration by law enforcement personnel, and safeguards against fraud. The Assistant Attorney General may grant funds to law enforcement agencies for gun buyback programs, with requirements including testing purchased guns on-site before payment and destroying all guns received. Law enforcement agencies must match federal funds with cash or in-kind goods from non-federal sources to be eligible for the grant. The matching requirement can be waived by the Assistant Attorney General. The Attorney General will work with the National Academy of Sciences to develop standards for identifying guns likely used in violent crimes and set pricing for purchasing these guns through gun buyback programs funded by grants. Law enforcement agencies receiving grants must report on their gun buyback programs. Law enforcement agencies receiving grants for gun buyback programs must submit reports on the number and types of guns collected and destroyed, along with recommendations for future programs. A final report is required within 90 days after the program ends. The Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Justice Programs must submit annual reports to Congress on the number of gun buyback programs funded, guns received, total guns purchased, and recommendations for program improvement. Definitions for this section include the meaning of \"State\" as each of the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and other territories, \"unit of local government\" as a local governing body below the state level, and \"violent crime\" as specific offenses reported by the FBI. $15,000,000 is authorized for fiscal years 2014 through 2018 for implementation."
