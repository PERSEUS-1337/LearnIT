The country's strategic location has made it a transshipment point for cocaine and a refueling stopover for trans-Atlantic air traffic. U.S.-Cabo Verdean cooperation focuses on counternarcotics efforts, military professionalization, and development projects. Cabo Verde, a small volcanic island archipelago located off the coast of Senegal in West Africa, is slightly larger than Rhode Island. Most of the islands are wind-eroded, mountainous, and arid, with recurrent water shortages posing a challenge for food production. The country has few natural resources but relies on its large maritime zone and beaches for tourism. Congressional activity with Cabo Verde mainly involves high-level meetings during periodic delegations. Cabo Verde, discovered by Portugal in the 15th century, was later colonized and used as a slave trading center until 1975. Most Cabo Verdeans are of mixed Portuguese and African descent and speak a Portuguese-African Creole. The country's location as a key ship resupply center for U.S. vessels led to a tradition of emigration to the United States, with a large Cabo Verdean population in New England. Expatriates play a significant role in the country's political system, with their remittances being a key source of private investment and hard currency. Cabo Verde transitioned from a one-party state to a democracy in 1991, following demands for a multi-party system. The African Party for the Independence of Cabo Verde (PAICV) and the Movement for Democracy (MPD) dominate politics, with expatriate voters participating in elections. The MPD strongly influences Cabo Verde's politics, with expatriate voters electing six parliamentarians. The party's economic reform-focused agenda includes privatizing state-owned firms, reforming public spending, alleviating poverty, and promoting exports. The MPD also aims to increase political pluralism and trade relations with other countries. In the 2016 parliamentary elections, the MPD won 40 seats, while the PAICV won 29. In March 2016, the MPD won 40 seats in the parliamentary elections, ending 15 years of PAICV majorities. MPD leader Ulisses Correia e Silva became Prime Minister, focusing on economic growth, poverty reduction, infrastructure improvements, FDI, crime reduction, and national security. In October 2016, President Jorge Carlos Fonseca, of the MPD, won reelection with 74% of the vote. Voter turnout was low at 35%. In the 2016 parliamentary elections, Fonseca faced no major opponent and won with 74% of the vote. Presidential elections in Cabo Verde are significant as the president holds appointment and legislative veto powers, commands the armed forces, and represents the Republic domestically and abroad. Fonseca first won the presidency in 2011 in a run-off following a four-candidate first-round vote. Cabo Verde has a better record on rule of law and human rights compared to other African countries, with civil rights widely respected. Cabo Verde has a strong record on civil rights and low corruption levels compared to other African countries. It is classified as a lower-middle-income economy with a per capita GNI of $3,280 in 2015. The country ranks relatively high in human development and economic freedom indices. Cabo Verde successfully met all U.N. Millennium Development Goals, particularly in health and primary education. Cabo Verde has achieved success in health, education, gender equality, and poverty eradication. Despite challenges in rural areas, the country has high literacy rates and social service indicators. Economic growth has been slow due to weak European markets, but tourism and foreign investment have boosted growth, with GDP increasing from 0.93% in 2012 to 3.63% in 2016. Unemployment has decreased to 9% from 16.8% in 2012. The poverty rate in Cabo Verde has decreased to 9% from a high of 16.8% in 2012, with youth still facing higher rates. Economic challenges contributed to the PAICV's election defeat in March 2016. The government is working to diversify aid and trade partnerships, reduce dependence on Europe, and prioritize agricultural growth. Poverty has decreased since the 1990s, with 27% living in poverty in 2010. Tourism in Cabo Verde has grown rapidly, reaching a record 569,000 arrivals in 2015. Despite concerns of a slowdown in 2016 due to the Zika virus, tourism continued to drive the country's growth. Analysts warn of a potential decrease in tourism in the short term, attributed to sluggishness in Europe and a projected slowdown in the United Kingdom. In 2007, the European Union established a \"Special Partnership\" with Cabo Verde focusing on trade, investment, and efforts to combat illicit migration and organized crime. Cabo Verde is focusing on bilateral ties with the United States, European states, and Portuguese-speaking countries. They received $13 million in aid from Angola for infrastructure enhancements. The country faces challenges with illicit narcotics transshipment and maritime security. Former President Pires was recognized for transforming Cabo Verde into a model of democracy and stability. Cabo Verde, a model of democracy and stability, has friendly relations with the United States. President Fonseca participated in the 2014 U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit and former President Obama met with Cabo Verdean leaders to discuss governance and economic growth. Michelle Obama met with Ligia Fonseca in Cabo Verde during a stop-over in 2016. Cabo Verde participates in the Young African Leaders Initiative. The future of bilateral relations under the Trump Administration or the 115th Congress is uncertain. Congressional activity related to Cabo Verde is limited to occasional delegations. Legislation specifically focused on Cabo Verde has not been considered by Congress, but the country is mentioned in broader foreign operations bills. Cabo Verde receives development assistance from the Millennium Challenge Corporation and some U.S. security aid. Cabo Verde receives development assistance from the Millennium Challenge Corporation and some U.S. security aid, as well as engages in bilateral security cooperation with the United States and European partners. Despite a positive socio-economic record, Cabo Verde has not received additional bilateral assistance from USAID or the State Department in recent years. Peace Corps closed its Cabo Verde country program in FY2013. Cabo Verde has received substantial U.S. development assistance through two MCC Compacts, totaling $176.2 million. The first Compact was completed in 2010, and the second Compact, focused on water utility projects and land registration system reform, is set to be completed in late 2017. The second MCC Compact in Cabo Verde focuses on reforming the land registration system to make property ownership more secure, especially on islands with high tourism investment potential. The Compact also supports program costs and monitoring and evaluation. The first Compact aimed to transition Cabo Verde to a sustainable, private sector-led growth agenda through various projects like investment climate improvement, financial sector reforms, and infrastructure upgrades. During Compact execution, the MCC adjusted key projects like a major port activity and the establishment of a credit bureau due to planning and cost issues. The government of Cabo Verde may struggle to maintain infrastructure projects long-term due to funding challenges. The US and Cabo Verde have an Open Skies aviation agreement for direct flights between the two countries. Cabo Verde is a minor U.S. trade partner eligible for AGOA tariff preferences. AGOA exports, mainly tuna and fish, increased in 2015 but still only make up a small portion of total exports to the U.S. Total Cabo Verdean exports to the U.S. averaged $2.3 million a year from 2011-2015, compared to $191 million in exports to all countries. Narcotics trafficking is a growing threat in Cabo Verde, with incidents of violence linked to drug investigations. The country's strategic location has made it a key point in the transatlantic narcotics trade, particularly for cocaine destined for Europe from South America. The United States considers maritime security, domain awareness, and border control as top priorities in Cabo Verde. Programs to combat drug trafficking include International Military Education and Training (IMET) and Department of Defense (DOD) support. The State Department has provided aid for law enforcement and counternarcotics efforts. IMET funding was $144,000 in FY2015, with $150,000 estimated for FY2016 and requested for FY2017. Cabo Verde has also received assistance under the West Africa Regional Security Initiative (WARSI). Cabo Verde receives assistance from the United States through programs like the West Africa Regional Security Initiative (WARSI) to combat transnational organized crime, improve criminal justice systems, and promote stability. It also engages in cooperation efforts with the Department of Defense's Africa Command (AFRICOM), hosting multinational military exercises like Saharan Express focused on maritime security, drug interdiction, and anti-arms proliferation training. The most recent Saharan Express took place in April 2015 off Cabo Verdean and Senegalese waters. In 2010, the Counternarcotics and Maritime Security Interagency Operations Center (COSMAR) was established in Cabo Verde with assistance from DOD and other donors. COSMAR serves as a multilateral intelligence and operations fusion center to counter drug trafficking and protect maritime waters in cooperation with U.S. military and law enforcement agencies. The African Maritime Law Enforcement Partnership (AMLEP) conducts cooperative interdiction operations and builds COSMAR's capacities in Cabo Verde. The United States has helped upgrade Cabo Verde's small patrol boat fleet."
