The amendment to Chapter 47 of title 18, US Code introduces a criminal penalty for failing to notify law enforcement of a security breach involving personal information.

The amendment to Chapter 47 of title 18, US Code defines a 'breach' as a security breach involving 10,000 or more individuals' means of identification, Federal Government databases, or data related to national security or law enforcement.

The amendment to Chapter 47 of title 18, US Code defines a 'breach' as a security breach involving 10,000 or more individuals' means of identification, Federal Government databases, or data related to national security or law enforcement. A significant risk of identity theft is determined by a reasonable person after a reasonable opportunity. If the data involved in a suspected breach is encrypted or rendered unusable, there is a presumption that the breach has not caused a significant risk of identity theft, unless facts demonstrate otherwise. Within 180 days of this Act's enactment, the Attorney General and Secretary of Homeland Security will establish rules for notifying individuals of data breaches. The rules will not mandate specific products or technologies for data protection. The rules and regulations for notifying individuals of data breaches will require notifying the United States Secret Service or FBI before informing consumers, with a possible delay if it hinders a criminal investigation or national security. The United States Secret Service or FBI must be notified before informing consumers of data breaches, with possible delays if it impacts criminal investigations or national security. The Secret Service will notify the FBI if the breach involves espionage, foreign counterintelligence, or national defense information. The Secret Service or FBI will also inform the Attorney General in each state. Investigation notifies the Attorney General in each State affected by the breach if the Secret Service or FBI declines to pursue a criminal investigation. Immunity from lawsuit is granted to law enforcement entities or individuals who notify law enforcement of a security breach. Failure to notify under section 1039 of title 18, US Code, incurs a civil penalty of up to $50,000 per day, not exceeding $1,000,000. This requirement does not override State laws. The requirement to notify law enforcement under this section supersedes any other notice required by State law. The notice to law enforcement is in addition to any consumer notice required by State or Federal law after a security breach. Federal agencies must notify of a major security breach as if they were a person under section 1039 of title 18, US Code. Federal agencies must notify the United States Secret Service or Federal Bureau of Investigation of a major security breach in the same way as a person under section 1039 of title 18, US Code. The rulemaking authority includes making rules for this notification. SEC. 8. PENALTIES FOR SECTION 1030 VIOLATIONS. SEC. 8. PENALTIES FOR SECTION 1030 VIOLATIONS.
