    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Rio Puerco Watershed Act of 1994\". The Rio Puerco watershed has experienced extensive ecological changes, including erosion, sedimentation, reduced productivity, loss of biodiversity, riparian areas, and surface water. This damage has significantly impacted the economic and cultural well-being of its inhabitants, leading to the loss of communities and adverse effects on traditions and cultures. The impairment of the Rio Puerco watershed has damaged the ecological and economic well-being of the region, including disruption of ecological processes, water quality impairment, reduced water storage capacity of the Elephant Butte Dam, irrigation system maintenance issues, and increased flood risk. The Rio Puerco is a major tributary of the Rio Grande. The Rio Puerco watershed, a major tributary of the Rio Grande, has been stressed by loss of native vegetation, introduction of exotic species, and habitat alteration. It is a mosaic of different land ownership types with varying management objectives. Effective watershed management requires cooperation among Federal, State, local, and tribal entities. The Secretary of the Interior, in consultation with various entities, is best suited to coordinate management efforts in the Rio Puerco watershed for the benefit of those living in the area and downstream users on the Rio Grande.

SEC. 3. MANAGEMENT PROGRAM. The Secretary of the Interior, through the Bureau of Land Management, will establish a clearinghouse for research and information on management within the Rio Puerco Drainage Basin. This includes an inventory of best management practices and monitoring activities in the Rio Puerco Watershed Project. The Secretary, in consultation with the Rio Puerco Management Committee, will prepare a report with alternatives for improving watershed conditions in the Rio Puerco Drainage Basin. This includes identifying goals and objectives for landowners and managers, as well as potential actions to meet these objectives. The report will recommend alternative actions, best management practices, and costs for improving watershed conditions. It will also suggest voluntary implementation of best practices on public and private lands, cooperative development of management guidelines, and public participation programs for restoring the watershed. The curr_chunk discusses involving private citizens in restoring the watershed, developing proposals for voluntary cooperative programs, encouraging best management practices on private lands, and creating a monitoring system using existing data sources. The curr_chunk outlines the need to provide information for assessing resource and socioeconomic conditions, identifying priority actions, and evaluating the effectiveness of implemented actions. The curr_chunk establishes the Rio Puerco Management Committee. The Rio Puerco Management Committee is established with representatives from various organizations including the Bureau of Land Management, Rio Puerco Watershed Committee, affected tribes and pueblos, National Forest Service, Bureau of Reclamation, Geological Survey, Bureau of Indian Affairs, Fish and Wildlife Service, Army Corps of Engineers, Soil Conservation Service, State of New Mexico, local Soil and Water Conservation Districts. The Rio Puerco Management Committee includes representatives from various organizations and stakeholders such as local Soil and Water Conservation Districts, the Elephant Butte Irrigation District, private landowners, and interested citizens. The committee's duties include advising the Secretary of the Interior on the Rio Puerco Management Program and serving as a forum for information on activities related to best management practices. The Secretary of the Interior, in consultation with the Rio Puerco Management Committee, will provide a biennial report to the Senate and House Committees on Energy and Natural Resources and Natural Resources. The report will include a summary of accomplishments outlined in section 3 and proposals for joint implementation efforts, along with funding recommendations. Additionally, there will be a Lower Rio Grande Habitat Study. The Secretary of the Interior, in cooperation with the State of New Mexico, will conduct a study of the Rio Grande from Caballo Lake to Sunland Park. The study will assess habitat conditions, changes in vegetation over 400 years, and feasibility of preventing habitat loss and restoration. The study will be transmitted to the Committee on Natural Resources within 3 years. The study will be transmitted to the Senate and House Committees on Energy and Natural Resources and Natural Resources, respectively. Authorization of appropriations is granted to carry out this Act."
