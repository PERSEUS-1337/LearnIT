    "content": "The ADAAA, enacted in 2008, amended the ADA to provide broader protection against discrimination for individuals with disabilities. It rejected previous court interpretations and reinstated a broad scope of coverage for individuals with disabilities. The key issue in any ADA case is determining if the individual has a disability. The ADA Amendments Act broadened the ADA's coverage by rejecting previous court interpretations and reinstating a broad scope of protection for individuals with disabilities. It expanded the definition of disability to include impairments that substantially limit major life activities, regardless of mitigating measures. The EEOC issued final regulations implementing these changes on March 25, 2011. The ADA Amendments Act expanded the definition of disability to include impairments that substantially limit major life activities, regardless of mitigating measures. The act also introduced new rules of construction to interpret the definition of disability broadly. The ADA Amendments Act broadened the definition of disability to include impairments that substantially limit major life activities, regardless of mitigating measures. It clarified that an impairment need not limit all major life activities to be considered a disability and that episodic impairments are also covered. The Act aimed to counteract previous court decisions that had narrowed the scope of the ADA. The EEOC issued final ADAAA regulations on March 25, 2011, which will become effective on May 24, 2011. The final regulations streamlined the organization of the proposed regulations and moved many examples to the appendix. The EEOC notes that the appendix will be published in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) and will guide the Commission in resolving charges of employment discrimination under the ADA. The final ADAAA regulations, effective May 24, 2011, provide clarifications on the ADA, including defining major life activities, interpreting impairments, coverage of transitory impairments, mitigating measures, and the \"regarded as\" prong. The regulations list examples of major life activities. The final ADAAA regulations, effective May 24, 2011, provide clarifications on the ADA, including defining major life activities and bodily functions. The EEOC includes additional examples such as sitting, reaching, and special sense organs. The regulations emphasize that the ADAAA requires accommodation for individuals with disabilities. The EEOC emphasizes that the ADAAA requires an individualized assessment for determining disabilities. The final regulations list impairments that are almost always considered disabilities, including deafness, blindness, intellectual disability, missing limbs, autism, cancer, and mental health disorders like major depressive disorder and schizophrenia. The focus should be on how a major life activity is substantially limited, not on what outcomes an individual can achieve. The final regulations provide rules for determining if an impairment substantially limits a major life activity, with the term \"substantially limits\" broadly construed. The ADAAA states that an impairment in remission is still considered a disability if it would limit a major life activity when active. The EEOC regulations state that the duration or frequency of episodic impairments is no longer relevant in determining if it substantially limits a major life activity. Mitigating measures cannot be considered when assessing the impact of an impairment, except for ordinary eyeglasses and contact lenses. Negative side effects of mitigating measures may also be taken into account. The EEOC regulations state that mitigating measures cannot be required by a covered entity, but not using them may affect job qualifications. The ADAAA includes the \"regarded as having an impairment\" prong, which applies if an individual is subjected to discrimination due to a perceived impairment. The \"regarded as\" prong under the ADA does not apply to transitory or minor impairments lasting six months or less. The EEOC regulations encourage using this prong when reasonable accommodation is not needed. A covered entity can challenge a claim under this prong by showing the impairment is transitory and minor or that the individual is not qualified or poses a direct threat. Defense that an impairment is transitory and minor is only available under the \"regarded as\" prong. The rules of construction state that an impairment lasting fewer than six months can be substantially limiting under the \"regarded as\" prong."
