    "content": "The U.S. and Afghan governments, along with partner countries, are engaged in combat with a robust Taliban-led insurgency. Insurgents are in control of or contesting more territory today than at any point since 2001. The conflict also involves other armed groups, including affiliates of Al Qaeda and the Islamic State. NATO-led mission \"Resolute Support Mission\" focuses on training Afghan forces, while U.S. counterterrorism forces continue combat operations. The U.S. is also engaged in diplomatic efforts to end the war. The United States is actively engaged in diplomatic efforts to end the war in Afghanistan, including direct talks with Taliban representatives. A draft framework was reached in January 2019, where the Taliban would prohibit terrorist groups in exchange for the eventual withdrawal of U.S. forces. Concerns exist that the U.S. may prioritize military withdrawal over a comprehensive political settlement. Afghan politics remain unsettled, with inconclusive parliamentary elections in October 2018 adding complexity to the situation. The Afghan government faces criticism for its failure to ensure security and prevent insurgent gains despite progress in reducing corruption. The United States has provided significant aid to Afghanistan, but stability remains uncertain. Some hope that the country's natural resources and strategic location could improve its economic prospects. The Afghan government's failure to ensure security and prevent insurgent gains despite progress in reducing corruption has led to uncertainty in the country's stability. President Trump's new South Asia strategy initially showed renewed U.S. commitment, but direct talks with the Taliban without Afghan government involvement marked a significant policy reversal. In a significant policy reversal, the U.S. appointed Zalmay Khalilzad as Special Representative for Afghanistan Reconciliation, leading talks with the Taliban in Doha. The Taliban committed to preventing Afghanistan from being a terrorist platform in exchange for U.S. troop withdrawal. Khalilzad announced progress on counterterrorism and troop withdrawal in talks with the Taliban. He mentioned ongoing work on issues like intra-Afghan dialogue and a ceasefire. The Taliban will engage in intra-Afghan negotiations after finalizing the agreement. Kabul is not directly involved in the U.S.-Taliban negotiations. Former U.S. Ambassador Ryan Crocker criticized the exclusion of the Afghan government in U.S.-Taliban negotiations, warning that it delegitimizes the government. Afghan President Ashraf Ghani expressed concerns about any settlement that limits Afghan rights and warned of potential catastrophe if Kabul is not included in talks, citing past civil strife. Ghani's national security advisor accused Khalilzad of delegitimizing the Afghan government. The Afghan government has expressed concerns about being excluded from U.S.-Taliban negotiations, with President Ghani warning of potential catastrophe if Kabul is not included. There is a policy divergence between the U.S. and Afghan government, with the Taliban showing some conciliatory signs but many Afghans, especially women, remain wary due to past experiences with Taliban rule. The unsettled state of Afghan politics is complicating current negotiations. The national unity government in Afghanistan, led by President Ashraf Ghani and CEO Abdullah Abdullah, faces challenges amidst increasing political fragmentation along ethnic lines. The 2018 parliamentary elections were marred by issues, and the presidential election was postponed. Political upheavals challenge Ghani's government, with concerns about exclusion from U.S.-Taliban negotiations. The presidential election in Afghanistan, initially set for April 2019, has been delayed twice until September 2019. Speculation arises about the delays being linked to U.S.-Taliban talks, with the possibility of an interim government formation. NATO's Resolute Support Mission focuses on training Afghan forces, while U.S. combat operations have increased since 2017 under Operation Freedom's Sentinel. Since 2017, Operation Freedom's Sentinel (OFS) has involved around 14,000 U.S. troops in Afghanistan, with approximately 8,500 part of the Resolute Support Mission (RSM). The conflict has been described as \"largely stalemated\" by U.S. military officials, despite the Taliban's steady territorial gains. As of October 2018, the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR) reported that 53.8% of districts were under government control or influence, marking a decline from previous reports. In 2015, 12% of districts were under insurgent control, with 34% contested. The U.S. military no longer produces district-level stability assessments in Afghanistan. Taliban still conduct high-profile attacks and show tactical capabilities. Reports indicate that ANDSF fatalities have averaged 30-40 a day in recent months, with over 45,000 security personnel killed since September 2014. Insider attacks on U.S. and coalition forces by Afghan nationals remain a sporadic but persistent issue. General Miller survived an attack by a Taliban infiltrator in October 2018, which resulted in casualties among provincial officials. U.S. operations also target the Islamic State affiliate, ISKP, although the threat level posed by the group is debated. The Islamic State affiliate in Afghanistan, known as ISIS-K, is a debated threat. ISKP has claimed responsibility for large-scale attacks targeting Afghanistan's Shia minority. Al Qaeda, although degraded, remains a longer-term threat. The security of Afghanistan relies on the effectiveness of the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces (ANDSF), which has received significant funding from the United States and its partners. The Afghan National Defense and Security Forces (ANDSF) receive funding from the United States, U.S. partners, and the Afghan government. Concerns include absenteeism, high attrition rates, illiteracy, human rights abuses, and unsustainable casualty rates. Key performance metrics are classified by U.S. Forces-Afghanistan, raising concerns among some Members. In February 2017, General Nicholson mentioned a shortfall of troops in Afghanistan. President Trump delegated authority to Secretary Mattis to deploy around 3,500 additional troops in September 2017, bringing the total to 14,000. Reports suggest Trump may consider withdrawing some troops, but no decision has been made yet. In February 2019, U.S. officials stated no decision has been made to reduce forces in Afghanistan. The Senate passed S. 1, warning against a hasty withdrawal from Afghanistan and Syria. U.S. forces now have broader authority to target Taliban operations, including drug labs. The U.S. campaign to degrade Taliban's narcotics revenue ended in late 2018. Poppy cultivation in 2018 was the second-highest since 1994. Pakistan's negative role in Afghan affairs is highlighted by President Trump and Afghan leaders. Pakistan's role in Afghanistan's insurgency is debated, with some experts suggesting ties to insurgent groups like the Haqqani Network. The U.S. has identified militant safe havens in Pakistan as a threat to Afghan security, but some question this claim. Pakistan may prefer a weak Afghanistan to a strong, unified state, but instability in Afghanistan could also impact Pakistan. Pakistan's struggle with indigenous Islamist militants and the presence of a large Afghan refugee population complicates Afghanistan-Pakistan relations. The border dispute and the desire for strategic depth against India further add to the complexity. President Trump's 2017 speech highlighted concerns about Pakistan's safe havens for terrorist organizations. India's interest in Afghanistan is driven by its rivalry with Pakistan, hindering efforts to establish stronger relations with Central Asia. The Trump Administration criticized Pakistan for harboring terrorist organizations but also praised it as a valued partner. Security assistance to Pakistan was suspended in 2018. General Votel acknowledged Pakistan's lack of action against extremist safe havens but praised some positive steps. Afghanistan maintains cordial ties with Central Asia, but instability may complicate relations. Instability in Afghanistan may complicate relations with Central Asia. U.S. commanders warn of increased assistance to the Taliban from Russia and Iran. Both nations view the Taliban as leverage against the U.S. China also sees Afghanistan as a growing priority. President Trump did not mention Iran or Russia in his speech, leaving uncertainty about the U.S. approach towards them. Afghanistan is becoming a priority for China in its broader aspirations. President Trump encouraged India to play a greater role in Afghan economic development, raising Pakistani concerns over Indian activity in Afghanistan. Despite being the largest regional contributor to Afghan reconstruction, India has not shown interest in deepening defense ties with Kabul. Afghanistan's economy, crucial for long-term stability, has been hindered by decades of war, stunting domestic industries like mining. Aid cutbacks and political uncertainty post-2014 led to a slowdown in GDP growth, but there has been a slight recovery since 2015. Since 2015, Afghanistan has seen a slight economic recovery with growth between 2% and 3% in 2016 and 2017. However, the poverty rate has increased to 55% in 2016-2017 from 38% in 2012-2013, complicating the situation. A severe drought in northern and western Afghanistan has worsened economic and humanitarian challenges. Progress has been made in areas like human trafficking, religious freedom, and women's rights since 2001, but future prospects are uncertain. Congress has allocated over $132 billion in aid for Afghanistan since FY2002, with majority for security and development. The Administration's FY2020 budget requests $4.8 billion for the ANDSF and $400 million in Economic Support Funds. The FY2020 budget requests $4.8 billion for the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces (ANDSF), $400 million in Economic Support Funds, and smaller amounts for tasks like combating narcotics trafficking. Total funding for Afghanistan has decreased from about $5.5 billion in FY2018 to $4.8 billion in the current request. The cost of U.S. combat operations in Afghanistan since FY2001 is estimated at $745 billion, with $45 billion requested for each of FY2018 and FY2019. The Pentagon identified $18.6 billion in direct war costs in Afghanistan for FY2020. Insurgent and terrorist groups in Afghanistan have shown significant capabilities in recent years, highlighting the security challenges faced by the Afghan government and its international partners. Despite hopes for a negotiated settlement, the outcome remains uncertain. U.S. policy aims to compel the Taliban to engage in peace talks by demonstrating the futility of continued military conflict. However, with the Taliban's recent battlefield successes, some believe the group has little incentive to pursue peace negotiations. The Taliban's recent battlefield successes have led to doubts about their willingness to engage in peace talks. President Ghani has expressed concerns about the Afghan military's sustainability without U.S. financial support. Political dynamics in Afghanistan could pose a threat to stability, regardless of the Taliban's military capabilities. A potential collapse of the Afghan military or government could have significant implications for the United States. The breakdown of social order in Afghanistan could lead to the country fracturing into fiefdoms controlled by paramilitary commanders, similar to the situation almost thirty years ago after the Soviet Union dissolved. This could have implications for the United States due to negotiated security arrangements. The Taliban, who control most of Afghanistan, have clashed with the Afghan Islamic State affiliate. The future may bring changes in extremist group alliances, potentially affecting U.S. interests. After 17 years of war, U.S. policymakers may reconsider what constitutes victory in Afghanistan. The current stalemate could continue, with varying levels of U.S. engagement needed. The debate over the U.S. military presence in Afghanistan continues, with some arguing for sustained commitment while others question the necessity and cost. The Trump Administration's policy aims to prevent terrorist attacks on the U.S. originating from Afghanistan, but critics challenge this reasoning as a justification for endless war. They argue that the focus on military efforts is disproportionate, given the low terror threat to Americans. The debate over the U.S. military presence in Afghanistan continues, with some arguing for sustained commitment while others question the necessity and cost. Critics challenge the Trump Administration's policy, arguing that the focus on military efforts is disproportionate given the low terror threat to Americans. In light of internal political dynamics in Afghanistan, Members of Congress may examine how the U.S. can leverage its assets to encourage more effective governance and shape potential negotiations around amending the constitution. Core issues for Congress include authorizing funds and overseeing U.S. actions in Afghanistan. Core issues for Congress include authorizing funds and overseeing U.S. military activities, aid, and regional policy implementation."
