    "content": "The \"Drug-Free Indian Health Service Act of 2016\" mandates random drug testing for certain employees of the Indian Health Service. The Secretary must implement regulations for a mandatory random drug testing program for covered employees of the Indian Health Service within 90 days of the Act's enactment. The testing program must comply with specific guidelines and regulations. The Secretary must ensure covered employees are tested annually for specific drugs and provide notice of a mandatory random drug testing program at least 90 days before implementation. Covered employees can submit medical documentation for lawful drug use. The Secretary must notify covered employees selected for random drug testing, ensuring they are chosen randomly and not suspected of drug use. Employees can defer testing if on leave or official travel. The Secretary may take disciplinary action upon finding illegal drug use. The Secretary can determine illegal drug use in covered employees through positive test results, direct observation, evidence from arrest or admission. Mandatory administrative action follows if illegal drug use is confirmed. The Secretary can prohibit covered employees from providing healthcare or administrative services if illegal drug use is confirmed, and refer them to the Employee Assistance Program. Employees may return to duty after counseling or rehabilitation. Adverse actions are subject to subsection (g). The Secretary can take adverse action, including removal, against covered employees found to have engaged in illegal drug use, except if they voluntarily admit to it, stop using drugs, and seek counseling or rehabilitation through the Employee Assistance Program. Refusal to submit to random drug testing has disciplinary consequences. If a covered employee refuses random drug testing, the Secretary can prohibit them from healthcare activities and may initiate adverse action, including removal. The employee has the right to due process and can appeal the action to the Merit Systems Protection Board. No additional funds are authorized for this purpose. (j) Definitions.--For purposes of this section, a \"covered employee\" refers to an individual employed at an Indian Health Service health care facility, providing health care or administrative services to patients, excluding officers of the Commissioned Corps of the United States Public Health Service.
