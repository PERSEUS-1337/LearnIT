SEC. 3. CABIN USER FEES. Cabin owners must pay an annual user fee set by the Secretary. Initial fees are established based on lot values and adjusted for price changes. The Homebuilders/Wells Fargo Housing Opportunity Index establishes tiers based on lot values, with the lowest assigned to tier 1 and the highest to tier 10. Second appraisals override initial values for ranking. Incomplete appraisals cannot be used for fee tier assignment. The Secretary will assess an interim fee for permitted cabin lots until assigned to a tier, based on the lesser of $5,000 or the current cabin user fee determined under the Cabin User Fee Fairness Act of 2000, with an annual increase limit of 25 percent. The initial cabin user fees, determined based on assignments, are as follows. Tier 1: 5% of permits, $500\nTier 2: 12% of permits, $1,000\nTier 3: 22% of permits, $1,500\nTier 4: 22% of permits, $2,000\nTier 5: 10% of permits, $2,500 Tier 6: 9% of permits, $3,000\nTier 7: 7% of permits, $3,500\nTier 8: 5% of permits, $4,000\nTier 9: 5% of permits, $4,500\nTier 10: 3% of permits, $5,000 The Secretary must complete the current appraisal cycle within 3 years of the enactment of the Act. Initial cabin user fees will start in the first calendar year after the completion of the cycle. Annual adjustments to cabin user fees will be based on changes in the Implicit Price Deflator for the Gross Domestic Product. The Secretary can reduce the cabin user fee to $100 per year if the cabin is destroyed, substantially damaged, or access is significantly impaired. This reduced fee will be in effect until the cabin can be lawfully reoccupied and normal access is restored. SEC. 4. PAYMENT OF CABIN TRANSFER FEES. The cabin owner transferring the cabin must pay a $1,200 transfer fee to the Secretary for a new authorization. SEC. 5. RIGHT OF APPEAL AND JUDICIAL REVIEW. The cabin owner has the right to appeal a determination of a new cabin user fee or fee tier under specific regulations. They can also seek judicial review in a United States district court for contesting a final decision made by the Secretary.
