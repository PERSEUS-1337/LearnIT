    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Prioritizing Debt Reduction in U.S. Foreign Assistance Act of 2013\". Definitions are provided in the Act. In this Act, \"appropriate congressional committees\" refer to specific committees in the Senate and House of Representatives. \"Major foreign debt holder\" is a foreign country holding over $500 billion in US Treasury securities. \"United States Treasury securities\" are obligations issued by the US under chapter 31 of title 31, US Code. SEC. 3. FINDINGS. Congress finds that the Federal debt of the United States is approximately $17 trillion, with Admiral Mike Mullen stating it as the biggest threat to national security. A significant portion of this debt is held by foreign governments, some of which receive direct foreign assistance from the US. Foreign holdings of US Treasury securities exceeded $4 trillion in December 2012, leading to a downgrade in the US sovereign credit rating by Standard and Poor's in August 2011. The United States long-term sovereign credit was downgraded from AAA to AA+ due to excessive borrowing and unsustainable spending levels. The sense of Congress is that the growing Federal debt jeopardizes national security and economic stability, and paying money owed to foreign debt holders is a better use of taxpayer dollars than providing foreign assistance. The policy of the United States is to prohibit further foreign assistance to major debt holders and address the unsustainable Federal debt. A new section prohibits assistance to major foreign debt holders in the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961. The policy of the United States is to prohibit further foreign assistance to major debt holders in order to address the unsustainable Federal debt. The Act prohibits providing assistance to foreign countries holding over $500 billion in US Treasury securities, with exceptions for emergencies and humanitarian needs. The Secretary of State can waive the prohibition if it's in the national security interests of the US. The term 'appropriate congressional committees' refers to specific committees in the Senate and House of Representatives. The term 'United States Treasury securities' refers to obligations issued by the United States under chapter 31 of title 31, United States Code. SEC. 7. REPORT ON ASSISTANCE TO FOREIGN DEBT HOLDERS.
