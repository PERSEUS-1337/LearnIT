Congress finds that childhood obesity in the United States has reached epidemic proportions, with significant medical costs estimated at $270 billion annually. More than one-third of children and adolescents are overweight or obese, leading to a 23 percent link to sedentary lifestyles and increased risk of chronic diseases. Overweight adolescents have a high chance of becoming overweight adults, impacting their health and life expectancy. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, a significant number of students consider suicide, binge drink, and suffer from mental illness. Studies show that social-psychological support and prevention improve academic achievement, while instruction in personal and social skills reduces risky behaviors. Comprehensive programs linking instruction with health and social services are beneficial. Enhanced school health education programs are essential to reduce absenteeism. Only a small percentage of schools provide daily physical education. Enhanced school health education programs are crucial for developing a health literate society in the US. Physical education is recommended as a core subject to combat childhood obesity and improve academic performance. The White House Task Force on Childhood Obesity Report suggests increasing the quality and frequency of physical education for all students. The Society of Health and Physical Educators recommends 150 minutes per week of physical education for elementary students and 225 minutes per week for middle and high school students. The American school system can reach 50,000,000 children to provide necessary health and physical education. Almost 30 percent of 17-24 year olds are too overweight to serve in the military, highlighting the importance of physical education in combating obesity and improving military readiness. Physical education and health education are essential in combating obesity and improving military readiness, serving as key components in educating the whole child. The Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 is amended to include physical education and health education in assessments, allowing each state to determine the best way to assess students in these subjects according to state standards. The Carol M. White Physical Education Program is amended to authorize the program under section 5503. The Secretary can award grants to support physical education programs for K-12 students, including materials, equipment, staff training, fitness education, and motor skills instruction. The physical education programs aim to enhance students' physical, mental, and social development through activities promoting cognitive concepts, physical fitness, social skills, healthy eating habits, and professional development for teachers. Extracurricular activities like team sports and ROTC are not included in this subpart. The ROTC program activities are not part of the physical education program assisted under this subpart. Authorization of appropriations for fiscal year 2016 and the following 4 years is provided under section 5508 of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965."
