    "content": "The debate over allowing video cameras in courtrooms has been ongoing since the early 20th century. Technological advancements have made video recording less disruptive and more accessible. While the U.S. Supreme Court does not allow cameras in its chamber, some federal courts do permit video recording of proceedings. The Judicial Conference of the United States is considering expanding the use of cameras in lower federal courts. Some judges support video recording in courts, while others have reservations. Members of Congress have introduced measures to enable the use of video cameras in federal courts, with several bills introduced in the 114th Congress. The provisions of these bills vary on different dimensions. The report discusses the use of video cameras in federal courtrooms, highlighting the various dimensions of the debate and considerations for policymakers. It also outlines the legislative proposals before the 114th Congress regarding courtroom cameras. The report discusses legislative proposals before the 114th Congress regarding courtroom cameras, including the Cameras in the Courtroom Act and the Sunshine in the Courtroom Act. It describes current policies of the U.S. Supreme Court and federal courts on video cameras in courtrooms, noting that the Supreme Court does not allow any type of camera in its courtroom. The U.S. Supreme Court prohibits the use of cameras in its courtroom, following the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. Rule 53, added in 1946, prohibits the taking of photographs or broadcasting during judicial proceedings. The Judicial Conference further restricts cameras and broadcasting in federal courtrooms. Supreme Court Justices, while not bound by the Code of Conduct for United States Judges, often adhere to its guidelines, including the stance on cameras in courtrooms. The U.S. Supreme Court prohibits cameras in its courtroom, but possession or use of them is not a criminal act. Cameras could be allowed if rules are amended or Congress passes a statute. Oral arguments are open to the public on a first-come, first-served basis. The Supreme Court reserves seats for guests, journalists, and members of the bar during oral arguments. Transcripts of opinions and audio recordings are posted on the official website, with some high-profile cases having same-day audio releases. Justices have not consistently supported cameras in the courtroom, but some are open to the idea. Some current Supreme Court Justices are open to the idea of cameras in the courtroom, reflecting a greater receptivity compared to their predecessors. While they may consider permitting cameras if their colleagues agree, there is also personal apprehension towards video broadcasting. The Justices are somewhat more supportive of allowing cameras in lower federal courts, recognizing potential benefits but also acknowledging risks. Some Supreme Court Justices are open to the idea of cameras in the courtroom, with some having positive experiences with them in lower courts. Concerns have been raised about the potential impact of videos on the judicial process, such as altering behavior or arguments made during proceedings. Some Supreme Court Justices are open to the idea of cameras in the courtroom, but there are concerns about the potential impact on the decision-making process and judges' ability to remain neutral. The Supreme Court is cautious about introducing new technology and values maintaining the integrity of the courtroom and its proceedings. The Supreme Court has become more accessible through initiatives like posting oral argument audio recordings online. Justices are increasingly willing to speak at public engagements or on television interviews to explain their judicial philosophy. Some federal circuit and district courts allow video recordings under limited circumstances, despite historical prohibitions. In 1948, Congress passed legislation prohibiting recording or broadcasting criminal proceedings in federal courts, supported by the Judicial Conference. Cameras may be allowed for civil cases, but most lower federal courts still do not permit recording or broadcasting. The American Bar Association historically advised against cameras in courtrooms. Since the late 1980s, the Judicial Conference has become more open to allowing cameras in the courtroom for civil proceedings, despite historical discouragement from the American Bar Association. Canon 3A(7) prohibits broadcasting, televising, or recording in the courtroom, with some exceptions. The Judicial Conference has become more open to allowing cameras in the courtroom for civil proceedings, eliminating restrictions and implementing a pilot program from 1991 to 1994. The Judicial Conference conducted a pilot program from 1991 to 1994 to allow television cameras in the courtroom for civil proceedings. Judges initially neutral towards cameras became more supportive by the end of the program. However, concerns about the impact on attorneys' behavior, witness privacy, and public education led to the Judicial Conference voting against expanding camera coverage in district courts in September 1994. The Judicial Conference voted against expanding camera coverage in district courts due to concerns about the intimidating effect on witnesses and jurors. However, two federal appellate courts continued to allow cameras, with the Ninth Circuit Court live-streaming oral argument videos on its website. Another pilot program in 2010 studied cameras in the courtroom, involving fourteen federal district courts. The second study involved posting video footage of district court proceedings online at USCourts.gov. Participating district courts can still allow cameras in their courtrooms. Results are expected in 2016, with the Judicial Conference possibly maintaining its opposition to expanding cameras in courts. Some lower federal courts permit video cameras, but obtaining records of their proceedings may be more challenging than those of the U.S. Supreme Court. Obtaining records of federal circuit and district court proceedings can be challenging. While some federal circuit courts post audio recordings of oral arguments, transcripts are not always available. District court transcripts or audio can be purchased from the court or online. Current federal circuit and district court decisions are free on GPO's United States Courts Opinions collection and court websites. Past years' coverage varies. There is no comprehensive survey of judges' opinions on cameras in courts. A survey of federal circuit and district court judges on their opinions towards cameras in the courtroom reveals a mixed stance. Some judges have experience with cameras, while others do not. Many judges have not expressed a clear opinion on the matter, making it difficult to draw overall conclusions. Various factors are involved in the debate, which policymakers should consider when evaluating related legislation. Congress has significant legislative powers over the federal judiciary, but traditionally defers to the courts for determining their own procedures. Past, current, and proposed cameras-in-the-courtroom programs can illustrate the benefits and drawbacks of such initiatives. Policymakers should consider practical implications and how these policies may be introduced and implemented. The creation of the Judicial Conference in 1922 and the Rules Enabling Act in 1934 established deference to the federal courts. Proponents argue that Congress can legislate judicial administrative matters, including allowing cameras in courtrooms. However, concerns exist about the potential impact on judicial proceedings, with some viewing it as an imprudent exercise of congressional authority. Some argue that Congress should not legislate on judicial procedures, as it may raise constitutional concerns and lead to interbranch tensions. Suggestions have been made to leave the decision on cameras in federal courts to the judiciary. Senator Mike Lee and Justice Clarence Thomas have expressed concerns about potential conflicts between branches if Congress mandates televising judicial proceedings. Some argue that Congress should not legislate on judicial procedures, as it may raise constitutional concerns and lead to interbranch tensions. Suggestions have been made to leave the decision on cameras in federal courts to the judiciary. This approach mirrors the process for the Judicial Conference's pilot programs, wherein courts were selected from volunteers to allow cameras at their discretion. Legislative proposals for cameras in courtrooms often include an opt-out provision for judges to prohibit them if they interfere with due process or safety. Policymakers need to consider the circumstances, scope of exemptions, and who can make these decisions. Congress debates the public and media's access to courtrooms and proceedings as constitutionally-protected rights. Some argue for constitutionally-protected rights for public and media access to court proceedings, while others believe limits may be necessary to preserve procedural fairness. The Sixth Amendment guarantees a public trial, but opinions differ on whether this is a right for the public or a protection for the accused. Proponents of cameras in courtrooms see it as an extension of First Amendment rights. Cameras in the courtroom are seen as an extension of First Amendment rights, providing public access to court proceedings, especially for the Supreme Court. Proponents argue that video coverage is essential for informing the public about court decisions, as television and online videos are major sources of news for Americans. The use of cameras in the courtroom is supported by media outlets and advocacy groups to increase public access to court proceedings. However, the decision to broadcast court information on television news relies on the public's interest and news outlets' competition for viewers and advertisers. While certain high-profile trials attract public attention, less sensational cases may not be televised, raising concerns about the educational value of cameras in the courtroom. The debate over cameras in the courtroom revolves around concerns regarding the potential for cameras to be used for sensationalism and the impact of fast-paced news cycles on judicial reporting. Advocates now propose that court-operated cameras broadcast proceedings on the court's website, as seen in the Federal Judicial Center (FJC) pilot program and many state courts. The use of courtroom cameras is a topic of debate, with some courts and international supreme courts utilizing them. While concerns about biased or limited coverage persist, allowing courts to control the recording and broadcasting can help mitigate potential issues. This approach may provide a fair representation of proceedings and prevent accusations of bias. The use of courtroom cameras is a topic of debate, with concerns about biased coverage. The decision to broadcast live or record proceedings for later release can be intrusive and raise concerns about their effects on ongoing proceedings. The judicial branch was designed to be insulated from public and political pressure, but there is a trend towards greater transparency in American government. Some believe cameras in the courtroom can enhance transparency in judicial proceedings, benefiting Congress, other courts, and the public by providing a complete view of proceedings and promoting consistency in interpretations of past case precedents. Opponents of cameras-in-the-courtroom legislation argue that federal courts are already sufficiently open and transparent due to existing measures for public and media access. They believe that videos in the courtroom would duplicate the current system. Some argue against video broadcasting in courtrooms, stating it would duplicate existing audio and paper records. They propose alternative measures for judicial transparency, such as live-streaming audio, releasing same-day recordings, or allowing journalists to use technology for real-time reporting. However, others believe video provides unique benefits, showing body language and visual cues that other formats cannot capture. Video broadcasting in courtrooms offers unique benefits by capturing body language and visual cues that other formats cannot. It can help observers identify speakers and inform the audience about proceedings during breaks. However, concerns exist about the incomplete picture it provides and the potential disruption it may cause in the courtroom. Concerns exist about the potential disruption cameras may cause in the courtroom due to privacy expectations and their impact on how cases are argued and decided. Technological advancements have made cameras more discreet, but legislation may need to provide procedural protections for courtroom participants and proceedings. The use of high-definition video cameras in courtrooms raises concerns about potential disruptions and privacy issues. While modern cameras are less obtrusive, allowing anyone to film proceedings could create distractions and additional work for judges. Reviewing camera applications and accommodating objections to coverage may also add to the workload of court staff. The use of high-definition video cameras in courtrooms raises concerns about disruptions, privacy issues, and extra workload for judges. Privacy protections for courtroom participants and proceedings are crucial, with policies varying between appellate and initial trial proceedings. Privacy concerns in courtrooms, especially regarding jurors, are important for procedural fairness. Laws have prohibited recording or observing jury deliberations since 1956. Recent measures aim to keep jurors' identities and activities private to prevent outside pressure that could affect their impartiality. Privacy concerns in courtrooms extend to witnesses as well, as the media spotlight and potential public criticism may intimidate them, affecting their testimony. Measures like gag orders and sealed records protect jurors from outside pressure, while witnesses may prefer anonymity when their testimony is not televised. There are concerns about the safety and privacy of judges and lawyers if court proceedings are televised. This could lead to increased expenses for security and protection. Limiting public exposure may help protect these legal professionals from threats of violence. Additionally, broadcasting trials may turn defendants into well-known public figures, impacting their reputation. The publicity from a trial could impact the defendant's ability to receive a fair re-trial or appeal trial. Media exposure may lead to bias among prospective jurors. Concerns exist about privacy violations with video cameras in the courtroom capturing private conversations between attorneys and judges. In courtrooms, privacy concerns arise from video cameras potentially capturing private conversations, leading to worries about due process violations. Courts have implemented measures like obscuring identities, obtaining consent for filming, and allowing judges to block filming for privacy reasons. Some courts require consent from all participants before filming proceedings to address privacy concerns and ensure a fair trial. Adding cameras to the courtroom may impact how cases are argued and decided, potentially leading to charges of procedural unfairness. The concern about video recording altering participants' behavior has existed since the early days of newsreel cameras in courtrooms. The presence of cameras in courtrooms may lead to behavior changes in participants, potentially affecting the fairness of trials. Concerns about altering behavior and causing unfairness have been raised, with some suggesting that the observer effect may come into play. Scholars now recognize that judicial decision-making should be based on case facts, the law, and precedents, rather than external factors like camera presence. Television cameras in courtrooms raise concerns about the influence of public opinion on judicial decision-making and potential changes in behavior by courtroom participants. Similar worries arose when cameras were introduced in Congress, affecting members' behavior and communication with the public. Federal judges, not being elected officials, may perceive their relationship with the public differently. Some believe cameras in courtrooms may improve judicial accountability and professionalism among participants. Legislation has been proposed in Congress to allow video cameras in federal courtrooms, with current bills before the 114th Congress for consideration. The Cameras in the Courtroom Act (H.R. 94, S. 780) introduced in Congress would allow television coverage of Supreme Court proceedings, but not in federal circuit or district courts. The Cameras in the Courtroom Act has been introduced in previous sessions of Congress, allowing television coverage of Supreme Court proceedings. The Sunshine in the Courtroom Act, introduced in the House and Senate, only addresses federal circuit and district courts, not the Supreme Court. The Sunshine in the Courtroom Act allows for media coverage of federal circuit and district court proceedings, with guidelines issued by the Judicial Conference and rules set by the presiding judge. Jurors are protected from media coverage during jury selection and trial, and filming or broadcasting activities can be prohibited if they violate due process rights. District courts must protect witness identities if requested. The Sunshine in the Courtroom Act allows media coverage of federal court proceedings, with guidelines from the Judicial Conference. The Transparency in Government Act (H.R. 1381) introduced in 2015 addresses televising Supreme Court proceedings and expanding access to audio recordings. It is a broader bill than others in the 114th Congress, including changes for the federal judiciary and transparency initiatives for the government. Section 801 of the Transparency in Government Act mirrors the Cameras in the Courtroom Act. The Act includes provisions for televising court proceedings and making oral argument recordings publicly available online. It aligns with the Transparency in Government Act, which requires the Chief Justice to ensure audio recordings are posted on the Supreme Court's website. The previous version of the Act also focused on same-day audio recordings but had different provisions for televised proceedings. The Eyes on the Courts Act (H.R. 3723) addresses televising court proceedings in federal appellate courts, including the Supreme Court and circuit courts. It requires the Judiciary Conference to provide implementation guidelines, with the presiding judge allowing various forms of media coverage during oral arguments. The bill allows for the broadcasting of court proceedings in federal appellate courts, with exceptions made by the presiding judge to protect due process rights. Judges can also opt out if it is not in the interests of justice, with exemptions needing to be issued in writing at least 72 hours before the proceedings. This legislation aims to increase judicial transparency, educate the public about the courts, improve access to proceedings, and expand media coverage. Almost 100 years after its inception, policymakers should consider the underlying goals of policy measures and explore alternative ways to achieve similar objectives. The historical perspective on cameras in the courtroom focused on expanding media access, with journalists playing a crucial role as intermediaries between the public and the courts. If the goal of adding cameras is to enhance media coverage, other policy measures could be considered to improve journalists' ability to cover court proceedings effectively. For instance, at the Supreme Court level, additional measures could enhance the Court's communication channels. At the Supreme Court level, measures to improve communication with journalists include revising press credentialing requirements, using email or social media for announcements, distributing opinions via email, allowing the use of tablets or smartphones for note-taking, and providing wireless Internet in the courthouse. These initiatives aim to enhance media access without the need for cameras in the chambers, meeting the growing expectation for comprehensive online information. The debate over cameras in the courtroom aims to improve public access to information about court proceedings. Suggestions include same-day audio recording releases and live-streamed audio from the Supreme Court. However, challenges similar to those faced by broader broadcasting policies may still arise. Despite the availability of records and open courtrooms, some argue that current measures are sufficient. The federal judiciary may not need legislative action to increase transparency as they have already taken steps to improve access to court proceedings, such as releasing audio recordings in a timely manner and conducting pilot programs on cameras in the courtroom. Other courts have successfully implemented video cameras to record or broadcast proceedings, and the federal judiciary has also experimented with this technology. Safeguards are in place where cameras are allowed in courtrooms. In courtrooms where cameras are permitted, safeguards are in place to maintain judicial integrity and protect the rights of participants. Proponents argue that cameras improve transparency, accountability, and public access to court information. Despite legislative attempts to expand camera use in federal courts, concerns about negative effects persist. The judiciary's important role in American society leads to cautious approaches to changes, especially regarding cameras in the courtroom. The Judicial Conference's pilot program results from 2011-2015 may influence future policies on video broadcasting from federal courts, providing Congress with valuable information. Updates will be made as developments occur."
