    "content": "The \"Code Talkers Recognition Act of 2008\" requires the issuance of medals to honor Native American code talkers for their dedication and valor, expressing Congress's overdue recognition of their service. During World War I, Native Americans without citizenship status enlisted in the Armed Forces and Choctaw code talkers played a crucial role in transmitting vital communications that helped defeat German forces. The Germans were unable to understand the transmissions due to the unique language used by the code talkers. During World War II, the US utilized Native American languages as secret codes to confuse enemies. The Comanche Nation and Navajos were recruited for this purpose, with approximately 50 Comanche men and several hundred Navajos serving in special communication roles. During World War II, Native American code talkers developed unbreakable secret communication methods based on their native languages. In 2001, Congress and President Bush honored Navajo code talkers with congressional gold medals for their contributions as radio operators. Soldiers from various tribes like Assiniboine, Cherokee, Cheyenne, and others also served in similar roles. Native American code talkers from various tribes, including Menominee, Meskwaki, Mississauga, Muscogee, Osage, Pawnee, Sac and Fox, Seminole, and Sioux (Lakota and Dakota), played a crucial role in World War II by using their native languages for secret communication. Congress should recognize all Native American code talkers for their contributions to US victories in both World War I and World War II. SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, a \"code talker\" is defined as a Native American who served in the Armed Forces during a foreign conflict and communicated using a native language. A \"recognized tribe\" includes various Indian tribes such as Assiniboine, Chippewa, Choctaw, Comanche, Cree, Crow, Hopi, Kiowa, Menominee, and Mississauga. The term \"Secretary\" in this Act refers to the Secretary of the Treasury. Native American tribes like Menominee, Mississauga, Muscogee, Sac and Fox, and Sioux are included in the definition of a \"recognized tribe.\" SEC. 5. CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDALS. The Speaker of the House and the President pro tempore of the Senate will arrange for the award of gold medals to Native American code talkers from recognized tribes. The medals will be designed and struck with emblems representing tribal affiliation and participation, considered national medals. The Smithsonian Institution is required to accept and maintain gold medals and silver duplicates from recognized tribes, maintain a list of Native American code talkers, and is encouraged to create an exhibit for Native American veterans. SEC. 6. NATIVE AMERICAN CODE TALKERS. The Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of Defense and recognized tribes, shall determine the identity of each Native American code talker and provide a list to the Smithsonian Institution. They will also assess if non-recognized tribes are eligible for a gold medal. SEC. 7. DUPLICATE MEDALS. The Secretary will strike silver duplicate medals of the gold medals awarded to Native American code talkers for their service in foreign conflicts during the 20th century. Eligibility for the silver duplicate medal is based on serving as a code talker in the Armed Forces. The Secretary may award a silver duplicate medal to the next of kin or personal representative of a Native American code talker who was not previously awarded one. The eligibility for this medal will be determined by the Secretary in accordance with specific regulations. Additionally, bronze duplicate medals may be struck and sold at a price to cover the costs of production. The costs of striking silver duplicate and gold medals under subsection (a) and section 5(b) are expenses that need to be covered. SEC. 8. AUTHORITY TO USE FUND AMOUNTS; PROCEEDS OF SALE. The United States Mint Public Enterprise Fund can be used to pay for the cost of medals struck under this Act. Proceeds from the sale of duplicate bronze medals will go back into the Fund."
