    "content": "President Obama spoke at meetings with Republican Members of the House and Democratic Senators in January and February 2010, respectively. He answered questions from members for approximately 65 minutes in the House meeting and 60 minutes in the Senate meeting. The appearances garnered significant media attention and calls for more regular interactions between the President and Congress. Some proponents see advantages in informal question and answer sessions between the President and Congress. The unofficial nature avoids procedural issues but may lack public interest compared to formal sessions. Senator John McCain expressed interest in a more structured approach if elected President. Senator John McCain proposed a \"question period\" where the President would address Congress, similar to the Prime Minister of Great Britain appearing before the House of Commons. This practice is common in parliamentary systems like the UK. In the US, there have been periodic proposals for executive branch officials to answer questions before Congress. In 1991, Representative Sam Gejdenson proposed a two-hour question period each month in the United States. Various similar proposals have been suggested in the past by Senator Walter Mondale, Representative Estes Kefauver, President Taft, and George Pendleton. Scholars and observers debate the benefits of a question system in Congress, arguing it would improve executive department performance, enhance oversight capabilities, promote inter-branch dialogue, increase public knowledge, and strengthen Congress's position relative to the President. The report surveys how question periods are conducted in parliamentary democracies, examines previous proposals for question periods in the United States, considers advantages and disadvantages, and outlines legislative considerations for implementing a question period in Congress. It also analyzes possible options for structuring a question period and its potential effects on legislative-executive relations. An initial examination of question period practices in parliamentary democracies, including Question Time in Britain, Question Period in Canada, Question Hour in Germany, and Oral and Government Questions in France, as well as historical proposals for a question period in the United States. The British Parliament's question period process involves MPs submitting questions to Ministers to seek information about government actions and policies. Question Time in Great Britain, dating back to 1721, allows for opposition party scrutiny and governing party defense of current policy. It serves as a means of constituent service, with Members posing detailed written questions to Ministers regarding specific casework concerns. The system has evolved over 300 years, with some procedures based on custom rather than written rule. The modern format of question time in Great Britain was largely established by 1965, with gradual restrictions on the number of questions and time available. Members submit questions in advance to the Table Office, specifying if they require an oral or written response. They are limited to two oral questions per day and no more than eight in a 10-day period. Written questions are categorized as ordinary or named, with no deadline for ordinary questions. Written questions in the British Parliament are categorized as ordinary or named, with named questions requiring a response within a set period. Despite restrictions on the number of questions Members can submit, there has been a sharp increase in the total number of questions since 1970. Most MPs are active questioners, with written questions being far more common than oral questions. Since 1970, there has been a sharp increase in the total number of questions in the British Parliament, with over 74,000 questions in 2006-2007. Department Ministers appear daily in Parliament to answer questions on a rotating basis, with each Minister appearing about once every four weeks. Members must submit oral questions three days in advance, which are published in the Notice Paper for preparation. Members in the British Parliament have three days to prepare their oral questions, which are drawn at random and numbered for oral response. The time for oral questions fills about one hour each day Monday through Thursday when the House of Commons is in session. Cabinet Ministers may appear for the entire hour, while others may only appear for part of the hour. Question Time in the British Parliament occurs every Wednesday at noon, with a 30-minute block reserved for questions to the Prime Minister. The Speaker chairs the session, and questions are asked in a predetermined order. The Minister responds with a prepared answer, and supplementary questions follow. The Speaker ensures that answers are relevant and not used for speeches. During Question Time in the British Parliament, the Speaker allows for supplementary questions after the initial answer is given. The Speaker decides when to stop accepting supplementary questions and moves on to the next printed question. Ministers are not required to answer a question and may decline to do so without providing a reason. In the British Parliament, ministers may occasionally decline to answer oral questions if a formal response is forthcoming or for national security reasons. The Speaker can rule out questions on certain topics like the Royal Family or defense. Urgent Questions can be asked in emergencies with short notice, determined by the Speaker. In the British Parliament, ministers may decline to answer oral questions for various reasons. Parliament experimented with \"topical questions\" in 2007, allowing MPs to ask supplementary questions on any topic. Written responses are common for questions asked of Ministers, with oral questions accounting for a small percentage. The Prime Minister answers questions in Parliament every Wednesday at noon. The Prime Minister answers oral questions in Parliament every Wednesday at noon, with procedures differing from other Ministers. Questions typically focus on his engagements for the day, allowing for a lively and unscripted debate on government policies. The Prime Minister answers oral questions in Parliament every Wednesday at noon, with procedures differing from other Ministers. The use of \"open\" questions allows for a lively debate on timely policies, but critics argue it leads to partisan debates and lacks depth in scrutiny. This system is a relatively new development in British Question Time. The tradition of Prime Minister's questions being put last in the order as a courtesy to William Gladstone became custom. In 1961, a separate time period for questioning the Prime Minister was established. Question periods in parliamentary democracies vary in structure and effectiveness, with customs playing a significant role. The Canadian House of Commons Question Period is similar to British Question Time but has important differences. The Canadian Parliament's Question Period is similar to British Question Time but differs in key aspects. Oral questions are asked without advance notice, allowing for spontaneity. Ministers must attend daily, and any Minister can answer any question posed. The Speaker remains nonpartisan and lacks authority. Question Period in Canada allows opposition parties to question the government. The lead opposition party gets the first three questions, while smaller parties get one or two questions. Parties organize the questions and decide which Members will participate. The Speaker calls on Members at his discretion and may allow follow-up questions. Adjournment Proceedings, known as the \"late show,\" complement Question Period in the Canadian Parliament. Parliament enhances Question Period with Adjournment Proceedings, also known as the \"late show.\" Members dissatisfied with answers can request further discussion at the end of the day's legislative business. The Speaker selects up to five petitions for debate, allowing Members to speak for four minutes and Ministers to respond for two minutes. The lively atmosphere includes parliamentary heckling and opinions recorded in the Canadian Hansard. In the Canadian Parliament, Question Period involves opposition members sparring with ministers to elicit embarrassing responses. The arrival of live television coverage in 1977 increased visibility and attendance. The Speaker ruled against traditional desk slamming due to noise. In the Bundestag, up to 180 minutes per week are allotted for Question Hour. In the Bundestag, up to 180 minutes per week are allotted for Question Hour, where deputies can submit oral or written questions for Cabinet Ministers and the Chancellor. Deputies must submit oral questions a week in advance, with the option for urgent questions on short notice. They can also submit up to four written questions per month. The system in Germany includes an \"interpellation\" procedure where a group of deputies can request a special question period if 31 or more deputies sign the petition. The Bundestag in Germany allows for Question Hour where deputies can submit oral or written questions for Cabinet Ministers and the Chancellor. A group of deputies can request a special question period through an \"interpellation\" procedure if 31 or more deputies sign the petition. Major interpellations involve a plenary session debate, while minor interpellations result in a written reply from the government without a debate. The 1958 constitution established the right of Assembly Members to question the government weekly. The Bundestag in Germany allows for Question Hour where deputies can submit oral or written questions for Cabinet Ministers and the Chancellor. Questions are screened by the President's Conference, with 7 minutes allotted for each question. Government question time, on Tuesdays and Wednesdays, covers national and political issues with 5 minutes per question. The process is overseen by the President's Conference, with questions allotted based on party strength. Chamber debate may follow a Minister's response. In the assembly, oral questions are usually followed by one or two supplementals from the Member. Written questions are the main form of inquiries, with Members allowed unlimited submissions. The popularity of written questions has increased in the past two decades, with over 32,000 questions submitted in the 2005-2006 session. Answers are expected within two months and are published in the Journal Officiel. Questions and responses can be submitted electronically and are searchable on the Parliament's website. Various proposals have been made to increase formal contact between Members. Various proposals have been made by American scholars and public officials to increase formal contact between the executive branch and Members of Congress. Most of these proposals suggest a question period for Cabinet members and even the President. During the First Congress, Cabinet members and the President frequently appeared before Congress to consult on policy matters, but this practice declined in the Second Congress. During the Civil War, Representative George H. Pendleton introduced a bill allowing Cabinet Secretaries to debate matters affecting their departments in the House and Senate. The bill required Secretaries to be available for questions two days a week but was never voted upon. In 1881, Pendleton reintroduced the proposal as a Senator. In 1881, Senator Pendleton proposed bringing Cabinet officers into Congress to participate in debates and answer questions, aiming to ensure strong leadership and stimulate abilities for the good of the country. Despite support from senior Senators, the bill was never voted on. President Taft also proposed a similar idea in 1912. President William Howard Taft proposed in 1912 that Cabinet Secretaries be available for questioning and debate in Congress, but his recommendation was not acted upon. Similar proposals were introduced over the next 40 years, aiming to facilitate cooperation between the legislative and executive branches without compromising their independence. In 1943, Representative Kefauver proposed a \"question and report\" period for Cabinet members and officers of independent agencies, where they would appear before the House or Senate to respond to written questions. The proposal received favorable comments and support from the public. In 1943, Representative Kefauver proposed a \"question and report\" period for Cabinet members and officers of independent agencies to appear before Congress. Despite successful meetings between executive branch officials and Congress, opposition from congressional leaders and executive agency heads led to the plan's demise. Senator Walter Mondale later supported similar proposals in the 1970s, but none were adopted. Senator Walter Mondale introduced resolutions in the 93rd and 94th Congresses for weekly question and report periods, allowing agency and department heads to respond to written questions from Senators. Television and radio coverage would have been permitted under guidelines set by the Committee on Rules and Administration. Support for the proposal also came from a subcommittee of the House International Relations Committee. The Special Subcommittee on Investigations conducted hearings on \"Congress and Foreign Policy,\" recommending a limited question period for congressional oversight of national security matters. This proposal suggests a \"question hour\" period for Cabinet officers to answer questions from Members of Congress, aiming to improve relations between the executive and legislative branches. The U.S. Congress is considering a procedure for senior foreign policy officials to appear before each House monthly for question and answer sessions. These sessions would be open or closed based on sensitivity, supplementing the Secretary of State's appearances before standing committees. Other Cabinet officers with foreign policy responsibilities may also appear when requested. The U.S. Congress is considering a monthly question and answer session for senior foreign policy officials, including the Secretary of State, to facilitate dialogue and information flow on important matters of foreign policy and national security. Ground rules would need to be established to balance Congress' right to know and the executive branch's concerns over sensitive information. Representative Sam Gejdenson proposed a two-hour question period each month in 1991. The Gejdenson plan proposed a monthly question and answer session for Cabinet members before Congress. Questions would be submitted in advance and chosen by leaders from submitted questions. Each Member could submit one question per month, and House committees would be prohibited from meeting during the session. H.Res. 155 had 53 cosponsors, but no further action was taken after hearings in March 1992. John McCain proposed a question period before Congress similar to the Prime Minister of Great Britain's appearances before the House of Commons. He did not provide specifics on how it would operate, but implied he would personally appear before Congress. It is unclear if he would have supported past question time proposals. President Obama spoke at meetings with Republican House Members and Democratic Senators, taking questions for approximately 65 and 60 minutes respectively. Questions were asked by individual members, generating significant media attention and calls for continued interactions between the President and Congress. The President and Congress were urged to continue regular interactions, with question and answer sessions held informally. This unofficial approach avoided procedural issues but could lead to problems without formal procedures for selecting questioners or rules for question content. The lack of public interest compared to a formal question period was also noted. Both President Carter and President Clinton were involved in these interactions. President Carter and President Clinton both considered implementing a parliamentary-style question period in Congress to improve public understanding of executive policy and foster better communication between the branches. President Carter expressed support for the idea during his 1976 campaign, while President Clinton contemplated answering questions from Congress after his State of the Union address in 1993. House majority leader Richard Gephardt endorsed the concept after witnessing Clinton's speaking skills. The idea of implementing a question period in Congress to improve communication between branches was considered by Presidents Carter and Clinton. However, negative reactions from congressional leaders prevented the idea from progressing further. Different question period formats vary in their procedures, with key factors being which executive officials answer questions and whether questions and answers are written, oral, or both. Legislators considering a presidential question period must decide on the format, such as oral or written answers. A question period with oral answers only could resemble the Prime Minister's Questions in Britain, generating public interest. On the other hand, a more extensive question period with written answers or Cabinet officials could provide greater oversight and scrutiny of the executive branch. Advocates of adopting a parliamentary-style question period in Congress argue that it will improve oversight, promote inter-branch dialogue, increase public interest in government affairs, and strengthen Congress's institutional position within the government. A question period for Congress could strengthen its institutional position relative to the President by improving accountability through direct access to Cabinet officials. Critics suggest it could address issues of timeliness, access, and shared interests in oversight. This system would allow all Members of Congress to participate in routine oversight, unlike the current committee-based approach. Some congressional committees may limit participation for junior members, leading to concerns about oversight effectiveness. Allowing all Members of Congress to question Cabinet officials could address issues of accountability and oversight. Proponents believe that relationships between agencies and committees in Congress would not hinder serious scrutiny of executive departments. Representative Derrick noted an \"incestuous relationship\" between committees and their oversight areas, where committees may become advocates rather than disciplinarians. In the U.S. Congress, subject specialization often develops through committee membership, but limited positions may restrict expertise in certain areas. Proponents argue that a regular question period in Congress would allow Members to effectively raise concerns about contemporary matters, including administration policies and timely responses to events. This could address the issue of committees not producing timely answers from the executive branch. In the United States, there is a delay in getting the inquiry system through committees running, which can result in crucial time being lost during a crisis. Implementing a question period could help speed up constituent casework and provide a more immediate way for the executive branch to answer questions. In the British parliamentary system, questions submitted for written response are a major means of constituent service for MPs. The British parliamentary system requires quick written responses to questions, improving constituent service for MPs. Implementing this practice in Congress could enhance casework performance, with agency responses published in the Congressional Record for public access. In the British parliament, MPs use written response questions to convey their stance on policies and influence government decisions. For example, an MP's extensive questioning led to a compromise with the Defence Ministry over the closure of an aircraft factory. Advocates believe a question period would increase Cabinet officials' involvement in oversight. In the British parliament, MPs use written response questions to convey their stance on policies and influence government decisions. Advocates believe a question period would increase Cabinet officials' involvement in oversight. Testified that committee chairmen struggle to get Cabinet members to appear before their committees, often sending lower-level staff instead. Scholars suggest that regular public appearances by top Cabinet officials could improve their knowledge of department operations and enhance internal oversight. In the British parliament, question time is seen as a way to hold Cabinet members accountable for their subordinates' actions. It is believed that the fear of facing questions from MPs motivates Ministers to ensure their departments' policies are well defended. Some view question time as a way to instill accountability in civil servants. However, there are concerns that the committee oversight system may be seen as inefficient. The committee oversight system is criticized as procedurally inefficient, with witnesses reading prepared remarks and members asking duplicative questions due to scheduling conflicts. This lack of spontaneous interaction among differing views is a noted issue in the hearing process. Proponents of a question time believe it would improve the relationship between the legislative and executive branches by allowing for more interaction. Currently, there is limited public interaction between Members of Congress and the executive branch, with Cabinet officers mainly testifying before a few committees. A question time would expose Cabinet officers to a wider variety of congressional opinions. A question period for Cabinet officers would increase executive branch accountability to Congress by allowing for direct access to a wider range of congressional opinions. It could also help address member concerns publicly and in a timely manner, showcasing both inefficiencies and successes of executive management. Additionally, gaining popular support in Congress could provide leverage for agency initiatives. Some proponents believe this could strengthen Congress's political power. Some believe that a question period could enhance Congress's political power relative to the executive branch by providing equal footing in public discussion. Representative Gejdenson stated that Congress has lost power due to the President's unified voice dominating debates. A question period could help Congress be heard and engage in clearer debates. Placing Congress on equal footing with the President could strengthen its institutional position and increase public communication between the legislative and executive branches on important issues. Representative Gejdenson highlighted the need for a question period to facilitate clearer debates and engagement between the branches. Supporters of a question period believe it would raise public awareness of contemporary issues and generate increased interest in legislative activity. Experiences in other countries show that question time is popular among the general public and can lead to lively debates, attracting a wider audience to public affairs. Representative Gejdenson proposed adopting a parliamentary-style question period in Congress in December 1990 to raise public awareness about contemporary issues and make Cabinet officials more known to the public. Supporters argue that this would inform the electorate and highlight the authority of Cabinet officials. However, opponents criticize the idea, stating that a question period is not suitable for a non-parliamentary system. Critics argue that a question period is ill-suited for the American system of government due to concerns about intensifying partisanship, undermining the committee system, promoting theatrics, and giving the executive branch an unnecessary forum within Congress. They point out that the structural differences between the American system and parliamentary democracies make a question period unsuitable. In a parliamentary democracy, the President is independently elected and has constitutional authority separate from Congress. The Prime Minister in a parliamentary system derives authority from the majority of the legislature and is responsible to the parliament. Department Ministers in parliamentary systems are drawn from the parliament. In the United States, Members of Congress cannot hold executive branch offices simultaneously. This raises questions about the nature of a question period in the United States. The institutional character of a question period involving the President in the United States differs from a parliamentary question period. Party governance in the US is different from most parliamentary systems, as party cohesion is not necessary to maintain control of the executive branch. Unlike parliamentary systems, the American system does not generate a clear party of government and a distinct Opposition. Some critics raise concerns that the separation of powers doctrine may prevent mandatory appearances by the President and executive branch officials before Congress. Establishing a presidential question period would require the President's support, while it is unclear if Congress could mandate appearances by Cabinet members without constitutional obligation. This could lead to a situation where the President or Cabinet members refuse to appear before Congress. As a practical matter, subjecting executive branch officials to direct questions by Members of Congress could increase the frequency of claims of executive privilege, potentially endangering the success of the question period as an informational device and straining inter-branch relationships. Critics also raise concerns about unelected Cabinet officials speaking on the floor of the House or Senate. The integrity of the House floor for debate among elected Representatives is compromised by unelected Presidential appointees participating in discussions. The House is a special place where each Member is equal, and having administration officials answer questions on the floor alters the dynamics. The chemistry of the House floor could change if a presidential question period is introduced, potentially turning it into an interrogation room. There is debate on the effectiveness of question periods in obtaining information from government officials, with concerns that ministers may only provide selective information. Rising politicians often learn how to avoid giving unwanted information in such settings. In democracies, rising politicians aim to artfully avoid giving unwanted information during question periods. British parliamentary observers have proposed requiring Cabinet officials to appear before standing committees for more detailed responses, in addition to question periods. This is seen as a way to obtain general information through question periods and more specific details through ministerial testimony to committees. Colin Campbell, a Canadian academic, testified that parliamentary systems prefer the committee system over the question period for detailed investigations. Congress, being more involved in program administration, relies on hearings, appropriations, and confirmations, making a question period less impactful compared to investigative committees. The committee system offers a broader range of oversight tools for Members beyond just questioning executive officials. The committee system in Congress provides a range of oversight tools for Members, including hearings, investigations, and review of appropriations. While a question period could offer access to diverse interest groups, it is seen as complementary to the committee system, not a replacement. Many critics believe that question periods in Congress encourage partisanship and unnecessary strife. Question Time in the British parliament is known for its partisan nature. Representative Clarence Cannon opposed a question hour in Congress, fearing it would increase party conflicts and upset the balance of power between branches. The idea of implementing a question hour in Congress has been met with criticism due to concerns about it devolving into a political showdown and being used for partisan advantage. Members fear it would create discord between the legislative and executive branches, rather than fostering better teamwork. Representative Benjamin Gilman warned that bringing Cabinet members to the floor could invite partisanship instead of being a beneficial addition. Critics argue that bringing Cabinet members to the floor could lead to partisanship instead of promoting pragmatic inquiry. They suggest that existing rules in Congress could maintain decorum during a question period. This could potentially change the practices of standing committees in the House and Senate. Critics are concerned that implementing a question period for Congress could undermine committee jurisdiction, make it harder to get high-ranking officials to testify, and reduce oversight quality. Standing committees in the House and Senate may have to share oversight with all members, potentially leading to conflicts between committee agendas and individual members' preferences. One proposed solution is for committees to approve questions before they are asked, but this could limit universal access to the administration for all members. The advantages of a question time include universal access to the administration for all Members, but it could frustrate administration officials used to limited committee oversight. Critics are concerned that officials may be unwilling to participate in both question time and committee hearings. During question time in 1992, committee chairmen expressed concerns about the impact on committee hearings if administration witnesses could fulfill their obligation by appearing before the House for questioning. This could lead to lower quality interactions between Members and the administration, with questions being more general or focused on local impacts. Some Cabinet Secretaries may prefer committee hearings over question periods for engaging with Congress. Critics question the value of question periods in parliamentary systems, noting that they often result in evasive responses and lack substantive policy debates. Observers have described the question period as a display of humor and a White House press conference imitation. MPs have also criticized the lack of substantive value in question periods. The question period in parliamentary systems is criticized for lacking substantive value and being manipulated for political purposes. In 1971, the British Ministry of Environment distributed prepared questions to MPs to block awkward questions by opposition Members, leading to a parliamentary investigation revealing question rigging by both the government and opposition. Opponents of written response questions often mention the cost, with statistics showing an average of \u00a3140 for a written question and \u00a3385 for an oral question in Great Britain. Despite the high number of questions asked by MPs, supporters argue that the cost of preparing written responses is justified compared to current casework activities. Opponents of a question period in Congress argue that it could upset the institutional balance between Congress and the President, giving the President a comparative advantage due to the rise of mass media. They also raise concerns about the cost and lack of unity of message in Congress. Opponents of a televised question period in Congress fear it would give the President an advantage by allowing pro-administration allies to ask softball questions, potentially scoring political points before a national audience. This format, as noted by James Sundquist, favors the administration and could disrupt the balance of power between Congress and the President. In committee hearings, the legislative majority can pursue their questions at length, offer commentary, and have the opportunity for the final word. Various format options for a question period exist, with potential effects on the procedures of the legislation branch and the relationships between the executive and Congress. The decision about who would be asked to appear is fundamental in any question period. Popular perceptions in America of parliamentary question periods focus on the oral questioning of the Prime Minister, but in England, Prime Minister's Questions are just a small part of the system. Past proposals for question periods in Congress have centered on Cabinet members, not the President. However, involving the President could potentially generate more public interest and have a greater impact. A presidential question period would be a new development in American politics. A presidential question period in American politics would be a new development and could potentially generate more public interest. The format of the question time, whether oral or written questions, is an important consideration for Congress. The traditional question period in parliamentary systems involves more written questions due to time constraints, but oral questions generate greater public interest. Past American proposals have not included written responses to Members' questions, unlike the British system where MPs can opt for a written response if their oral question is not reached. In American proposals, the limited time for oral questions poses a challenge for Members of Congress to receive responses. The duration of question periods would impact the number of government officials appearing. The British House of Commons dedicates four hours weekly for questioning Cabinet members, while the US has additional influential officials beyond the Cabinet. In American proposals, the challenge of limited time for oral questions is addressed. The selection of questions by Members may require a system due to high demand. Various proposals suggest different methods for choosing questions, such as committee clearance or leadership selection. The use of committees to clear questions could allow for a smooth integration of the question period and the committee system. Committees may select questions related to current policy debates and project them into public view. Approval from multiple committees may be needed for questions spanning different jurisdictions. The majority and minority leaders could potentially focus the question period on policy differences between political parties. The question period in Congress may be influenced by chamber leaders to highlight policy differences between parties, potentially leaving out rank and file Members. Using a random shuffle to select questions could allow for wider participation but may result in less relevant questions. Members may also use questions to address constituent casework concerns. The Mondale and Gejdenson proposals for question periods in Congress did not allow for joint House and Senate participation, while the Kefauver proposals suggested separate question periods for each chamber to avoid procedural issues. A joint question period involving the President, as proposed by Senator McCain, could raise logistical concerns about accommodating the full membership of Congress. A bicameral arrangement for a question period involving the President, proposed by Senator McCain, may be preferred due to logistical complexities. Joint sessions could limit the President's appearances and allow for House and Senate participation, following models like the State of the Union address. Parliamentary systems have rules for question periods, such as requiring succinct questions seeking information or action. Rules for question periods in parliamentary systems require succinct questions seeking information or action, related to the Minister's responsibility. Similar rules are used to keep answers short. Legislators may need to draft new rules for question time in Congress, addressing procedures and civility issues. Question period in Congress following British norms would require a relaxation of current rules of decorum. Written and oral questions must be delivered with civility. Proposals would necessitate a review of House or Senate procedures to accommodate a question routine, potentially impacting the length of daily floor sessions. Expanding session length in Congress could lead to periods of overwork or inconsequential time spent on questions. Enforcing House or Senate rules may become more crucial if question periods become partisan. The American Speaker's dual role as a political leader and presiding officer could make managing intense political exchanges challenging. In the U.S. Congress, rulings by the Speaker or Vice President about questions may increase partisan feelings and appeals. Question periods in parliamentary systems inform MPs about government policies, but their effectiveness varies. Executive branch officials occasionally appear during question periods. The practice of executive branch officials appearing on the floor during Congress has largely ceased since the late 1790s. Proposals for a question period in Congress have been suggested since the mid-19th century, initially to increase executive branch influence and more recently for greater executive branch accountability. The success of a question period in a system of separated powers depends on participant attitudes and the format it takes, potentially involving more Members in policy-making and improving communication with the executive branch. In proposing a question period for Congress, attention would focus on balancing the interests of both parties, committees, institutional interests, and general membership. This could impact relations between Congress and the executive, potentially increasing partisan controversy."
