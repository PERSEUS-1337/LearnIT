    "content": "Reconstruction of few-view x-ray Computed Tomography (CT) data is a challenging problem, especially with low x-ray projections. This paper introduces a deep network-driven approach to improve reconstruction quality by using convolutional neural networks to interpret sinogram data and incorporate it into iterative reconstruction. The method was tested on a chest CT dataset, showing promising results in addressing extreme few-view CT challenges. The text discusses the challenges of reconstructing images from few-view x-ray projections in Computed Tomography (CT). It mentions the use of deep learning networks to improve reconstruction quality and highlights the severe artifacts and noise in images reconstructed from extremely few-view sinogram measurements. Deep learning-based approaches have been successful in improving image quality in CT imaging applications, particularly for low-dose imaging. These methods use perceptual and contextual features to enhance image reconstruction, addressing the challenges of severe artifacts and noise in images reconstructed from sparse-view sinogram measurements. In this paper, a CNN inference-based reconstruction algorithm is proposed for extremely few-view CT imaging scenarios. Existing methods do not utilize sinogram data for consistency in image reconstruction. The proposed method directly predicts the reconstructed image from few-view sinogram data using a CNN-based inference model. This approach aims to address the challenges of noise and lack of high-frequency information in images reconstructed from undersampled sinogram measurements. The proposed method uses sinogram data for consistent image reconstruction by directly predicting the image from few-view sinogram data using a CNN-based inference model. This approach outperforms existing algorithms and sinogram completion methods in chest CT imaging. The proposed method utilizes CNN-based deep inferencing to predict reconstructed images from few-view sinogram data, followed by an iterative algorithm with the predicted images as initial guess. The network architecture is adapted from CT-Net for few-view CT applications, using smaller filter sizes in the 1D CNN due to spatial incoherence in the sinogram. Training loss includes SSIM, L2, and adversarial loss with a discriminator. The predicted images serve as image prior in Regularized Least Squares (RLS)-based reconstruction. The reconstructed images are used as image prior in the Regularized Least Squares (RLS)-based iterative algorithm for reconstruction. The optimization involves solving for the reconstructed attenuation coefficients using sinogram data and a Total Variation regularization functional. A carefully selected initial guess, such as the deep network-driven prediction, enables high-quality reconstruction with fast convergence, preserving edge-preserving high frequency regions in the images. For the experiment on the chest CT dataset, 100 iterations with \u03b2 = 2e \u22122 were chosen in the RLS algorithm. The dataset consists of 1595 patients for lung nodule detection. 1000 patients were used for training and the rest for testing. The reconstructed volumes were 512 \u00d7 512 \u00d7 N, with N ranging from 94 to 541 slices. Each slice was independently processed for reconstruction. The original 512 \u00d7 512 slices were down-sampled to 128 \u00d7 128 to fit the model on a single GPU memory. The dataset was down-sampled from 512 \u00d7 512 to 128 \u00d7 128 slices to fit the model on a single GPU. Forward projection was used to generate sinograms for training and testing, with sinogram sampling for few-view experiments. The model was trained using Tensorflow on NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 Ti, with evaluation against baseline algorithms like FBP and RLS. The proposed method, along with FBP, RLS, and SC, was evaluated using PSNR and SSIM. Qualitative results show sharper edges and less noise compared to baseline algorithms. Quantitative evaluation on few-view experiments demonstrates that the proposed approach outperforms the baselines, especially with a small number of views.
