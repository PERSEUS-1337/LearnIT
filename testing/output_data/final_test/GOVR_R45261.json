    "content": "The Black Lung Disability Trust Fund finances federal Black Lung Program benefits for coal workers with pneumoconiosis caused by inhaling coal dust. This disease scars lung tissue, impeding gas exchange. Continued exposure can progress from simple CWP to complicated CWP or PMF, leading to loss of lung function. Despite advancements in mining dust control, mandatory chest x-rays, free CWP surveillance, and mine safety legislation, CWP persists in American coal miners, especially in the Appalachian region. PMF rates have recently resurfaced in Central Appalachia at levels not seen since the 1970s. In 2017, researchers discovered a large cluster of Progressive Massive Fibrosis (PMF) among coal miners in Kentucky and Virginia, possibly the largest ever recorded. This cluster includes miners with less than 20 years of experience and cases in current miners. The occurrence of PMF in short-tenured and current miners is significant, as MSHA standards aim to prevent the progression of Coal Workers' Pneumoconiosis (CWP). The federal Black Lung Program was established in 1969. The federal Black Lung Program was created in 1969 under the Coal Act to prevent the progression of Coal Workers' Pneumoconiosis (CWP) by providing benefits for disability and death caused by CWP. It established safety standards for coal mines and allowed miners with CWP to be moved to areas with lower dust concentrations without penalty. The Coal Act of 1969 established the federal Black Lung Program to provide benefits for disability and death caused by CWP. Part B of the program provides cash benefits to disabled miners and their survivors, while Part C covers cases filed after December 31, 1973. Part B benefits were initially administered by the Social Security Administration but are now managed by the Department of Labor. The Black Lung Benefits Act (BLBA) requires claims for disability or death due to Coal Workers' Pneumoconiosis (CWP) to be filed with each state's workers' compensation system if it meets certain standards set by the Department of Labor (DOL). If a state's system does not meet these standards, Part C benefits are to be paid by the miner's coal employer or the federal government. As of now, no state workers' compensation system has been approved by DOL under Part C of the BLBA. The compensation system under Part C of the BLBA requires operators of underground coal mines to provide benefits to miners. Operators can do so by purchasing insurance or through DOL-approved self-insurance. Self-insured operators must meet specific financial requirements to be approved for self-insurance. The federal government pays black lung benefits when the responsible operator or successor operator fails to pay within 30 days. Initially, benefits were paid from general revenue, but now they are paid from the Black Lung fund. The Lung Benefits Revenue Act of 1977 (P.L. 95-227) established the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund, financed by a coal excise tax, to pay benefits for miners. The fund can seek reimbursement from responsible operators and covers various program-related expenses. The Black Lung Benefits Act (BLBA) provides benefits for miners disabled by pneumoconiosis from coal mine employment. Survivors are also eligible if the miner's death was due to pneumoconiosis. Benefits are available to miners and their survivors, defined as individuals who worked in coal-related activities and were exposed to coal dust. The Black Lung Benefits Act (BLBA) provides benefits for miners disabled by pneumoconiosis from coal mine employment. Survivors are also eligible if the miner's death was due to pneumoconiosis. Benefits are not available to other workers exposed to coal dust, such as railroad workers or those living near coal mines or power plants. Family members of miners can receive benefits as survivors, but cannot claim benefits themselves due to exposure to coal dust at home. The BLBA defines pneumoconiosis as a chronic dust disease of the lung arising from coal mine employment. The federal Black Lung Program regulations define pneumoconiosis as medical or \"clinical\" pneumoconiosis and statutory or \"legal\" pneumoconiosis, which includes various lung diseases caused by dust exposure in coal mine employment. Legal pneumoconiosis is any chronic lung disease related to coal mine employment. The Department of Labor (DOL) has established that benefits are available to miners with chronic lung diseases arising from coal mine employment, including COPD. The Black Lung Program has presumptions to determine eligibility for benefits, with three being rebuttable and one being irrefutable. The Black Lung Program has presumptions to establish eligibility for benefits, with three being rebuttable and one being irrefutable. Five presumptions provided by the BLBA include a rebuttable presumption for miners with at least 10 years of mining employment, a rebuttable presumption for miners who died of a respirable disease after 10 years of mining, and an irrebuttable presumption for miners with chronic lung disease meeting certain criteria. The Black Lung Program has presumptions for miners with chronic lung disease meeting certain criteria, including a rebuttable presumption for miners with at least 15 years of mining employment and a presumption for miners who died before March 1, 1978, after at least 25 years of mining. The Black Lung Program has presumptions for miners with chronic lung disease meeting certain criteria, including a rebuttable presumption for miners with at least 15 years of mining employment and a presumption for miners who died before March 1, 1978, after at least 25 years of mining. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) included provisions amending the Black Lung Benefits Act to increase eligibility opportunities and simplify benefits for certain survivors. The ACA provisions removed restrictions on applying presumptions for miners with chronic lung disease, increasing eligibility for benefits and simplifying benefits for survivors under the Black Lung Program. The ACA provisions under Section 1556 of the BLBA, effective for claims filed after January 1, 2005, aim to expand benefits for eligible miners with pneumoconiosis. Eligible miners receive medical coverage at no cost and cash disability benefits based on the basic pay rate. Dependents can also receive benefits. The miner can receive benefits based on the basic pay rate, with additional percentages for dependents. Benefits can also be paid to a divorced spouse under certain conditions. Children are considered dependents until certain criteria are met. Benefit rates are adjusted with federal employee pay schedules. Benefits may be offset by other state compensation. The total amount paid in cash disability benefits has decreased over time, with more cash benefits than medical benefits. Survivors of miners with pneumoconiosis-related deaths may be eligible for cash benefits based on the miner's potential benefits. If there is no surviving spouse, benefits can be awarded to minor children, dependent parents, or siblings. The Black Lung Disability Trust Fund provides benefits to miners' survivors if the miner passes away. Revenue comes from a coal excise tax, but additional funds are often needed from the general fund. The Black Lung Excise Tax is imposed on domestically mined coal sales. The Black Lung Excise Tax (BLET) is imposed on sales or use of domestically mined coal, with producers liable for the tax. The tax rates vary based on how coal is mined, with different rates for underground-mined and surface-mined coal. In FY2017, $229 million was collected on underground-mined coal, while $200 million was collected on surface-mined coal. The Black Lung Excise Tax (BLET) is imposed on domestically mined coal, with different tax rates for underground-mined and surface-mined coal. Just over half of surface-mined coal was taxed at $0.55 per ton, while the rest was subject to a 4.4% tax on sales price. The tax supports the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund for domestic miners and does not apply to imported or exported coal. Tax collections have declined in recent years. The Black Lung Excise Tax (BLET) collections have declined in recent years, from over $650 million in FY2009 to about $429 million in FY2017, following the general decline in U.S. coal production. The tax was established to ensure the coal industry shared the social costs of black lung disease, with rates increasing over time. Coal excise tax receipts are expected to sharply decrease beyond 2018 due to a decrease in the tax rate. The Black Lung Excise Tax was established to finance black lung benefits programs, with rates based on coal type and limited to 2% of sales price. There were debates on how to structure the tax, with some suggesting a graduated tax based on coal's Btu content. Ultimately, the tax was set at $0.50 per ton for coal from underground mines and $0.25 per ton for coal from surface mines, effective after March 31, 1978. The Black Lung Excise Tax was established to finance black lung benefits programs, with rates based on coal type and limited to 2% of sales price. Different proposals were considered for structuring the tax, including a uniform rate for all coal types and an ad valorem tax based on sales price. Another suggestion was a \"premium rate\" to fully fund the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund, with the tax enacted as the lesser of the per-unit price or a 2% ad valorem rate. The Black Lung Benefits Revenue Act of 1981 doubled coal excise tax rates to $1.00 per ton for coal from underground mines and $0.50 per ton for coal from surface mines, with the goal of eliminating the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund's debt. The rates were temporary and scheduled to revert to previous levels in 1996. Subsequent legislation in 1985 and 1987 further increased the rates to $1.10 for underground-mined coal and $0.55 for surface-mined coal. The Black Lung Benefits Revenue Act of 1981 doubled coal excise tax rates to reduce reliance on the Treasury and recover costs from the mining industry. The rates were extended through 2018 to address the program's expenses exceeding revenues and the debt to the Treasury not being paid off by 2013. Congress believed it was appropriate to continue the tax on coal at increased rates beyond the expiration date. The trust fund receives repayable advances from the general fund to cover expenses, with interest charged on these advances. A moratorium on interest payments ended in 1990, leading to a growth in trust fund debt throughout the 1990s and 2000s. The excise tax rate was extended until 2019, and the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund debt was restructured in FY2009. The Black Lung Disability Trust Fund debt was restructured in FY2009, reducing the cumulative debt from $10.4 billion to $6.2 billion by the end of FY2009. Despite initial expectations of full debt elimination by FY2040, current projections indicate that the trust fund's debt will rise over time due to lower coal excise tax revenue. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) projects the trust fund's debt will not be eliminated by FY2050. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) projects the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund's debt to reach $15.4 billion by FY2050. Revenue sources include fines, penalties, and interest from coal operators and miners, as well as reimbursements from responsible operators for violations of the act. In FY2017, the trust fund received $1.2 million from fines, penalties, and interest. This revenue is small compared to the $428.7 million generated by the coal excise tax. The trust fund can start paying benefits within 30 days if no responsible operator has done so. If an operator is identified later, the trust fund may seek reimbursement for benefits paid, with the collected amount going back into the fund. In FY2017, $19.9 million was collected from responsible mine operators, contributing to the trust fund's debt of $3.1 billion. The trust fund also borrowed $1.3 billion from the general fund that year. Projections indicate further borrowing from the general fund in the future. Projections show increasing borrowing from the general fund in the next few years to repay debt. Trust fund revenues will not be enough to cover expenses, leading to a projected $2.6 billion borrowing by FY2022. Congress could consider raising taxes on the coal industry or forgiving trust fund debt to improve the fund's fiscal condition. The coal industry may face increased taxes or forgiven trust fund debt to address shortfalls in the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund. Additional revenue may be necessary to cover past benefits and maintain current levels, as trust fund revenues are insufficient. Congress has previously raised excise taxes on coal temporarily to address fund deficits. The Black Lung Disability Trust Fund may need increased taxes or forgiven debt to address shortfalls. Extending 2018 coal excise tax rates could lead to a $4.5 billion debt by 2050, but a 25% increase could eliminate the debt and create a surplus. Another option is to reduce tax benefits for the coal industry. The Obama Administration proposed repealing tax incentives for the coal industry to offset the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund's shortfalls. Repealing these tax benefits could generate revenue to transfer from the general fund to the trust fund. The Black Lung Disability Trust Fund was established in 1977 to finance black lung benefits, with revenue coming from various sources including the general fund. Trust funds are created when there is a direct link between the government benefits or services provided and the revenue source. Congress believed that the costs of the black lung program should be borne by the coal industry to maintain this link. The Black Lung Disability Trust Fund's fiscal outlook has been improved through interest and debt forgiveness in the past. Recent debt forgiveness in 2008 helped reduce the burden on the coal industry. The GAO projects that forgiving all current debt would result in $2.3 billion in new debt by 2050, while forgiving all interest would lead to $5.8 billion in debt by 2050. Forgiving interest or debt would shift the burden of paying for black lung benefits to general taxpayers, but a one-time appropriation could satisfy the trust fund's obligations transparently. The trust fund's primary expenditures are for Part C benefits to miners with no responsible operator. Congress could reduce benefits or increase coal operators' responsibility. Part C benefits are relatively low compared to other compensation. The basic benefit rate for federal employees at the GS-2, Step 1 level is just over $660 per month or under $8,000 per year. State workers' compensation programs typically provide two-thirds of the worker's pre-disability wage as benefits. The FECA program provides 75% of the pre-disability wage for federal workers with a spouse or dependent. The minimum benefit for total disability or death in the FECA program is twice the Part C benefit rate, with no automatic adjustment for cost of living increases. In 1981, Congress enacted eligibility restrictions for miners and survivors to Part C benefits to address concerns about the trust fund's financial insolvency. Presumptions for new claims were removed, including those related to miners with at least 10 years of mining experience who died of a respirable disease, and miners with negative chest x-rays after 15 years of mining work. The 1981 law removed eligibility presumptions for miners and survivors seeking Part C benefits, including those related to miners with negative chest x-rays but evidence of disabling respiratory conditions or who died due to pneumoconiosis. This presumption can only be rebutted by the Secretary of Labor. The 1981 law removed eligibility presumptions for miners and survivors seeking Part C benefits. The ACA reinstated the fourth eligibility presumption and expanded rights for survivors' benefits, allowing the federal government to recover costs from responsible operators. In 2016, Representatives Bobby Scott and Sander Levin raised concerns about bankrupt coal operators transferring liabilities to the trust fund, potentially avoiding liens by continuing to make payments. Insolvent coal operators may avoid trust fund liens by making benefit payments until after court approval in bankruptcy cases. Congress may examine the impact of coal operator bankruptcies on the BLBA's lien provisions to strengthen federal oversight and reduce trust fund expenditures."
