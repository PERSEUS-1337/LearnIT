    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Shore Protection Act of 1996\". Congress finds that the beach, shore, and coastal resources of the United States are critical assets that must be protected, conserved, and restored. These resources provide economic and environmental benefits of national significance. A network of healthy beaches is essential for the economy, tourism competitiveness, and safety of coastal communities. The coasts of the United States support 28,000,000 jobs and generate $1.3 trillion, contributing significantly to the national economy. Travel and tourism is the second largest sector of the economy. The coastline of the United States is crucial for its economy, with tourism being a significant contributor. Coastal communities generate 85% of tourism revenue, and almost half of the US population lives in these areas. The coastline not only creates jobs and revenue but also protects families, homes, and businesses from natural disasters. Shoreline protection projects along the US coastline provide ecological, environmental, and economic benefits. Beaches protect lives and property worth billions of dollars. The coastline is a national treasure visited by millions of Americans and tourists annually. Over 90 million Americans engage in boating or fishing activities along the coast each year. Shoreline protection projects yield positive outcomes for the US as a whole. The purpose of this Act is to provide for a Federal role in shore protection projects, including sand replacement, where benefits exceed costs. The Act aims to establish a Federal role in shore protection projects, specifically focusing on sand replacement when benefits outweigh costs. The Act amends the first section to promote shore protection projects and research for sandy beaches, including restoration and nourishment. The Act promotes shore protection projects and research for sandy beaches, giving preference to areas with Federal investment and the need for prevention or mitigation of damage. It also authorizes projects that benefit local and regional economic development and ecology. The Act authorizes studies and recommendations for shore protection projects meeting specific criteria, requiring the Secretary to report results to Congress. The Secretary recommends shore protection projects to Congress based on studies, considering economic and ecological benefits, and non-Federal participation. When recommending shore protection projects to Congress, the Secretary considers economic and ecological benefits, as well as non-Federal participation. The Army Corps of Engineers is not required to meet NEPA requirements under this provision. The Secretary is responsible for recommending shore protection projects to Congress, considering economic and ecological benefits, and non-Federal participation. The Secretary must also determine if there are complementary projects by other Federal agencies and coordinate efforts if needed. Shore protection projects authorized by Congress must be constructed with appropriated funds. After Congress appropriates funds for a shore protection project, the Secretary must enter into a written agreement with a non-Federal interest before construction begins. The agreement specifies the project's duration and ensures cooperation between the Federal Government and the non-Federal interest. The Secretary must coordinate shore protection projects and report annually to Congress on their status. Agreements with non-Federal interests are required before construction begins for small shore protection projects. The Act authorizes Federal participation in protecting publicly owned property shores. The Secretary must coordinate projects and report to Congress annually.

The Secretary must enter into a written agreement with non-Federal interests for shore protection projects, specifying project details and ensuring cooperation. Additionally, other shoreline protection projects require written agreements with non-Federal interests. State and regional plans for protecting publicly owned shores are also addressed in the Act. The Act regarding protection of publicly owned shores is amended by redesignating a section and inserting a new section. The Secretary may cooperate with States to prepare comprehensive coastal conservation plans, encourage State participation, and submit reports to Congress. Definitions in the Act are amended to include all shorelines. The Act's definitions are amended to include all shorelines.
