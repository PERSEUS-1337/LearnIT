    "content": "The 113th Congress is focused on supporting federal R&D activities despite concerns about the federal debt. The government plays a crucial role in funding R&D efforts that have led to scientific advancements. Prioritization of R&D within the federal budget is challenging due to competing priorities. The U.S. government supports a wide range of scientific and engineering R&D for various purposes including national defense, health, safety, environment, and energy security. The federal government plays a key role in funding R&D activities to advance knowledge, develop the workforce, and enhance U.S. innovation and competitiveness. Congress defines R&D priorities and allocates funding, facing challenges due to fiscal constraints. President Obama proposed the FY2014 budget amidst concerns about federal funding levels. President Obama released his proposed FY2014 budget on April 10, 2013, prioritizing and allocating available funding. The budget sought $142.773 billion for R&D in FY2014, a 1.3% increase over FY2012 levels. Adjusted for inflation, the request represented a 2.6% decrease from FY2012. The President's proposed FY2014 budget maintained emphasis on increasing support for physical sciences and engineering, aligning with the America COMPETES Act and its reauthorization. Funding for R&D at targeted agencies fell short of authorized levels. President Obama set a goal in 2009 to increase national R&D investment to over 3% of the U.S. GDP, but did not provide details on how to achieve this. This would have required a significant increase in government and/or corporate R&D spending, as total U.S. R&D expenditures were 2.90% of GDP at that time. Total U.S. R&D expenditures of $428.2 billion in 2011 accounted for 2.84% of GDP, requiring a 5.6% increase in national R&D spending to reach the 3% goal set by President Obama in 2009. Analysis of federal R&D funding is complex due to inconsistencies among agencies in reporting and inclusion of R&D in non-R&D activities. The data on federal R&D funding for FY2012, FY2013, and FY2014 is analyzed by agency, with seven federal agencies receiving 95.3% of total funding. President Obama's FY2014 budget request allocated the majority of funding to the Department of Defense, Department of Health and Human Services, Department of Energy, NASA, and NSF. The report analyzes R&D budget requests for key federal agencies like NASA, NSF, DOC, and USDA. The President's FY2014 budget proposed significant increases for DOE, DOC, DHS, HHS, NSF, and NASA, while DOD and EPA faced reductions in R&D funding. In FY2014, federal R&D funding saw reductions in various areas, with basic research receiving a $1.422 million increase, applied research receiving a $3.345 billion increase, development facing a $3.781 billion decrease, and facilities and equipment receiving an $875 million increase. This funding can be further analyzed by the type of work supported and the contributions of each agency to basic research, applied research, development, and facilities and equipment. The federal R&D budget in FY2014 reflects national priorities, with agencies like HHS, DOD, and NIH being major funders of basic research, applied research, and development. HHS accounts for nearly half of basic research funding, while DOD is the primary funder of development. The federal government is the largest supporter of basic research in the U.S., funding 53.3% of it in 2011. Industry funds 22.5% of basic research and is the primary funder of applied research and development. Defense-related R&D is mainly funded by the Department of Defense. Defense-related R&D is primarily funded by the Department of Defense, with some funding from the Department of Energy and the Department of Justice Federal Bureau of Investigation. It has accounted for over half of total federal R&D funding for the past two decades, ranging from 50% to 70%. In FY2014, the President's request included $73.2 billion for defense-related R&D, representing about 51.2% of the total R&D request. President Obama's FY2014 budget also supported multiagency R&D initiatives, including the American Competitiveness Initiative announced by President Bush in 2006 to increase federal funding for physical sciences and engineering. The America COMPETES Act aimed to double federal funding for physical sciences and engineering research over 10 years, targeting accounts at NSF, DOE Office of Science, and DOC National Institute of Standards and Technology. Despite authorization for increased funding, actual appropriations fell below targets in subsequent years. In 2010, Congress passed the America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2010 (P.L. 111-358) authorizing appropriations levels for targeted accounts for FY2011-FY2013. The FY2012 funding for targeted accounts was $12.529 billion, $1.631 billion less than authorized, doubling over 17 years from FY2006 level. President Obama requested $13.532 billion in aggregate funding for targeted accounts in his FY2014 budget. President Obama requested $13.532 billion in funding for targeted accounts in FY2014, an increase of $1.003 billion from FY2012. The FY2013 funding was $12.141 billion, and FY2014 funding is set at $12.950 billion. The doubling pace of funding over 20 years is in question due to budget constraints. Obama aimed to double funding for basic research over 11 years from FY2006 to FY2017. President Obama's budget requests aimed to double funding for targeted accounts from FY2006 levels, but the FY2014 budget did not specify this goal. The Office of Management and Budget projected a doubling pace of approximately 19 years through FY2018. The National Nanotechnology Initiative (NNI) was launched by President Clinton in FY2001 to advance understanding and control of matter at the nanoscale. The President requested $1.704 billion for the NNI in FY2014, a reduction of $159 million from FY2012. Funding for nanotechnology has seen substantial changes over the years. The Administration's FY2014 request includes reductions for DOD and NSF, and increases for DOE, DHS, HHS, and DOC in nanotechnology funding. The NITRD program, established in 1991, coordinates federal investments in networking and information technology R&D. President Obama has requested $3.968 billion for the NITRD program in FY2014. The Administration's FY2014 request includes funding increases for the Networking and Information Technology Research and Development (NITRD) program, with significant boosts for agencies like DOC, DOE, DOD, DHS, and NSF. However, there are proposed reductions for HHS and NASA. Additionally, President Obama has proposed a $2.652 billion budget for the U.S. Global Change Research Program (USGCRP) in FY2014, representing a $151 million increase from the FY2012 level. The Administration's FY2014 request includes funding increases for various agencies like NASA, DOC, DOI U.S. Geological Survey, and USDA. The Materials Genome Initiative, announced by President Obama in June 2011, aims to accelerate the discovery and deployment of advanced materials. Agencies are working on implementation strategies focusing on creating an innovation infrastructure, achieving national goals with advanced materials, and developing the next generation materials workforce. Funding opportunities in FY2012 and FY2013 reflect these efforts. The Materials Genome Initiative, launched by President Obama in June 2011, aims to accelerate the discovery and deployment of advanced materials. Agencies like DOE, DOD, NSF, and NIST are funding research and development for the initiative. The President's FY2014 budget mentions the initiative in various documents, but does not provide specific agency funding details. Obama launched the Advanced Manufacturing Partnership (AMP) to invest in emerging technologies for creating manufacturing jobs and enhancing global competitiveness. The National Robotics Initiative (NRI) aims to develop robots to augment human capabilities in various sectors. Four agencies issued a joint solicitation in FY2012 for research funding in next-generation robotics. The Department of Defense is supporting research funding for next-generation robotics to advance defense technologies and applications. The President's FY2014 budget includes references to agency funding for the National Robotics Initiative (NRI) and proposes the establishment of a National Network for Manufacturing Innovation (NNMI) to promote manufacturing technologies. The National Network for Manufacturing Innovation (NNMI) is a collaboration among NIST, DOD, DOE, and NSF to develop new manufacturing technologies through a network of institutes. Each institute focuses on unique technology to support local manufacturing activity and bridge the gap from laboratory to market. The President's budget requests $1 billion over nine years for up to 15 NNMI institutes. The Administration's FY2014 budget proposed funding for up to 15 NNMI manufacturing innovation institutes, with NIST expecting to obligate $147.6 million in FY2014 and $672 million in spending projected for FY2014-FY2018. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014 did not address the administration's NNMI proposal as it had not been approved by Congress. The budget also proposed a reorganization of federal STEM education programs. The President proposed a reorganization of federal STEM education programs, with lead agencies designated for different education levels. The plan aimed to consolidate programs and allocate budget authority to these agencies. However, the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations rejected the proposed reorganization within the FY2014 Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies appropriations act. The Senate report deferred action on the reorganization of federal STEM education programs until assessments are finalized as required by the America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2010. The explanatory statement rejected the proposed reorganization and directed the Office of Science and Technology Policy to explore other possible reorganizations in consultation with federal agencies and stakeholders. Complications in analyzing federal R&D funding levels are attributed to rescissions in the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2013, sequestration requirements in the Budget Control Act of 2011, and sequestration process modifications in the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012. The complications in analyzing federal R&D funding levels are due to rescissions and sequestration reductions, which may be applied unequally to R&D and non-R&D functions. FY2013 figures will be added as agencies provide more information. Some agencies have appropriations accounts containing only R&D, while others have both R&D and non-R&D activities. Post-rescission/pre-sequestration funding levels are included for most agencies. The BCA established discretionary spending limits for FY2012-FY2021 and mandated a Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to develop a deficit reduction plan. Due to the failure to enact legislation by January 15, 2012, automatic spending reductions through sequestration were triggered. The sequestration process for FY2013 requires OMB to implement across-the-board spending cuts. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) is required to implement across-the-board spending cuts at the account and program level to achieve equal budget reductions from both defense and nondefense funding. This is mandated by the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (BBEDCA) and the Budget Control Act. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 made changes to the procedures in the Budget Control Act for FY2013. The joint committee sequester was reduced by $24 billion and statutory caps on discretionary spending for FY2013 were lowered. President Obama ordered the sequester to be implemented on March 1, 2013, with budget authority canceled for non-exempt funds at the program level. The reductions were calculated on an annualized basis due to a temporary continuing resolution in force. The FY2013 funding reductions are being apportioned throughout the fiscal year, with uncertainty on the budgetary resources available until further guidance from OMB. Section 3004 of P.L. 113-6 aims to eliminate any excess budget authority, with across-the-board rescissions of 0% for non-security and security budget authority. After the enactment of P.L. 113-6, OMB calculated additional rescissions needed for security and non-security budget authority. The report provides an analysis of R&D funding in 12 federal departments and agencies. Congress finalized FY2014 appropriations with the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014 (P.L. 113-76) in January 2014. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014 (P.L. 113-76) finalized FY2014 funding for federal departments and agencies, including research and development (R&D) supported by the government. Congress supports R&D in the Department of Defense primarily through its Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDT&E) appropriation. Individual reports on appropriations bills can be accessed on the CRS website. The Department of Defense primarily supports research and development through its RDT&E appropriation, which funds the development of military hardware, software, and technology. RDT&E funds are allocated in various parts of the defense appropriation bill, including the Defense Health Program for medical research. Congress appropriates funds for these programs in different titles of the bill. The Chemical Agents and Munitions Destruction Program, funded by Congress in Title VI of the defense appropriations bill, supports the destruction of lethal chemical agents and munitions to prevent future risks and costs. The National Defense Sealift Fund, also funded by Congress in Title V, supports the procurement and maintenance of the naval reserve fleet and U.S. flagged merchant fleet. The Joint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat Fund (JIEDDF) in the defense appropriations bill contains RDT&E monies, tracked by the Joint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat Office. RDT&E funds for Global War on Terror (GWOT) or Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) are requested and accounted for separately. The Obama Administration has included Global War on Terror (GWOT) or Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) funds as part of the regular budget, not in emergency supplementals. Additional OCO funds may be requested in supplemental requests if initial funding is insufficient. Transfer funds like the Iraqi Freedom Fund (IFF) and Mine Resistant and Ambush Protected Vehicle Fund (MRAPVF) are typically included in GWOT/OCO-related requests/appropriations. Congress makes a single appropriation into each fund and authorizes the Secretary to make transfers to other accounts. The Obama Administration requested $67.520 billion for DOD's baseline Title IV RDT&E in FY2014, which was $5.449 billion less than FY2012. The FY2014 request was $4.120 billion above the FY2013 sequestered balance of $63.400 billion. Additionally, $117 million was requested for OCO RDT&E, half of the FY2013 amount, mainly for classified programs. The FY2014 OCO RDT&E request focused on classified programs, with additional funding for Defense Health, Chemical Agents, and National Defense Sealift. The House approved $66.399 billion for Title IV RDT&E, $1.121 billion less than requested, citing unjustified program delays or increases. Notable increases included $250 million for the Rapid Innovation Fund and $173 million for Israeli missile defense programs. The House approved $56 million for RDT&E for the National Defense Sealift Fund, $604 million for the Chemical Agents and Munitions Destruction Program, and $1.356 billion for the Defense Health Program. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $65.807 billion in baseline Title IV RDT&E, with increases for the Israeli Cooperative Program and the Rapid Innovation Program. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended significant reductions in various defense programs, including the Army's Warfighter Information Network, the Missile Defense Agency's Midcourse Defense Segment, the Army's Manned Ground Vehicles program, and the Air Force's CSAR HH-130 recapitalization program. These reductions were attributed to restoring acquisition accountability. Additionally, the committee provided funding for the National Defense Sealift Fund, the Chemical Agents and Munitions Destruction program, and RDT&E in the Defense Health Program. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014 provided funding for baseline Title IV RDT&E, with additional funds for OCO-related RDT&E, National Defense Sealift Fund, Defense Health Program, and Chemical Agents and Munitions Destruction. RDT&E funding is allocated to military departments and DOD agencies separately. RDT&E funding within DOD agencies is categorized by budget activities, including basic research, applied research, and advanced technology development. Budget activities 6.4 and 6.5 focus on developing specific weapon systems, while 6.6 provides management support. Budget activity 6.7 supports system improvements in existing operational systems. Congressional policymakers are involved in overseeing these activities. The FY2014 Title IV baseline S&T funding request was $11.984 billion, emphasizing activities aligned with the department's strategic focus on the Asia-Pacific region. Funding supports the development of new technologies for military superiority and commercial advancements. The House approved $12.317 billion in Title IV baseline S&T funding, $333 million more than requested, with increases in all S&T-related budget activities. The Senate recommended $12.050 billion, and the Consolidated Appropriations Act provided $12.185 billion. Basic research receives special attention, with over half of DOD's budget spent at universities. The Administration requested $2.165 billion for basic research for FY2014, with the House and Senate approving $2.170 billion each. The increase of $5 million went to Historically Black Colleges and Universities in the Defensewide account. The President also requested $1.838 billion for R&D and related programs in the Department of Homeland Security for FY2014, a 64% increase from the previous year. The House-passed bill allocated $1.225 billion for Science and Technology (S&T), $291 million for the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office (DNDO), and $10 million for U.S. Coast Guard Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDT&E). The Senate-reported bill proposed $1.218 billion for S&T, $289 million for DNDO, and $20 million for Coast Guard RDT&E. The final appropriations were $1.220 billion for S&T, $285 million for DNDO, and $19 million for Coast Guard RDT&E. The S&T Directorate is the primary DHS R&D organization, with the Administration requesting $1.527 billion for FY2014, a significant increase from the previous year. The FY2014 request for Science and Technology (S&T) was $1.220 billion, a 91% increase from FY2013, mainly due to funding for the National Bio- and Agro-Defense Facility (NBAF) construction. The total estimated cost for NBAF is $1.230 billion, with completion expected in FY2020. Additionally, the request for University Programs decreased by 19% to $31 million in FY2014. The House bill proposed $1.225 billion for Science and Technology (S&T), including $404 million for NBAF construction. It also allocated $40 million for University Programs to increase funding for university centers of excellence. The Senate bill proposed $1.218 billion for S&T, with the same amount for NBAF construction. Funding for scholarships and fellowships in University Programs was eliminated in the House bill. The Senate recommended $33 million for University Programs, acknowledging a reduction due to program consolidation. The enacted appropriation for Science and Technology (S&T) was $1.220 billion, including $404 million for NBAF and $40 million for University Programs. Funding for S&T scholarships and fellowships program was not provided. The Domestic Nuclear Detection Office is responsible for nuclear detection within DHS. The Domestic Nuclear Detection Office (DNDO) is responsible for nuclear detection research, development, testing, evaluation, acquisition, and operational support within DHS. The Administration requested $291 million for DNDO for FY2014, a 4% decrease from the previous year. Funding shifts within DNDO's Research, Development, and Operations account reflect a transition to a commercial-first approach to technology acquisition. The request for Human Portable Radiation Detection Systems (HPRDS) saw a 50% decrease to $14 million in FY2014. The House bill would have provided the requested amount for DNDO, while the Senate bill allocated $289 million with small reductions in various accounts. The enacted appropriation was $285 million, including reductions in Transformational R&D and other areas. The Government Accountability Office reported on R&D activities within DHS components. The Government Accountability Office found that DHS lacks department-wide policies for defining and reporting R&D activities, leading to a lack of knowledge on total R&D investments. Recommendations were made for DHS to develop policies, guidance, and a mechanism to track R&D projects department-wide. In response, the Secretary of Homeland Security was directed to establish a review process for all R&D and related work within DHS. The GAO identified DHS R&D as a concern due to fragmented programs. The House bill required DHS to report on R&D reforms, while the Senate bill directed DHS to implement policies for overseeing R&D. The joint statement instructed DHS to comply with both reports on R&D. The FY2014 President's Budget requested $31.331 billion for NIH, an increase of $2.180 billion over the previous year. The Senate Appropriations Committee reported S. 1284 for the Departments of Labor, Health. The Senate Appropriations Committee reported S. 1284 (S.Rept. 113-71) for the Departments of Labor, Health, and Human Services, and Education, and Related Agencies (Labor/HHS). The committee recommended program level funding for NIH at $31.184 billion, slightly lower than the President's request but higher than previous years. The House did not take action on a stand-alone FY2014 Labor/HHS bill, and federal agencies operated under the Continuing Appropriations Act, 2014 until mid-January 2014. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014 provided funding for NIH at $30.150 billion, a $1 billion increase over the previous year. NIH supports a wide range of research and training in biomedical and behavioral sciences, with 83% of its budget going to non-federal scientists at various institutions. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) consists of the Office of the NIH Director and 27 institutes and centers, with personnel at universities, hospitals, and research institutions. Each institute focuses on specific diseases or research areas, managing its own programs in coordination with the Office of the Director. Funding for NIH primarily comes from Congress, with separate appropriations to 24 of the 27 institutes and centers. Funding for the National Institutes of Health (NIH) primarily comes from the annual Labor/HHS appropriations bill and the Interior/Environment appropriations bill. NIH also receives mandatory funding for type 1 diabetes research and the National Library of Medicine. Congress does not usually specify amounts for particular diseases or research areas, and NIH does not budget by disease category. Total funding for NIH activities is determined by the program level. NIH does not budget by disease category. Funding is subject to discretionary appropriations, with a budget assessment called the PHS Program Evaluation Set-Aside. This set-aside redistributes funds among PHS and other HHS agencies for specific purposes. Congress determines the tap percentage in annual appropriations acts. The PHS Program Evaluation Set-Aside redistributes funds among PHS and other HHS agencies. NIH, with the largest budget, becomes the largest \"donor\" of program evaluation funds. The FY2014 President's Budget proposes to increase the set-aside to 3.0%, but the Senate committee rejected the increase due to its impact on NIH, estimating an extra $147 million would be taken from NIH. The assessment is set at 2.5% in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014. The Senate committee largely supported the Administration's priorities for NIH funding in FY2014, with most institutes and centers receiving about a 1% increase compared to FY2012. NIH's areas of emphasis for FY2014 include investing in basic research, with 53% of the proposed budget allocated to this area. Additionally, $40 million was requested for the new BRAIN initiative in neurosciences. The Senate committee supported the Administration's priorities for NIH funding in FY2014, with most institutes receiving a 1% increase. $41 million was requested for the Big Data to Knowledge program. The National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) received a $91 million increase in its budget for FY2014. The Senate committee approved a $661 million budget for NIH in FY2014, a 15% increase over FY2012. Over $40 million of the increase would go to expanding the Cures Acceleration Network. NIH is focusing on recruiting and retaining diverse scientific talent with a new Workforce Diversity Initiative funded at $32 million. The NIH budget for FY2014 includes funding for a new Workforce Diversity Initiative and the Ruth L. Kirschstein National Research Service Awards. The budget summary emphasizes the economic benefits of health research and highlights global competition in the sciences. The NIH budget for FY2014 includes increased funding for Alzheimer's disease research, with a focus on implementing the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease. The budget also includes a significant increase in funding for the National Institute on Aging, specifically for research on Alzheimer's disease. The Senate committee recommended a 6% increase for NIA, while the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014 provided a 4.5% increase. The NIH budget for FY2014 includes increased funding for Alzheimer's disease research and the National Institute on Aging. The IDeA program received $273 million, slightly lower than the requested $276 million. The Senate committee recommended restoring the FY2012 level of funding for IDeA. In FY2014, the Administration planned to cut $26 million from NIH STEM programs, including a $15.4 million reduction in the Science Education Partnership Awards program. The Senate committee and H.R. 3547 directed NIH to continue funding the programs. The FY2014 request for the Office of the Director included new funding for the Common Fund and strategic initiatives, such as $31 million for a Biomedical Innovation Opportunities-Fund. The Common Fund's request was $573 million, $28 million higher than FY2012, including funding for the new BD2K. The FY2014 budget for NIH included $573 million for the Common Fund, with an increase of $28 million from FY2012. The budget requested $16.9 billion for Research Project Grants, a 2% increase from FY2012 and a 9% increase from FY2013. This would support an estimated 36,610 RPG awards, including 10,269 competing RPGs. In FY2014, the average cost of a competing RPG is estimated to be about $456,000, up from $421,000 in FY2012. The increase is mainly due to high-cost HIV/AIDS Clinical Trials Networks grants. NIH proposed continuing the FY2012 grant awards policy of eliminating inflation increases for future year commitments to maximize new and competing grants. Adjustments for special needs would still be accommodated. The Senate committee and the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014 did not comment on specific funding mechanisms. The Appropriations Act, 2014 (P.L. 113-76) did not specify funding mechanisms or grants policies. The Administration requested $12.618 billion for Department of Energy R&D in FY2014, with programs in science, national security, and energy. The House bill proposed $9.888 billion, the Senate committee recommended $12.219 billion, and the enacted appropriation was $11.767 billion. The request for the DOE Office of Science was $5.153 billion, an 11.5% increase from FY2013. No authorized funding level for FY2014 was specified. The House bill proposed $4.653 billion for FY2013 appropriations, which the Administration warned would lead to funding cuts and facility closures. The Senate committee recommended the requested amount, and the enacted appropriation was $5.071 billion. The Obama Administration now aims to increase funding for the Office of Science and other agencies, moving away from the previous goal of doubling funding. The FY2014 request for the Office of Science was 42% higher than the previous year. The Office of Science saw a significant increase in funding from FY2006 to FY2016, with the FY2014 request being 42% higher than the baseline. The enacted appropriation was 40% above the baseline, with the largest program, basic energy sciences, receiving a $261 million increase. Plans were announced for new Energy Frontier Research Centers with a $169 million allocation. The final appropriation for BES was $1.713 billion. The final appropriation for Energy Frontier Research Centers (EFRCs) was up to $100 million, with $100 million recommended by the Senate committee. In the Basic Energy Sciences (BES) program, funds were allocated for DOE synchrotron light sources and construction of the Linac Coherent Light Source II (LCLS-II). The LCLS-II received $75.7 million, lower than the requested $95 million. Additionally, $10 million was allocated for the Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) in the BES Materials Sciences and Engineering program. The request proposed to increase the U.S. contribution to the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) from $105 million in FY2012 to $225 million in FY2014. The U.S. share of ITER was estimated to be between $1.45 billion and $2.2 billion in 2008, with costs likely increasing due to delays and changes. DOE believes $225 million per year will meet obligations up to ITER's \"first plasma\" milestone, totaling $2.4 billion. Funding for U.S. ITER in FY2014 was offset by a decrease in domestic fusion activities, including no funding for the Alcator C-Mod tokamak. The House bill proposed less funding for the U.S. contribution to ITER but more for domestic fusion activities, including operations at Alcator C-Mod. The Senate committee recommended funding for ITER contingent on a cost estimate, while the final appropriation included funding for both ITER and Alcator C-Mod. The joint explanatory statement directed DOE to submit a strategic fusion plan assuming U.S. participation in ITER. The strategic fusion plan assumes U.S. participation in ITER and assesses funding priorities for the domestic fusion program in various budget scenarios. The request for biological and environmental research in the Office of Science was $625 million, divided between two programs: biological systems science and climate and environmental sciences. The final appropriation was $610 million, with no specific allocation mentioned between the two programs. The DOE national security R&D funding request saw a 9.9% increase to $3.283 billion, with differences in proposed amounts between the House and Senate. The increase was mainly for the Naval Reactors program, including operations, infrastructure, and construction funding for projects like the Spent Fuel Handling Recapitalization. The House bill provided less funding for Naval Reactors than requested and excluded the Recapitalization project, while the Senate committee recommended more funding. The final appropriation for Naval Reactors was $1.095 billion, with no funds allocated for the Spent Fuel Handling Recapitalization project. In the Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation account, the Senate committee recommended an increase of $20 million for advanced nuclear detection technologies, bringing the total appropriation to $399 million. The Administration requested changes in funding for nuclear weapons science and inertial confinement fusion research. The final appropriation for weapons activities was $1.672 billion, with similar allocations to the House bill. The request for DOE energy R&D was $4.182 billion, up 31.9% from the previous year. The final appropriation for energy R&D was $3.508 billion, with increases in funding for R&D in the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy. The funding for R&D in the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE) increased by 58% from $1.599 billion in FY2013 to $2.528 billion in FY2014. The Senate committee recommended $2.034 billion, with a focus on Advanced Manufacturing receiving $365 million, including funds for Clean Energy Manufacturing Innovation Institutes. Other areas for funding increases in EERE included batteries, energy storage, solar power, biofuels production, and grid integration for energy efficiency. The House bill proposed decreased funding for most EERE programs except for Advanced Manufacturing, which saw a $120 million increase. The Senate committee recommended $126 million for Advanced Manufacturing and directed the termination of the Energy Efficient Buildings Hub. The Administration's proposed decrease in fossil energy R&D funding was mainly from the coal program. The final appropriation included a $141 million increase, mostly directed towards the coal program. The House bill proposed decreased funding for most EERE programs except for Advanced Manufacturing, which saw a $120 million increase. The Senate committee recommended $126 million for Advanced Manufacturing and directed the termination of the Energy Efficient Buildings Hub. The final appropriation included a $141 million increase, mostly directed towards the coal program. The request for ARPA-E was $379 million, an increase of $104 million or 38%. Despite a reduction in funding, the House committee remains supportive of ARPA-E's efforts. The final appropriation for ARPA-E was $280 million. The National Science Foundation (NSF) supports basic research and education in the non-medical sciences and engineering. The National Science Foundation (NSF) is a key source of federal support for university research in fields like mathematics and computer science. It also plays a significant role in federal STEM education programs and student aid. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014 allocated $7.172 billion to the NSF, with differing recommendations from the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations. The National Science Foundation (NSF) received a total of $7.426 billion in funding for FY2014. The budget priorities included programs like Cyber-enabled Materials, Manufacturing, and Smart Systems (CEMMSS), Cyberinfrastructure Framework for 21st Century Science, Engineering, and Education (CIF21), and NSF Innovation Corps (I-Corps) with increased funding requests compared to previous years. The FY2014 budget requests for NSF programs showed significant increases compared to FY2012 actual amounts. I-Corps had a $18.1 million increase, INSPIRE had a $33.9 million increase, SEES had a $65.3 million increase, and SaTC had a $3.1 million decrease. Overall NSF budget increases since FY2006 have been driven by a \"doubling path policy\" to double funding for NSF and other science agencies. The doubling path policy aimed to increase funding for targeted accounts, but actual funding levels have not reached authorized levels. Some legislators are concerned about the feasibility of doubling the NSF budget, while others argue that without the policy, funding levels may have decreased. Congress has not reauthorized the doubling path policy as of the date of this report. The NSF budget is divided into different accounts, including Research and Related Activities (R&RA), which is the largest NSF account providing research funding. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014 allocated $5.809 billion for R&RA in FY2014, an increase from the previous year. The Administration initially requested $6.212 billion for R&RA, emphasizing support for research priorities like advanced manufacturing and cybersecurity. The House Committee on Appropriations recommended $5.676 billion for R&RA in FY2014. The NSF budget for Research and Related Activities (R&RA) in FY2014 was recommended at $5.676 billion by the House Committee on Appropriations and $6.018 billion by the Senate Committee on Appropriations. In FY2013, NSF consolidated R&RA sub-accounts, resulting in 8 directorates and offices from the previous 11. The FY2014 request for R&RA included increases for all major sub-accounts, with the largest increase in the International and Integrative Activities account (IIA) at $536.6 million, primarily for the Graduate Research Fellowship (GRF). The Engineering (ENG) directorate also saw a significant increase to $911.1 million. The Administration sought $911.1 million for the Engineering (ENG) directorate in FY2014, with a third of the growth attributed to small business research programs in the Division of Industrial Innovation and Partnerships. The Joint Explanatory Statement (JES) accepted proposed terminations and reductions in Research and Related Activities (R&RA), provided funding for the International Ocean Discovery Program, and rejected Senate report limits on OneNSF initiatives. The House report allocated $13.9 million for new investments in cognitive science and neuroscience research and supported a temporary reduction in Antarctic research funding for safety and management implementation. The Senate report recommended full funding for SEES ($222.8 million) and EPSCoR ($163.6 million) in FY2014. The FY2014 request for AST was $243.6 million, with the Senate expecting full support for scientific and education activities in the Division of Astronomical Sciences. The FY2014 request for SBE was $272.4 million, $18.2 million more than FY2012. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014 did not specify funding for SBE. In FY2013, NSF was prohibited from funding certain SBE grants without promoting national security or economic interest. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014 provided $846.5 million to E&HR in FY2014, $13.2 million more than FY2013. In FY2014, E&HR funding for STEM education at NSF increased to $846.5 million, $13.2 million more than FY2013. The House Committee recommended $825.0 million, while the Senate Committee recommended $880.3 million. Approximately 44.0% of the FY2014 E&HR request would support R&D activities, showing an increasing trend in R&D funding. The Administration proposed a reorganization and consolidation of federal STEM education programs in FY2014, with NSF playing a leadership role. In FY2014, NSF would have led federal STEM education efforts, with a focus on undergraduate and graduate education. The proposed changes included the establishment of the CAUSE program, expansion of the GRF for research fellowships, and the creation of the NRT to replace the IGERT. Funding requests included $123.1 million for CAUSE and $325.1 million for the NGRF. The Administration sought funding for federal STEM education programs in FY2014, including $123.1 million for CAUSE, $325.1 million for the NGRF, and $55.1 million for the NRT. The JES and appropriations committees rejected the reorganization plan, directing OSTP to reexamine other options. The Senate deferred action on the reorganization pending STEM program assessments required by the America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2010. The House report rejected the establishment of the CAUSE program or transition to a federal government-wide GRF program. The NSF's MREFC account received $200.0 million in FY2014, supporting projects like the Advanced Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory and Ocean Observatories Initiative. Funding for projects like the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope, Advanced Technology Solar Telescope, and National Ecological Observatory Network would continue. The House report provided funding for ongoing projects like the Advanced Technology Solar Telescope and National Ecological Observatory Network. The Senate report supported the start of construction for the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST). The Joint Explanatory Statement (JES) authorized funding for the LSST and allowed NSF to submit a transfer proposal if additional funds were needed. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014 allocated funds for various accounts within NSF. The FY2014 NSF budget request also included funding for the National Nanotechnology Initiative and other multi-agency initiatives. The FY2014 budget included funding for NASA R&D, with the final appropriation at $16.445 billion. There is no authorized level for NASA funding in FY2014. Bills that would authorize FY2014 appropriations for NASA include H.R. 2687, H.R. 2616, and S. 1317. The FY2014 request for Science was $5.018 billion, a 4.9% increase from FY2013. The FY2014 budget for NASA included funding for Science at $5.018 billion, a 4.9% increase from the previous year. The House and Senate committees recommended different amounts for Planetary Science, with specific allocations for near-Earth object observation and plutonium-238 production. Congressional policymakers debated whether NASA or DOE should fund plutonium-238 production. The House committee recommended increases for Mars and outer planets exploration, while the Senate committee focused on Mars exploration. The final appropriation for Planetary Science in the FY2014 budget was $1.345 billion, with increases for Mars exploration and outer planets. For Earth Science, the House committee recommended $1.659 billion, excluding funds for proposed Landsat and NOAA activities, while the Senate committee recommended funds for land imaging but expressed concerns. The final appropriation for Earth Science in the FY2014 budget was $1.826 billion. NASA was directed to submit a plan for implementing future Landsat satellites at lower cost. The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) received a requested $658.2 million, with FY2014 expected to be the peak funding year. Congress capped the formulation and development cost of JWST and mandated annual reports on the program. The House committee recommended $584.0 million for JWST in FY2014. The House committee recommended $584.0 million for JWST in FY2014, while the Senate committee recommended the requested amount. The final appropriation was the requested amount. The request for Aeronautics was $565.7 million, a 6.8% increase from the FY2013 operating plan. NASA planned to explore options for the future of its rotorcraft research in the Fundamental Aeronautics program. The House committee recommended $566.0 million for Aeronautics, while the Senate committee recommended $558.7 million. The final appropriation was $566.0 million. The Administration requested $742.6 million for Space Technology, a 20.8% increase from the FY2013 operating plan to support existing projects. The request for Exploration in FY2014 was $3.916 billion, with funds allocated for the development of the Orion Multipurpose Crew Vehicle and the Space Launch System. The final appropriation for this account was $576.0 million, which was lower than the House and Senate committee recommendations. Additionally, funds were included to accelerate the development of high-power solar electric propulsion technology for future spacecraft. The FY2014 budget request for NASA included $821.4 million for commercial crew, a 56.5% increase from FY2013, and $2.730 billion for Orion, the SLS, and related systems, a 5.3% decrease. There was controversy over the apparent difference in priorities between Congress and the Administration. NASA stated that the funding was consistent with planned schedules for both programs. The House committee recommended $3.612 billion, with $500 million for commercial crew and $2.825 billion for Exploration Systems Development. The Senate committee recommended $4.209 billion for NASA, with $775 million for commercial crew and $3.118 billion for Exploration Systems Development. The final appropriation was $4.113 billion, including $696 million for commercial crew and $3.115 billion for Exploration Systems Development. The ISS account received $3.049 billion, an increase of 9.8% from the previous year. The House committee recommended $2.860 billion, while the Senate committee supported the requested amount. The final appropriation for the ISS was approximately $2.955 billion. NASA proposed a mission to capture a small asteroid robotically and explore it with astronauts. The FY2014 budget included funding for a proposed mission to capture a small asteroid, redirect it to orbit around the Moon, and explore it with astronauts. The House report deemed the asteroid mission \"premature\" and did not include the requested increases for it, while the Senate report did not mention it. NASA described the mission as an \"emerging concept\" and had not provided Congress with all the details. The joint explanatory statement expressed concerns about NASA's asteroid mission concept, stating that more justification and groundwork are needed before a long-term commitment. NIST, a Department of Commerce laboratory, aims to enhance U.S. companies' competitiveness through technology support and diffusion. The President's FY2014 budget requested $928.2 million for NIST, including $693.7 million for research and development. In FY2014, NIST received $850.0 million in funding, which was $80.6 million higher than FY2013 but $78.3 million lower than the President's request. This funding included $651.0 million for research and development in the STRS account, $153.1 million for the MEP program, $21.4 million for AMTech, and $60.0 million for construction. In FY2014, NIST received $850.0 million in funding, $80.6 million higher than FY2013 but $78.3 million lower than the President's request. The Industrial Technology Services (ITS) account received $143.0 million, up $9.4 million from FY2013. The Manufacturing Extensions Partnership (MEP) program received $128 million, $8.6 million above FY2013. The Advanced Manufacturing Technology Consortia (AMTech) received $15 million. The Construction of Research Facilities (CRF) account received $56.0 million, the same as FY2013. The House Committee on Appropriations recommended funding NIST at $784.0 million, 15.5% below the budget request. The Senate Committee on Appropriations report included $947.5 million for NIST, 2.1% more than proposed by the President. Funding for STRS would have been $703.0 million, 1.3% higher than the budget request. MEP support would have been $153.1 million, the same as the Administration's proposal, while AMTech would have received $31.4 million, a 46.7% increase over the President's recommendation. Construction funding remained at $60.0 million. The Administration proposed two new programs funded through mandatory appropriations: $100 million for NIST's Wireless Innovation Fund and $1 billion for the National Network for Manufacturing Innovation. However, P.L. 113-76 did not provide funding for these programs. The extramural programs, such as the Manufacturing Extension Partnership and AMTech, have faced skepticism from some Members of Congress. There have been proposals to eliminate these activities due to budget pressures. The Advanced Technology Program was replaced by the Technology Innovation Program, which operated until funding was withdrawn in FY2012. Spending increases for NIST laboratories have been minimal, despite their essential research role. The American Competitiveness Initiative, announced in 2006, aimed to support these efforts. The Administration planned to double funding for innovation-enabling research at NIST over 10 years, as stated by former President Bush in 2006. President Obama later indicated a similar intention to double the budget of key science agencies, including NIST, over the next decade. However, the timeframe for doubling slipped to 11 years in Obama's FY2011 budget, and there was no mention of doubling in the FY2014 budget request. NOAA, under the Commerce Department, conducts scientific research on ecosystems, climate, weather, and oceans. NOAA, created in 1970, focuses on managing coastal and marine environments. Their R&D efforts target climate, weather, air quality, and ocean resources. President Obama requested a 35.0% increase in R&D funding for FY2014, totaling $733.0 million, to support NOAA's strategic goals. The R&D request for FY2014 included $503.9 million for research, $65.7 million for development, and $163.4 million for R&D equipment. Excluding equipment, $393 million would fund intramural programs and $177 million would fund extramural programs. NOAA's administrative structure consists of five line offices: NOS, NMFS, NESDIS, NWS, and OAR. OAR is the primary center for R&D within NOAA, accounting for 61.9% of NOAA's R&D funding in FY2013. The President's FY2014 request would have provided OAR with $438.7 million in R&D funding. The President's FY2014 request would have provided OAR with $438.7 million in R&D funding, which is 59.9% of total R&D funding requested by NOAA and 92.9% of OAR's total budget request of $472.4 million. The appropriations bills and final Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014 do not specify the R&D funding levels for NOAA, but total agency and OAR funding have been provided for context. The Administration's FY2014 budget request for USDA's Research, Education, and Economics mission area was $2.81 billion, up from $2.40 billion in FY2013. Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack emphasized the importance of increasing investment in research and education to boost farm productivity and rural economies. The House and Senate committees recommended $2.51 billion and $2.64 billion for combined appropriations. The omnibus appropriations act (P.L. 113-76) provided $2.64 billion for the REE mission area, the highest level since FY2010. The Agricultural Research Service (ARS) received $1.28 billion in the President's FY2014 budget request, with the House and Senate committees recommending $1.07 billion and $1.12 billion respectively. ARS focuses on research for efficient food production, pest management, and regulatory programs. The omnibus appropriations act provided $1.12 billion for FY2014, with a proposed $155 million to replace the agency's Southeast Poultry Disease Research Laboratory. The President also requested funding for additional research priorities and proposed closing six selected laboratories to redirect funding towards agency research priorities. The National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) was established in the 2008 farm bill to develop partnerships for agricultural research and education. NIFA distributes funds to various institutions for research, education, and outreach in the agricultural sector. Funding for research at various institutions is distributed through competitive awards, formula funding, and special grants. The FY2014 request for NIFA was $1.29 billion, with the omnibus appropriations act providing $1.28 billion. The FY2014 act directed the department to include additional information in the FY2015 budget for research and extension grants. In FY2014, the President requested $383 million for NIFA's competitive grant program AFRI, with $316 million provided in the omnibus appropriations act. AFRI focuses on plant and animal health, agricultural systems, bioenergy, food safety, nutrition, and health. Major initiatives included support for food and agriculture-related workforce development, water research, food security, nutrition, obesity prevention, and food safety with a focus on minimizing antibiotic resistance transmission. The President requested $8 million to modernize NIFA's grant management systems for better research tracking. The budget proposed reorganizing STEM programs, with NSF leading undergraduate and graduate education, DOE focusing on K-12 education, and the Smithsonian on informal education. NIFA's STEM programs would be transferred to these agencies. In the omnibus appropriations act, Congress did not adopt the plan to reorganize STEM education programs due to incomplete details. The FY2014 budget proposes $78.5 million for ERS, supporting economic and social science analysis on agriculture and rural development. The President proposed $159.6 million for the National Agricultural Statistics Service in FY2014. The FY2014 budget allocated $161.2 million for the National Agricultural Statistics Service, with additional funding for high-priority reports. Congress also provided $811.0 million for research and development to the Department of the Interior, supporting scientific monitoring and research efforts. The Department of the Interior (DOI) received $811.0 million in FY2014 for research and development, primarily allocated to the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). This funding supports various activities such as energy permitting, ecosystem management, oil spill restoration, Earth observations, invasive species control, and tribal natural resource management. The Department of the Interior (DOI) received $811.0 million in FY2014 for research and development, primarily allocated to the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). USGS R&D funding levels are determined by DOI agencies after appropriations are allocated. The President requested $1.167 billion for USGS for FY2014, including $760.5 million for R&D across various program areas. In FY2014, the USGS received $1.167 billion, with $760.5 million allocated for R&D, an increase of $87.7 million (13.0%) from FY2012. The largest increases in R&D funding were for Ecosystems, Climate and Land Use Change, and Core Science Systems. Division G of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014 provided $1.032 billion for USGS Surveys, Investigations, and Research, including $648.1 million for research and development. Ecosystems saw the largest increase in funding, while Water Resources saw a decrease. In FY2014, research and development funding for various agencies included: $30.5 million for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, $42.0 million for the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, $26.1 million for the National Park Service, $27.1 million for the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement, $15.8 million for the Bureau of Land Management, $16.6 million for the Bureau of Reclamation, and $6.0 million for the Office of Wildland Fire. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency funds research and development activities to support environmental pollution control laws. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) conducts research and development activities to provide scientific tools and knowledge for preventing, regulating, and abating environmental pollution. EPA's scientific research activities, including R&D and related evaluations, are funded through the agency's Science and Technology appropriations account. Funding for EPA R&D is included in line-items of appropriations bills, making it difficult to determine the exact allocation for R&D specifically. The Science and Technology appropriations account is funded by a base appropriation and a transfer from the Hazardous Substance Superfund account for research on cleaning up contaminated sites. No regular appropriations bill for FY2014 was introduced in the House or Senate. The House Appropriations Committee began markup of a draft bill, while the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee released a draft bill for FY2014. EPA and other agencies operated under two continuing resolutions before the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014 was enacted. Title II of Division G under the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014 provided $778.4 million for the EPA S&T account for FY2014, which was $29.1 million less than the requested amount but $12.9 million above the FY2013 enacted level. The funding represented 9.5% of the agency's overall appropriations for FY2014. The Joint Explanatory Statement for Division G of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014 provided additional guidance to EPA within the S&T account. This included directives on Endocrine Disruptor Research, implementing NAS recommendations for IRIS assessments, and increasing public access to federally funded scientific research results. The FY2014 appropriations for the S&T account were below the requested levels but above the FY2013 post-sequestration levels, with a few exceptions. The $155.0 million allocated for \"Research: Sustainable Healthy Communities\" exceeded the requested amount but was less than the provided amount. The FY2014 funding for \"Homeland Security\" and \"Enforcement\" program areas was less than both the requested and FY2013 levels. P.L. 113-76 included $4.2 million for \"Research: National Priorities\" for water quality research grants. Some activities in the EPA S&T account remained relatively flat compared to the FY2014 request and FY2013 appropriations. The Office of Management and Budget reports historical and projected budget authority amounts for R&D at EPA, but it is not clear how these amounts relate to the funding for specific EPA program activities. R&D at EPA is managed primarily by the Office of Research and Development, with a large portion of the S&T account funds allocated to R&D activities. The EPA's account funds R&D activities managed by ORD, including research laboratories and grants. The Department of Transportation funds transportation-related R&D, with FHWA and FAA receiving the majority of funding. President Obama requested $940.6 million for DOT R&D in FY2014. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014 (P.L. 113-76) provided funding for the Department of Transportation (DOT) and other federal agencies for FY2014. The FAA budget justification requested $340.7 million for R&D in FY2014, but Congress allocated $158.8 million for the FAA Research, Engineering, and Development (RE&D) account, which was $7.2 million less than the request. The RE&D budget for aviation safety, economic competitiveness, and environmental sustainability was allocated $158.8 million in FY2014, $7.2 million less than the request. Within this budget, $87.2 million was provided for aviation safety improvement, $24.3 million for economic competitiveness, and $41.6 million for environmental sustainability. The House committee recommended $145.0 million, while the Senate committee recommended $160.0 million for RE&D. No funding was provided for the Joint Planning and Development Office (JPDO). The President requested $379.8 million for R&D funding for the FHWA in FY2014. The President requested $379.8 million in FY2014 R&D funding for the FHWA, which proposed restructuring its research, development, and technology activities into three programs. The House and Senate Committees on Appropriations recommended the requested amount for FHWA, with the Senate also proposing an additional $500 million for bridges in critical condition. Final R&D funding figures were not available at the time of the report. Congress provided $14.8 million for the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Research. The President's FY2014 request included funding of $14.8 million for the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Research and Technology, which aimed to improve coordination and collaboration among transportation administrations. The House committee endorsed the proposal to transfer the functions of the Research and Innovative Technology Administration to this new office. The House committee recommended $14.2 million for the new Office of the Assistant Secretary for Research and Technology, responsible for coordinating research and development programs, PNT technology, managing GPS systems, and overseeing various transportation programs. The Senate committee also supported moving RITA to this new office under the direction of an Assistant Secretary for Research and Technology. In FY2014, Congress recommended funding of $14.8 million for the Federal Railroad Administration R&D, doubling the budget to $90.8 million. This included support for high-performance rail R&D, a National Cooperative Research Program, and Workforce Development R&D activities. The proposed Railroad Research, Development, and Technology account was not included in the funding act. Congress appropriated $43 million for the Federal Transit Administration's research program, with $40 million for the national research program and $3 million for the cooperative research program. The President's request included $17.2 million for R&D, aiming to redirect funding for technology investments to R&D activities. The House recommended $20.0 million for the RDD&D account, while the Senate committee recommended $43.3 million. Additionally, the House committee suggested extending FTA's authorities under MAP-21 to support grants for new technologies promoting clean energy and low-emission vehicles."
