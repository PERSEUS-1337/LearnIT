    "content": "SECTION 1. COLLECTION OF PAST-DUE LEGALLY ENFORCEABLE LOCAL GOVERNMENT TAX OBLIGATIONS. Section 6402 of the Internal Revenue Code is amended to allow the Secretary to collect past-due local government tax obligations from overpayments. The Secretary can collect past-due local government tax obligations from overpayments by notifying the State or eligible local government, providing necessary details, and reducing the overpayment amount accordingly. The overpayment reduction priorities include internal revenue tax liability, past-due support, debts to Federal agencies, State income tax obligations, and other specified debts. The overpayment reduction priorities include applying overpayments to covered unemployment compensation debts before future federal tax liabilities. States must consider evidence before taking action on behalf of local governments for debt collection. The government must notify individuals with past-due local government tax obligations by certified mail, allowing them 60 days to dispute the debt before taking action. The local government must notify individuals with past-due tax obligations by certified mail and give them 60 days to dispute the debt before taking action. The government must also ensure that certain conditions are met to validate the determination of the tax obligation. The local government must notify individuals with past-due tax obligations by certified mail and give them 60 days to dispute the debt before taking action. The government must also ensure that certain conditions are met to validate the determination of the tax obligation, including considering evidence presented and making efforts to obtain payment. A past-due, legally enforceable local government tax obligation refers to a tax debt resulting from a court judgment or administrative hearing determining the amount due to a local government, no longer subject to judicial review, or from an assessed but uncollected tax imposed by a local government. The Secretary will issue regulations for the submission of past-due local government tax obligations by States and eligible local governments. Regulations will specify the required information and debt thresholds for the reduction procedure. The reduction procedure established by paragraph (1) may be applied, with regulations possibly requiring States and eligible local governments to pay a fee to reimburse the Secretary. Any fee paid shall be used to reimburse appropriations for the cost of applying the procedure. If an erroneous payment is made to a State or local government, they must promptly repay the Secretary according to regulations. The reduction procedure may require States and local governments to reimburse the Secretary for any erroneous payments promptly. Amendments to the Internal Revenue Code include disclosure of return information and conforming amendments. Amendments to section 6402 of the Internal Revenue Code include adding subsections (g) and (h) and updating subsections (h) and (j). The effective date for these changes is after the enactment of the Act."
