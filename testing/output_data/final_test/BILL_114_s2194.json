Congress finds that nearly half of the world's population uses traditional cookstoves and open fires, leading to health issues such as respiratory illnesses and increased mortality rates. The Global Burden of Disease Study 2010 doubled the mortality estimates for exposure to smoke from cookstoves, indicating over 4 million deaths annually. The Global Burden of Disease Study highlights the significant impact of cookstove smoke exposure, attributing millions of deaths annually to indoor and outdoor pollution. Household air pollution is ranked as a major health risk factor, especially for women and girls in developing regions of Asia and Africa. Recent studies show that the demand for biomass cooking fuel can reach up to 2 tons per family annually, leading to local environmental degradation and loss of biodiversity. Women and children spend significant time collecting fuel, risking violence and rape in some areas. Black carbon from traditional cookstoves is a major contributor to regional pollution. The Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves, a partnership hosted by the United Nations Foundation, aims to promote clean and efficient stoves in developing countries to reduce black carbon emissions and improve public health. The United States Government has also invested in this initiative. The United States Government has invested over $114 million in the Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves to promote clean cookstoves and fuels in developing countries. This includes funding for research, field implementation activities, and financing. Support for the sector is anticipated to increase to $175 million for the next 5 years, with contributions from various government agencies. The United States Government has invested in promoting clean cookstoves and fuels in developing countries, with funding from various agencies totaling over $114 million. Additional funding includes $5,000,000 from the Department of Health and Human Services, $15,000,000 from the Environmental Protection Agency, and up to $50,000,000 from the Overseas Private Investment Corporation for projects supporting energy access and savings through cookstoves. This commitment aims to support research on cookstoves performance, marketing, adoption, and their impact on health, climate, and air quality. The United States Government has invested over $114 million in promoting clean cookstoves and fuels in developing countries. Additional federal support may be provided by various agencies, including the Department of Energy, Department of Agriculture, and National Science Foundation. The Millennium Challenge Corporation committed $45,300,000 to Mongolia for economic growth through energy efficiency and improved air quality. SEC. 3. ADVANCEMENT OF GLOBAL ALLIANCE FOR CLEAN COOKSTOVES GOAL. The Secretary of State, in collaboration with various federal agencies and international organizations, will support the Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves by conducting research, improving design, lowering costs, promoting technology adoption, and establishing industry standards for cookstoves and fuels. The Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves is supported by the Secretary of State and various agencies to ensure efficiency and cleanliness standards are met. This includes diplomatic engagement, international development projects, efforts in refugee camps and disaster relief, and financing for clean energy projects. SEC. 4. AUTHORIZATIONS OF APPROPRIATIONS. From 2016 through 2020, funds are authorized for the Department of State and United States Agency for International Development to work with the Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves and foreign governments. This includes engaging in diplomatic activities to support clean cookstoves and fuels, as well as reducing emissions of short-lived climate pollutants. The Department of Energy is authorized to appropriate funds for research on affordable, low-emission cookstoves and biomass fuels to improve health, reduce environmental degradation, and empower women. The Department of Energy is authorized to appropriate funds for research on affordable, low-emission cookstoves and biomass fuels to improve health, reduce environmental degradation, and empower women. Additionally, the National Institutes of Health is authorized to work with the Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves to support health research and training for those at risk from household burning of solid fuels. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is authorized to appropriate funds to work with the Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves to evaluate cookstove and fuel programs for public health benefits and adoption determinants. The Environmental Protection Agency is authorized to appropriate funds to work with the Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves to conduct cookstove and fuel testing for environmental and health benefits. The Environmental Protection Agency is authorized to appropriate funds for research on air pollutant emissions, climate benefits of cookstoves, and other related activities. The National Science Foundation is also authorized to receive funds for climate, health, and air quality research for fiscal years 2016 through 2020. The National Science Foundation and the Department of Agriculture are authorized to receive funds for research and activities related to clean cookstoves and fuels for fiscal years 2016 through 2020. This includes supporting research on climate, air quality, health benefits, providing technical expertise on policy questions, and aligning with international efforts promoting sustainable production and use of clean burning biomass cooking fuels. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is authorized to receive funds for fiscal years 2016 through 2020 to work with the Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves. This includes monitoring global black carbon emissions, assessing climate impacts, and partnering with scientists in other countries. Additionally, the Peace Corps is authorized to receive funds for activities related to clean cookstoves. The Peace Corps is authorized to receive funds for fiscal years 2016 through 2020 to work with the Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves. This includes training community members to select, construct, and maintain clean cookstoves and fuels, providing ongoing support, and helping access grants to lower costs."
