    "content": "The living resources provisions of UNCLOS recognize international interdependence on fish, shellfish, sea turtles, and marine mammals. Articles 61 through 73 cover conservation, exploitation, transboundary stocks, highly migratory stocks, marine mammals, and rights of landlocked and geographically disadvantaged nations. Sedentary continental shelf species are addressed in Article 77(4). Living resources on the high seas are covered in Articles 116-120 of UNCLOS, while marine habitat protection is provided by Articles 192-196. These provisions align with current U.S. policy on marine resource management, conservation, and exploitation under the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. However, there is a growing complexity in ocean policy within UNCLOS, with limited U.S. involvement to address concerns. The U.S. government, particularly the U.S. Coast Guard, dedicates significant resources to enforcing fishing and living resources laws in the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) across various regions. The living resource provisions of UNCLOS do not impose significant new obligations on the US, but could offer new privileges related to international ocean policy. US participation in UNCLOS could lead to increased stability in international marine resource policy without requiring new domestic legislation. Coastal nations have broad authority over living resources in their territorial sea and EEZ under UNCLOS. The UNCLOS grants coastal nations authority over living resources in their territorial sea and EEZ up to 200 miles from the baselines. The terms maximum sustainable yield and optimum utilization are open to interpretation, potentially requiring further definition for sustainable resource management. UNCLOS leans towards optimal resource exploitation with little consideration for non-consumptive management objectives. The UNCLOS emphasizes optimal resource exploitation but lacks consideration for non-consumptive management goals like tourism in reef environments or biodiversity conservation. Valid reasons for refraining from harvesting to achieve non-consumptive goals or respond to moral/ethical concerns are not explicitly acknowledged. The determination of allowable catch within a coastal nation's EEZ is not subject to compulsory procedures leading to binding dispute settlement. Under UNCLOS, if a coastal nation is unable to harvest the entire allowable catch, other nations must be given access to these resources. The U.S. Fishery Conservation and Management Act of 1976 closely mirrors most of the draft UNCLOS's provisions for living resources. UNCLOS encourages attention to associated or dependent species, including incidental bycatch concerns. Attention to ocean ecosystems reflects the complex web of biological relationships, with marine conservation regimes managing living resources from an \"ecosystem\" approach. Straddling fish stocks are managed cooperatively through international agreements involving coastal nations and those fishing in international waters. The United States aligns with these efforts. The United States participates in international agreements to manage transboundary fish stocks, such as the Convention on the Conservation and Management of Pollock Resources in the Central Bering Sea and the 1953 Convention for the Preservation of the Halibut Fishery. Concerns persist over cooperative management of anchovy fisheries along the United States-Mexico Pacific boundary. The United States amended its policy in 1990 to align with UNCLOS by extending national jurisdiction to include tunas, in accordance with the Sea of 10 December 1982 treaty. This treaty calls for cooperative management of highly migratory species to ensure their conservation and promote their optimum harvest. The U.S. is party to agreements in both the Atlantic and Pacific oceans consistent with these provisions. In the Pacific, the 1950 Convention Between the United States of America and the Republic of Costa Rica for the Establishment of an Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission involves 21 member nations and 1 cooperating non-party (Cook Islands); a 2003 Convention for the Strengthening of the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission (Antigua Convention) has been ratified by 14 nations. The 1966 International Convention for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas involves 48 contracting parties and 5 cooperating non-contracting entities. The 1995 Straddling Stocks Agreement addresses concerns for highly migratory stocks in a manner consistent with UNCLOS and involves 80 nations. The Convention on the Conservation and Management of Highly Migratory Fish Stocks in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean was signed by 19 nations. The Convention on the Conservation and Management of Highly Migratory Fish Stocks in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean was signed by 19 nations in 2004. The United States is a signatory to all agreements related to marine mammals, except the Antigua Convention. International cooperation is mandated for the conservation of cetaceans, such as whales and dolphins, on the high seas. Protection for cetaceans is primarily managed through international organizations like the International Whaling Commission and CITES. Sea turtles are indirectly protected under UNCLOS due to their association with harvested species, with some provisions for threatened or endangered populations. Protection for sea turtles, similar to whales, includes trade restrictions under CITES. Anadromous species like salmon and sturgeon are primarily managed by nations where they originate, with fishing prohibited on the high seas. Coastal nations must cooperate for the protection of anadromous fish stocks. The United States cooperates with other nations to manage anadromous fish stocks that migrate through their waters. International agreements are used to enforce regulations beyond the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). Catadromous species like American eels are managed by coastal nations where they spend most of their lives. Sedentary species are addressed in UNCLOS Article 77(4), with coastal nations having jurisdiction over them. International cooperation is required for species that migrate through multiple EEZs. Article 77(4) of UNCLOS grants coastal nations jurisdiction over sedentary species beyond 200 miles, based on the continental shelf definition in Article 76. The lack of a specific list of sedentary species in UNCLOS can lead to disputes over access. Additional scientific research may be needed to understand the sedentary nature of shellfish like scallops. Protection for sedentary species is reinforced by Article 136, emphasizing the need to safeguard unique ecosystems like seamounts and hydrothermal vents. Article 136 of UNCLOS emphasizes protecting unique ecosystems like seamounts and hydrothermal vents to prevent damage to flora and fauna. Concerns may arise when nations share the continental shelf beyond 200 miles, such as potential conflicts between Russian and U.S. interests in developing a snail fishery in the Bering Sea's international waters. UNCLOS preserves fishing rights on the high seas, while also obligating cooperation in conserving and managing high seas living resources. This cooperation represents a new commitment for the United States. The United States' new commitment to the conservation and management of high seas living resources is subject to compulsory dispute settlement. The 1995 Straddling Stocks Agreement and the Agreement to Promote Compliance with International Conservation and Management Measures by Fishing Vessels on the High Seas extend the reach of UNCLOS by addressing specific concerns and limiting reflagging of vessels. The latter agreement entered into force in 2003 with 39 parties currently involved. The United States' commitment to conservation of high seas living resources is subject to dispute settlement. UNCLOS allows special access rights to surplus marine resources in EEZs for nearby developing nations. Coastal nations determine surplus availability and must protect the marine environment. Regional agreements may guide resource allocation to disadvantaged nations. Article 194(5) of UNCLOS emphasizes the protection of rare or fragile marine ecosystems and endangered species. Article 61(4) addresses bycatch and incidental catch, while Article 196 focuses on preventing the introduction of harmful alien species. Article 206 mandates environmental impact assessments for activities that may cause pollution. These measures aim to safeguard the marine environment and habitats. The UNCLOS addresses pollution to protect marine habitats by requiring parties to prevent, reduce, and control pollution from various sources. It also expands enforcement rights for port/coastal nations and emphasizes the protection of unique ecosystems like seamounts and hydrothermal vents. Article 297(3)(b) of UNCLOS provides assurances that domestic EEZ fisheries matters cannot be forced into compulsory dispute settlement proceedings, allowing coastal States to retain sovereignty over living resources and their management. Disputes can be submitted to conciliation instead of binding decisions. Article 297(3)(b) allows disputes on EEZ living resources to be submitted to conciliation under certain conditions, while Article 297(3)(c) prohibits the conciliation commission from substituting its discretion for that of the coastal nation. Conciliation procedures are outlined in Annex V, stating that the commission's report is not binding. The history of ITLOS and Article 292 for the prompt release of vessels are also relevant. The prompt release of vessels, including fishing vessels accused of unauthorized fishing in EEZ, can be applied for at ITLOS. These cases may actually involve fishery disputes. The provisions of UNCLOS align with current U.S. policy on marine resource management. Ratification by the U.S. could lead to a positive international response. The U.S. accession to UNCLOS would allow nomination of representatives to various bodies, address concerns about continental shelf boundaries, and enhance participation in global maritime organizations like the International Seabed Authority and ITLOS. Some suggest that if the United States ratifies UNCLOS, it could recognize the International Whaling Commission (IWC) as the main organization for regulating cetaceans, potentially empowering the IWC. However, there are concerns that U.S. ratification may complicate enforcement of domestic marine regulations due to uncertainties about the social and economic impacts of UNCLOS implementation. The United States is concerned about UNCLOS's language on access to surplus living resources and regulating ballast water discharges to combat invasive species. There are worries about potential constraints on preventive measures for ships operating outside territorial seas. Proponents argue that U.S. participation in international bodies could help prevent future conflicts. The International Seabed Authority and the Senate could address ambiguities in UNCLOS drafters' language through declarations and statements. This can help clarify U.S. policy and interpretations of UNCLOS, as discussed in a Senate Committee on Foreign Relations hearing on October 21, 2003."
