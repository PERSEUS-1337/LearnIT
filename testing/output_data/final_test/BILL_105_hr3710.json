    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Charles Butler McVay and U.S.S. INDIANAPOLIS Relief Act\" and includes findings. Shortly after midnight on July 30, 1945, the U.S.S. INDIANAPOLIS was torpedoed by a Japanese submarine, resulting in the worst sea disaster in U.S. naval history. Only 316 out of 1,196 crew members survived the attack and five-day ordeal at sea. Captain Charles Butler McVay III, the commanding officer, was later charged for the incident. Captain McVay, with a distinguished naval career, was convicted of negligence in the sinking of the USS INDIANAPOLIS despite extenuating circumstances. He had a commendable record from his graduation in 1919, through World War II, including leading the ship in major assaults. During World War II, the USS INDIANAPOLIS was involved in key missions, including transporting parts for atomic bombs and preparing for the assault on Japan. Captain McVay skillfully led the ship through various challenges, despite facing a damaging kamikaze attack. The Commander-in-Chief, Pacific Fleet (CINCPAC) failed to inform Captain McVay of intelligence regarding Japanese submarines in the area where the USS INDIANAPOLIS was sailing. Despite lacking submarine detection capabilities, Captain McVay requested a destroyer escort for the voyage to Leyte Gulf. The USS INDIANAPOLIS was denied a destroyer escort for its voyage to Leyte Gulf, becoming the first unescorted heavy warship to make the crossing during World War II. After the ship was sunk, Navy shore offices failed to report its overdue arrival, leaving around 950 survivors adrift for four days until they were spotted by a routine air patrol. The sinking of the INDIANAPOLIS threatened to overshadow the Navy's role in the Pacific victory and its post-war military status. The Department of the Navy court-martialed Captain McVay for losing his ship in combat in World War II, despite the fact that many ships were lost during the war. A rushed court of inquiry recommended issuing a Letter of Reprimand to Captain McVay. Captain McVay was court-martialed for failing to order the ship to maintain a zigzag course, despite evidence showing it would not have made a difference. The court-martial charge was based on this failure, even though standing orders did not require zigzagging in poor visibility. Captain McVay was convicted of negligence for not maintaining a zigzag course, but CINCPAC disagreed with the severity of the punishment. Despite the conviction, he continued on active duty until his retirement in 1949 with a final promotion to rear admiral. Rear Admiral Charles Butler McVay III (retired) died without exoneration for the sinking of the INDIANAPOLIS. Declassified Navy documents reveal he was not given crucial intelligence that could have prevented the disaster. Congress addressed this issue in 1993. In 1993, Congress recognized the U.S.S. INDIANAPOLIS as the national memorial to the historic warship and its final crew. In 1994, Congress acknowledged the ship's contributions to ending World War II and commended the dedication of the national memorial in Indianapolis in 1995. The U.S.S. INDIANAPOLIS was commended for its heroic service to the United States at a memorial in Indianapolis on July 30th, 1995. The Congress exonerates Rear Admiral Charles Butler McVay III from responsibility for the sinking of the U.S.S. INDIANAPOLIS in 1945, expresses that his court-martial conviction was unjust, and urges the President to grant a posthumous pardon. The Congress recommends awarding a Presidential Unit Citation to the final crew of the U.S.S. INDIANAPOLIS for their courage and fortitude after the ship was torpedoed and sunk in 1945. The citation can be awarded without time limitations."
