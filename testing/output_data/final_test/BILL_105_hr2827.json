    "content": "The \"Taxpayer Right-To-Know Act of 1997\" may be cited as the short title for this Act. The Congress finds that individual income taxes are a significant annual expense for many Americans, leading to uncertainty among taxpayers about how their tax dollars are spent. Taxpayers do not receive acknowledgment or itemized explanations from the IRS on how their taxes are allocated, contributing to a lack of knowledge about government spending and a less informed electorate. The Internal Revenue Service needs to update its technology and treat taxpayer information as a strategic asset to improve customer service. Taxpayer education by the IRS on how tax dollars are spent leads to increased compliance. The purposes of this Act include educating individual income tax filers on their contributions, improving understanding of the Federal Government, and enhancing satisfaction with the IRS. SEC. 3. ITEMIZED INCOME TAX RECEIPT. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to add a new section allowing taxpayers to request an itemized income tax receipt. The Secretary must provide taxpayers with an itemized receipt showing how their tax payments are allocated among major expenditure categories like national defense, international affairs, Medicaid, and Medicare. Total tax payments include taxes imposed by subtitle A and section 3101 on wages received during the taxable year. The tax receipt provided to taxpayers will detail how their tax payments are allocated among major expenditure categories such as Medicaid, Medicare, Social Security, and interest payments. Additional specific expenditure items may also be included to enhance taxpayer understanding of the Federal budget. Requests for a tax receipt must be made at the time of filing the tax return for the taxable year. The IRS is encouraged to use modern technologies like email and the Internet to provide tax receipts to taxpayers at no cost. Taxpayers can also generate their own income tax receipts through an interactive program on the IRS website. Regulations may be prescribed by the Secretary to implement this section. (b) Clerical Amendment.--The table of sections for chapter 77 of the Code is amended by adding a new item. The amendments made by this section apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 1997."
