    "content": "SECTION 1. FINDINGS. The Congress acknowledges that multinational corporations play a significant role in international trade and investment, with influence over developed and developing countries. They operate without accountability to national governments or international standards. Some multinational corporations, including those based in the United States, have adopted voluntary codes of conduct to promote socially responsible investment. These codes could facilitate socially responsible business operations worldwide and reduce pressures to ignore fundamental labor, environmental, and agricultural standards. Establishment of guidelines. The Secretary of State, in consultation with other government officials and stakeholders, will establish guidelines for U.S. nationals conducting business in foreign countries. These guidelines will be based on principles from the OECD and the International Labor Organization. The guidelines for U.S. nationals conducting business in foreign countries will be based on principles from the International Labor Organization, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, and various other principles such as the MacBride, Sullivan, and Slepak Principles. The guidelines will be published in the Federal Register and take effect 6 months after the enactment of this Act. SEC. 3. COMPLIANCE. SEC. 3. COMPLIANCE. Submission of Statements by United States nationals conducting business operations in foreign countries to indicate compliance with guidelines, and registration requirement for business operations in each foreign country. The Secretary of State conducts public hearings annually to assess compliance with guidelines by US nationals operating in foreign countries. A report on compliance levels must be submitted to Congress within 18 months of the enactment of the Act. The report must be submitted within 18 months of the Act's enactment and annually thereafter. SEC. 4. EXPORT MARKETING SUPPORT. The United States government can assist in export marketing activities for US nationals if they comply with guidelines. This assistance includes contacts with foreign governments or nationals to facilitate selling goods, services, or technology abroad. This provision will take effect 18 months after the enactment of the Act. SEC. 5. DEFINITIONS. The Act defines key terms such as \"comply with the guidelines\", \"business operations\", and \"United States national\". Compliance with guidelines involves implementing and reporting measures, business operations exclude small businesses, and a United States national includes citizens, nationals, and permanent residents. A United States national is defined as a citizen, national, or permanent resident of the United States, as well as certain business entities organized under U.S. laws. The Secretary of State may issue regulations to implement the Act."
