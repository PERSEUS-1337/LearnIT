Eligible individuals must agree to a contract with a State-approved job placement organization for job placement and support services. The Job Placement Act of 1995 allows eligible individuals to enter into contracts with State-approved job placement organizations to receive job placement vouchers. Failure to comply with the contract terms may result in sanctions imposed by the State. The individual must provide the job placement organization with the voucher received. The organization can redeem up to 25 percent of the voucher for payment from the State. The Job Placement Act of 1995 allows individuals to use job placement vouchers for finding employment. The State-approved organization can redeem up to 25 percent of the voucher initially, with the remaining amount redeemed once the individual is placed in a job for at least 6 months. The State can modify the period for job placement vouchers as needed. Performance-based standards must be established to evaluate the success of the program, taking into account economic conditions. The State must evaluate the program annually and submit a report. The State must submit an evaluation report with performance-based standards to the Secretary for review and potential revision if success rates are inadequate. Amendments to the Social Security Act require modifications to job placement voucher periods and evaluation criteria. The Social Security Act is amended to include new clauses regarding job placement voucher programs, specifying the percentage of expenditures to be paid to the State. Additionally, changes are made to section 431(a)(6) by updating references from 482(i)(5) to 482(j)(5) and from 482(i)(7)(A) to 482(j)(7)(A). The amendments made by section 2 will take effect starting from the second calendar quarter after the enactment of this Act."
