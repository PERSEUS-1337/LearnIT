    "content": "The \"Childproof Handgun Act of 1999\" may be cited as the Act. It focuses on handgun safety. The \"Childproof Handgun Act of 1999\" defines 'childproof' as technology in handguns that limits operational use, cannot be easily deactivated, and requires authorized user for firing. This technology includes radio tagging, touch memory, remote control, fingerprint, and magnetic encoding. The term 'locking device' refers to a device installed on a firearm that prevents discharge without deactivating it using a key or combination lock. The Childproof Handgun Act of 1999 mandates that firearms must have a mechanism to prevent discharge without the proper key or device. It will be illegal for licensed manufacturers, importers, or dealers to sell handguns that are not childproof, with some exceptions. Exceptions to the Childproof Handgun Act of 1999 include the manufacture, transfer, or possession of handguns by the United States, States, law enforcement officers, and rail police officers certified under the law. Beginning 90 days after the Childproof Handgun Act of 1999, it is illegal for licensed manufacturers, importers, or dealers to sell handguns without a locking device or warning. After the Childproof Handgun Act of 1999, licensed manufacturers, importers, or dealers must include a warning on handguns about responsible storage to prevent civil or criminal liability. The warning emphasizes storing firearms unloaded, locked, separate from ammunition, and inaccessible to children. Federal law prohibits minors from possessing handguns in most circumstances. Exceptions to the Childproof Handgun Act of 1999 include possession by the United States, State, or law enforcement officers for official use, as well as possession by rail police officers certified under state laws. The Childproof Handgun Act of 1999 exempts possession of childproof handguns by law enforcement officers for official use. Amendments to Section 924 of title 18, United States Code include penalties for failure to provide childproof handguns or locking devices.
