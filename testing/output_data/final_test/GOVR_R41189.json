    "content": "The President signed H.R. 1473 into law as P.L. 112-10 on April 15, 2011, representing the final appropriations act for FY2011. The law includes $41.6 billion in non-emergency discretionary spending for the Department of Homeland Security, with a 0.2% rescission for all departmental appropriations except for Coast Guard funding related to the global war on terrorism. P.L. 112-10 provides limited direction on how funds should be allocated, requiring the department to provide spending plans. Congress did not pass the 12 regular appropriations bills for FY2011 before the end of FY2010. Until P.L. 112-10 was signed into law on April 15, 2011, government funding levels for FY2011 were determined by a series of interim continuing resolutions, including P.L. 111-242, P.L. 111-290, P.L. 111-317, P.L. 111-322, P.L. 112-4, P.L. 112-6, and P.L. 112-8. These resolutions extended funding at FY2010 levels until the final appropriations act was passed. The second CR, P.L. 111-290, extended funding through December 18, 2010. The House passed the FY2011 full-year CR, H.R. 3082, on December 8, 2010. An interim CR, H.J.Res. 105, extended the expiration date to December 21, 2010. The Senate amended H.R. 3082 to extend funding at FY2010 levels, signed into law on December 22, 2010 as P.L. 111-322. Funding was further extended through March 4, 2011 with P.L. 111-322. The Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act, 2011 was adopted on February 19, 2011. The Continuing Appropriations Act, 2011 (H.R. 1, 112th Congress) was passed on February 19, 2011. Further Continuing Appropriations Amendments, 2011 (H.J.Res. 44, 112th Congress) was introduced on February 28, 2011, to extend funding for two weeks. The legislation included reductions in funding for specific DHS accounts and programs. H.J.Res. 44 was passed by the House on March 1, 2011, by the Senate on March 2, 2011, and signed into law on March 3, 2011 (P.L. 112-4). It provided spending at FY2010 levels through March 18, 2011, with reductions in spending for DHS. The Continuing Appropriations Act, 2011 included reductions in funding for specific DHS accounts and programs, such as $1 million for logistics training, $43 million for facility construction projects, $20 million for cyber-security projects, and $103 million for university and emergency operations center grants. The Continuing Appropriations Act, 2011 included reductions in funding for specific DHS accounts and programs, such as logistics training, facility construction projects, cyber-security projects, and university and emergency operations center grants. P.L. 112-6 and P.L. 112-8 provided spending rates for all 12 regular bills through April 8, 2011, and April 15, 2011, respectively. The Continuing Appropriations Act, 2011 included reductions in funding for specific DHS accounts and programs. P.L. 112-8 provided a spending rate for all 12 regular bills through April 15, 2011, allowing time for the final year-long CR to be completed. The Senate Committee on Appropriations reported its version of the FY2010 DHS Appropriations bill on July 15, 2010, recommending a net appropriation of $45.2 billion for DHS for FY2011. The House Appropriations Subcommittee on Homeland Security marked up its draft bill on June 24, 2010, but the bill was withdrawn before the full committee markup. The Administration requested a $45.0 billion budget for FY2011, a 2.4% increase from FY2010. Total budget authority for DHS in FY2011 was $52.6 billion. Net requested appropriations for major agencies within DHS were as follows: CBP $9,809 million, ICE $5,524 million, TSA $5,729 million, Coast Guard $9,867 million, Secret Service $1,570 million, National Protection & Programs Directorate $2,362 million. The Department of Homeland Security's budget for FY2011 included funding for various agencies such as Secret Service, National Protection & Programs Directorate, FEMA, Science and Technology, and the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office. Data sources for this report include the President's Budget Documents, Congressional Budget Justifications, and the Senate-reported version of S. 3607. The final direction given to DHS through P.L. 112-10 is outlined by title and component, detailing the President's FY2011 funding request for programs and activities. The report outlines President's FY2011 funding request for DHS programs and activities, comparing enacted FY2010 amounts to the FY2011 request. It tracks Senate recommendations and notes congressional issues related to discretionary funding amounts. No House recommendations are available for comparison. The report does not cover mandatory funding or legislation related to DHS programs. The Department of Homeland Security was created by an act that transferred functions, funding, and personnel from 22 agencies and offices. Appropriations for DHS are organized into five titles, covering management, security, preparedness, research, and general provisions. Title I includes funding for various offices within DHS, while Title II covers agencies like Customs and Border Protection, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Transportation Security Administration, Coast Guard, and Secret Service. The U.S. Visitor and Immigrant Status Indicator Technology (US-VISIT) program was transferred to the National Protection & Programs Directorate (NPPD) in the FY2008 appropriation. This reorganization also included shifting programs and offices to eliminate the Preparedness Directorate and move some to FEMA, as proposed by the Administration and agreed upon by Congress. Title III in Division E of P.L. 110-161 reflects changes in appropriations for FEMA, USCIS, S&T, and FLETC. The congressional budget process determines the maximum budget authority for annual appropriations, with 302(a) allocations guiding discretionary totals for enactment in annual appropriations bills. The congressional budget process determines the maximum budget authority for annual appropriations through 302(a) allocations, which guide discretionary totals for enactment in annual appropriations bills. The appropriations committees allocate 302(b) discretionary funds among subcommittees, with these allocations forming the basis for enforcing budget discipline. Adjustments to 302(b) allocations may occur as appropriations bills progress towards final enactment. The annual concurrent resolution on the budget sets forth the congressional budget, with DHS's 302(b) allocations for FY2010 and the current appropriations cycle shown in Table 2. Budget authority is established through appropriations acts or direct spending legislation and determines the amounts available for federal agencies to spend. The Antideficiency Act prohibits agencies from obligating more funds than enacted by Congress. Budget authority may be indefinite, available on a one-year, multi-year, or no-year basis. One-year budget authority is only available for obligation during a specific fiscal year. Budget authority allows federal agencies to incur obligations and authorize payments from the Treasury. Obligations are incurred when agencies enter contracts, hire personnel, or receive services in a fiscal year. Outlays represent actual funds spent during the year, which may not always align with the budget authority enacted. Multi-year and no-year budget authority allow for obligations over multiple years, with some funds being spent in future fiscal years. The Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 defines discretionary appropriations as budget authority provided in annual appropriation acts and the outlays derived from that authority, but it excludes appropriations for entitlements. Mandatory spending, also known as direct spending, consists of budget authority and resulting outlays provided in laws other than appropriation acts and is typically not appropriated each year. Some mandatory entitlement programs must be appropriated each year and are included in the appropriations acts. Within DHS, the Coast Guard retirement pay is an example of appropriated mandatory spending. Offset funds collected by the federal government, either from government accounts or the public, are not counted as revenue but as negative outlays. DHS net discretionary budget authority is composed of discretionary spending minus any fee or fund collections that offset discretionary spending. Some collections offset agency discretionary budget authority, while others offset mandatory spending for entitlement programs. The DHS budget includes mandatory entitlement programs like the Secret Service and Coast Guard retired pay accounts. Some entitlements are funded by permanent appropriations, while others are funded annually. The Secret Service retirement pay is a permanent appropriation, while the Coast Guard retirement pay is annually appropriated. Additionally, the DHS budget contains offsetting Trust and Public Enterprise Funds, which are not appropriated by Congress but are included in the President's budget to calculate gross budget authority. The DHS budget includes mandatory entitlement programs like the Secret Service and Coast Guard retired pay accounts. Some entitlements are funded by permanent appropriations, while others are funded annually. The Secret Service retirement pay is a permanent appropriation, while the Coast Guard retirement pay is annually appropriated. The appropriation amounts in Table 3 are presented in current dollars and are not adjusted. Table 4 compares the enacted total for FY2010 to the request for, and congressional action on the FY2011 appropriations. FY2011 enacted numbers are drawn directly from P.L. 112-10 and P.L. 111-83. Gross numbers are estimates due to the lack of reliable data on fees and mandatory spending. Title I covers the general administrative expenses of DHS, including the Office of the Secretary and Executive Management (OSEM). The Office of the Secretary and 12 entities report directly to the Secretary, including the Under Secretary for Management and its components. New Title I accounts proposed for FY2011 were DHS Headquarters Consolidation and the National Special Security Event State and Local Reimbursement Fund. Table 5 shows appropriations for FY2010 and FY2011. The impact of P.L. 112-10 on DHS components under this title will be discussed in the report. The report will outline the impact of P.L. 112-10 on DHS components under this title, including the Administration's request, Senate action, and possible issues for Congress. H.R. 1473 established funding levels for existing Title I accounts, with funding provided for OSEM, USM, CFO, and CIO compared to the President's request. The OIG would receive $114 million, plus $16 million from FEMA's disaster relief fund, as outlined in P.L. 111-83. $77 million for DHS Headquarters Consolidation is allocated for building projects. $53 million for the OCFO includes $4 million for financial systems consolidation efforts. Overall, funding levels reflect an $154 million, or 11.3% reduction from the Administration's request under Title I. The final legislation for FY2011 includes reductions in funding levels for Title I accounts, with an additional across-the-board rescission of budget authority. This results in a $452 million decrease from the President's request. Section 1656 of the legislation also rescinds $3 million in unobligated balances from Title I components, affecting OSEM and USM. The total FY2011 request for Title I accounts funded in FY2010 was $1,366 million, representing a 9.1% increase over the previous year. The FY2011 request for Title I accounts saw increases in funding for various components, with the largest increase in the OCIO account at 17.7%. The total FY2011 request for all Title I accounts was $1,749 million, representing a 39.7% increase over the FY2010 total. Additionally, two new accounts were introduced for FY2011, including the DHS Headquarters Consolidation request of $363 million and the National Special Security Event State and Local Reimbursement Fund request of $20 million. In FY2010, the largest increase in funding was requested for the OCIO, with $398 million and 309 FTEs, up from $338 million and 203 FTEs. The OCIO program increases include Information Technology Services ($56 million), Infrastructure and Security Activities ($186 million), and National Security Systems ($74 million). The next largest increase was in the OIG, with $130 million and 665 FTEs, up from $114 million and 632 FTEs. Within OIG, a $4 million increase was requested for Audit, Inspections, and Investigations for various TSA initiatives. The FY2011 funding request for the OFCGCR was not requested as the office closed in March 2010. The new DHS Headquarters Consolidation account aims to provide improved visibility and management of DHS facilities. $363 million was requested to support the consolidation of mission support elements and headquarters to the St. Elizabeths Campus. The NSSE State and Local Reimbursement Fund will be administered by the Office of Operations Coordination and Planning. The Office of Operations Coordination and Planning manages National Special Security Events (NSSEs) such as presidential inaugurations and major international meetings. A $20 million appropriation is requested to reimburse state and local governments for security costs. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended various appropriations, including reductions for different departments compared to the President's request. The Senate committee recommended funding reductions for different departments compared to the President's request. The total funding for Title I was $1,310 million, a decrease of $439 million or 25.1%. Specific provisions included funding for the development of the DHS Consolidated Headquarters and lease consolidation in the National Capital Region. The Chief Administrative Officer is directed to provide regular briefings on the consolidation plan. $50 million for the OSEM appropriation is contingent on the Secretary submitting a comprehensive risk assessment and national security strategy for the railroad sector. The Senate committee recommended funding reductions for different departments compared to the President's request, including $50 million for the OSEM appropriation contingent on a comprehensive risk assessment and national security strategy for the railroad sector. Additionally, $25 million would be withheld until a plan for a biometric air exit capability is submitted, and $20 million would be allocated for Visa Waiver Program negotiations. $5 million from the USM appropriation would fund facility alterations for consolidating DHS headquarters operations. The committee report for departmental management and operations accounts includes directives for the Secretary to negotiate with foreign governments for rapid deployment of Federal Air Marshals, expand U.S. Customs and Border Protection personnel, and ensure timely budget justifications. The OCFO is directed to provide detailed information on reimbursable agreements and significant uses of funds. The OCFO must ensure that DHS justifications for the President's FY2012 budget request include a status report of overdue committee reports, plans, and directives. A standard format must be used by all offices and agencies to reflect the status of congressional directives for fiscal years 2009, 2010, and 2011. The OCIO and DHS Chief Intelligence Officer are required to submit expenditure plans for certain projects within 60 days after the act's enactment. $75 million of OCIO funding would not be obligated until the plan is submitted. The plan for FY2011 expenditures must be included in the submission. The expenditure plan must be submitted within 60 days after the act's enactment and must include FY2011 expenditures, staffing details, explanations for maintaining contract staff, funding comparisons, and the number of I&A-funded employees supporting organizations outside I&A and within DHS. The plan should focus on areas where DHS can provide unique expertise and serve intelligence customers not supported by other intelligence community components. The committee provides additional funding of $3 million to the OIG for integrity investigations and directs the IG to submit a plan within 90 days. The CFO is required to submit monthly budget and staffing reports. The OCHCO manages human resources at DHS and provides oversight and guidance. The Office of the Chief Human Capital Officer (OCHCO) oversees various functions related to human capital management within the Department of Homeland Security. These functions include policy and programs, learning and development, executive resources, human capital business systems, headquarters human resources management services, and business support and operations. The OCHCO implements the Human Capital Operational Plan focusing on talent management, performance culture, learning and development, and service excellence. The Human Resources Information Technology (HRIT) program aims to modernize the DHS HRIT infrastructure to adapt to changing business, legislative, and economic circumstances. Funding for the OCHCO for FY2010 and the President's request for FY2011 are detailed in Table 6. The FY2011 budget request for the Office of the Chief Human Capital Officer (OCHCO) is $25 million with 108 full-time equivalent (FTE) employees, a decrease of $474,000 from FY2010. The Human Resources Information Technology (HRIT) appropriation remains at $17 million with 25 FTEs for FY2011. The OCHCO funding will be used for diversity initiatives, leader development programs, and outreach efforts within the Department of Homeland Security. The Office of the Chief Human Capital Officer (OCHCO) budget for FY2011 is $25 million with 108 full-time equivalent (FTE) employees, a decrease from FY2010. The Human Resources Information Technology (HRIT) program was to deploy TALENTLink to streamline hiring processes, but it was decommissioned in June 2010. The Senate committee recommended $39 million for OCHCO, $3 million less than the President's request, with $14 million allocated to HRIT. The OCHCO budget for FY2011 is $25 million with 108 FTE employees, a decrease from FY2010. TALENTLink was terminated due to not meeting federal standards, resulting in a reduction in funding. The committee expects OCHCO to use FY2010 funds for a follow-on system. The appropriation will maintain current services, provide for 133 FTEs, and save over $1 million by converting contractor positions to FTEs. OCHCO is required to provide briefings on developing a strategic plan to overhaul the DHS hiring process and align it with the Administration's plans. Quarterly briefings summarizing vacancy data at DHS are also mandated. The OCHCO is required to provide quarterly briefings summarizing vacancy data at DHS, including new hires, application ratios, security clearance backlog progress, and hiring delays. The briefings will also cover steps taken to reduce delays and compliance with time requirements for suitability reviews. The FY2010 performance metrics for the OCHCO will be presented at the first quarterly meeting. Provisions in S. 3607 prohibit funds for certain HR management systems and new hires not verified through E-Verify. DHS intelligence mission is outlined in the Homeland Security Act of 2002. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 outlines the intelligence mission of DHS, establishing the Information Analysis and Infrastructure Protection Directorate. This Directorate is responsible for receiving, assessing, and analyzing information to identify and assess terrorist threats to the homeland. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 established the Information Analysis and Infrastructure Protection Directorate within DHS to identify and assess terrorist threats. Former Secretary Chertoff's reorganization in 2005 disbanded IAIP and placed the Office of Infrastructure Protection under the National Protection and Programs Directorate. The Office of Information Analysis was also affected by the changes. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 established the Information Analysis and Infrastructure Protection Directorate within DHS. In 2005, Secretary Chertoff reorganized the department, disbanding IAIP and placing the Office of Infrastructure Protection under the newly created National Protection and Programs Directorate. The Office of Information Analysis was renamed the Office of Intelligence and Analysis, with the Assistant Secretary for Intelligence Analysis designated as the Chief Intelligence Officer. The Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007 amended the Homeland Security Act to codify the Office of Intelligence and Analysis and the Office of Infrastructure Protection. Former Secretary Chertoff also established the Office of Operations Coordination and Planning in 2008. The Office of Operations Coordination and Planning (OPS) supports crisis and contingency planning for the Secretary of Homeland Security. The FY2011 budget for Analysis and Operations (AOO) was $348 million, a 3.9% increase from FY2010. This budget supports both the Office of Intelligence and Analysis (I&A) and OPS, with I&A managing the DHS intelligence enterprise. The Office of Operations Coordination and Planning (OPS) manages the National Operations Center, a key hub for domestic incident management and coordination. The budget for Analysis and Operations (AOO) in FY2011 was $348 million, supporting the DHS intelligence enterprise. Senate-reported S. 3607 allocated $340 million for AOO, with restrictions on funds for the National Immigration Information Sharing Operation until certification by the Secretary. The Secretary must certify compliance with laws and standards before funds can be used for the National Immigration Information Sharing Operation. The Chief Intelligence Officer was required to submit an expenditure plan for FY2011 within 60 days of the act's enactment. The committee directed I&A to brief quarterly on progress in placing DHS intelligence professionals in state and local fusion centers. Title II contains appropriations for various DHS components. The report outlines the Administration's request, Senate action, and possible issues for Congress. The House position on the request was not officially ratified in 2010. The House position on the request for funding levels for various components of DHS in the final FY 2011 CR was not officially ratified in 2010. Funding for CBP was provided as follows compared to the President's request: Salaries and Expenses, $8,213 million ($5 million, or 0.1% above); Automation Modernization, $337 million ($11 million, or 3.2% below); Border Security Fencing, Infrastructure and Technology, $574 million (even); Air and Marine Interdiction, $516 million ($13 million, or 2.6% above); and Construction and Facilities Management, $260 million ($20 million, or 7% below). The FY2011 CR included a cancellation proposal under Sec. 257 of P.L. 112-6. Border Patrol was directed to have 21,370 agents by Sept 30, 2011. ICE received $5,438 million for Salaries and Expenses and $74 million for Automation Modernization. TSA received $5,220 million for Aviation Security. TSA's budget for FY2011 was $507 million less than requested, with allocations for various security operations including screening, explosives detection systems, aviation security direction, surface transportation security, transportation threat assessment, transportation security support, and the Federal Air Marshal Service. The Federal Air Marshal Service received the largest relative increase in funding. Language in P.L. 112-10 directs that TSA aviation security spending beyond a certain amount be offset by fee collections. The year-ending CR caps TSA screener staffing at 46,000 FTEs, with no requirement to include newly hired part-time screeners in the count. DHS must report on efforts to develop advanced screening technologies, deploy screeners cost-effectively, and achieve labor savings. For the Coast Guard, funds were provided as follows: $6,907 million for Operating Expenses, $1,520 million for Acquisition, Construction, and Improvements (AC&I), and $25 million for research and development. $1,267 million is allocated for Deepwater, with a $154 million increase for the National Security Cutter. $2 million is designated for upgrading Coast Guard housing. For the Secret Service, $1,514 million is provided for salaries and expenses, with a $53 million decrease from the request. Funding for salaries and expenses is provided at $53 million below the request, with construction funding remaining at $4 million, equal to the President's request. A 0.2% across-the-board rescission of budget authority for FY2011 is applied to all accounts in Title II, except for the Coast Guard's funding for overseas contingency operations, which sees a $64 million reduction. Additionally, $51 million in FY2010 unobligated balances from Title II components are rescinded, including $13 million from CBP salaries and expenses, $18 million from ICE salaries and expenses, and $14 million from Coast Guard operating expenses. $14 million is rescinded from Coast Guard operating expenses, $15 million from TSA unobligated balances, and $10 million from ICE construction. CBP's primary mission is to prevent terrorism and enforce laws at the border. CBP is responsible for enforcing laws at the border on behalf of multiple government agencies. The Administration requested a decrease in budget authority for CBP in FY2011. The FY2011 budget request for CBP included changes such as increases for Data Center consolidation, Intellectual Property Rights enforcement, and Intelligence Analysts, as well as reductions in various areas including Office of Information Technology, Border Patrol Premium Pay, and Secure Freight Initiative. The FY2011 budget request for CBP included reductions in various areas, such as the elimination of the CBP Explosive Detector Dog program, reductions in funding for programs like the Container Security Initiative and the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative, as well as reductions in the Border Security, Fencing, Infrastructure, and Technology program. The Senate-reported S. 3607 provided $11,282 million in gross budget authority for CBP for FY2011, which was $108 million more than requested by the Administration. This included reductions in funding for Air and Marine Interdiction, logistics upgrades, and Facilities Management Account. Congress considered funding for Border Patrol agent hiring and staffing levels, as well as the Secure Border Initiative surveillance program during the FY2011 appropriations cycle. The FY2011 budget request for CBP included adjustments to Border Patrol staffing and premium pay, with a proposed reduction of $15 million to premium pay and a decrease of 181 USBP Agents. Congress expressed concern over the potential staffing level reductions in certain geographic areas. In response to concerns over staffing reductions, DHS Secretary Napolitano assured no agent cuts at the southwest border. CBP revised its premium pay reduction request and Congress passed an Emergency Supplemental Appropriation Bill providing $254 million for CBP salaries and expenses, including hiring additional Border Patrol agents for the southwest border. Additionally, up to 1,200 National Guard troops were authorized for deployment to support counternarcotics enforcement until CBP recruits and trains. The Administration requested $574 million for deploying SBI technology and infrastructure, a decrease from the previous year. They proposed allocating $336 million for developing additional technology solutions and $169 million for operations and maintenance of existing infrastructure on the southwest border. Secretary Napolitano reported that 645.2 miles of fencing were in place, with plans for an additional 6.4 miles. The Administration planned to construct an additional 6.4 miles of fencing along the southwest border. The management and deployment of SBInet technology have been controversial, with delays in the initial pilot program deployment. Secretary Napolitano froze spending on the Boeing portion of SBInet and announced the intention to end the Boeing contract for a new border security technology plan. The Administration planned to end the Boeing SBInet contract and develop a new border security technology plan incorporating SBInet technology. The FY2011 budget included a $20 million reduction for the Office of Air and Marine Operations, resulting in the elimination of 120 staffing positions. Congress fully funded the request to hire 144 new OAM personnel in FY2010, but only 24 positions were filled. The Emergency Supplemental Appropriation Bill provided $32 million for two additional Unmanned Aerial Vehicle systems. The Senate-reported bill would have allocated additional funds for OAM personnel. The Administration's FY2011 budget request included decreases in funding for cargo security initiatives, specifically for the Container Security Initiative (CSI) program and the Secure Freight Initiative (SFI). Congress appropriated $162 million for these programs in FY2010, but the President's budget request for FY2011 was only $84 million, a 48% decrease. The Senate-reported version proposed $103 million, a 36% decrease compared to FY2010. The SFI aims to enhance supply chain security through the International Container Security (ICS) program. The International Container Security (ICS) program aims to scan all U.S.-bound maritime containers at overseas ports before loading onto vessels. In FY2010, ICS was operational in six ports and scanning 100% of containers at select locations. The President's FY2011 budget proposed a reduction in funding for ICS by nearly $17 million. The President's FY2011 budget proposed a reduction of nearly $17 million for the International Container Security (ICS) program by changing protocols at certain ports. Additionally, there was a proposed $58 million reduction to the Container Security Initiative (CSI) program, which targets high-risk containers for inspection at foreign ports. The proposed $58 million reduction in CSI funding will shift operations to the National Targeting Center-Cargo (NTC-C) for targeting high-risk containers. Physical operations at 54 of the 58 existing CSI ports will be phased out in FY2011, which has faced congressional scrutiny. The Senate Appropriations Committee supports programs like CSI that enhance border security and expressed disappointment in proposed cuts to C-TPAT and Western Hemisphere Travel. The committee requested a briefing on how the additional $29 million for CBP programs will be used and how security effects of proposed cuts will be mitigated. ICE enforces immigration and customs laws, investigates violations, locates and removes aliens, and combats terrorist financing. ICE enforces immigration and customs laws, investigates violations, and combats terrorist financing. The Administration requested a budget increase for ICE in FY2011. The FY2011 budget for ICE includes a 1.6% increase over the previous year, with additional funding allocated for various operations such as Detention and Removal, facility co-location, investigations support, data center migration, Border Enforcement Security Task Forces, and intellectual property rights enforcement. The Senate-reported budget provided more funding than the Administration requested, reflecting the diverse activities ICE undertakes to enforce civil and criminal laws. ICE's resource allocation for its mission is a contentious issue, especially regarding the detention and removal of aliens. There is debate on the prioritization of criminal aliens for deportation and the balance with other responsibilities like terrorist travel and worksite enforcement. Less than one-third of those deported by ICE in FY2008 and FY2009 were convicted of a criminal offense. ICE's Detention and Removal Operations (DRO) manages custody of aliens in removal proceedings or ordered removed from the US. Concerns exist about insufficient detention space leading to decisions on release based on space availability rather than individual cases. Policymakers suggest using alternatives to detention for non-criminal alien detainees as a cost-effective and fairer option. ICE's Detention and Removal Operations (DRO) faces concerns about inadequate detention space, leading to decisions on release based on availability rather than individual cases. Policymakers propose using alternatives to detention for non-criminal alien detainees for a more proportional treatment. In 2009, ICE introduced new detention standards to address criticisms about medical care for aliens in detention. The FY2010 detention bed count was 33,400, with a $20 million increase requested in the President's FY2011 budget. INA provides limited avenues for state enforcement of civil provisions, with INA \u00a7287(g) granting authority for state and local immigration enforcement activities. The debate over the role of state and local law enforcement in enforcing federal immigration laws has raised concerns about training, resources, civil rights violations, and community impact. While some argue that federal resources are limited and state and local entities should assist, others question the implications of such partnerships. The President's FY2011 budget included $5 million for 287(g) agreements, allowing state and local entities to apply for additional funding. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is responsible for protecting air, land, and rail transportation systems in the United States against terrorist threats. It was created by the Aviation and Transportation Security Act and transferred to the Department of Homeland Security in 2002. The TSA deploys passenger and baggage screeners, detection systems, and other security technologies to ensure the safety of transportation systems. State and local entities can apply for additional funding through appropriations to the Office of State and Local Government Coordination in FEMA. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is responsible for protecting air, land, and rail transportation systems in the United States against terrorist threats. TSA assesses the risk of terrorist attacks to non-aviation transportation assets, issues regulations, and enforces them to improve security. The President's request for TSA budget in FY2011 was $8,165 million, with a 7% increase over FY2010 enacted levels. Aviation Security received $5,560 million, comprising 68% of the total TSA budget, with a focus on passenger screening and international initiatives. Proposed increases for aviation security in FY2011 include $215 million for advanced imaging technology (AIT) systems at airport checkpoints, $219 million for additional screeners, $96 million for airport management support, and $60 million for portable Explosive Trace Detection (ETD) machines. The President's FY2011 budget request includes funding for 800 new portable Explosive Trace Detection (ETD) machines for airport screening checkpoints, a decrease in budget for checked baggage Explosives Detection Systems (EDS) and ETD purchase/installation, additional canine explosives detection teams, behavioral detection officers, and increased funding for Federal Air Marshals to enhance international aviation security initiatives. The President's request includes an increase in funding for Federal Air Marshals (FAMS) by $85 million for international flights, $39 million for international cooperative programs, $27 million for Surface Transportation Security, and $51 million for Transportation Security Support. The Senate-reported S. 3607 specified $8,064 million for the TSA, $100 million less than the President's request. The Senate-reported S. 3607 allocated $8,064 million for the TSA, $100 million less than the President's request. $5,491 million was designated for aviation security programs, with $950 million for FAMS and $250 million for airport grants from the Aviation Security Capital Fund. The amount for aviation security was $69 million less than requested, with $37 million less for screener personnel. The Senate denied additional BDOs due to concerns over effectiveness and efficiency gains from in-line EDS systems. The Senate-reported bill includes reduced funding for EDS/ETD purchase and installation, as well as Screening Technology Maintenance and Utilities. This is due to anticipated recovery of unspent funds from prior years and negotiated vendor warranties for AIT systems. $360 million is allocated for procurement and installation of AIT systems and other checkpoint technologies. The Senate-reported bill includes funding for Aviation Regulation and Other Enforcement, Air Cargo Security, Surface Transportation Security, and Transportation Security Support. The bill supports the Administration's request for increased funding for canine teams, international aviation security programs, cargo screening mandates, and transportation security. The FY2011 DHS appropriations process included $147 million for Transportation Threat Assessment and Credentialing (TTAC), $25 million less than requested, due to TSA's shift to competitive bidding for modernizing vetting and credentialing infrastructure. This decision aimed to reduce duplication and complexity in criminal checks, security threat assessments, and data maintenance for transportation workers and others with access to transportation systems and facilities. This change resulted in less development funding anticipated for FY2011. The incident on an international airline flight from Amsterdam raised concerns about aviation security, including the use of terrorist watchlists, passenger and carry-on item screening, and challenges in meeting cargo screening deadlines. Discussions have included increasing aviation security fees, such as the passenger security fee, to address deficit spending. The President's request included funding for new checkpoint technologies to enhance security measures. The TSA is allocating $344 million to test, procure, and deploy new checkpoint technologies to improve explosives detection, including whole body imaging systems. These systems are controversial due to privacy concerns and high costs. Other technologies being procured include advanced X-ray systems, liquid scanners, and explosives trace detection equipment. The TSA aims to have AT X-ray deployment at 96% of full operating capacity by the end of FY2011. The TSA plans to have AT X-ray deployment at 96% of full operating capacity by FY2014, while AIT deployments will only reach 56% of FOC. The focus is on larger airports first, leaving vulnerabilities at smaller airports. Maintenance costs for checkpoint screening equipment are a concern, with a $74 million request for FY2011, a 45% increase from FY2010. Costs for modifying airport terminals for next-generation screening technologies are also a worry. The concern is the costs of modifying airport terminals to accommodate next-generation checkpoint technologies, particularly AIT systems. The Senate-reported bill included $65 million for anticipated costs to accommodate AIT equipment. P.L. 112-10 requires DHS to report on efforts to develop advanced screening technologies and deploy screeners in a cost-effective manner. Terrorist watchlisting and TSA's efforts to deploy the Secure Flight system have been significant issues in appropriations debate. The appropriations debate has focused on the Secure Flight program, which was fully implemented in December 2010. Following the December 25, 2009 incident, the emphasis shifted to intelligence analysis for no-fly and selectee lists. The FY2011 President's request included a proposed increase of $10 million for the TSA's Office of Intelligence (TSA-OI) to enhance field intelligence capabilities at large airports and improve secure communications with TSA headquarters. Lawmakers have questioned the adequacy of TSA-OI resources for accurate decision-making on terrorist identities for no-fly and selectee lists, compared to broader information in databases like TIDE. The TSA utilizes terrorist systems like TIDE and TSDB to screen passengers and cargo for security risks. Legislation requires TSA to screen 100% of cargo on domestic flights using the Certified Cargo Screening Program. The Certified Cargo Screening Program (CCSP) regulates screening and security practices for shippers, freight forwarders, and cargo facilities. Challenges exist in screening cargo on inbound international flights due to limited control over foreign supply chains and diplomatic considerations. TSA aims to harmonize air cargo security standards internationally to achieve 100% screening. The TSA faces resource challenges in overseeing the Certified Cargo Screening Program (CCSP) for domestic air cargo security. The FY2011 budget includes funding for air cargo policy, programs, inspectors, and the National Explosive Detection Canine Training Program (NEDCTP). The NEDCTP provides training and certification for local law enforcement canine teams for air cargo screening duties at airports. S. 3607 included provisions for TSA reporting on cargo screening statistics and implementation plans for meeting the 100% screening mandate for passenger aircraft. The Senate committee encouraged TSA to expedite approval of screening technologies for air cargo, with a focus on working with the fresh fruit industry. ATSA granted TSA authority to collect passenger security fees. The ATSA granted TSA authority to collect passenger security fees, with proposals for fee increases by the Obama Administration and Congress, opposed by the airline industry. The airline industry argues that aviation security costs should be shared by all citizens, not just aviation system users, to sustain passenger demand and airline revenues. Congress may consider increasing passenger security fees, as they have not been adjusted for inflation since 2001, to address federal deficit spending. This issue remains of interest to the 112th Congress. The Coast Guard, as the lead federal agency for maritime homeland security, is responsible for securing U.S. ports, waterways, and territorial waters. It also conducts missions like search and rescue, environmental protection, and navigation aids. The President's requested budget shows a 1% increase in operating expenses and a 10% decrease in the capital account compared to last year. The President's budget request for the Coast Guard includes a 10% decrease in the capital account compared to last year. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended about 6% more funding than the President requested, with additional allocations for vessel acquisition, shore facilities, research and development, and bridge modifications. The Coast Guard's budget includes a 10% decrease in capital account. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended more funding for vessel acquisition, shore facilities, research and development, and bridge modifications. Increased duties in the maritime realm related to homeland security have added to the Coast Guard's obligations. The Deepwater program aims to replace or modernize 91 cutters, 124 small surface craft, and 247 aircraft at a cost of over $25 billion, but has faced criticism for management and execution. The Coast Guard's Deepwater program, the largest acquisition effort in its history, faces scrutiny from GAO and DHS IG. In FY2011, the President requested $1,113 million for Deepwater, including funds for National Security Cutters and Fast Response Cutters. The Senate Appropriations Committee provided $121 million more than the request, mainly for a sixth national security cutter. Congress has also addressed the Coast Guard's losses of C-130s and helicopters in flight accidents. In 2010, funding was provided through H.R. 4899 to replace a crashed HH-65 and purchase two C-103Js for the Coast Guard. P.L. 112-10 allocated $1,267 million for Deepwater, with reductions in military workforce and planned decommissioning of older vessels. The USCG's Maritime Safety and Security Teams (MSSTs) face potential elimination in five locations, including San Francisco and New York, as part of a cost-saving measure. This decision could result in a reduction of 5,000 cutter hours in FY2011. The MSSTs are part of the Deployable Operations Group (DOG) and play a crucial role in responding to safety and security situations in ports. The decision to eliminate teams in New York, Anchorage, and Kings Bay, GA was based on existing Coast Guard personnel presence. The Senate Appropriations Committee rejected the President's request to cut five MSSTs and partially rejected decommissioning assets. P.L. 112-10 allowed decommissioning of certain cutters, aircraft, and one MSST. The Coast Guard's role in marine safety and environmental protection has been highlighted by the Gulf of Mexico oil spill. The Coast Guard oversees offshore oil platform safety, rescues crews, and leads oil spill clean-up efforts. The Coast Guard's role in overseeing oil rig safety and responding to oil spills has raised concerns about its ability to keep pace with changing technology. Some regulations date back to 1978, prompting criticism of the Coast Guard's competence in marine safety. In response, the Coast Guard revamped its marine safety program and received funding for additional personnel in FY2009. Congress allocated funds for 300 more marine safety personnel, with the Senate Appropriations Committee providing $20 million extra for 176 positions. Concerns were raised about the Coast Guard's management of the Rescue 21 program, which experienced cost overruns and delays. The program was intended to limit coverage gaps to 2%, but now faces a less than 10% coverage gap. Rescue-21 program aims to reduce coverage gap to less than 10%. Deployment at 24 of 39 planned locations as of December 2009. President requested $36 million for FY2011 to complete deployment at six locations and continue at four others. U.S. Secret Service has missions in criminal investigations and protection, including financial crimes, identity theft, and protecting high-profile individuals. The U.S. Secret Service is responsible for security at National Special Security Events (NSSE) and protecting designated individuals like the DHS Secretary. The President's FY2011 budget request included $1,570 million for the Secret Service, an $87 million increase from FY2010. The agency also protects 34 individuals, 24 authorized under U.S. Code and 10 provisionally. The Secret Service protects 34 individuals, including the President, Vice President, their families, visiting heads-of-state, and designated NSSEs. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended $1,576 million for the Secret Service for FY2011, an increase of $93 million over FY2010. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended $4 million above the president's request for domestic investigations, citing concerns about the Secret Service's violation of the Anti-Deficiency Act. They directed the Secret Service and DHS CFO to implement GAO recommendations on financial management. Additionally, $20 million was withheld until the DHS CIO certifies information security plans align with data center migration and enterprise architecture requirements. The FY2011 appropriations for USSS focus on funding for the Service's protection mission and NSSE funding. USSS's protection mission, which employs the majority of agents, receives a larger share of resources. Congressional action has mainly been related to the protection mission, reflecting the costs of increasing protection for individuals, events, and facilities. Congress has also maintained USSS's role in investigating financial crimes. In FY2010, congressional action primarily focused on addressing the Service's protection mission, including funding for a new international field office in Estonia to combat electronic crimes. The 110th Congress enacted the Former Vice President Protection Act of 2008, requiring the Service to protect former Vice Presidents and their families. However, Congress also restricted the Service's protection mission in the FY2010 DHS appropriation, stating that funds could not be used to protect federal department heads without reimbursement. The need for protection activities has increased due to potential terrorist attacks and threats to the President. The Administration proposed a $20 million initiative for the NSSE State and Local Reimbursement Fund to reimburse state and local governments for security costs at NSSEs. Eligible costs would be determined by the DHS Secretary, with management costs capped at one percent. The NSSE State and Local Reimbursement Fund would not provide funds to states and localities already reimbursed by other federal programs. NSSEs are events of national significance with heightened security risks, led by the U.S. Secret Service. Coordination includes planning for venue and air space security, training, communications, and credentialing. Recent NSSE funding includes $100 million appropriated for securing the 2008 Presidential Nominating Conventions in Denver, CO, and Minneapolis-St. Paul, MN. The Department of Justice administered the funding through the Byrne Programs to reimburse state and local law enforcement entities for security costs. Prior to this, $15 million was allocated for emergency planning and security costs during President Obama's inauguration in 2009. President George W. Bush issued an emergency declaration for DC, authorizing federal reimbursement for emergency preparedness activities exceeding $15 million appropriated by Congress. An additional $39.2 million was allocated in the FY2009 Omnibus Appropriations Act for emergency planning and security costs in DC, not specifically for NSSEs. In comparison, the 2008 Presidential Nominating Conventions received $100 million, with $50 million each for Denver and Minneapolis-St. Paul. DC received $15 million for 2009 inauguration security and an extra $39.2 million in the FY2009 omnibus. The FY2011 budget proposed $20 million for the NSSE Fund, but did not specify an administering agency. While the USSS has authority over NSSE operations, it is not designated as the administrating agency. The budget request does not address coordination between USSS and the DHS entity managing the NSSE Fund, nor does it mention the relationship with other DHS grants and assistance programs like FEMA's Grant Programs Directorate. The NSSE Fund proposed in the FY2011 budget would be administered by an entity within DHS, potentially replacing funding provided through the DOJ Byrne Programs for state and local NSSE costs. While DHS already offers funding through programs like GPD's State Homeland Security Program, the grant approval process is not flexible for NSSE security activities. The NSSE Fund may overlap with existing federal programs like FEMA and NPPD. The Post-Katrina Emergency Reform Act expanded FEMA's authorities, creating the NPPD and OHA within DHS. Table 13 details appropriations for Title III. The impact of P.L. 112-10 on DHS components will be discussed, along with the Administration's request and Senate action in the 111th Congress. House data for comparison is unavailable. The final FY 2011 CR (P.L. 112-10) provided funding levels for Title III components of DHS, including NPPD. Funds for Management and Administration were $44 million, IPIS $840 million, and US-VISIT $335 million. Additionally, $877 million in unobligated funds for the IPIS program were rescinded. FPS is funded through fees collected for its activities as stated in P.L. 112-10, Section 1628. The final FY 2011 CR (P.L. 112-10) provided funding levels for Title III components of DHS, including NPPD. The Federal Protective Service is directed to reach a staffing level of \"not fewer than 1,250 full-time staff and 935 full-time Police Officers, Inspectors, Area Commanders, and Special Agents who are directly engaged on a daily basis in protecting and enforcing laws at Federal buildings.\" P.L. 112-10 expressly provides $140 million for OHA, with $27 million for salaries and expenses. For FEMA Management and Administration, $788 million was provided directly, $115 million below the Administration's request. The FY 2011 CR (P.L. 112-10) increased funding for the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) by 36% but provided 20% less funding for state and local grant programs compared to the recommended amount. Other funding included $182 million for Flood Map Modernization and $120 million for Emergency Food and Shelter. The State Homeland Security Grant Program received funding for Operation Stonegarden, REAL ID, Citizen Corps, and Metropolitan programs. P.L. 112-10 included funding for various programs such as Operation Stonegarden, REAL ID, Citizen Corps, and Metropolitan Medical Response System. It also provided funding for Public Transportation Security Assistance and Railroad Security Assistance, including Over-the-Road Bus Security Assistance and AMTRAK Security program. The EFS program funding level was set at $120 million, with significant cut-backs compared to previous years. Additionally, $50 million was allocated for the PDM program, matching the lowest funding level since FY2006. The funding levels for various programs in P.L. 112-10 were reduced, including $182 million for Flood Map Modernization, $12 million below requested amounts. Additionally, $8 million was allocated for reimbursement of costs to state and local governments for National Special Security Events. There were across-the-board rescissions totaling $18 million, with $3 million rescinded from FY2010 unobligated balances and $16 million from NPPD IPIS programs. The National Protection and Programs Directorate (NPPD) was established in response to the Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act of 2006. It includes various offices such as the Office of Risk Management and Analysis, the Office of Infrastructure Protection, the Office of Cybersecurity and Communications, US-VISIT program, and the Federal Protective Service. The Directorate's activities are supported by the Management and Administration Program. Section 1662 rescinds $33 million from US-VISIT unobligated balances. The Office of Infrastructure Protection and the Office of Cybersecurity and Communications are supported by the Infrastructure Protection and Information Security Program (IPIS). The Management and Administration Program supports administrative functions through the Directorate Administration Program/Project Activity (PPA) and the Office of Risk Management and Analysis. The Risk Management and Analysis office develops a common risk management framework and projects like the Risk Assessment Process for Informed Decision-making (RAPID) and Homeland Security National Risk Assessment (HSNRA). The Administration requested $46 million for Management and Administration in FY2011, with $36 million for Directorate Administration and $10 million for RMA. The budget increase went to Directorate Administration, with adjustments for additional FTE slots and efforts to reduce contractors at DHS. The increase was offset by a reduction in contracting fees. The Administration requested an additional $2 million for the Directorate Administration account to establish two DHS Enterprise Data Centers and requested a modest reduction for RMA. The Senate-approved $45 million for Management and Administration, $1 million less than requested for the Office of Risk Management and Analysis due to unclear outcomes in their expenditure plan. The Senate-reported S. 3607 would require the Under Secretary to report on quantifiable priorities for the Infrastructure Protection and Information Security Program. This program supports the Office of Infrastructure Protection and the Office of Cybersecurity and Communications, which includes the National Cyber Security Division, the National Communication System, and the Office of Emergency Communications. OIP coordinates efforts to reduce risks to critical infrastructure from terrorist attacks or natural disasters through collaboration between the government, private sector, and other entities. The National Communication System (NCS) and the Office of Emergency Communications (OEC) focus on the nation's communication systems and promoting interoperable communication equipment for emergency response providers. The Administration requested $866 million for the Infrastructure Protection and Information Security Program in FY2011. The Administration requested $866 million for the IPIS program in FY2011, which is $33 million less than the previous year. Net adjustments and programmatic changes accounted for the reductions, resulting in net decreases in most Program/Project Activities (PAAs). Adjustments to base funding led to a significant decrease in the United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT) PPA. The Administration proposed reductions in various programs, including the National Cybersecurity Protection System, Critical Infrastructure and Key Resources Partnerships, Vulnerability Assessments, and cybersecurity-related Training and Education. They also suggested increases in Assessment, Testing, and Analysis funding. The Administration proposed programmatic increases in various areas such as Assessment, Testing, and Analysis (+$9 million), Infrastructure Protection Data Center Migration (+$7 million), Cybersecurity Coordination (+$5 million), Cybersecurity Exercises (+$3 million), and the National Coordinating Center (+$2 million), resulting in a net increase of 138 FTEs. Some adjustments were made to reduce the number of contractors working for NPPD, with costs offset by reductions in contracting budgets. The Administration requested a net increase of 138 FTEs, with the majority falling within the US-CERT PPA and the second largest increase in the Mitigation PPA. Programmatic reductions were attributed to greater efficiencies from Cybersecurity and Communications quarterly reviews. An Addendum proposed a new PPA structure for the IPIS, including a separate PPA for the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Cybersecurity and Communications, restructuring of activities by the National Cyber Security Division, and realignment of associated FTEs. The Senate approved $881 million for the IPIS program, providing additional funds for vulnerability assessments and the NISAC. They also allocated more funds for the National Infrastructure Protection Plan Management program and the Critical Infrastructure/Key Resources Partnership program. The Senate did not fund the department's request for data center migration but provided the requested funds for the IP-Mitigation Program. They required DHS to provide quarterly updates on hiring personnel for security enforcement at chemical facilities and the ammonia nitrate security program. The Senate allocated funds for the National Cyber Security Division, including an additional $9 million for the Cybersecurity Protection and Response program. They also provided funds for the Office of Emergency Communications and expressed concerns about the exploration of emerging commercial broadband services. The Senate expressed concerns about the lack of exploration and utilization of emerging commercial broadband services. They requested a report on plans for training and best practices related to broadband technologies. Additionally, the Administration proposed a $13 million reduction for the National Cybersecurity Protection System Program, which could slow down the deployment of intrusion detection hardware and software in the federal government and its partners. The Administration proposed a redirection of funds towards the Assessment, Test, and Analysis Program for penetration testing of federal networks. Congress may need to consider the trade-offs associated with this. Additionally, a $10 million reduction was proposed for the Critical Infrastructure and Key Resources Partnerships and Information Sharing Program, which supports Sector and Government Coordinating Councils. The Administration proposed reducing travel, meetings, and support for government representatives. Joint regional consortium meetings would be cut, and the future of the Critical Infrastructure Warning Information Network (CWIN) is uncertain. Congress may investigate the impact of these cuts and the termination of CWIN operations. Congress has expressed frustration with NPPD's budget documentation in the past. The DHS restructuring proposal aims to achieve transparency and rationalization. Information system migrations are reflected in various parts of the NPPD budget. Congress may seek clarification on the budget impact of these migrations. The FY2011 appropriation shows a 6% funding decrease from FY2010 levels. US-VISIT manages biometric identification information for foreign visitors entering the US. This information is shared with various government agencies for accurate identification. US-VISIT stores biometric data from international travelers to help identify risks to the United States. The directorship of US-VISIT has changed multiple times, with proposals to place it within a new Screening Coordination Office. The Screening Coordination Office (SCO) was initially proposed to oversee DHS screening programs but was never funded. US-VISIT was later transferred to the National Protection Programs Directorate (NPPD) for coordination and oversight. The Administration requested $335 million for US-VISIT in FY2011, a decrease from the previous year. Funding cuts were proposed for Program Management Services and the Comprehensive Biometric Exit Program. The Senate-reported bill S. 3607 allocated $335 million for US-VISIT in FY2011, matching the Administration's budget request. It also included provisions for implementing a biometric air exit capability and required an expenditure plan before obligating $167 million for US-VISIT. Deployment of a biometric exit system has been a long-standing concern for Congress. DHS lacks reliable methods to track visa overstays, using biographical data for matching entry and exit information. Pilot projects on biometric exit systems were completed in 2009, but no transition plan exists for comprehensive deployment. The FY2011 budget did not request funding for a biometric exit capability, suggesting delays in implementation. Congressional interest may focus on US-VISIT's exit system strategy. The Federal Protective Service (FPS), under the National Protection and Programs Directorate (NPPD), is responsible for protecting federally owned and leased buildings, personnel, and property. FPS focuses on security and law enforcement activities to reduce vulnerability to criminal and terrorist threats, including risk assessments, countermeasures, law enforcement response, and emergency education programs. FPS also assists other federal agencies, such as the U.S. Secret Service, with additional security at National Special Security Events. The Federal Protective Service (FPS) is responsible for protecting federally owned and leased buildings, personnel, and property. FPS employs law enforcement officers, investigators, and administrative personnel, along with contract security guards. The proposed budget for FPS in FY2011 is $1,115 million, with funding for basic security operations, building-specific security operations, and Security Work Authorizations. Senate-reported S. 3607 would provide FPS with the same amount for salaries and expenses as requested for FY2011 and enacted in FY2010. The Senate Appropriations Committee expressed concern about the lack of resources for the Federal Protective Service (FPS) to address terrorist threats and attacks against federal employees and facilities. They noted the increase in protected square footage and recommended adjusting fees for FY2011 to increase funding. The committee also provided for an increase in the number of FPS employees to 1,348, including at least 1,011 police officers. The Senate Appropriations Committee directed NPPD to increase FPS employees to 1,348, including 1,011 police officers, and requested a new staffing model within 45 days. GAO will assess the model's validity within 75 days. Additionally, NPPD and ICE were instructed to provide a signed MOU regarding business services. GAO reported that FPS relies on other entities for security, GSA is dissatisfied with FPS's security level, FPS plans to enhance strategic methods and monitoring to address threats and improve service quality. The Office of Health Affairs (OHA) coordinates DHS programs with public health components, administers various programs including BioWatch and NBIS, and received $139 million in FY2010. Dr. Alexander G. Garza serves as Assistant Secretary of Homeland Security and Chief Medical Officer. The Office of Health Affairs (OHA) received $139 million in FY2010 appropriations. The President requested $213 million for OHA for FY2011, a $74 million increase. The requested funding would support 95 FTEs, 11 more than in FY2010. The committee recommended $155 million for OHA for FY2011, $57 million less than the President's request. The FY2011 budget recommendation fell $60 million below the request, including increases for NBIC and Salaries and Expenses, and small increases for the Rapidly Deployable Chemical Detection System and Planning and Coordination. The BioWatch program requested an $84 million increase to deploy \"Generation 3\" detectors for improved timeliness in detecting bioterrorism pathogens, although questions were raised about their performance. The Senate committee raised concerns about the performance of Gen-3 detectors for the BioWatch program. Congress funded a study recommending thorough testing before deployment, better system performance assessments, and improved coordination with partners. The estimated annual cost to deploy and operate Gen-3 detectors is $200 million. FEMA leads the nation's preparedness efforts. FEMA leads the nation's preparedness efforts through a comprehensive emergency management system to reduce loss of life and property from natural disasters, man-made disasters, and terrorism. FEMA provides assistance through programs like the Disaster Relief Fund and Pre-Disaster Mitigation Fund to state, local, and tribal governments. For FY2011, the Administration proposed an appropriation of $7,294 million for FEMA, an increase of $165 million from FY2010. The increase was mainly for FEMA's Management and Administration activities and the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF), offset by reductions in other FEMA programs. State and Local Programs saw a $164 million reduction, the Flood Map Modernization Fund a $16 million reduction, and Emergency Food received $100 million. The FY2011 budget proposal for FEMA included a $16 million reduction for State and Local Programs and a $100 million reduction for Emergency Food and Shelter. Significant budget proposals focused on consolidating programs, refocusing FEMA's resources on disaster response, repairing regional facilities, and partnering with HUD for sustainable development. The Administration assumed catastrophic disasters are rare. The Senate proposed a slight increase for FEMA's budget and a decrease for Management and Administration, offset by a transfer from the DRF. They recommended higher appropriations for State and Local Programs and Emergency Food and Shelter compared to the Administration's request. Flood Map Modernization funding remained the same. Several significant issues are associated with FEMA's FY2011 budget, including supplemental appropriations for the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF), consolidation of state and local programs, reduction in funding for the Assistance to Firefighters Program and Emergency Food and Shelter Program, expiration of the Pre-Disaster Mitigation program, and Flood Map Modernization appropriations. The DRF is the main account for funding various emergency and disaster assistance programs, often requiring supplemental funds for continued disaster assistance due to ongoing recovery efforts from past hurricanes. The FY2011 budget for FEMA includes concerns about reliance on supplemental funding for the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF). President Obama requested additional funds for the DRF in FY2010 due to unexpected recovery costs, amending the initial request by an additional $1,500 million. These requests were included in the proposed legislative language of the FY2011 budget. The FY2011 budget for FEMA included concerns about reliance on supplemental funding for the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF). Congress provided a $5,100 million supplement in P.L. 111-212. Increased disaster expenditures in the past five years may be due to more disasters annually or increased federal involvement in disaster assistance. Arbitration panels authorized by P.L. 111-5 have led to higher costs for the DRF. Monthly pay-outs from the DRF have averaged around $350 million. The FY2011 budget for FEMA raised concerns about reliance on supplemental funding for the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF), with monthly payouts averaging around $350 million. The $2,650 million provided in P.L. 112-10 was deemed insufficient for annual emergency and disaster recovery costs. FEMA's State and Local Programs aim to assist first responder entities in preparing for and responding to disasters, with proposed reductions in total appropriations for FY2011. The proposed reduction in total appropriations and elimination of selected programs, such as the Interoperable Emergency Communications Grant Program and the Metropolitan Medical Response System, could lead to grantees either trying to fund all projects, resulting in reduced funding overall, or not funding all needed projects. The Administration argues that consolidating assistance programs expands eligible activities, increases grantee discretion, and encourages prioritizing investments to meet specific homeland security needs. The Administration's FY2011 budget proposed a $610 million budget for firefighter assistance, with a 25% decrease from FY2010. This includes $305 million for AFG and $305 million for SAFER. The focus is on enhancing capabilities for terrorism response and major incidents. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved $810 million for firefighter assistance. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved $810 million for firefighter assistance, including $390 million for AFG and $420 million for SAFER. The committee directed DHS to fund applications based on local and USFA priorities, continue direct funding to fire departments, and maintain the peer review process. The EFS Program under the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act provides emergency help to families and individuals in need through social service providers nationwide. FEMA chairs a national board overseeing the program. The EFS Program under the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act provides emergency help to individuals in need through various organizations. Funding decisions are made at both national and local levels, with a minimal administrative budget. Proposed budget cuts may impact the program's ability to provide assistance. The Administration's justification for proposed funding cuts to the EFS program notes a refocus on FEMA's primary mission of disaster response. The Senate has suggested a budget of $150 million, $50 million above the Administration level. The FY2011 budget request of $100 million represents the largest reduction in the program's 27-year history. The Pre-Disaster Mitigation (PDM) program provides federal grants to mitigate property damage and loss of life due to disasters. The program was re-authorized for three years with funding of $180 million for FY2011 and $200 million per year for the remaining two years. The FY2011 budget requested $100 million, a reduction from the previous year's appropriation. The Senate has suggested $75 million for the program. The Senate has suggested reducing FEMA's budget for flood mapping activities to $194 million for FY2011, in line with the Administration's request. This reduction is due to the anticipated completion of the Flood Map Modernization Initiative and increased cost-sharing with other stakeholders. The report discusses the impact of P.L. 112-10 on DHS components, outlines the Administration's request, Senate action, and possible issues for Congress regarding Title IV appropriations. The final FY2011 CR appropriates $147 million for USCIS, with $103 million for E-Verify and $25 million for asylum and refugee status processing. The FY2011 budget for DHS components includes $235.9 million for the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center, $141.2 million for the Science and Technology Directorate, and $688 million for research and development. Funding for university programs is not to be reduced by more than 20% from the FY2010 level. Additionally, $40 million is set aside for the National Bio- and Agro-defense Facility. The FY2011 budget for DHS components includes funding for various programs, including the National Bio- and Agro-defense Facility. The act restricts the use of funds for NBAF until certain design planning and risk assessment requirements are met. Funding for DNDO is allocated for different purposes compared to the President's request, with reductions in some areas and an across-the-board rescission of budget authority. The FY2011 budget for DHS components includes funding reductions in unobligated balances from USCIS. USCIS activities include adjudication of immigration petitions, naturalization petitions, and refugee/asylum claims. USCIS funds processing and adjudication of immigrant and nonimmigrant applications. USCIS funds processing and adjudication of immigrant, nonimmigrant, refugee, asylum, and citizenship benefits largely through the Examinations Fee Account. The agency receives most of its revenue from adjudication fees of immigration benefit applications and petitions. The requested USCIS gross budget authority for FY2011 was approximately $2,813 million, with a direct appropriation of $386 million for specific projects. The USCIS requested $34 million for the SAVE Program, $207 million for asylum and refugee applications, and $2,427 million in gross budget authority for FY2011. Fee revenue would fund the majority of the budget, with $1,955 million allocated for adjudication services. Additionally, $84 million was requested for information and customer services, and $337 million for administration. The Senate proposed $172 million for USCIS funding. The Senate proposed appropriating $172 million for USCIS in FY2011, including funds for processing asylee and refugee applications, immigration verification programs, and immigrant integration limited to lawful permanent residents. Key issues for Congress include declines in applications, fee-generated funding, and USCIS's need for accurate application projections to avoid backlogs. USCIS must avoid over-budgeting projects, as seen in the 2007 fee increase surge. USCIS sought direct appropriations of $207 million in its FY2011 budget request for applications for refugees, asylum-seekers, and military naturalizations. Congress is considering providing direct appropriations for application processing and fees, which may be a concern as they review the FY2011 request. Additionally, the FY2011 budget request included a $34 million appropriation for the SAVE program. The FY2011 presidential budget request included a $34 million appropriation for the SAVE Program, funded through \"surcharges\" on immigration application fees. The Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC) provides training for federal, state, local, and international law enforcement agencies, focusing on developing skills and knowledge for law enforcement activities. The overall FY2011 request for FLETC was $280 million, a decrease of $3 million from FY2010. In FY2011, FLETC officials plan to continue re-accreditation for law enforcement training programs and provide training to federal, state, local, and international partners. The Senate-reported S. 3607 would allocate $274 million to FLETC, $5 million less than the administration request. The Directorate of Science and Technology (S&T) is the primary DHS organization for research and development, with a requested budget of $1,018 million for FY2011, a 2% increase from FY2010. The FY2011 budget for the S&T Directorate includes a 2% increase from FY2010, with $109 million allocated for radiological and nuclear countermeasures R&D. Other activities face a 9% funding reduction, including the termination of local and regional initiatives. The proposed budget does not include funds for the National Bio and Agro Defense Facility, but DHS plans to reprogram prior-year funds for construction. The Senate-reported bill would provide $8 million less than requested for the S&T Directorate. The Senate committee endorsed transferring radiological and nuclear R&D to the S&T Directorate but called for an independent review of FY2011 research priorities. Funding for local and regional initiatives would be restored, with increases for Infrastructure and Geophysical Division and University Programs. However, there would be a reduction of $36 million and elimination of $5 million for data center migration. Construction of NBAF may require significant increases in Laboratory Facilities funding and increased congressional oversight. DHS expects further funding for NBAF construction and decommissioning of PIADC. The estimated total federal cost of the NBAF project increased to $615 million by May 2009, with additional costs for site-specific infrastructure and utility upgrades. Decommissioning the Plum Island Animal Disease Center is expected to cost $190 million. The completion schedule has been extended by one year due to delays in selling Plum Island. Congress authorized DHS to use receipts from the sale of Plum Island to offset costs. Congress authorized DHS to use receipts from the sale of Plum Island to offset costs for NBAF construction and PIADC decommissioning. DHS policies for testing and evaluation of large acquisition projects have been a focus for Congress, with the Under Secretary for Science and Technology issuing necessary regulations in this regard. The Test and Evaluation and Standards Division (TSD) within DHS, overseen by the Director of Operational Testing and Evaluation (DOT&E), is a focus of Congressional oversight. The Homeland Security Institute (HSI) was replaced by the Homeland Security Studies and Analysis Institute (HSSAI) and the Homeland Security Systems Engineering and Development Institute (HSSEDI). These institutes are funded by various S&T programs and agencies, with DHS expecting growth in their usage in the coming years. The Domestic Nuclear Detection Office (DNDO) is the primary DHS organization for combating the threat of nuclear attack. Under the Administration's FY2011 budget, DNDO's research role would be transferred to the Directorate of Science and Technology (S&T). The Administration requested a total of $306 million for DNDO for FY2011, a 20% decrease from the FY2010 appropriation. Excluding Transformational R&D, the remaining activities would increase by 12%. In FY2011, the Senate-reported bill would allocate $53 million for human-portable radiation detection systems, increase funding for radiation portal monitors by $12 million, and reduce funding for human-portable radiation detectors by $15 million due to procurement delays. Additionally, $17 million more than the request would be provided for DNDO, while $31 million would be cut from Systems Development. The bill would also rescind $27 million in unobligated prior-year balances. The committee recommended that funding for Advanced Spectroscopic Portals (ASPs) should come from operational components rather than DNDO. Congressional attention has focused on DNDO's testing and analysis for ASPs, with certification requirements in homeland security appropriations acts. DHS decided in 2010 not to use ASPs for primary screening but will continue developing them for secondary screening. The global nuclear detection architecture overseen by DNDO remains a congressional concern. The global nuclear detection architecture overseen by DNDO is a congressional concern. Changes in funding priorities reflect a shift towards developing a wider range of solutions. Other agencies involved in the architecture include DOD, DOE, State Department, and the intelligence community. DNDO's mission, established by Congress, includes further developing, acquiring, and supporting nuclear detection capabilities. The SAFE Port Act transferred DNDO's research activities to the S&T Directorate, raising questions about Congress's intent. Funding for DNDO's Systems Acquisition was reduced in FY2010, shifting the responsibility to end users. However, the FY2011 budget includes increased funding for DNDO's procurement of radiation detectors. In FY2011, there is increased funding for DNDO's procurement of radiation detectors for the Coast Guard, Customs and Border Protection, and TSA. The reasons for this funding increase are not explained in the budget justification. In FY2011, P.L. 111-230 allocated $600 million for border security, with $394 million to DHS, $196 million to DOJ, and $10 million to the Federal Judiciary. Within DHS, CBP received $306 million for additional Border Patrol agents, CBP officers, integrity programs, tactical communications, UAVs, and forward-operating bases. ICE received $80 million for violence reduction efforts and additional personnel, while $8 million was allocated for basic training at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center. In a budget amendment, the Administration requested an additional $600 million for border security along the Southwest border, with funding for U.S. Border Patrol and Immigration and Customs Enforcement. This included hiring 1,000 new Border Patrol agents, new unmanned aerial detection systems, and additional ICE agents. $8 million was allocated for basic training at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center. The budget amendment requested $201 million for DOJ to increase federal law enforcement presence along the Southwest border, including adding ATF Gunrunner Teams, FBI Hybrid Task Forces, DEA agents, equipment, operational support, attorneys, immigration judges, and support for detention and incarceration costs for criminal aliens. Funding would also support Mexican law enforcement operations with ballistic and DNA analysis, information sharing, and technical capabilities. The budget amendment included $701 million for border security in H.R. 5875, $100 million more than requested. It also allocated $201 million to DOJ for border security efforts, including funding for more law enforcement personnel. The House-passed bill would have provided $412 million for CBP, $13 million more than requested, with $208 million for new Border Patrol agents. The House-passed version of H.R. 5875 allocated $701 million for border security, $100 million more than requested. It included funding for new Border Patrol agents, unmanned aerial detection systems, CBP officers, tactical communications, infrastructure, corruption investigations, and training. Additionally, $30 million was provided for ICE to reduce narcotics smuggling and border violence, and $50 million was allocated for supporting state and local law enforcement through Operation Stonegarden. The Senate-passed version of H.R. 5875 included $600 million for border security. The Senate-passed H.R. 5875 includes $600 million for border security, with allocations to DHS and DOJ. It provides funding for CBP, including additional Border Patrol agents, CBP officers, integrity programs, tactical communications, UAV acquisition, and ICE efforts to reduce violence along the Southwest border. The House introduced a new border security supplemental bill, H.R. 6080, which passed on August 10. The bill contained similar language to the Senate-passed H.R. 5875, with funding provisions for border security efforts. The Senate passed H.R. 6080 on August 12 without amendment. Since 9/11, there has been a growing focus on homeland security funding. The Office of Management and Budget started reporting on combating terrorism in 1998, with homeland security included since 2002. The analysis has become more detailed over the years, making year-to-year comparisons less straightforward. It's important to note that DHS funding doesn't cover all federal spending. DHS funding for homeland security in FY2011 accounts for 51% of total federal funding, with the Department of Defense at 26%, Department of Health and Human Services at 6%, Department of Justice at 6%, and Department of Energy at 3%. These top five agencies collectively make up nearly 93% of all federal spending on homeland security. Not all DHS funding is classified as homeland security-related, as legacy agencies within DHS also conduct other activities. The FY2011 DHS budget request included $37.1 billion for homeland security, but the total requested budget authority was $52.6 billion. This inconsistency is also seen in other agencies listed in the table."
