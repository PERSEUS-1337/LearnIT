    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Spent Nuclear Fuel Control and Accounting Act of 2006\". Several incidents of missing or unaccounted-for spent nuclear fuel have occurred at civilian nuclear power reactors, including Vermont Yankee, Humboldt Bay, and Millstone. Weaknesses in accounting and control have been identified at other reactors. Data from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission shows that most reactors have removed spent fuel rods from their assemblies and store them onsite. Individual spent fuel rods and fragments, whether stored onsite in pools or casks, or at offsite facilities, are highly radioactive and not covered by regulations requiring control and accountability for spent nuclear fuel at civilian power reactors. The oversight of individual spent fuel rods at civilian nuclear power reactors lacks consistent management and specific guidance from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, leading to inconsistent compliance with regulations. The Commission does not evaluate compliance with material control and accounting regulations, and there is much work needed to implement recommendations from a published report. The Government Accountability Office report recommends implementing measures to ensure effective control of spent nuclear fuel at civilian power plants to prevent safety and security risks, especially in the event of terrorist attacks in the United States. SEC. 138 of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 addresses material control and accounting of individual rods and fragments from a dismantled fuel assembly. The Commission will require civilian nuclear power reactors to submit detailed reports on spent fuel rods and fragments. Annual inspections will be conducted to ensure compliance with material control and accounting regulations. Additionally, guidance for storing individual fuel rods and fragments will be provided. The Commission will provide guidance to civilian nuclear power reactors on best management practices for storing individual fuel rods and fragments on site, selecting suitable storage locations, conducting annual inventory of spent nuclear fuel, and cataloguing each item. The Commission will provide guidance to civilian nuclear power reactors on best practices for storing and cataloguing spent nuclear fuel, including individual rods and fragments. The Commission will provide guidance on electronic data management and waste tracking system for storing and cataloguing spent nuclear fuel. The Commission will develop an electronic data management and waste tracking system for civilian nuclear power reactors to store records and track spent nuclear fuel. Regulations will be issued for reactors to digitize existing records or implement the system for new reactors. The Commission may evaluate existing electronic data management and waste tracking systems to determine if they can be modified for compliance with the described system. SEC. 181 of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 requires the development of a detailed manifest form for transporting spent nuclear fuel onsite, specifying whether it contains individual rods or fragments. Regulations will mandate civilian nuclear power reactors to submit completed manifest forms to track any transported fuel rods or fragments. The Commission, in consultation with the Department of Transportation, will identify spent fuel rods or fragments transported outside nuclear power reactor premises using manifests. Conforming amendments to the Nuclear Waste Policy Act include material control, guidance for fuel storage, and an electronic waste tracking system. The Commission, in consultation with the Department of Transportation, will identify spent fuel rods or fragments transported outside nuclear power reactor premises using manifests."
