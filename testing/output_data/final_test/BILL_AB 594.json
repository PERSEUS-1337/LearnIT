    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 82013 of the Government Code is amended to define a \"committee\" as a person or group that receives contributions of $2,000 or more, makes independent expenditures of $1,000 or more, or makes contributions of $10,000 or more to candidates or committees in a calendar year. The status of a committee remains until terminated. Section 82036 is also amended to define a \"late contribution.\" \"Late contribution\" refers to a contribution of $1,000 or more made within 90 days before an election to a candidate, committee, or political party committee. Section 82036.5 of the Government Code is amended to define \"late independent expenditure\" as an independent expenditure of $1,000 or more made for or against a specific candidate or measure within 90 days of an election. The date of the election is considered the deadline to return ballots. Section 84101 is also amended. A committee qualifying under Section 82013 must file a statement of organization with the Secretary of State and local filing officer within 10 days. The Secretary of State assigns a number to each committee and sends copies of statements to appropriate county elections officials. The official receiving a statement of organization from the Secretary of State must send a copy to the clerk of each city in the county deemed appropriate. Committees qualifying before an election but after the last campaign statement must file required information within 24 hours by specified means. If an independent expenditure committee qualifies as a committee and makes expenditures of $1,000 or more to support or oppose a candidate, they must file required information within 24 hours by specified means. Section 84103 of the Government Code is amended to require committees to file an amendment within 10 days if there is a change in the information in their statement of organization. The amendment must be filed with the Secretary of State and the local filing officer. Payments for filing fees or sample ballot appearances made from a candidate's personal funds are not included in the calculation of contributions. Committees must notify the filing officer within 24 hours of any changes to their committee's name, treasurer, or affiliations by facsimile, online, delivery, or in person. This notification is required if the changes occur before the election but after the last preelection statement filing deadline. Committees must notify the filing officer of any changes to their information within 24 hours. The notification should include the changed information, date of the change, person providing the notification, and committee's name and ID number. A committee can file online if the filing officer can receive it that way. Section 84200.5 of the Government Code is repealed, and a new section 84200.5 is added, requiring preelection statements from candidates, elected officers, and committees supporting or opposing them. All elected state officers and candidates not on the upcoming ballot must file preelection statements if they contribute to committees or make significant independent expenditures for the statewide election. A state or county general purpose committee formed under certain sections must file preelection statements if contributions exceed $500 for the statewide primary or general election, but committees formed under other sections are exempt from this requirement. A political party committee must file preelection statements if it receives over $1,000 in contributions or makes contributions totaling $500 or more for a state election. During a city election, a general purpose committee must file preelection statements if it contributes or spends $500 or more. However, committees formed for specific purposes are exempt from this requirement. Candidates for the Board of Administration of the Public Employees\u2019 Retirement System or the Teachers\u2019 Retirement Board, along with their supporting committees, must also file preelection statements during an election period. A general purpose committee formed for a city election must file preelection statements if it contributes or spends $500 or more. Committees formed for specific purposes are exempt from this requirement. Candidates for the Board of Administration of the Public Employees\u2019 Retirement System or the Teachers\u2019 Retirement Board, along with their supporting committees, must also file preelection statements. Section 84200.7, 84202.5, and 84203.5 of the Government Code are repealed. Section 84206 is amended to provide a short form for filing reports for candidates receiving less than $2,000 in contributions and making expenditures of less than $2,000 in a calendar year. Payments for filing fees or statements of qualification from personal funds are excluded from expenditure calculations. Every candidate or officeholder who files a short form and later receives or spends $2,000 or more in a year must notify the Secretary of State, local filing officer, and other candidates within 48 hours. This notification revokes the previously filed short form statement. Elected members or candidates for county central committees who receive less than $2,000 in contributions and make expenditures below $2,000 annually are exempt from filing campaign statements. A local government agency cannot impose filing requirements on elected members or candidates for county central committees of a political party who receive and spend less than $2,000 in a calendar year. Additionally, slate mailer organizations must file campaign statements by July 31 for the period ending June 30 and by January 31 for the period ending December 31. Slate mailer organizations must file campaign reports if they receive payments of $500 or more for supporting or opposing candidates or measures, or if they spend $500 or more on producing slate mailers. Reports must be filed with the county clerk where the organization is based, or in Los Angeles County if domiciled outside California. Slate mailer organizations must file campaign reports based on the location and scope of their slate mailers. The filing requirements vary depending on whether the slate mailers support or oppose candidates or measures in state elections, multiple counties, one county, multiple jurisdictions within one county, or one city. Section 85201 of the Government Code is amended to require individuals filing a statement of intention to establish one campaign contribution account at a financial institution in the state. Candidates raising over $2,000 in contributions in a calendar year must disclose the name, address, and account number of the financial institution on the committee statement of organization. All contributions or loans to the candidate must be deposited in the campaign account. Personal funds used for promoting the candidate must also be deposited in the account before expenditure. Campaign expenditures must be made from the account, except for a candidate's payment for a filing fee and statement of qualifications from personal funds. Candidates not receiving contributions and spending less than $2,000 from personal funds in a year are exempt from these rules. An individual raising campaign contributions under $2,000 in a year must establish a campaign contribution account but is not required to file a committee statement of organization. This act does not require reimbursement by local agencies or school districts as it pertains to creating new crimes or infractions. The Legislature declares that this bill aligns with the Political Reform Act of 1974."
