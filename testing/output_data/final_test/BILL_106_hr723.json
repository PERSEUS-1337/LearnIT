The Congress finds that prescription drug prices have risen significantly, making it difficult for many Americans, especially the elderly and vulnerable populations, to afford their medication. Profit margins for drug manufacturers are high, particularly impacting those who cannot afford their medications. The high cost of prescription drugs is a significant burden for many Americans, especially the elderly. Elderly patients face high out-of-pocket costs for medications, with 90% of those over 60 taking daily medication. Additionally, individuals over 65 fill an average of 15 prescriptions annually for chronic conditions, compared to 5 prescriptions for younger age groups. The United States spends billions on biomedical research, with a large portion allocated to pharmaceutical research. The pharmaceutical industry only spent $14 billion on research in a year. The industry profits from drugs developed with US-funded research, but does not reimburse taxpayers for these profits. The Public Health Service Act is amended to establish a Prescription Drug Assistance Program under Title XXVIII. The Secretary will establish a pharmacy assistance program for eligible persons, providing assistance in a cost-effective manner through various methods like indemnification, vouchers, or direct provider reimbursement. Cash payments will not be made before proof of purchase. Utilization review and other administrative techniques may be used to manage pharmacy benefits and reduce drug interactions and overutilization. The Secretary may authorize local councils on aging, community action agencies, and home care corporations to assist in determining income eligibility for the program. An annual enrollment fee of up to $15 may be required to cover administrative expenses. Copayment requirements and deductibles may be established to control expenses, with copayments not exceeding $10 per prescription. \"SEC. 2802. PROFITS FROM RESEARCH.\" Manufacturers of drugs submitting research results from NIH or under specific agreements must pay 7% of sales to the Secretary before approval. The Secretary can waive this requirement in certain cases. The Secretary can exempt a drug manufacturer from paying 7% of sales to NIH if it is in the public interest. \"SEC. 2803. DEFINITIONS.\" \"For section 2801, covered benefits include prescription drugs like insulin, eligible for reimbursement under the program. Experimental drugs and over-the-counter products are not covered, except for insulin. Eligible persons are defined as individuals who meet certain criteria.\" The term 'eligible person' refers to individuals aged 65 or older without existing pharmacy benefits, with an income below 175 percent of the Federal poverty guidelines. 'Pharmacy assistance' provides up to $500 annually per eligible person for covered benefits."
