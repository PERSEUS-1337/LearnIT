    "content": "Section 1341 of the ACA establishes a transitional reinsurance program to provide payment to non-group market health plans that enrolled high-risk enrollees for 2014 through 2016. The program collected contributions from health insurers and third-party administrators to make reinsurance payments to insurers who enrolled high-cost enrollees in their non-group market plans inside and outside of the exchanges. The report provides an overview of the ACA's transitional reinsurance program, aimed at offsetting expenditures for high-risk individuals and preventing premium increases. It includes background information, program components, implementation details, and addresses questions on HHS's authority. The report also includes a table summarizing key aspects of the program. The transitional reinsurance program aims to manage insurance risk in health insurance by balancing premiums against the collective risk of the covered population. Consumers buy health insurance to protect against financial losses from high-cost medical care, while insurers use various methods to ensure the viability of their business. Insurers manage risk by pooling premiums from enrollees to fund claims. However, sometimes the risk taken on may not be enough to protect against losses. To limit exposure, insurers transfer risk to reinsurers, spreading the risk further. Reinsurance acts as a risk-transfer and risk-spreading mechanism for insurers. Reinsurance is purchased by insurers to limit liability, stabilize loss experience, protect against catastrophes, and increase capacity. It allows insurers to reduce risk exposure, impacting the availability and affordability of health insurance coverage. Reinsurance can influence market entry decisions, product offerings, and premium setting. Contracts can vary in complexity but generally cover a portion of the business. Governmental involvement in insurance and reinsurance is not new, with the government acting as a reinsurer in certain markets. An example is the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002, which created a temporary program to provide a government reinsurance backstop for terrorism losses after the September 11 attacks. The ACA restructures the private health insurance market by requiring coverage for individuals regardless of health status or preexisting conditions. Insurers can adjust premiums based on specific factors, and individuals may be eligible for financial assistance through health insurance exchanges. The ACA restructures the private health insurance market by requiring coverage for individuals regardless of health status or preexisting conditions. Insurers use various methods to manage risk, such as projected enrollment and claims costs, to set rates. The uncertainty insurers face in the early years of ACA implementation is due to the new market reforms and expanded pool of individuals seeking coverage. The ACA introduces risk mitigation programs to stabilize health insurance prices in the private market. Uncertainty arises from the expanded pool of individuals seeking coverage, including healthy and unhealthy individuals. Insurers face financial risks, which the ACA addresses through three programs: transitional reinsurance, risk adjustment, and risk corridors. These programs aim to moderate uncertainty and stabilize the market. The transitional reinsurance program under Section 1341 of the ACA provides temporary payment to non-group market health plans enrolling high-cost enrollees. Insurers previously raised premiums to protect against high costs, but new ACA reforms limit this practice. The ACA establishes a transitional reinsurance program to mitigate financial risk for individuals who had delayed needed health care while uninsured. Insurers can only vary premiums based on certain factors, and the program collects contributions from insurers to make reinsurance payments. The transitional reinsurance program under the ACA collects contributions from insurers to make payments to high-cost enrollees in non-group health plans, transferring funds from insurers to cover claims costs. The program aims to mitigate financial risk for individuals who delayed needed healthcare while uninsured, with specified collections of $10 billion for 2014, $6 billion for 2015, and $4 billion for 2016. Additional collections are deposited into the U.S. Treasury's general fund. The ACA transitional reinsurance program collects contributions from insurers to make payments to high-cost enrollees in non-group health plans. The program aims to mitigate financial risk for individuals who delayed needed healthcare while uninsured. The aggregate collection for the U.S. Treasury is $2 billion for plan year 2014, $2 billion for plan year 2015, and $1 billion for plan year 2016, with additional amounts for program administration. The estimated amounts for program administration are $20.3 million for 2014, $25.4 million for 2015, and $32.0 million for 2016. The ACA transitional reinsurance program collects contributions from insurers to make payments to high-cost enrollees in non-group health plans. The HHS Secretary established a methodology for determining contributions based on enrollment. The national per capita reinsurance contribution was $63 for 2014, $44 for 2015, and $27 for 2016. Insurers could pay national per capita reinsurance contribution amounts in a single payment by mid-January of the following year or in two payments. For example, for plan year 2014, an insurer could make a full payment of $63 per capita by January 1, 2015, or two payments totaling $63 per capita by January 15, 2015, and November 15, 2015. HHS determined reinsurance payments would go to plans with high-cost enrollees whose claims exceed a specified level. The Secretary proposes payment parameters for plans with high-cost enrollees, including attachment point, coinsurance rate, and reinsurance cap. Table 3 shows payment parameters for plan years 2014-2016. An illustrative example of reinsurance payment eligibility and calculation is provided. The transitional reinsurance program impacts health insurance premiums and details amounts collected and remitted in plan years. The transitional reinsurance program aims to offset high-cost enrollees' risk for insurers, impacting market entry, product offerings, and premium rates. Reinsurance funds reduce insurers' risk, allowing lower premiums. Analysis from the American Academy of Actuaries shows insurers used reinsurance availability to offer lower premiums in plan years 2014-2016. The transitional reinsurance program aimed to offset high-cost enrollees' risk for insurers, impacting market entry, product offerings, and premium rates. Collection amounts fell short of the target for the 2014-2016 plan years, affecting reinsurance payments availability. In 2014, $10 billion was allocated for reinsurance payments, reducing health insurance premium rates by 10%-14%. In 2014, CMS collected $9.7 billion in reinsurance contributions, below the target of $12.0 billion. Approximately $7.9 billion was remitted for reinsurance payments to insurers, covering 100% of eligible claims. For the 2014 plan year, $1.7 billion of the $9.7 billion reinsurance contributions was reserved for 2015 payments. In 2015, $6 billion was available for reinsurance payments, reducing premium rates by 6%-11%. Insurers had deadlines for reinsurance contributions and data submissions to CMS. Early reinsurance payments were remitted between March and April 2016. CMS collected $6.5 billion in reinsurance contributions for the 2015 plan year, below the target amount of $8.0 billion. Nationwide, 497 insurers requested reinsurance-eligible claims totaling $14.3 billion. CMS remitted approximately $7.8 billion for reinsurance payments to insurers, with $7.0 billion paid in early reinsurance payments between March and April 2016. The remaining $0.8 billion was paid after November 15, 2016 contributions were collected. For the 2015 plan year, CMS collected $6.5 billion in reinsurance contributions, with $500 million allocated for program administration and $5 million to the U.S. Treasury. In 2016, $4 billion was available for reinsurance payments, reducing premium rates by 4%-6%. The first payment was due by January 15, 2017, and the second by November 15, 2017, with final data submission required by May 1, 2017. CMS anticipates remitting early reinsurance payments to insurers in August 2017, with a total of approximately $4.0 billion expected to be collected for reinsurance contributions. Nationwide, 445 insurers requested reinsurance-eligible claims totaling approximately $7.5 billion, with CMS expecting to remit around $4.0 billion for reinsurance payments to insurers. In August 2017, early reinsurance payments of approximately $3.3 billion are expected to be remitted to insurers for the 2016 plan year. CMS will make an early reinsurance payment to insurers for the 2016 plan year, totaling approximately $4.0 billion. The HHS Secretary is implementing the transitional reinsurance program for all states, as no state currently has their own program. In states where the federal government is implementing the program, HHS acts as the reinsurance entity, collecting contributions from insurers and third-party administrators. CMS collects contributions from insurers and third-party administrators under the ACA to make payments to eligible insurers. Collections are first allocated to reinsurance payments until targets are met, then to program administration expenses and the U.S. Treasury. Prior allocation methods have been amended, with the first collection going towards reinsurance and expenses, and the second to the Treasury. In a proposed rule in March 2014, CMS questioned its authority to prioritize reinsurance payments over payments to the U.S. Treasury. One commenter noted that the ACA does not specify the order of payments. CMS agreed, stating it has discretion in allocating reinsurance contributions. A final rule in May 2014 revised the allocation formula, ensuring that funds collected from insurers are not deposited solely to the U.S. Treasury. The current allocation formula for reinsurance contributions has raised concerns about its legality. The GAO issued an opinion stating that the method of allocating funds from insurers is not authorized by Section 1341 of the ACA. This section specifies that each insurer's contribution should reflect its proportionate share of the total amount allocated for each calendar year. The GAO found that Section 1341 of the ACA requires HHS to collect specific amounts from insurers for the U.S. Treasury without flexibility. The collected funds cannot be used for reinsurance payments to insurers. The GAO found that Section 1341 of the ACA requires HHS to collect specific amounts from insurers for the U.S. Treasury without flexibility, preventing the funds from being used for reinsurance payments. GAO recommended apportioning receipts between reinsurance payments and the U.S. Treasury on a pro rata basis, citing federal court decisions supporting this approach. CMS disagreed with GAO's conclusions and planned to prioritize collections towards reinsurance payments despite GAO's opinion. The GAO legal opinions are not binding on the executive branch, but they provide helpful guidance on appropriations matters. The Supreme Court's decision in King v. Burwell suggests interpreting the ACA in a way that improves health insurance markets. In King, the court rejected a literal reading of a statutory provision to avoid higher premiums and lower enrollment. CMS prioritizing reinsurance contributions over U.S. Treasury contributions benefits insurers by ensuring more funding for reinsurance payments. The King v. Burwell decision suggests interpreting the ACA to benefit health insurance markets by prioritizing reinsurance contributions over U.S. Treasury contributions to ensure more funding for insurers enrolling high-cost individuals. The Court's interpretation was guided by the broader structure of the ACA, considering potential policy consequences and statutory construction principles. The King Court interpreted the ACA provision to prioritize reinsurance contributions over U.S. Treasury contributions, considering the broader structure of the ACA and statutory construction principles. It is unclear if this ruling would support a different interpretation of Section 1341 unless evidence in the ACA favored it. No suits have been filed challenging CMS's prioritization of reinsurance contributions."
