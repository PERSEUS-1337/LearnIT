    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Innovative STEM Networks Act\" or the \"I-STEM Act.\" Congress finds that there is a high demand for qualified workers in STEM fields, with STEM job holders earning higher wages and having better job prospects compared to non-STEM occupations. According to the Harris STEM Survey, most parents believe STEM education should be a priority in the U.S., but only half think it is a top priority. Additionally, only one in five STEM college students felt well-prepared by their K-12 education for college STEM courses. SEC. 3. STEM INNOVATION NETWORKS. Title II of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 is amended to include a new part called \"PART E--STEM INNOVATION NETWORKS\" with the purpose outlined in SEC. 2501. The text authorizes a program to provide grants for STEM innovation networks to increase students' readiness for STEM careers by developing evidence-based practices and supporting STEM educators. The curr_chunk focuses on the development of effective STEM educators, testing teaching and learning models for students to meet STEM academic standards, and student engagement in STEM subjects. The curr_chunk focuses on a grant program related to STEM education. The Secretary will award grants to establish STEM Innovation networks to improve student achievement in STEM subjects and prepare students for careers in STEM fields. Not less than 5 and not more than 10 grants will be awarded each fiscal year, with priority given to entities serving high-need educational agencies. Eligible entities must submit an application to receive a grant. An eligible entity must submit an application to the Secretary containing required information, including a description of planned activities to address STEM education needs, data on student achievement and teacher evaluations in STEM subjects. The eligible entity must provide data on student achievement and teacher evaluations in STEM subjects, review workforce needs in the state, identify STEM subjects to address with grant funds, and describe planned activities. The eligible entity must describe activities to improve STEM instruction aligned with State standards, integrate with informal STEM programs, provide analysis of STEM education quality, and indicate if grant funds will be used. An eligible entity receiving a grant must establish STEM innovation networks to prepare students for STEM careers, including coordinating activities with other STEM programs. The curr_chunk focuses on increasing student awareness about STEM career pathways, developing statewide plans aligning workforce needs with education programs, and identifying strengths and weaknesses in State STEM education efforts. The curr_chunk discusses the authorized activities that an eligible entity can use a grant for, including promoting STEM education tools for educators, providing mentoring for new STEM teachers, and developing preservice teacher programs emphasizing STEM content at higher education institutions. The curr_chunk focuses on supporting elementary and secondary school students in STEM competitions and activities, implementing STEM standards from prekindergarten to grade 12, and developing STEM education programs in secondary schools and community colleges to meet local needs. The curr_chunk discusses the use of funds in STEM education programs to supplement, not supplant, existing funds, and the requirement for states to maintain or increase fiscal effort for STEM subjects. It also defines eligible entities as state or local educational agencies partnering with successful STEM achievement organizations. The curr_chunk provides definitions for key terms related to improving student achievement in STEM subjects, including eligible entities such as nonprofit organizations, businesses, STEM faculty departments, educational service agencies, and others. It also defines terms like community college, high-need community, high-need local educational agency, high-need school, and informal STEM program. The curr_chunk defines \"informal STEM program\" as a program outside of regular school hours, and \"STEM\" as science, technology, engineering, or mathematics. It also authorizes $150,000,000 for fiscal year 2015 and beyond. The Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 is amended to include a new section on STEM Innovation Networks, with a purpose and grant program outlined."
