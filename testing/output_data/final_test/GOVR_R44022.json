    "content": "The Internet is a decentralized network of interconnected networks owned by private sector entities. Computers are identified by unique IP numbers, allowing for communication and access to information worldwide. Domain names were created to simplify location names, with the DNS system mapping addresses to domain names. Root servers coordinate this system. The U.S. government originally funded and operated key components of the network architecture that enabled the domain name system to function. In 1998, management of the DNS was transitioned to ICANN, a not-for-profit international organization based in California. ICANN employs a multistakeholder system of governance for policy decisions. The Board of Directors, with input from various stakeholder groups, makes decisions regarding the Internet and domain name system. The U.S. government initially had authority over ICANN's management post-1998 transition, utilizing agreements like the Memorandum of Understanding and Joint Project Agreement. Currently, NTIA and ICANN are participants in an Affirmation of Commitments (AoC) agreement, allowing scrutiny and evaluation by review boards. The AoC is voluntary, and either party can withdraw at any time. The \"IANA functions contract\" authorizes ICANN to manage the technical aspects of the domain name system, including number resources, protocol assignments, and domain names. Additionally, a cooperative agreement exists between NTIA and Verisign. The IANA functions contract authorizes Verisign to manage the root zone file for .com and .net registries, overseen by NTIA. NTIA's role is administrative, while policymaking is done by ICANN. NTIA has never refused ICANN's directives under the contract. The IANA functions contract gives the U.S. government a stewardship role over ICANN and the domain name system, acting as a backstop in extreme circumstances. The government also participates in ICANN policy development through the Governmental Advisory Committee (GAC). The U.S. government has influence over ICANN and the DNS through the IANA functions contract. NTIA announced its intention to transition stewardship role over domain name functions to the global Internet community by letting the contract with ICANN expire. NTIA extended the IANA functions contract through September 30, 2016, and asked ICANN to collaborate with global Internet stakeholders to develop a transition proposal. Various Internet organizations had previously called for the globalization of ICANN and IANA functions. NTIA has specified key principles for the transition proposal, including maintaining the multistakeholder model and the security of the Internet DNS. ICANN led a process to reach consensus on the transition, divided into IANA Stewardship Transition and Enhancing ICANN Accountability. The transition must have broad community support and not replace NTIA with a government-led solution. The ICANN Board formally accepted the IANA Stewardship Transition proposal and Enhancing ICANN Accountability report, transmitting them to NTIA for approval. A steering group was formed to oversee the transition process in an open, transparent, inclusive, and accountable manner, with input from the Internet community. The IANA Stewardship Transition process involved a Steering Group and a Coordination Group composed of representatives from various Internet stakeholder communities. The Coordination Group was responsible for preparing a transition proposal, with a focus on coordinating the development of proposals for the three primary IANA functions. The ICG received three proposals for the primary IANA functions: Number Resources from the RIR, Protocol Parameters from IETF, and Domain Names from CWG-Stewardship. While the first two proposals were completed in January 2015, the domain name proposal faced challenges in reaching a consensus. The CWG-Stewardship group, consisting of 19 members and 115 participants, debated whether a new entity should oversee the IANA functions contract or if ICANN should be given enhanced accountability over the IANA function. On March 10, 2016, the ICANN Board approved the final IANA Transition Stewardship Proposal. The ICANN Board approved the final IANA Transition Stewardship Proposal, combining proposals for Numbers Resources, Protocol Parameters, and Domain Names. The numbers community suggested ICANN continue as the IANA Functions Operator under a contract with RIRs, with a Service Level Agreement and Review Committee. The protocol parameters community proposed to maintain the current system of agreements and oversight mechanisms. The domain names community proposed forming a new legal entity, Post-Transition IANA (PTI), as an affiliate of ICANN to oversee IANA functions. This proposal integrates elements of internal and external models, with ICANN assuming NTIA's role and PTI becoming the IANA functions operator. A Customer Standing Committee (CSC) would monitor PTI's performance, and a multistakeholder IANA Function Review process (IFR) would be established. The legal jurisdiction of ICANN in California would remain unchanged. ICANN initiated a process to enhance its accountability alongside the IANA stewardship transition. A Cross Community Working Group (CCWG) was formed to develop proposals for strengthening ICANN's accountability mechanisms. Two interrelated Work Streams were pursued, with a focus on enhancing accountability mechanisms in the absence of the historical contractual relationship with the U.S. government. Work Stream 1 focused on enhancing ICANN accountability within the IANA Stewardship Transition timeframe, while Work Stream 2 addressed topics extending beyond the transition. The CCWG membership included individuals appointed by stakeholder organizations, with decisions made by consensus. Additionally, up to seven advisors provided independent advice and research. The CCWG-Accountability Work Stream 1 proposal, approved by the ICANN Board on March 10, 2016, aims to enhance ICANN's accountability by creating the \"Empowered Community\" to enforce powers when consensus cannot be reached. This new entity, under California law, will act at the direction of the multistakeholder community and be the Sole Designator of the ICANN Board. The Empowered Community, as per the CCWG-Accountability Work Stream 1 proposal, will have the power to reject ICANN budgets, approve changes to Fundamental Bylaws, remove ICANN Board Directors, recall the entire ICANN Board, initiate Independent Review Processes, and inspect ICANN's books and records. The proposal includes recommendations for a revised mission statement for ICANN Bylaws, an enhanced Independent Review Process, modifications to the Reconsideration Request process, a commitment to human rights, incorporating reviews from the Affirmation of Commitments, and considering accountability in structural reviews. It also addresses the role of the Governmental Advisory Committee in the Empowered Community. The CCWG-Accountability proposal recommended new language in the Bylaws to prevent ICANN from taking actions inconsistent with its Bylaws, stressing the importance of \"stress tests\" to measure accountability measures' resilience to various scenarios. 37 specific contingencies were identified and consolidated into five categories for stress testing. The CCWG-Accountability proposal recommended stress tests to measure ICANN's accountability resilience. 37 contingencies were categorized into five groups: financial crisis, operational failure, legal issues, accountability failure, and failure to external stakeholders. According to the CCWG-Accountability charter, stress tests for ICANN's accountability could include analyzing weaknesses, risks, remedies, and proposing solutions to mitigate risks. Proposed accountability enhancements will be tested to ensure they do not make ICANN more susceptible to undue influence or paralyze its work. The ICANN Board adopted revised bylaws in response to the transition plan submitted to NTIA, completing implementation tasks by August 12, 2016. NTIA extended the IANA function contract until September 30, 2016, with the option of further extensions up to three years. NTIA requested ICANN and Verisign to develop a transition plan for managing the root zone file after the IANA transition. NTIA has a cooperative agreement with Verisign designating NTIA as the Root Zone Administrator. Under a proposal by ICANN and Verisign, the IANA Functions Operator will have administrative authority over Verisign's operation of the root zone file. NTIA had to approve the multistakeholder community proposal for the transition to proceed. ICANN submitted the transition proposal to NTIA on March 10, 2016, and NTIA began reviewing it within 90 days. NTIA contracted with the Berkman Center at Harvard to review the IANA Stewardship Transition proposal. NTIA issued a report on June 9, 2016, stating that the proposal meets criteria for transitioning U.S. government stewardship over IANA. The proposal supports the multistakeholder model, maintains Internet security, and meets global customer needs without replacing NTIA's role with a government-led solution. Concerns have arisen in Congress over the proposed transition of the IANA functions from NTIA to ICANN. Some Members argue for additional scrutiny, while others question the necessity of the transition. Congress, with legislative and budgetary authority over NTIA, closely monitors the transition progress through relevant committees. The House Energy and Commerce Committee and the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee, along with the House and Senate Appropriations Committees, have jurisdiction over NTIA and could impact its ability to relinquish authority over the IANA functions. Representative Shimkus introduced H.R. 4342, the DOTCOM Act, which would have delayed the transition until GAO submits a report on the advantages and disadvantages of the change, including national security concerns. H.R. 4342, the DOTCOM Act, aimed to delay the transition of NTIA's authority over IANA to the multistakeholder model. GAO recommended NTIA to develop a formal framework for evaluating the transition plan. The DOTCOM Act, introduced as an amendment to H.R. 4435, aimed to delay the transition of NTIA's authority over IANA to a multistakeholder model. The House passed H.R. 4435 with provisions to protect the .mil domain and maintain separation between policymaking and technical operations. The Senate also addressed the future of Internet governance in its version of the National Defense Authorization Act. Section 1646 of S. 2410 in the National Defense Authorization Act advises transferring the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority functions to a global multi-stakeholder community only if the '.MIL' domain and Internet Protocol addresses used by the Department of Defense remain exclusive. The Department of Defense is directed to sustain stewardship of Internet root zone servers and seek agreement through the IANA transition process. The committee urged DOD to ensure that the .mil domain retains its current status during the IANA transition process. The Carl Levin and Howard P. \"Buck\" McKeon National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015 was signed into law without the DOTCOM Act provision. Congress stated that the Secretary of Defense should only support the IANA transfer if assurances are given to protect the .mil domain's status. Congress emphasized the need for assurances to protect legacy top-level domain names and IP address numbers, especially those used by the Department of Defense and the US Government for national security. They also stressed the importance of maintaining consensus-based decision making in the multi-stakeholder approach and ensuring transparent and efficient accountability processes to uphold a free, open, and resilient Internet. Additionally, Congress called for the Secretary of Defense to take necessary steps to sustain the Internet root zone servers managed by the Department of Defense. The House Appropriations Committee approved H.R. 4660, the FY2015 Commerce, Justice, Science (CJS) Appropriations Act, which does not include funds for NTIA to carry out the transition of Internet domain name system functions. An amendment was adopted to prevent the relinquishment of NTIA's responsibility. H.R. 4660 was passed by the House on May 30, 2014. The Senate Appropriations Committee directed NTIA to review the proposed transition of the IANA contract to ensure ICANN has an approved oversight plan. NTIA was also required to report quarterly on the privatization process. The Senate Appropriations Committee directed NTIA to review the proposed transition of the IANA contract to ensure ICANN has an approved oversight plan. The committee expressed concern about NTIA's advocacy for U.S. businesses and consumers in ICANN's Governmental Advisory Committee. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015 prohibits NTIA from using funds to relinquish its responsibility for Internet domain name system functions during FY2015. The prohibition on funding for NTIA's IANA transition activities expires on September 30, 2015. The Explanatory Statement directs NTIA to inform Congressional committees in advance of any proposed successor contract or decision related to changing NTIA's role with ICANN or IANA activities. NTIA is also required to submit a report to the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations regarding potential recourse if the transition to a new contract negatively impacts the United States. Legislation introduced in 2014 aimed to prevent NTIA from relinquishing its DNS and IANA responsibilities without specific criteria being met. Bills such as H.R. 4367, H.R. 4398, and H.R. 5737 were proposed but not enacted by the 113th Congress. The DOTCOM Act of the 113th Congress was reintroduced in the 114th Congress by Representative Shimkus as H.R. 805 on February 5, 2015. The amended version of H.R. 805 reflecting a bipartisan agreement was passed by the House on June 23, 2015 (378-25). H.R. 805, passed by the House, delays NTIA's authority over IANA function termination until after submitting a report to Congress on the final transition proposal. The report must certify support for the multistakeholder model, maintain Internet security, meet global expectations, preserve Internet openness, and not replace NTIA with a government-led solution. H.R. 805 and S. 1551 require NTIA to certify ICANN's bylaws changes in the transition proposal. S. 1551 is similar to H.R. 805 and was introduced by Senator Thune. H.R. 2578 passed by the House appropriates funds for DOC and NTIA, stating NTIA's responsibility over Internet domain name system functions should not be relinquished. The Senate Appropriations Committee directed NTIA to continue quarterly reports on the transition process and inform the Committee in advance of any decision regarding a successor contract. The committee expressed concerns about the process and supported the continued US stewardship role over the domain name system for security and freedom of speech. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 (P.L. 114-113) prohibits NTIA from relinquishing control over IANA in FY2016. Section 539 of P.L. 114-113 states that funds cannot be used for this purpose during fiscal year 2016. However, this restriction does not apply in fiscal year 2017. The Senate Appropriations Committee expressed concerns about the proposed IANA transition in the FY2017 Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act. The committee's concern about the proposed IANA transition and the security of .gov and .mil domains led to directives for NTIA to provide quarterly reports and notify committees in advance of any decisions. The House Appropriations Committee approved the FY2017 CJS Appropriations act, seeking to prohibit NTIA from relinquishing authority over IANA in FY2017. Section 534 of the act prohibits the use of funds for this purpose. The bill report (H.Rept. 114-605) expressed concerns about NTIA's plan to transition Internet domain name functions to the global multistakeholder community. Section 534 of the Protecting Internet Freedom Act (S. 3034) prohibits NTIA from relinquishing authority over IANA without congressional approval. The Protecting Internet Freedom Act requires NTIA to certify sole ownership of .gov and .mil domains to Congress. Senator Cruz submitted the bill as an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act. Other related legislation includes the Global Internet Freedom Act and the Defending Internet Freedom Act. H.R. 2251 and H.R. 5329 aim to prevent NTIA from relinquishing control over domain name functions and the IANA function unless specific criteria are met. S.Res. 71 designates a week as \"Internet Governance Awareness Week.\" S.Res. 71, passed on February 5, 2015, aims to increase awareness about NTIA's proposed transition and the importance of accountability and governance reforms for ICANN. Congress has held hearings on the IANA transition and ICANN's management of the domain name system. On May 13, 2015, House Committees held hearings on Internet governance and ICANN's operations. On July 8, 2015, another hearing focused on Internet governance progress post-ICANN 53. On March 17, 2016, a hearing discussed privatizing the Internet Assigned Number Authority. On May 24, 2016, the Senate Committee held a hearing. The Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation held a hearing on the transition of the Internet Assigned Number Authority from NTIA. The key issue is whether NTIA should relinquish its authority by September 30, 2016, and what safeguards should be in place for the domain name system. Supporters of the transition argue that by transferring authority over ICANN and the DNS to the global Internet community, the U.S. government will support the multistakeholder model of Internet governance and be able to effectively oppose proposals for intergovernmental control over the Internet. If NTIA does not relinquish authority, the U.S. will be in a paradoxical position of opposing government control while maintaining unilateral authority over the Internet DNS. Supporters of the transition argue that the U.S. government should transfer authority over ICANN and the DNS to the global Internet community, as envisioned since the inception of ICANN. They believe that ICANN has matured and improved its accountability, making the transition possible. However, opponents fear that without NTIA's oversight, the integrity and stability of the DNS may be compromised, especially in light of the Edward Snowden NSA revelations. Critics are concerned about the risks of foreign governments gaining influence over the DNS through a new international governance mechanism, potentially compromising the integrity and stability of the Internet. Some suggest delaying the transition and maintaining NTIA's oversight of ICANN. Proponents of delaying the transition argue that extending NTIA's IANA contract with ICANN past September 30, 2016 is necessary to ensure accountability, robustness, and resistance to undue government influence in ICANN's new governance structure. They also point out that important issues like ICANN's jurisdiction and human rights are still being developed under Enhancing Accountability activities. Opponents believe that the multistakeholder community has reached consensus on the transition plan and it should proceed as scheduled. The U.S. government has exclusive control over the .mil and .gov domains, with the .mil domain reserved for military use and the .gov domain available to governmental entities. Proponents argue that delaying the transition of domain name system authority to ICANN past September 30, 2016 would weaken the multistakeholder system and strengthen foreign government influence. There is no contract between ICANN and the U.S. government. The U.S. government has control over the .mil and .gov domains, with no contract conferring ownership to the government. The transition of domain name system authority to ICANN could impact U.S. government control of these domains. NTIA requested ICANN to obtain approval before re-delegating .mil and .gov domains. Some argue for a legally binding contract to ensure U.S. ownership, control, and use of these domains. Opponents claim the transition constitutes a transfer of government property, which only Congress has the power to do. The transition of domain name system authority to ICANN could impact U.S. government control of the .mil and .gov domains. NTIA disputes claims that the transition involves transferring government property, arguing that federal agencies can discontinue services without specific legislative authority. Congress has been asked to examine whether the termination of NTIA's contract with ICANN would result in the transfer of government property. NTIA has evaluated the transition plan for domain name system authority to ICANN, meeting criteria set in 2014. Input was gathered from federal agencies and guided by GAO recommendations. GAO suggested evaluation frameworks for NTIA to consider. Congress is evaluating NTIA's assessment of the transition plan for domain name system authority to ICANN, focusing on ICANN's accountability to the multistakeholder community and potential influence from foreign governments and intergovernmental organizations. Concerns include the ability to implement transition recommendations before NTIA's contract with IANA ends, impacting the governance of ICANN and the DNS in the broader context of Internet governance. The question of how the Internet should be governed is becoming more pressing as the Internet expands globally. ICANN's policy decisions can impact areas such as intellectual property, cybersecurity, privacy, and Internet freedom. National governments are increasingly involved in ICANN policy decisions, especially when they intersect with national laws and interests. ICANN is seen as a model of multistakeholder governance, and its governance may set a precedent for future policy debates. The governance of the Internet by ICANN may set a precedent for future policy debates on the role of governments and intergovernmental organizations in governing the Internet."
