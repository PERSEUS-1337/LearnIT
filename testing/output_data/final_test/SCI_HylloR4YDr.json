    "content": "Many robot locomotion tasks require control policies parameterized by goals. Deep reinforcement learning involves learning Inverse Dynamics Models (IDMs) to map current state and desired goal to actions. Good performance with IDMs depends on learning shared information between experiences for generalization. A training process guides learning of latent representations to encode shared information, enabling efficient navigation in goal space. The approach is effective in high-dimensional locomotion environments like Mujoco Ant, PyBullet Humanoid, and PyBullet Minitaur, with demonstrated quantitative and qualitative results. In reinforcement learning, agents optimize behavior to maximize rewards by learning goal-conditioned policies or value functions. Control policies in robotics involve following dynamic sequences of waypoints, rather than a single policy. The approach of learning functions conditioned on state and goals has shown superior performance in tasks like Mujoco Ant, PyBullet Humanoid, and PyBullet Minitaur. In reinforcement learning, agents optimize behavior by learning goal-conditioned policies or value functions. A popular model for transitioning between waypoints is the Inverse Dynamics Model (IDM), which maps current state and goal to actions. This paper introduces a generalized IDM that achieves goal-direction motion efficiently without requiring full goal state information or previous state history. The model is trained on a reduced goal space, enhancing control in robotics tasks. The IDM is a model for transitioning between waypoints in reinforcement learning. It is trained on a reduced goal space, allowing the agent to navigate to the goal using only intermediate 3-D positions. The algorithm eliminates the need to randomly sample goals during training by exploiting known symmetries/equivalences of the system. This includes defining equivalence modulo orientation among experiences to capture symmetry under translations and rotations. Our model utilizes equivalence modulo orientation among experiences to guide training of latent representations shared by experiences, improving generalization capability in reinforcement learning. The IDM eliminates the need to randomly sample goals during training by exploiting known symmetries of the system, resulting in high sample efficiency and superior performance. Our approach in the Mujoco Ant environment and the Minitaur and Humanoid environments in PyBullet demonstrates success in navigating to arbitrary goal positions in 3-D space. Ablation experiments show that collecting generalized experience boosts performance, condensing input pairs into a latent representation is crucial, and learning this representation is critical to algorithm success. Several recent works focus on learning policies and value functions conditioned over state and goal spaces, with applications in hierarchical reinforcement learning algorithms. Goal-conditioned value functions are used to reach intrinsic goals, extract relevant information, and excel at various tasks. Goal-conditioned value functions are utilized in model-based control settings to map the agent's current state and goal state to desired actions. They have been applied in various contexts, such as training models for real robots and predicting actions from compressed inputs like RGB images. Specifically, IDMs are used to provide curiosity-based rewards in locomotion environments like Humanoid, Minitaur, and Ant. The red sphere indicates the goal in locomotion environments like Humanoid, Minitaur, and Ant. IDMs are used to provide supervision for learning visual features relevant to the robot's task. By combining IDMs with known symmetric properties of the robot, goal-conditioned policies or value functions are not needed. An IDM conditioned on the state space and a reduced goal space is trained using data collected while training any RL algorithm. This unique data collection exploits equivalences in experiences observed during training to learn a latent representation space shared between equivalent experiences. The IDM produces actions based on this latent representation, allowing for generalization over unobserved parts of the state and goal spaces. In reinforcement learning, the agent interacts with an environment modeled as a Markov Decision Process with state space, action space, transition probabilities, reward function, and discount factor. The agent learns a policy to maximize the expected return. Goal-conditioned RL optimizes for learning a policy under a goal-specific reward function. On-policy RL algorithms use deep neural networks to estimate policy gradients or maximize a surrogate. In reinforcement learning, deep neural networks are used to estimate policy gradients and maximize a surrogate objective function subject to constraints. Off-policy RL algorithms incorporate elements of deep Q-learning into the actor-critic formulation. Hindsight Experience Replay (HER) is a popular technique for learning policies efficiently from sparse rewards in goal-based environments. Our method leverages samples collected while training a state-of-the-art RL algorithm to train an IDM that maps the current state and desired goal position to the action required to reach the goal. Our goal is to collect data for the Inverse Dynamics Model (IDM) by learning a policy under a single reward function. We collect state, action, and position data from transitions observed during training, emphasizing the difference between the high-dimensional state space S and the goal space O. The Inverse Dynamics Model (IDM) collects data through experiences defined as tuples (s, o, o , a), where s is the current state, o is the 3-D position, and a is the action taken. The IDM can reproduce actions based on training data, using supervised learning techniques. The Inverse Dynamics Model (IDM) can reproduce actions based on training data but struggles to generalize good behavior to unseen states and observations. The current hypothesis of collecting data for a single reward leads to biased samples, limiting the agent's ability to navigate certain parts of the input space. This results in the agent failing to reach goals outside of the training data, as shown in qualitative evidence. The IDM struggles to generalize beyond training data, leading to bias in the state space. To address this, generalized experience is collected by considering equivalence modulo orientation. The LFM generates latent representations for equivalent samples, minimizing distance to enforce equivalence and fitting the IDM for correct action prediction. Unseen experiences are collected by changing the agent's initial orientation, enhancing the agent's ability to navigate diverse input spaces. The IDM struggles to generalize beyond training data due to bias in the state space. Generalized experiences are collected by changing the agent's initial orientation, leading to new trajectories. Despite using generalized experiences, the IDM does not always show great improvements in tasks like navigating to the desired goal position in an arbitrary direction. To address this, e.m.o. experiences are used to train a Latent Feature Model that discards irrelevant information from the state space. The Latent Feature Model (LFM) aims to learn the equivalence between e.m.o. experiences from the generalized experience set G by generating latent representations for two e.m.o. experience samples simultaneously and optimizing their distance using a Siamese framework. The objective is to incorporate the property of equivalence modulo actions in the latent representations and learn a good mapping from these representations to actions. The Latent Feature Model (LFM) generates latent representations for e.m.o. experience samples, which are then used as input to the Inverse Dynamics Model (IDM) to predict actions. Both models are trained simultaneously to produce rich latent representations for goal-directed motion. At test time, only the current state and goal are needed for generating the latent representation. The Latent Feature Model (LFM) generates latent representations for experience samples, used by the Inverse Dynamics Model (IDM) to predict actions. A series of ablation experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach, with superior results on locomotion environments compared to baselines. Training and evaluation methods are kept consistent across all approaches. The test setting details, network architectures, and hyperparameters are discussed in the Appendix. The method aims at goal-directed motion and is compared with on-policy and off-policy RL algorithms. In the baseline experiment, (s, o, o, a) samples are collected by taking random actions. The Vanilla Goal-Conditioned Policy (VGCP) algorithm learns a policy on state and desired goal input using RL techniques like PPO and SAC. The study compares on-policy and off-policy RL algorithms for goal-directed motion, using Soft Actor Critic (SAC) and Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) with Hindsight Experience Replay (HER) for Humanoid tasks. Sparse rewards indicate target success, while dense rewards include control and contact costs. Experience is collected using standard RL algorithms and generalized experiences for training the IDM. In the study, generalized experiences are collected by saving agent trajectories and rotating the initial state by a random angle. These experiences are used to train the IDM, with LR emerging as the best performer in navigating towards the goal. The learned behavior is extended to unseen parts of the state space using a dual network architecture. In this experiment, a dual network architecture is used to train the LFM and IDM with a weighted loss function. The goal is to minimize the distance between latent representations and fit the IDM output to desired actions. The agent navigates through waypoints to evaluate the IDM's performance in learning optimal trajectories and walking style. The comparison shows that neither HER nor VGCP performed well in this setting. In this section, the performances of the algorithm and baselines are analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively. The analysis includes overall performances of all methods, distribution of distances to the goal at test time, comparison between the best baseline and LR on waypoint navigation task, and analysis of speed, trajectory, and walking style on Humanoid. The results show that LR and GE outperform all other baselines in three environments. LR is consistently the best performing algorithm. VGCP performs well in Minitaur and Humanoid environments but poorly in the Ant environment. The performance of different algorithms varies across environments. LR and GE outperform other baselines in three environments, with LR consistently performing the best. VGCP performs well in Minitaur and Humanoid environments but poorly in the Ant environment due to insufficient training samples. HER-Sp and HER-De show poor performance compared to GE, LR, and VGCP. Analysis of violin plots reveals variations in distances from targets across episodes for different algorithms. The analysis of the performance of different algorithms across environments shows that LR and GE outperform other baselines in three environments, with LR consistently performing the best. The peak of the LR distribution is lower than other methods, indicating successful navigation to the goal in most episodes. However, there are instances where the agent fails due to wrong actions learned during training. The Humanoid model may learn wrong actions, causing early agent death. Comparing LR and VGCP, LR navigates waypoints more efficiently and faster. VGCP struggles to reach the last goal due to slow speed. LR outperforms other baselines in three environments, with successful navigation in most episodes but occasional failures due to learned wrong actions. The agent trained using VGCP moves arbitrarily towards the goal, with orientation not aligned with motion. Closest distances in episodes are biased by initial state and target configurations. Results show LR outperforms other methods in reaching goals outside training distribution. The proposed algorithm achieves goal-directed motion for various locomotion agents by learning the inverse dynamics model on shared latent representations. Key steps include utilizing agent experience from training, generalizing the experience, and learning shared information through latent representation for reaching the goal. Extensive qualitative results are provided in the Appendix. The proposed algorithm achieves goal-directed motion for locomotion agents by learning inverse dynamics models on shared latent representations. Extensive qualitative and quantitative evidence shows superior generalization over unseen parts of the state space compared to existing methods. Training environments include Humanoid and Minitaur in PyBullet. Different reward functions are used for data collection and training, encouraging agents to move towards goals. The agent receives rewards based on reaching the goal or incurring costs. Humanoid is a bipedal robot with a 43-D state space and 17-D action space. Minitaur is a quadrupedal robot with a 17-D state space and 8-D action space. Ant is a quadrupedal robot with a 111-D state space and 8-D action space. The agent navigates in 3-D space using torques at 8 joints. Different locomotion environments are chosen for goal-based navigation. Specific details on environment interactions, network architectures, and optimization methods are provided in Table 2. The Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 1e-3 and batch size of 512 is used across all environments. After using a learning rate of 1e-3 and batch size of 512 for all methods in various environments, training was frozen after 5 million samples in the Humanoid environment to improve performance. Different numbers of environment interactions were collected for the Ant and Minitaur environments during training. On-policy data was used for RL, while only the first half of training samples was used for GE and LR, with the second half generated using a transformation method. During training, 1 million, 2 million, and 5 million samples were collected for the Ant, Minitaur, and Humanoid environments respectively. The hyperparameters for training included the dimension k of the latent representation space and the ratio of the latent representation loss (L1) to the regression loss (L2), \u03bb. The values used were \u03bb = 0.25 for all environments, k = 10 for Ant and Minitaur, and k = 50 for Humanoid. At test time, the agent is rotated by a random angle, and the target is placed at a specific distance and angle from the agent in each environment. During training, different numbers of samples were collected for different environments. The agent is rotated by a random angle at test time, and the target is placed at a specific distance and angle from the agent in each environment. The episode consists of a maximum of 1000 steps, terminating when the agent reaches the goal or falls down. The method's performance is tested on 1000 episodes with 10 random seeds, ensuring a fair comparison between all methods. The closest distance from the target that the agent reaches is reported for each episode. The method outperforms baselines despite using inferior samples. The method outperforms baselines despite learning from inferior samples, focusing on actions that lead to transitions rather than optimal actions. The IDM formulation enables learning actions for goal-directed motion, while the LFM framework allows the agent to generalize by producing the same action for transitions with a common latent representation. Our method outperforms baselines by generalizing motion to a larger goal space, utilizing goal-conditioned policies for exploration and achieving goal-directed motion efficiently. Our method enables the agent to learn a good policy efficiently by generalizing representations of training experience to unencountered state and goal spaces. This leads to improved performance and sample efficiency compared to baseline methods like VGCP. The agent trained using VGCP moves slowly and follows a non-optimal path to navigate through waypoints. In contrast, the LR agent learns an IDM that encourages walking forward efficiently, resulting in superior performance. In contrast to the LR agent, the VGCP agent struggles to navigate efficiently through waypoints, raising questions about the performance of the HER algorithm in high-dimensional locomotion tasks with specific actions required for walking and goal navigation. The importance of latent representation dimension k in achieving good performance in high-dimensional locomotion tasks with specific actions required for walking and goal navigation is discussed. The dimension of the latent representation k is a crucial hyperparameter that determines the performance of LR, with choosing a bad value potentially resulting in information loss or irrelevant information being encoded. In experiments, k = 10 for Ant and Minitaur, and k = 50 for Humanoid are used to show the impact on performance in the Ant environment. In the Ant environment, the impact of reducing the dimension k on performance is shown. Performance improves until k = 10, but further reduction leads to a sudden drop, indicating information loss. The Ant's 111-D state and 3-D goal are condensed to a 10-D representation for action generation by the IDM."
