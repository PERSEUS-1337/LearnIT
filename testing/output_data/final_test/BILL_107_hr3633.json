    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Oklahoma City Victims Compensation Act\". The Congress found that on April 19, 1995, Public Law 100-440 established a minimum staffing level of 1,000 Federal Police Officers for the Federal Protective Service, which was not met by over 60 percent. Additionally, on April 29, 1995, the Federal Protective Service only provided one non-law enforcement guard for multiple buildings in downtown Oklahoma City. On April 19, 1995, the Federal Protective Service and the General Services Administration in Oklahoma City failed to comply with Public Law 100-440, provide adequate protection to Federal properties, and were negligent in law enforcement personnel and security for the Murrah Federal Building. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, definitions include \"claimant\" as an individual filing for compensation, \"collateral source\" as various sources of compensation related to the bombings, and \"economic loss\" as pecuniary loss resulting from harm. The term \"eligible individuals\" refers to those eligible for compensation under section 5(c), while \"noneconomic losses\" encompass various nonpecuniary losses such as pain, suffering, and mental anguish. The term \"Special Master\" denotes the individual appointed under the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund of 2001. The Transportation Safety and System Stabilization Act (Public Law 107-42; 115 Stat. XX) was enacted. The purpose of this Act is to compensate individuals injured or killed in the Oklahoma City bombing. The Attorney General will administer the compensation program and allocate necessary funds for administrative costs. SEC. 6. DETERMINATION OF ELIGIBILITY FOR COMPENSATION. Claimants can file a compensation claim with the Special Master under this Act by using a form that states their eligibility and the amount sought. The form must include information about the physical harm suffered. The Special Master will develop a claim form that can be filed electronically if feasible. The claimant must provide information on physical harm, economic and noneconomic losses, and collateral sources of compensation related to the bombing of the Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City on April 19, 1995. No claim can be filed without this information. The Special Master will review and determine the eligibility of a claimant, extent of harm, and compensation amount based on the harm and facts of the claim. No claim can be filed after 2 years from the promulgation of regulations under section 8. The Special Master reviews and determines claimant eligibility, harm extent, and compensation based on claim facts. Negligence is not considered, and a final determination is made within 120 days. Claimants have rights to representation and evidence presentation. The Special Master determines claimant eligibility based on presence at the Murrah Federal Building or within a two block radius, and other specified requirements. Claimants have rights to present evidence and other due process rights as determined by the Special Master. The Special Master determines claimant eligibility based on proximity to the Murrah Federal Building during or after the bombing in Oklahoma City on April 19, 1995, resulting in physical harm or death. Only one claim per individual or deceased individual can be submitted under this Act. Upon submission of a claim under this Act for damages from the bombing of the Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City on April 19, 1995, the claimant waives the right to file a civil action in any Federal or State court, except for actions to recover collateral source obligations or punitive damages. Individuals described in clause (i) cannot submit a claim under this Act unless they withdraw from the action within 90 days of regulations being promulgated under section 7. SEC. 7. PAYMENTS TO ELIGIBLE INDIVIDUALS. The Special Master authorizes payment to claimants under this Act within 20 days of determining compensation. This Act provides budget authority for compensation payments. The Attorney General can accept contributions for funding, with payments made from a separate account. Funds in accounts provided under paragraph (1) must be used before appropriated amounts. The Attorney General, in consultation with the Special Master, must create regulations within 90 days of the Act's enactment. These regulations will cover forms for submitting claims, required information, hearing procedures, assistance for claim filing, and other relevant matters. Additionally, the United States retains the right of subrogation for any claims paid under this Act."
