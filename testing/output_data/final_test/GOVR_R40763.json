    "content": "The USDA administers various agricultural conservation programs to assist landowners with natural resource concerns. These programs have increased in number and funding over the past 60 years. Early efforts focused on reducing soil erosion and improving water quality for farm production. In 1985, the Food Security Act of 1985 established a new direction for conservation policy. The Food Security Act of 1985 (1985 farm bill, P.L. 99-198) established the first conservation programs to address environmental issues from agricultural activities. Subsequent farm bills in 1990, 1996, 2002, 2008, and 2014 reflected the evolution of conservation policy, with increased influence from environmentalists and nonagricultural interests. Funding for these programs shifted to mandatory spending through USDA's Commodity Credit Corporation. The conservation agenda expanded beyond soil erosion and water quality to address other natural resource concerns. The conservation agenda has expanded to address various natural resource concerns, including wildlife habitat, air quality, wetlands restoration, energy efficiency, and sustainable agriculture. Key agencies involved in agricultural conservation programs include the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) and the Farm Service Agency (FSA), supported by other USDA agencies like the Agricultural Research Service (ARS) and the Forest Service (FS). Additionally, agricultural conservation programs involve partnerships with federal agencies, state and local governments, and private organizations for funding and expertise. The USDA provides technical and financial assistance for voluntary conservation programs to protect soil, water, wildlife, and natural resources on privately owned agricultural lands. These programs aim to limit environmental impacts while maintaining food and fiber production. Agricultural conservation programs can be grouped into categories such as working land programs and land retirement and easement programs. The USDA offers various conservation programs categorized into working land programs, land retirement and easement programs, watershed programs, emergency programs, compliance, technical assistance, and other programs. Funding for most conservation programs comes from the USDA's Commodity Credit Corporation as mandatory spending, authorized by Congress through omnibus legislation like the farm bill. While mandatory programs receive steady funding authority, some programs have faced reductions or caps through annual appropriations since FY2003. Since FY2003, conservation program funding has been reduced or capped annually, with some reductions at the Administration's request. The mix and extent of reductions vary each year, with programs like CRP unaffected while EQIP repeatedly reduced. Over the past decade, over $4 billion in authorized mandatory funding for conservation programs has been cut. FY2018 saw the first appropriations act in 15 years that did not reduce mandatory conservation program funding. Sequestration, an automatic reduction process, has also impacted conservation programs, with discretionary accounts avoiding sequestration through spending adjustments in recent years. Discretionary accounts have avoided sequestration in recent years through spending adjustments, while mandatory conservation programs have been subject to sequestration. Despite sequestration and appropriations act reductions, total annual mandatory funding for conservation programs has increased from $3.9 billion in FY2008 to over $5 billion in FY2018. The number of conservation programs has grown significantly, leading to confusion about their purpose and policies. Discussions have been held about simplifying or consolidating these programs to reduce overlap and duplication. The Agricultural Act of 2014 included program consolidation measures, repealing 12 programs and creating two new ones. Several conservation programs have been repealed or unfunded in recent years. Discussions have been held about simplifying or consolidating conservation programs to reduce overlap and duplication. The 2014 farm bill, known as the Agricultural Act of 2014, covers national scope, participation levels, funding levels, and program authority.
