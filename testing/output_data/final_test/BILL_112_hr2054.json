    "content": "The \"Energy and Revenue Enrichment Act of 2011\" may be cited as the short title for this legislation. It includes definitions for various terms used in the Act. The \"Energy and Revenue Enrichment Act of 2011\" defines key terms such as Department, enrichment plant, qualified operator, and reenrichment. The Department refers to the Department of Energy, an enrichment plant is a uranium facility owned by the Department of Energy, a qualified operator is a company experienced in operating such plants, and reenrichment involves increasing the U-235 content in uranium for usability. The term \"Secretary\" in the Energy and Revenue Enrichment Act of 2011 refers to the Secretary of Energy, who is responsible for making uranium usable. SEC. 3. REENRICHMENT CONTRACT. The Secretary will contract a qualified operator for a 24-month pilot program to reenrich depleted uranium at an enrichment plant, aiming to maximize financial return to the government. The program will involve uranium reenrichment equal to 25% of the total enrichment in the US in 2010, ensuring economic viability. The Secretary will commence reenrichment activities by June 1, 2012, and may sell the reenriched uranium generated. Proceeds from sales will be allocated as specified. The funds from the contract will be allocated to the Secretary for carrying out the section's activities. Any remaining amounts will be transferred to the Uranium Enrichment Decontamination and Decommissioning Fund for future use. The Secretary assumes responsibility for disposing of all depleted uranium generated under the contract. Funding for reenrichment may involve assuming title to additional depleted uranium and transferring title to uranium resulting from reenrichment. Additionally, there is a limitation on federal uranium sales. LIMITATION ON FEDERAL URANIUM SALES: The Secretary is restricted from selling more than 15% of the US domestic uranium supply during a 24-month pilot program and the subsequent 24 months. After this period, sales cannot exceed 10% unless determined to have no significant market impact."
