    "content": "The Dodd-Frank Act established the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) to address financial market instability. The FSOC includes heads of regulatory agencies and is supported by the Office of Financial Research (OFR) within the Department of the Treasury. OFR collects data on the financial system to identify sources of instability. The Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) was created to address regulatory weaknesses that contributed to the 2008 financial crisis. It provides a forum for financial regulators to evaluate and address risks to the financial system as a whole, including coordination among regulators and supervision of large financial institutions. The Secretary of the Treasury must testify to Congress at least once a year when the annual report is released. The FSOC evaluates and addresses risks to the financial system, designates certain non-banks as systemic, and supervises firms with over $50 billion in assets. It also oversees the creation of resolution plans and coordinates communication among financial regulators. The FSOC has a permanent staff for data collection and evaluation, prudential regulation of certain non-banks, safety and soundness regulation of financial market utilities, and resolution of non-banks in danger of failing. The FSOC may resolve non-banks in danger of failing instead of bankruptcy. Evaluation of consumer financial protection rules may be set aside if they pose systemic risk. The FSOC distinguishes between depository banks and non-bank financial firms, aiming to regulate non-banks similarly to depository banks. Depository banks have prudential regulators monitoring their assets and liabilities. Non-bank financial institutions, like investment banks and insurance companies, do not have a bank charter or rely on deposits for funding. Prudential regulators oversee banks through the FFIEC, while failing depository banks are resolved by the FDIC. Non-banks may have access to liquidity facilities, such as the Federal Reserve discount window. Non-bank financial institutions like AIG and government-sponsored enterprises had their own regulatory regimes. Bankruptcy courts handled failures among most non-banks, while some accepted prudential regulation by the SEC. The Office of Thrift Supervision regulated non-bank thrifts, and the Federal Reserve provided backup liquidity to sound depository institutions. In the crisis, the Fed had to provide liquidity to non-bank financial institutions to support financial markets. Dissatisfaction with existing regulation grew during the mortgage crisis, especially after government support for failing non-banks. During the financial crisis, the Fed provided support to prevent creditors of failing non-banks from facing uncertainty in bankruptcy courts. This included financial assistance for the purchase of Bear Stearns by JPMorgan in 2008 and the placement of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in conservatorship with explicit financial support from Treasury. Lehman Brothers subsequently declared bankruptcy. Lehman Brothers failed and declared bankruptcy when no buyer was found, leading to financial panic spreading to other institutions. AIG was saved from failure by Fed intervention. Congress provided $700 billion to address troubled assets in the financial system, but the broader economy suffered severe damage despite efforts to restore confidence in financial institutions. The DFA was passed by Congress to reform the financial regulatory system after severe damage to the economy. It designates the Fed as the prudential regulator for systemically important non-banks and authorizes the FDIC to resolve them under certain circumstances. The goal is to dispel investor expectations that some firms are \"too big to fail.\" The Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) was established by the Dodd-Frank Act to identify risks to the financial system, promote market discipline, and respond to emerging threats. The FSOC's mission and members are detailed in this report, along with its recommendations during the 113th Congress. The Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) was created by the Dodd-Frank Act to address risks in the financial system and prevent firms from being too big or connected to fail. The Act aims to promote financial stability and mitigate systemic risk, without providing specific definitions for these terms. The FSOC's first annual report highlighted the importance of stable financial systems that do not create or amplify shocks. The FSOC's annual report emphasizes the importance of a stable financial system that does not create or amplify shocks. It identifies three main risks that could transmit shocks: failure to honor obligations, market deterioration, and financial infrastructure disruptions. The FSOC's mission is to prevent activities, practices, and regulations that could spread or magnify shocks in the financial system. There is no universally accepted definition of systemic risk among financial professionals, but all definitions aim to capture risks to the stability of the financial system as a whole. Systemic risks aim to capture risks to the stability of the financial system as a whole, including externalities and the fallacy of composition. Federal Reserve Governor Daniel Tarullo identified four common ways failing firms can damage financial stability. Tarullo identified four common ways failing firms can damage financial stability: domino effects, fire sales, contagion, and the failure of critical functions. Domino effects occur when the failure of one firm causes a chain reaction of failures among its creditors. Fire sales can become self-reinforcing if collateral is seized and sold at distressed prices. Contagion occurs when the failure of one firm signals trouble for others in the same industry. The failure of critical functions can lead to systemic risk. Systemic risk arises when critical functions fail, leading to potential domino effects and fire sales. Interconnectedness between firms can exacerbate this risk, especially for large firms that may receive preferential treatment from creditors due to their perceived government backing. Systemic risk regulators may construct a firm-specific index of systemic risk based on funding advantages for big firms over smaller competitors. Contagion, identified as an independent source of systemic risk, can signal danger for large firms even from the failure of a small firm. This contagion is based on the information a firm's failure provides to investors, rather than specific transactions or interconnections. In 2008, the failure of Lehman Brothers signaled to investors that money market mutual funds exposed to mortgage-related assets could be in financial trouble. The Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) has 10 voting members, chaired by the Secretary of the Treasury, and includes prudential bank regulators, securities market regulators, and an independent insurance expert. The Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) has 10 voting members, chaired by the Secretary of the Treasury, and includes representatives from various regulatory agencies and an independent insurance expert. The DFA grants specific authority to the Secretary of the Treasury, the Fed, and the FDIC to act without further approval from the FSOC in certain circumstances. These agencies often rely on shared FSOC resources and coordinate actions with the firm's primary regulator. The Treasury Secretary chairs the FSOC, the Fed regulates firms designated systemic, and the FDIC resolves non-banks in financial instability. The Secretary has unique powers related to FSOC meetings, reports, rulemakings, and recommendations. Meetings can be called by the Secretary or a majority of members. The Treasury Secretary chairs the FSOC and has special powers regarding the designation of systemic non-bank firms. A two-thirds vote of the FSOC is required to designate a non-bank as posing systemic risk, with the Secretary of the Treasury having an effective veto over the designation. The Treasury Secretary chairs the FSOC and has special powers regarding the designation of systemic non-bank firms. The chair's vote is required to rescind or reevaluate the systemic designation of a firm, and in emergencies, the chair's affirmative vote is needed to determine that a non-bank will not be granted a usual hearing before its systemic designation. Large recipients of TARP funds who cease to be bank holding companies are automatically considered systemically significant firms and placed under Fed supervision. The Secretary is responsible for conducting periodic studies on the economic impact of systemic risk regulations. The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the OFR, conducts studies on the economic impact of systemic risk regulations every five years. They also play a role in coordinating prudential supervision and regulation for highly leveraged financial companies, recommending receivership procedures for failing systemic firms, and appointing the FDIC as receiver when necessary. The determination for appointing the FDIC as receiver requires a two-thirds vote of both the Fed and the FDIC board. The process differs for broker-dealers, insurance companies, and other firms. The Secretary petitions the courts if the firm objects to the determination. The Secretary's determination triggers the resolution regime under the FDIC, addressing the firm's default likelihood, financial stability impact, and private sector viability. The Secretary has duties related to the determination and procedures for the FDIC to act as receiver, including notifying Congress and ensuring compliance with regulations. The FDIC must provide annual accounting reports to the Secretary and comptroller general for receiverships. The Secretary's approval is needed for additional payments in certain situations. The Secretary plays a role in approving orderly liquidation plans and amendments to them. The FDIC must assure the Secretary of a repayment plan for orderly liquidation, with both reporting to Congress on the terms. No firms have undergone orderly liquidation to date. The Federal Reserve, established in 1913, has the authority to address financial market instability as a lender of last resort. Despite a focus on macroeconomic variables, addressing financial market instability has always been a core mission. Under the FSOC, the Fed will have additional supervision and examination authority for designated non-banks. The Dodd-Frank Act directs the Fed to supervise certain large non-bank financial companies. The Dodd-Frank Act directs the Fed to supervise certain large non-bank financial companies, with regulatory standards for non-bank firms under Fed supervision being more stringent. These standards include risk-based capital requirements, leverage limits, liquidity requirements, resolution plans, concentration limits, contingent capital requirements, enhanced public disclosures, short-term debt limits, and overall risk management requirements. Standards for foreign firms must acknowledge competitive equality and consider comparable standards in their home country. The Fed has powers over covered bank holding companies and non-banks, including limiting mergers, restricting products, imposing conditions on activities, and requiring asset sales. It can collect information through examinations and establish standards for systemic firms under the Dodd-Frank Act. The Dodd-Frank Act grants the Fed authority over systemic firms, including setting standards such as contingent capital requirements, enhanced disclosures, and short-term debt limits. The FDIC can resolve failing non-bank financial companies administratively, with the approval of the Fed, and may recommend a determination of systemic risk. The FDIC has powers and duties to resolve systemic firms under the Dodd-Frank Act. It can take over failing firms' assets, rights, and functions, including subsidiaries posing systemic risk. The FDIC's actions must address systemic risk, not preserve the non-bank. The FDIC has powers over subsidiaries posing systemic risk and can form bridge companies for orderly liquidation. It pays valid obligations based on systemic risk determinations and ensures shareholders and creditors bear losses. The FDIC reports to the FSOC and Congress after resolution, providing details of the receivership. The FSOC's annual report to Congress includes an analysis of perceived threats to the financial system, such as the use of wholesale funding sources by banks and financial institutions. Wholesale funding sources, like money market mutual funds and repurchase agreements, are not eligible for certain government initiatives that assist financial institutions. Wholesale funding sources, like money market mutual funds and repurchase agreements, may not have access to certain government initiatives that assist financial stability, such as deposit insurance. Non-banks using wholesale funding for capital market activity could face runs similar to depository banks but may not have access to emergency lending facilities like the Fed's discount window. During times of uncertainty, financial intermediaries may lose trust in each other, leading to a reduction in wholesale funding resembling a bank run. Wholesale funding can resemble a bank run if providers fear borrowers won't repay, without government guarantees. Fire sales occur when assets are sold in distressed markets, affecting collateralized lending like repos and asset-backed commercial paper. Defaulting borrowers and distressed collateral markets can lead to downward spirals in prices. The 2013 annual report by FSOC highlights positive and negative developments in wholesale funding. While there have been reductions in intra-day credit exposure and reliance on overnight repos, the risk of runs on broker-dealers and fire sales remains. Efforts to address instability in money market mutual funds are still pending. Reliance on government-assisted funding increased significantly in 2008. In 2008, government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) became the dominant providers of wholesale mortgage funding as private mortgage securitization decreased significantly. The lack of private capital in mortgage funding indicates ongoing financial instability in the mortgage markets. The FSOC aims to restore private capital as the main source of long-term mortgage funding, improve consumer protection, and enhance financial stability. Signs of improvement in mortgage markets include rising house prices, stabilized default rates, and positive GSE flow business. Regulatory uncertainty and economic recovery pessimism may delay the return of private capital. The 2013 annual report by FSOC notes improvements in the mortgage market but highlights the need for further progress. Modifications to conservatorship agreements aim to expedite the wind-down of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac portfolios. Regulatory uncertainty may decrease with final rules for RESPA, TILA, and the ability-to-pay standard. GSE guarantee fees may need adjustment to allow for private competitors. Financial infrastructure, crucial for systemic risk, includes the environment for financial trading and interbank communications. The financial infrastructure encompasses the environment for financial trading, interbank communications, clearing and settlement of payments, security of financial information, and information storage systems. It evolves with technology but is vulnerable to disruptions from natural disasters and human activity, as seen with Hurricane Sandy and malfunctions affecting securities issuance. Major financial institutions have faced cyberattacks and attempts to access confidential information, such as during the initial public offering of Facebook. The 2013 annual report by FSOC highlighted initiatives to address operational issues, including recommendations for improving settlement and clearing processes in the wholesale funding sector. The SEC proposed Regulation Systems Compliance and Integrity (Regulation SCI) to prevent malfunctions in capital markets. Future interest rate changes could pose a risk to financial stability due to factors like a global savings glut and central bank policies. Rising interest rates, driven by factors like a global savings glut and central bank policies, could pose a risk to financial stability. Financial intermediaries, including banks, may be damaged if they do not address the mismatch between their cost of funds and revenues from lending. The accuracy of key reference rates, such as LIBOR, used in benchmarking interest rates in contracts has been called into question. Previous instances of rising interest rates have caused stress in the financial system. The impact of rising interest rates on financial stability has been seen in various instances, such as stress on banks in the past. Low interest rates currently pose challenges for savers, making it difficult to earn significant returns safely. The under-reporting of LIBOR rates in 2008 may have misled regulators about the lending capacity of major financial institutions during a liquidity crunch. Investors face greater risk due to low income streams from safe bonds, increasing the likelihood of \"breaking the buck\" if investments incur losses. Pension systems with defined benefits may struggle to earn adequate returns safely. Some investors may be tempted to invest in riskier assets, leading to potential asset bubbles. The FSOC attributes low interest rates to global central banks' policies and the pricing of short-term risk. The FSOC identifies factors contributing to increased risks in the bond market, including low-risk sensitivity of institutional buyers and willingness to accept credit risk. Measures to mitigate risks include investigations into interest rate benchmark manipulation and concerns about high yield bond issuance and loosened underwriting standards for CLOs. The FSOC notes that risks in the bond market have increased due to low-risk sensitivity of institutional buyers and relaxed underwriting standards for CLOs. Fiscal policy refers to government revenues and spending, with short-term fluctuations during recessions and booms, while long-term fiscal policy focuses on the balance between expected government spending and revenues over an extended period. The CBO and other projections show a long-term fiscal imbalance in government spending and revenues. Despite this, the United States has not faced backlash in bond markets. Fiscal imbalances can lead to short-term and long-term problems, but the Fed could cushion short-term issues by purchasing Treasury securities. States could be cushioned by Fed purchases of Treasury securities in the event of a short-run fiscal crisis. Higher interest rates and debt could lead to interest payments crowding out other government programs. The FSOC does not view gradual normalization of Treasury yields as a significant threat, but long-term imbalances could pose a risk if there is a sudden spike in yields. Short-run fiscal events have had minimal financial impact so far. U.S. debt is still considered a safe investment. Financial instability overseas can threaten financial stability in the United States through various channels such as global bank failures, competitive currency devaluations, capital flights, and sovereign debt issues. Despite short-run fiscal events having minimal impact, U.S. debt remains a safe investment. Recent events in Europe have raised doubts about the perception of sovereign debt as a risk-free asset, particularly for countries like Greece, Cyprus, Italy, Portugal, and Ireland. Financial institutions and regulators often treat these debts as risk-free, leading to potential threats to financial stability. This can result in institutions not retaining capital buffers against the possibility of sovereign debt restructuring or default, causing people to avoid institutions and markets with large exposure to these countries. Financial instability from sovereign debt crises can lead to credit drying up, interest rates rising, and magnify financial difficulties for the affected country. There is no formal way to address a sovereign default, leading to evolving government funding and banking crises in Europe. Central banks may target these issues, but coordination among regulators and officials is crucial to prevent further spread of financial instability. The 2013 FSOC report highlighted positive developments in Europe, such as the potential for the ECB to purchase sovereign debt. However, banking disruptions in Cyprus created downside risks for financial stability. Coordination among countries is crucial to prevent competitive devaluation due to expansionary monetary policies. The FSOC report highlighted risks to financial stability, including banking disruptions in Cyprus and the impact of austerity programs in Europe. Expansionary monetary policies in Japan were also discussed, with a focus on escaping deflation and achieving robust growth.

The federal safety net is a broad term referring to financial protections. Financial holding companies, authorized by the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, can control banks, securities firms, and insurance companies. They go beyond the limits of a bank holding company. Commercial and industrial companies lack the federal safety net protections that banking institutions have. The Federal Open Market Committee oversees market conditions and implements monetary policy by setting interest rates. Financial institutions primarily invest in financial assets like loans and debt securities. They can be depository or non-depository, with depository institutions accepting federally insured deposits. Under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, banks can form financial subsidiaries for certain activities. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act allows banks to form financial subsidiaries for certain activities, with a mechanism in place to decide on new financial activities. The Financial Stability Oversight Council, created by the Dodd-Frank Act, monitors systemic risks and implements firewalls to prevent the spread of losses among business units. Foreign banks and their holding companies headquartered in other countries may have various financial operations in the United States, regulated primarily by the Federal Reserve under the International Banking Act of 1978. Functional regulation based on activity rather than organizational structure was emphasized by the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. Government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) are private companies with government charters, providing them with a funding advantage over purely private competitors. Government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) have a funding advantage over private competitors due to their charters, which restrict their business activities. Hedge funds are unregulated mutual funds limited to qualified investors, investing in various assets to reduce adverse movements in interest rates, commodities, or securities prices.
