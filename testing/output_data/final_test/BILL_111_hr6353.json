Definitions in this section include the meaning of \"Administrator\" as the head of the EPA, \"affordability\" as the ability to pay utility bills without hardship, \"financial capability\" as a community's ability to invest in water quality improvements, and \"guidance\" as advisory information. The Administrator will update the guidance on financial capability assessment and schedule development within one year of the Act's enactment to ensure evaluations meet specified criteria. The guidance on financial capability assessment will be updated to focus on local economic conditions, regional systems, site-specific factors, and not rely solely on prescriptive formulas. The financial capability assessment should consider various economic measures and community investments related to water quality improvements. Timing of implementation should take into account the economic outlook of the community and potential impacts of program requirements over time. The timing of water quality-related improvements should consider the financial impact on distressed populations and reflect local economic conditions. Implementation methodologies should assess local financial capability through various factors that may vary across regions. The residential indicator should be revised to consider costs imposed on ratepayers for essential utilities, quantify local community-imposed costs in regional systems, and assess impacts on communities with different economic conditions. The consideration of industrial and population trends, median household income, and affordability methods like shelter costs and utility payments are important factors in assessing impacts on communities with varying economic conditions. The updated guidance should consider State and local tax efforts, low-income ratepayer percentages, and impacts on program delivery. It should also address modifications to long-term control plans or agreements based on economic or financial changes in the community. Upon completion of updating guidance under subsection (b), the Administrator will publish in the Federal Register and submit to relevant committees the updated guidance on reconsideration and modification of financial capability determinations and implementation schedules based on specified criteria."
