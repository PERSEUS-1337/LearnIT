HHS is organized into 11 main agencies responsible for administering various programs and conducting research. The operating divisions, including those in the U.S. Public Health Service, have diverse missions in support of public health. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is organized into 11 main agencies responsible for administering various programs and conducting research. The operating divisions, including those in the U.S. Public Health Service, have diverse missions in support of public health, such as providing health care services, advancing health care quality and medical research, preventing disease and controlling environmental health hazards, and regulating food and drugs. The remaining HHS operating divisions focus on administering human services programs for vulnerable populations and managing health insurance programs like Medicare and Medicaid. The FY2020 budget request was delayed due to negotiations over FY2019 appropriations, leading to a partial government shutdown. HHS divisions like FDA, IHS, and ATSDR were affected, but eventually received full-year funding almost five months after the fiscal year began. The FY2020 budget request was delayed, leading to a partial government shutdown. HHS would spend an estimated $1.286 trillion in outlays in FY2020, $56 billion more than FY2019. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) estimates that HHS accounted for 27% of federal outlays in FY2018. Mandatory spending, mainly from Medicare and Medicaid, makes up 86% of HHS budget in FY2020. Discretionary spending only accounts for about 8% of estimated HHS outlays. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) receives a significant amount of discretionary funding, accounting for 7% of all discretionary budget authority in FY2018. The HHS budget includes mandatory spending, mainly from Medicare and Medicaid, making up 86% of the budget in FY2020. This results in discrepancies between the budget amounts provided to HHS through appropriations and the total budgetary resources. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) budget includes mandatory spending from Medicare and Medicaid, controlled by authorizing laws. Discretionary funding is provided through annual appropriations, while some mandatory programs require appropriations despite being controlled by authorizing statutes. The HHS budget request considers the department as a whole, with funding divided across three appropriations bills. The Department of Health and Human Services receives discretionary funding through different appropriations bills, including the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, the Departments of the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies, and the Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration. The Administration may have different estimates for HHS programs compared to congressional scorekeepers. The HHS budget materials include two estimates for mandatory spending programs in FY2019: proposed law and current law. Proposed law estimates consider changes in mandatory spending proposed in the FY2020 HHS budget request, while current law estimates assume no policy changes. The budget estimates in this report reflect the proposed law estimates, but other estimates from HHS, OMB, or Congress may differ. The HHS budget includes estimates for mandatory spending programs in FY2019, with proposed law and current law estimates. Agencies may supplement appropriations with user fees and transfers from other sources. Budgetary totals at the program level account for these resources. FDA and AHRQ historically show notable differences between appropriations and program level amounts. The HHS FY2020 Budget in Brief outlines the breakdown of the budget request by operating division. CMS accounts for the largest share of the request, with the majority going towards mandatory spending programs like Medicare and Medicaid. Discretionary funding for CMS is comparatively smaller, with the largest share going to PHS agencies. NIH would receive the largest amount of funding. The FY2020 budget request for HHS outlines funding allocations for various operating divisions. NIH would receive the largest amount of discretionary budget authority ($33.5 billion), followed by ACF ($18.3 billion). Table 3 provides context by comparing funding estimates from FY2017-FY2019. Budget authority (BA) allows for financial obligations, while outlays represent actual expenditures from the Treasury. The FY2020 budget request for HHS outlines funding allocations for various operating divisions, with NIH receiving the largest amount of discretionary budget authority. Table 3 compares funding estimates from FY2017-FY2019, showing the difference between budget authority (BA) and outlays. The appendix provides a summary of each division's mission, appropriations bill, budget request level, and related resources. For example, the FDA focuses on regulating the safety of human and animal foods, dietary supplements, and cosmetics. The FDA regulates the safety of human and animal foods, dietary supplements, cosmetics, and medical products. The FY2020 budget request for the FDA is $3.329 billion with outlays of $2.837 billion. The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) focuses on improving healthcare for vulnerable populations. HRSA supports health care workforce training, the National Health Service Corps, and federal health centers program with a budget request of $11.004 billion for FY2020. The Indian Health Service aims to provide comprehensive health services for American Indians and Alaska Natives. The Indian Health Service (IHS) provides health care for approximately 2.2 million eligible American Indians and Alaska Natives through programs and facilities on or near reservations. The FY2020 budget request for IHS is $6.104 billion, with outlays of $5.970 billion. Additional resources related to the request can be found in the Congressional Justification and the Budget in Brief. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) focus on disease prevention, environmental health, and health promotion. The CDC and ATSDR focus on disease prevention, environmental health, and health promotion. CDC is organized into centers and offices, with a budget request of $6.767 billion for FY2020. ATSDR's work is to prevent adverse effects from exposure to hazardous substances. The FY2020 budget request for CDC is $7.877 billion. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) focuses on research in human diseases and health information exchange. The assumption is that AHRQ's functions will be consolidated within NIH. The National Institute for Research on Safety and Quality (NIRSQ) and Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) are key agencies with relevant appropriations in the LHHS FY2020 Request. NIRSQ has a budget of $33.669 billion, while SAMHSA has a budget of $5.535 billion. SAMHSA's mission is to reduce the impact of substance abuse and mental illness on communities. The FY2020 President's budget proposes eliminating the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) and consolidating certain key functions within the National Institute for Research on Safety and Quality (NIRSQ). AHRQ's mission is focused on research to improve healthcare quality and affordability. The FY2020 President's budget proposes consolidating AHRQ functions into NIRSQ. The CMS mission focuses on improving quality and accessibility of healthcare programs. Over 145 million Americans rely on CMS-administered programs. CMS administers Medicare, Medicaid, CHIP, and the Exchanges with a budget request of $1,169.091 billion for FY2020. ACF focuses on promoting the well-being of children, youth, families, and communities, administering programs like TANF, Head Start, and child welfare with a budget request of $52.121 billion for FY2020. The Administration for Community Living (ACL) focuses on maximizing independence, well-being, and health for older adults and people with disabilities. They administer programs such as Home and Community-Based Supportive Services and State Councils on Developmental Disabilities with a budget request of $1.997 billion for FY2020. Additional resources can be found in the Congressional Justification and Budget in Brief documents. The Administration for Community Living (ACL) has a budget request of $1.997 billion for FY2020, with outlays of $2.238 billion.
