    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Oral Health Promotion Act of 2002\". The findings are also included in the Act. Congress finds that oral and general health are inseparable, with good dental care being critical to overall physical health. Despite improvements in oral health, dental caries are the most common chronic childhood disease. Low-income, minority children face disparities in oral health and access to dental care, with many Medicaid-covered children not receiving a single dental visit. Poor and minority children face disparities in oral health, with 25 percent never visiting a dentist before kindergarten. They are more likely to have dental caries, causing pain and difficulty in daily activities. This leads to missed school days, with children missing 52 million hours annually due to dental issues. Low-income adults also suffer from untreated dental disease, losing 164 million work hours each year. SEC. 3 amends the Social Security Act to require dental benefits under SCHIP, effective January 1, 2003. SEC. 4 allows dental coverage under SCHIP as a supplement to other health coverage. The amendment to the Social Security Act requires dental benefits under SCHIP, effective January 1, 2003, as a supplement to other health coverage for targeted low-income children. The amendment to the Social Security Act requires dental benefits under SCHIP for targeted low-income children, regardless of existing health coverage. Conditions for provision of dental services are based on income eligibility. The amendment to the Social Security Act requires dental benefits under SCHIP for targeted low-income children, regardless of existing health coverage. States must ensure that their plan has the highest income eligibility standard, does not limit applications for children, and provides benefits to all eligible children without imposing waiting lists for those at or below 200 percent of the poverty line. The amendment authorizes additional funds for child health assistance and allows states to waive waiting periods for eligibility under the State plan. The amendment allows states to waive waiting periods for child health assistance, including coverage of dental services, and also extends this option to adults receiving assistance under title XXI of the Social Security Act. The amendments expand child health assistance to include dental services for children under certain conditions. The amendments made by subsection (a) apply to child health assistance and medical assistance provided on or after the date of enactment of this Act. SEC. 5 enhances Medicaid matching rates for full adult dental benefits, including orthodontia and dentures. The amendments apply to services provided after the enactment date. SEC. 6 establishes a fund for oral health services at community-based health centers. The Community Oral Health Expansion Fund is established in the Treasury of the United States with an annual appropriation of $140,000,000. The Fund is used by the Secretary of Health and Human Services to provide grants to states for expanding oral health services through Federally-qualified health centers. The Community Oral Health Expansion Fund provides grants for oral health services through nonprofit providers. Grants can be used for staff recruitment, equipment purchase, and facility construction. Additionally, grants can be used for demonstration projects and partnerships with Head Start programs to identify at-risk children for dental care. The program aims to identify at-risk children for dental disease prevention. States must provide matching funds of at least 10% for the program costs. Contributions can be in cash or in-kind. The Federal Government does not consider services assisted or subsidized by them when determining non-Federal contributions. States prioritizing dental benefits in their child health insurance plans may receive grants under SCHIP. States with market-based payment rates for dental services under Medicaid and SCHIP are preferred for grants. States prioritizing dental benefits in their child health insurance plans may receive grants under SCHIP, with preference given to those providing reimbursement for dental services at market-based rates under their State medicaid plan. The term \"State\" is defined as per title XIX of the Social Security Act."
