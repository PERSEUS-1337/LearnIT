    "content": "The explosion of consumer demand for geospatial information and tools like GIS has made GIS a part of daily life for many Americans through applications like Google Earth and navigation systems. The release of Google Earth in 2005 revolutionized the understanding of geospatial information with its free and easy-to-use multi-scale visualization. Geospatial data is rapidly expanding, with new methods for acquisition and usage. The federal government plays a significant role in managing and sharing geospatial data among federal agencies and with state and local entities. The 112th Congress may have an interest in overseeing programs and geospatial assets across the federal government. The CRS reports explore geospatial policy issues for Congress, including organization, data sharing, and national GIS proposals. They discuss federal responsibility for managing land parcel data and introduce basic concepts and complex policy issues in the federal geospatial enterprise. The discussion does not cover classified geospatial information or national security issues. A Geographic Information System (GIS) is a data system that captures, stores, analyzes, and displays geospatial information attached to a location. This information includes features like highway intersections, rivers, and congressional district boundaries. GIS allows for the combination of geospatial information in unique ways to extract new insights. A GIS analysis involves locating highway intersections, analyzing vehicle flow, river locations, water depth, and effects of development on runoff. Geospatial data is collected by various entities and is considered a costly component of GIS. Geospatial data acquisition in GIS involves various technologies such as GPS, aerial photography, and satellite remote sensing. Data can be collected by land surveyors, census takers, police, and citizens with GPS-enabled devices. The collected data, including land-use information and demographics, can be manually entered or digitized from maps. Remote sensing data from satellites is digitally acquired and processed in GIS for analysis, such as producing land cover maps. When geospatial data is combined in GIS, it needs to be transformed to fit the same coordinates for analysis. Local and state governments provide geospatial data for public services like land records and zoning. Private-sector companies are often contracted for more recent and detailed data. Issues arise regarding the availability of this up-to-date information to users beyond the acquiring government. Issues with data sharing between local and federal governments can hinder effective emergency response, such as in the aftermath of natural disasters. The federal government acquires geospatial data for various needs, like updating floodplain maps, which is required by law. FEMA has spent over $1.4 billion since FY2003 on this effort. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has invested $1.4 billion since FY2003 to convert paper flood insurance rate maps to digital formats, aiming for improved accuracy using new data collection techniques like LIDAR. Private sector companies and organizations, such as MAPPS and COGO, play a significant role in providing geospatial data. The Coalition of Geospatial Organizations (COGO) consists of 11 organizations involved in geospatial data and policy issues. Geospatial data attributes can be represented as layers in GIS, allowing for integration of information from different layers over the same geographic coordinates. GIS enables combining data like land zoning, wetlands, precipitation, and streams to calculate runoff. The power of GIS analysis allows for interpreting information that would be difficult to visualize and analyze. Timeliness is crucial in some geospatial uses, as seen during the 2008 southern California wildfires, where real-time decision making was essential due to the fire's rapid progress and the need to visualize escape routes. The Sylmar fire on November 15 showcased the power of geospatial information combined with GIS for real-time decision making and displaying fire progress on the Internet. Timeliness in posting this information was crucial for citizens to avoid the fire's path, highlighting the value of GIS for policy makers in unique analyses. GIS provides unique analyses of spatial information to assist policy makers in resolving complex problems, such as the Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) program. The City of Virginia Beach used GIS to respond to the 2005 BRAC Commission's recommendation to realign Naval Air Station Oceana due to land use encroachment concerns. The City of Virginia Beach used GIS to analyze noise zones and APZ around Naval Air Station Oceana to prevent encroachment and economic losses. GIS analysts overlaid various geospatial data to determine current land use and development, helping city leaders modify land use ordinances. The GIS analysts in Virginia Beach used geospatial data to analyze land use around Naval Air Station Oceana, identifying undeveloped, commercial, and residential areas. They also highlighted underdeveloped land with potential for incompatible development, leading to recommendations for changes in municipal land ordinances to prevent future issues. This analysis helped prevent the relocation of the air station and was featured in an online interactive map by the New York Times in 2009. The New York Times published an online interactive map in 2009 showing foreclosure rates in the New York City region by census tract. The map displayed foreclosure percentages, number of foreclosed residences, and non-white population percentages. It allowed comparisons of foreclosure rates from 2005 to 2008, with detailed geospatial information and demographic data for further analysis. The New York Times published an interactive map in 2009 displaying foreclosure rates in the NYC region by census tract, allowing comparisons from 2005 to 2008. This spatial analysis of foreclosure effects can inform policymakers about the extent of foreclosure patterns. Within 36 hours of the 2011 Japan earthquake, a GIS team started a project for GISCorps to gather geospatial information for humanitarian organizations. The GIS team quickly developed an interactive map with real-time geospatial data to aid humanitarian efforts in Japan after the earthquake and tsunami. They collaborated with Crisis Commons to provide critical information for aid missions. Japan assisted in gathering census records and maps for GIS layers through crowd-sourcing efforts. The information was vetted by experts and included in an interactive map. Crowd-sourcing, also known as participatory mapping, is gaining popularity for location information. The accuracy of volunteered information, like in Wikipedia, can sometimes be questionable. The interactive map displayed data layers of the tsunami-flooded area and Japan's nuclear power plant locations, including the damaged Fukushima I plant. The OMB Circular A-16, first issued in 1953, ensures federal surveying and mapping activities meet the needs of federal and state agencies. It was revised in 1967 to include coordination responsibilities among federal departments. In 1990, it expanded to include geospatial data activities and established the Federal Geographic Data Committee (FGDC) with 19 members. The U.S. Geological Survey provides administrative support through the FGDC Secretariat. The FGDC Secretariat provides administrative support for federal agencies responsible for geospatial data themes. The FGDC Steering Committee chartered a Coordination Group in 2009 to oversee strategies for the National Spatial Data Infrastructure (NSDI). The Coordination Group aims to enhance coordination within the federal government to meet Circular A-16 responsibilities. The Coordination Group oversees strategies for the National Spatial Data Infrastructure (NSDI) and is responsible for coordinating agencies' Circular A-16 responsibilities. OMB Circular A-16 calls for the development of the NSDI, which is a national digital spatial information resource for sharing and transferring spatial data. The Federal Geographic Data Committee (FGDC) leads and supports the National Spatial Data Infrastructure (NSDI) strategy, policy development, and decision making. It coordinates with state, local, tribal governments, academia, and the private sector to ensure availability and integration of spatial data from various sources. The NSDI consists of data themes, metadata, National Spatial Data Clearinghouse, standards, and partnerships. Data themes are electronic records and coordinates for a topic or subject, such as elevation or vegetation. Framework data includes geodetic control, orthoimagery, elevation, transportation, hydrography, cadastre, and governmental units. Metadata provides information about the data to ensure its credibility and authority. OMB Circular A-16 mandates FGDC metadata for spatial data collected with federal funds. The Clearinghouse offers access to spatial data and metadata. The Clearinghouse provides access to spatial data and metadata from various sources, following rules set by Circular A-16. It mandates the use of international standards for NSDI to enhance global data usage. FGDC is responsible for developing and promoting these standards, with a focus on cost-effective data collection partnerships. The National Map is a framework for geographic knowledge nationwide, managed as a National Geospatial Data Asset Portfolio. Partnerships with federal, state, tribal governments, and private-sector providers are promoted for cost-effective data collection and distribution. Geospatial data is considered a capital asset, with guidance issued by OMB in 2010. The National Map is a new online map service by the USGS that will replace paper topographic maps. It will include high-resolution imagery, elevation data, land cover data, and more. The goal is to provide nationwide coverage with updated map products like \"US Topo\" over the next three years. The National Map is a new online map service by the USGS that aims to provide nationwide coverage for transportation, hydrography, elevation, land cover, and cultural features. It will continuously update data and face challenges in integrating data from various sources. The Geospatial One-Stop portal is the official means of accessing metadata resources for the National Map and focuses on the discovery and access of geospatial information. The USGS Geospatial Liaison Network, along with FGDC and the National Map, focuses on policy, standards, advocacy, and integrated base mapping content. Geospatial One-Stop integrates with the Obama Administration's Open Government initiative through Data.gov. Liaisons represent NSDI partnership offices, coordinate NGP initiatives, and seek partnerships to support NSDI goals. The USGS Geospatial Liaison Network works with universities and consortia to support NSDI goals. Each liaison represents USGS, NSDI, and NGP at the state level, coordinating with state GIS coordinators or councils. They focus on geospatial data acquisition and maintenance, especially in states with large federal land holdings. Data.gov, launched in 2009 under the Obama Administration, aims to promote open government. Data.gov was launched in 2009 under the Obama Administration to improve access to federal data, with over 270,000 records in its first year, 90% of which were geospatial data. It is a growing location for access to geospatial elements managed under FGDC, despite not being exclusively under FGDC and NSDI. FEMA, FGDC, FIRMs, GAO, GIS, GPS, IFTN, LIDAR, MAPPS, NGAC, NGP, NILS, NRC, NSDI, NSGIC, OMB, USGS, USFS, VGI are key organizations and technologies in the geospatial data field."
