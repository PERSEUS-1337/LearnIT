The Congress finds that the overuse of antimicrobial drugs has led to the development of drug-resistant pathogens, fueled by overprescription and patients seeking antibiotics for viral infections. Failure to complete antibiotic courses also contributes to antibiotic resistance in bacteria, including those causing pneumonia and ear infections. Antibiotics are used to treat various infections caused by bacteria, fungi, and parasites. Many pathogens, including those causing tuberculosis, gonorrhea, yeast infections, and malaria, are becoming resistant to conventional treatments. A significant percentage of antibiotics produced in the United States are used in animals, with a large portion used nontherapeutically to promote growth. The overuse of antibiotics in farm animals, primarily for growth promotion rather than treating infections, is leading to the development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. This resistance can transfer from animals to humans, causing difficult-to-treat diseases and significantly increasing healthcare costs. The rise of antibiotic-resistant bacteria has led to an annual cost of nearly $1.3 billion. Various organizations recommend improving surveillance, prolonging drug effectiveness, developing new drugs, and implementing measures like vaccines and infection control to address this issue. The Department of Health and Human Services will receive funding for top priority action items under the public health action plan to combat antimicrobial resistance. The Department of Health and Human Services will receive funding for top priority action items designated in the Antimicrobial Resistance Action Plan for fiscal years 2002 through 2006. These action items are specified in categories such as Surveillance. In the category of \"Surveillance\", action items include designing and implementing a national AR surveillance plan with partners and monitoring patterns of antimicrobial drug use in various sectors. In the category \"Prevention and Control\", action items include conducting a public health education campaign on appropriate antimicrobial use, developing educational interventions for clinicians, and evaluating the effectiveness of infection control measures. Action Item #58 in the Plan involves refining and implementing the FDA framework for approving new antimicrobial drugs for use in food-animal production. Action Item #63 supports demonstration projects to evaluate strategies for promoting appropriate drug use and reducing infection rates. The Plan includes action items to provide genomics and technologies for rapid diagnostics and therapeutics development to prevent the spread of resistant pathogens. It also involves identifying strategies for promoting appropriate drug use and reducing infection rates. The Plan includes action items to develop new rapid diagnostic methods for human and veterinary use in collaboration with academia and the private sector. These methods should be accurate, affordable, and easily implemented in routine clinical settings. The Plan includes action items to encourage research for vaccines in human and veterinary medicine, as well as creating a working group to identify priority public health needs for new antimicrobial resistance products. The Antimicrobial Resistance Action Plan includes 13 top priority action items to promote the development and appropriate use of priority antimicrobial resistance products. These items aim to address market incentives inadequacies for novel compounds and approaches in human and veterinary medicine. The Antimicrobial Resistance Action Plan, titled \"A Public Health Action Plan to Combat Antimicrobial Resistance,\" was developed by an interagency Task Force on Antimicrobial Resistance in 1999. The Task Force is cochaired by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Food and Drug Administration, and the National Institutes of Health, and includes other agencies such as the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, the Health Resources and Services Administration, the Health Care Financing Administration, and the Environmental Protection Agency. The term \"AR\" in this Act refers to antimicrobial resistance and involves various government agencies such as the Department of Agriculture, Department of Defense, and Department of Veterans Affairs."
