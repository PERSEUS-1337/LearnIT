    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Asian Elephant Conservation Act of 1997\". The Congress finds that Asian elephant populations are declining, endangering the species in the wild. Despite being listed as endangered, resources for conservation efforts have been insufficient due to habitat loss. The Asian elephant is crucial for preserving tropical forest habitats. The Asian elephant faces threats such as habitat loss, human-elephant conflict, poaching, and capture for domestication. Addressing these threats requires the commitment of nations, the United States, other countries, and the private sector. The purposes of this Act are to perpetuate healthy populations of Asian elephants, support conservation programs in Asian elephant range states, and provide financial resources for those programs. The term \"CITES\" refers to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora. The term \"conservation\" includes various activities aimed at ensuring the survival of Asian elephants in the wild, such as habitat management, research, enforcement of CITES regulations, community involvement, conflict resolution, and education. The Asian Elephant Conservation Fund, established under section 6(a), is referred to as the \"Fund.\" The Secretary of the Interior is referred to as the \"Secretary,\" and the Administrator of the Agency for International Development is referred to as the \"Administrator.\" SEC. 5.

Within 6 months, the Secretary will consult with the Administrator, request comments from involved countries, and approve or disapprove the proposal, notifying the submitter and countries involved. The Secretary may approve a final project proposal under this section if it will enhance conservation programs for Asian elephants by addressing conflicts between humans and elephants, enhancing compliance with conservation laws, and developing scientific information on Asian elephant habitat and population trends. (e) Project Sustainability.--The Secretary will prioritize projects that enhance sustainable conservation programs for Asian elephants to ensure long-term effectiveness.\n(f) Project Reporting.--Recipients of assistance must provide periodic reports to the Secretary and Administrator to evaluate project progress and success.
