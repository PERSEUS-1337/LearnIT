    "content": "The \"Improving Cancer Treatment Education Act of 2013\" includes provisions for Medicare coverage of comprehensive cancer patient treatment education services and research on cancer symptom management improvement under the NIH. The Congress finds that cancer patients experience side effects and symptoms impacting their health and quality of life. Timely symptom management and education can help reduce these effects. Educational interventions by registered nurses have been effective in managing cancer pain for patients in outpatient and home-based settings. After attending a family caregiver cancer education program, caregivers reported feeling well-informed and confident. Patients benefit from educational sessions with oncology nurses before treatment to manage side effects and improve well-being. The Oncology Nursing Society notes that patients and caregivers often lack adequate education before starting treatment due to limited coverage for patient education programs. The Oncology Nursing Society recommends one-on-one educational sessions with nurses before cancer treatment to inform patients about possible side effects and symptoms. Insufficient Medicare payments and lack of investment in symptom management research contribute to inadequate patient education and poor symptom management. Patients with cancer often do not experience symptoms related to their disease and treatment adequately managed. They deserve comprehensive care with appropriate treatment and symptom management. Those receiving infused chemotherapy may receive treatment education, but others undergoing different types of cancer care may not. Comprehensive cancer care should include services for nausea and vomiting. The Institute of Medicine reports emphasize the importance of managing symptoms like nausea, vomiting, fatigue, depression, and pain in cancer patients to improve their quality of life. They also highlight the need for addressing psychosocial needs, including providing information about therapies and potential side effects. Provision of Medicare payment for comprehensive cancer patient treatment education and expanded cancer symptom management research will improve care and quality of life for older individuals with cancer. Medicare coverage of comprehensive cancer patient treatment education services is being expanded under the Social Security Act to improve care for older individuals with cancer. Medicare coverage of comprehensive cancer patient treatment education services is being expanded under the Social Security Act to provide one-hour education sessions for individuals diagnosed with cancer and their caregivers, informing them about care, symptoms, side-effects, and adverse events. The expanded Medicare coverage includes one-hour education sessions for cancer patients and caregivers, providing information on treatment, symptoms, side-effects, adverse events, self-dosing responsibilities, and ways to address symptoms. The information is given in a culturally and linguistically appropriate manner. The Medicare coverage now includes one-hour education sessions for cancer patients and caregivers, offering information on treatment, symptoms, side-effects, adverse events, self-dosing responsibilities, and symptom management in a culturally and linguistically appropriate manner. The Secretary will consult with relevant organizations to establish standards for these education services. The Medicare coverage has been expanded to include comprehensive cancer patient treatment education services, with payment rates set at 150 percent of the rate for diabetes outpatient self-management training services. This amendment aims to provide education on treatment, symptoms, side-effects, adverse events, self-dosing responsibilities, and symptom management in a culturally and linguistically appropriate manner. The Medicare coverage now includes comprehensive cancer patient treatment education services, performed more frequently than covered, with no impact on payment for other services. The effective date for these amendments is the first day of the first calendar year after the enactment of this Act. Research on cancer symptom management improvement is emphasized by Congress. Congress emphasizes the importance of addressing side effects and symptoms in cancer survivors to improve their quality of life. Despite advancements in cancer research, efforts to manage these effects have not kept pace. The National Institutes of Health should continue supporting research in symptom management. The National Institutes of Health should support research on symptom management and the role of nurses in providing interventions. NIH should support research on cancer symptom management improvement. The Director of the National Institutes of Health will expand research programs to improve cancer symptom management and evaluate nursing interventions. This will be carried out in collaboration with various institutes and agencies."
