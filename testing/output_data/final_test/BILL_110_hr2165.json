    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Teri Zenner Social Worker Safety Act\". Congress finds that 2 million American workers are victims of job-related violence annually, with a significant portion occurring in the healthcare and social services fields. A study revealed that 70% of front-line child welfare workers have experienced violence. Front-line child welfare workers often face violence or threats in their line of duty. Exit interviews show that 90% experienced verbal threats, 30% faced physical attacks, and 13% were threatened with weapons. Social service workers in the public sector are 7 times more likely to be victims of violent assaults compared to those in the private sector. Some states and organizations have developed safety programs and guidelines for social workers and case workers. Social workers and case workers face job-related violence, impacting individuals, families, clients, and communities in the United States. There is a need to increase awareness and prevent such violence to protect these dedicated individuals and reduce the severity of injuries sustained. SEC. 3. SOCIAL WORKER SAFETY GRANT PROGRAM.
