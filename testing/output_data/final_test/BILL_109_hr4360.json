    "content": "The \"Border Law Enforcement Act of 2005\" may be cited as such. The Act includes findings related to border security. The Congress finds that federal officials lack the manpower and resources to prevent criminals, terrorists, and illegal immigrants from engaging in criminal activity. There is a growing number of armed criminals, gang members, drug smugglers, and potential terrorists entering the US illegally over the southern border, leading to escalating violence and criminal activity. The Rio Grande border is becoming a battleground between law enforcement and criminal narco-terrorists. There is a concerning rise in foreign nationals with terrorist connections entering the US illegally. The country is facing a war against criminal organizations and individuals committed to its destruction. The inability of Federal officials to protect the US borders is putting the nation at risk of mass destruction by individuals entering illegally and using criminal means. Lawlessness along the southern border poses a clear danger to the country's peace, security, and well-being. SEC. 3. DESIGNATED COUNTY LAW ENFORCEMENT ASSISTANCE PROGRAM. The Congress reaffirms the States' authority to protect people within their jurisdiction, with minimum Federal standards. The Act authorizes Sheriffs in designated counties near the southern border to support US Customs and Border Protection. The Congress authorizes Sheriffs in designated counties near the southern border to work with US Customs and Border Protection to enforce laws and ensure individuals are lawfully present in the United States. This is in response to escalating lawlessness in border areas. The Act reaffirms full sovereign power for State and local officials to enforce criminal law due to Federal officials' inability to control lawlessness. A Designated County Law Enforcement Assistance program is established to provide financial assistance for Sheriffs in counties near the southern border. The Act grants Sheriffs in counties near the southern border authority to perform specified duties and be reimbursed for costs incurred by the Attorney General or Secretary of Homeland Security. The Act grants Sheriffs near the southern border authority to conduct law enforcement operations, transfer detained aliens to federal officials, and enforce drug trafficking laws.

Payment under this section is limited to future costs incurred after the enactment of the Act. The Attorney General can make advance payments for anticipated costs, not exceeding a 3-month period. Reimbursement or pre-payment will be made from the Designated County Law Enforcement Account in the Treasury of the United States.

Sheriffs must certify that all costs meet the requirements for reimbursement. Under this Act, Sheriffs must certify that all costs for personnel, training, equipment, and detention facilities for unlawfully present aliens are reasonable and necessary. Certifications are subject to State and Federal laws on perjury, removal from office, and prosecution. Only up to 20 percent of funds can be used for construction or renovation of detention facilities. Detained aliens deemed unlawfully present must be immediately delivered to Federal law enforcement officials. Sheriffs are responsible for the custody of aliens, who are considered Federal prisoners. SEC. 4. REGULATIONS; EFFECTIVE DATE; AUDIT; SUPPLEMENTAL FUNDING. The Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security must issue regulations within 60 days of this Act's enactment. These regulations will govern the distribution of funds for Sheriffs' expenses and set standards for federal law enforcement cooperation. The Act will take effect immediately, and regulations are not required before Sheriffs can deploy personnel. Reimbursement for expenses incurred by Sheriffs under this Act is eligible, subject to audit by the Inspector General. Funds must supplement, not replace, State or local funds for similar purposes."
