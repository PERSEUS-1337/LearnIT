    "content": "The United States has engaged in both multilateral talks and bilateral agreements for trade negotiations. Currently, pending agreements with Colombia, Panama, and South Korea are being evaluated. South Korea has existing FTAs with various countries and is negotiating with others like Australia, Canada, Japan, and Mexico. The implications of these agreements for American manufacturers are under scrutiny. The United States is evaluating pending trade agreements with Colombia, Panama, and South Korea. South Korea has existing FTAs with various countries and is negotiating with others like Australia, Canada, Japan, and Mexico. The pending KORUS FTA aims to eliminate barriers for U.S. and South Korean manufacturers in various industrial sectors. The pending KORUS FTA aims to eliminate barriers for U.S. and South Korean manufacturers in industrial sectors such as automobiles, consumer products, textiles, apparel, and pharmaceuticals. The report compares manufacturing components of the agreements, focusing on automotive trade. It also discusses implications on other sectors like home appliances, electronics, textiles, and pharmaceuticals. Agricultural and services trade are not covered in the report. The KORUS FTA is a candidate for fast-track legislative consideration. The Bipartisan Trade Promotion Authority Act of 2002 allows for automatic discharge from committee, limited debate, and no amendments for agreements entered into before July 1, 2007. The implementing bill for the KORUS FTA would be submitted to Congress and include provisions necessary for implementation. Congress votes on the legislation as a whole under fast-track procedures, with the possibility of members suggesting provisions addressing specific concerns. The European Union and South Korea completed negotiations on a free trade agreement (KOREU FTA) on October 15, 2009. The agreement must be adopted by the EU Council of Ministers and then submitted to the European Parliament for a vote. If approved, the FTA will be provisionally ratified in the European Union. The KOREU FTA, once ratified in the European Union, will facilitate manufacturing trade with South Korea by removing customs duties and addressing regulatory obstacles in various sectors. The agreement requires approval from all 27 EU member states and the South Korean National Assembly. The potential impact on U.S. manufacturers will be debated by Congress when considering ratification of the KORUS FTA. The KORUS FTA and KOREU FTA are being debated for ratification, with potential implications for European and U.S. manufacturers. Side agreements may be needed for the auto sections, and industry observers expect gains in their sectors. Various economic impact studies support positive assessments. The FTA Business Coalition, representing U.S. companies, supports the KORUS FTA, along with other business groups like the Business Roundtable and NAM. U.S. manufacturing sectors, including information technology, aircraft equipment, medical devices, and pharmaceuticals, are expected to benefit from the agreement. The ITC estimates that the reduction of barriers under the KORUS FTA could increase U.S. goods exports to Korea by $10-11 billion and boost GDP by nearly $12 billion. The KORUS FTA could boost U.S. GDP by $12 billion and create 70,000 jobs. The KOREU FTA is supported by European business groups and could bring $24.2 billion in new trade for EU exporters. However, not all U.S. and EU business communities are in favor of their respective agreements with South Korea, with trade in automobiles being a key issue. Ford, Chrysler, and the UAW initially opposed the KORUS FTA due to concerns about the South Korean auto market. However, Ford changed its stance in 2010, supporting the agreement with stronger automotive provisions. GM and the UAW also expressed support. European carmakers have varying views, with some neutral and others in direct competition with South Korean manufacturers. Some European automakers and steel sectors are concerned about the KOREU FTA, fearing potential job losses and negative effects on their industries. U.S.-based steel manufacturers argue that the KORUS FTA could weaken U.S. trade remedy laws. Labor groups in the U.S. and EU were initially opposed to the agreement. Labor groups in the U.S. and EU were initially opposed to their respective pending FTAs with South Korea, fearing negative effects on manufacturing jobs. However, with modifications announced in December 2010, the UAW expressed support for the KORUS FTA, stating it would lead to a more balanced trade relationship between the U.S. and South Korea. Labor groups in the U.S. and EU have expressed opposition to the pending FTAs with South Korea, citing concerns about job losses and unbalanced trade relationships. The UAW has shown support for the KORUS FTA after modifications were announced in December 2010, but other groups like the AFL-CIO, United Steelworkers, and European trade unions remain opposed to the agreements. The European Metalworkers' Federation and textile, clothing, and leather workers' unions in Europe also have reservations about the pending KOREU FTA, fearing further job losses and giving South Korean automakers a competitive advantage. In 2009, U.S. goods exports to South Korea totaled $28.6 billion, while EU goods exports were about the same at $29.8 billion. Major U.S. merchandise export categories to South Korea include machinery, medical devices, and aircraft and parts, while top EU goods exports include machinery, vehicles, and medical devices. Exports to South Korea include machinery, vehicles, and medical devices. Negotiators from the U.S. and EU focused on these sectors during FTA negotiations. Concerns arise about potential disadvantages for U.S. manufacturers if EU goods enter the South Korean market duty-free before U.S. products. NAM warns of job losses if U.S. manufacturers are locked out of the market. The KORUS agreement is crucial for U.S. manufacturers to compete with the EU in the South Korean market. South Korea's smaller market size poses challenges, but the potential gains for South Korean manufacturers in the larger U.S. and EU markets are significant. The U.S. and EU risk falling behind if they do not move forward quickly on the KORUS agreement. The KORUS FTA is crucial for U.S. manufacturers to compete with the EU in the South Korean market. A study funded by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce found that the U.S. could lose jobs and export sales if the KORUS FTA is not implemented. Another estimate suggests a potential loss of exports to South Korea if the KOREU FTA is fully implemented without the KORUS FTA. The study on the KORUS FTA predicts increased imports of South Korean products by the United States and Europe, particularly in motor vehicles, textiles, apparel, and footwear. South Korea is expected to boost exports to the European Union, especially in automobiles and electronics. The KOREU FTA could benefit South Korean-built cars in the EU by eliminating tariffs. Both FTAs address similar issues as U.S. and European manufacturers compete in various sectors, offering benefits to consumers. The pending FTAs between the U.S., EU, and South Korea could lead to a broader selection of goods at lower prices for consumers. Motor vehicles are a key issue in the agreements due to their importance as domestic employers and export sectors. South Korea is a significant player in the global motor vehicle production, with forecasts for increased passenger car production. KAMA forecasts passenger car production to increase to 3.3 million in 2010, allowing South Korean carmakers to boost domestic sales and exports to the US and EU markets. US and EU markets are much larger than the South Korean market. US had 10.4 million light vehicle sales and EU had 14.5 million new passenger car registrations in 2009. South Korean auto market was 1.2 million passenger cars in 2009. US automotive sector had a trade deficit of $7.9 billion. The United States automotive sector had a trade deficit of $7.9 billion with South Korea in 2009, mainly in passenger vehicles, light trucks, and auto parts. South Korea's car industry is export-driven, with over 60% of its passenger car production exported worldwide. Despite a decrease in exports in 2009 due to the economic downturn, South Korean carmakers exported just over 475,000 vehicles to the United States. In 2009, South Korea exported fewer light trucks to the United States and cars to the European Union. The domestic passenger car market in South Korea is dominated by local manufacturers, with a low import penetration rate. Foreign carmakers exported around 61,000 passenger vehicles to South Korea in 2009, with European luxury vehicles making up over half of the sales. In 2009, European brands dominated the best-selling imported cars in South Korea, with Japanese automakers accounting for 28% and U.S. manufacturers at 10%. Some argue an unbalanced trade relationship exists, impacting pending trade agreements. South Korea's auto industry highlights the increase in imports of U.S. and European cars over the last decade. Imports of U.S. and European cars to South Korea surged in the last decade, with U.S. auto exports increasing by nearly 400% and European auto exports by over 1,000%. Foreign automotive transplants, including South Korean ones, have established major production facilities in the U.S. and EU. This has impacted trade flows, potentially displacing some imports from South Korea. South Korean automakers Hyundai and Kia established production facilities in the United States in the mid-2000s, increasing their U.S. sales with locally built cars. By 2009, South Korea's U.S. transplants doubled their production to 196,000 vehicles. Hyundai's U.S.-built car sales increased by 6% from 2008 to 2009. Hyundai Motor Manufacturing Alabama and Kia Motors Manufacturing Georgia are major employers in the U.S., directly employing over 2,700 and 2,000 workers respectively. Hyundai and Kia established production facilities in the U.S. in the mid-2000s, increasing sales with locally built cars. By 2009, production doubled to 196,000 vehicles. Kia's plant in Georgia employs over 2,000 workers and has the capacity to produce 300,000 vehicles annually. South Korean automakers also produce cars in Europe, with plants in Slovakia and the Czech Republic. Kia and Hyundai each have plants capable of producing 300,000 vehicles and engines. Hyundai's U.S.-built car sales increased by 6% from 2008 to 2009. U.S. and European automakers have joint ventures with foreign competitors in South Korea. GM sold 115,000 cars through GM-Daewoo in 2009. Renault sells cars through Samsung with a production capacity of 300,000 vehicles annually. South Korea's car market is protected by import duties and non-tariff barriers. NTBs can impede exports from the U.S. and EU to South Korea. Customs duties and NTBs are covered in the KORUS FTA and KOREU FTA. The KORUS FTA and KOREU FTA have different customs duties and timelines for tariff elimination. The KOREU FTA has a transition period for automotive tariffs, while the KORUS FTA was changed in a 2010 agreement to align with the EU's tariff elimination schedule. South Korea will eliminate its 8% tariff on U.S. passenger cars within five years, except for a 25% truck tariff that will phase out over ten years. The KOREU FTA agreement will phase out truck tariffs within five years, potentially benefiting U.S. and EU luxury carmakers in the South Korean market. South Korean automakers may increase exports to the U.S. and EU markets due to competitive pricing, fuel efficiency, and generous warranties. The KORUS FTA requires South Korea to eliminate its 8% tariff on U.S. passenger cars over five years, while the United States would remove its 2.5% tariff on imported passenger vehicles. EU negotiators rejected immediate abolition of tariffs on certain vehicles, concerned about Hyundai and Kia cars flooding into Europe. The KOREU FTA would eliminate customs duties on cars over three to five years. The KOREU FTA would eliminate customs duties on cars over three to five years in equal cuts based on engine size. EU tariffs on small cars under 1,500 cc would be removed in five years, while tariffs on larger vehicles would be eliminated in three years. South Korea would phase out its 8% tariff on EU car imports over three or five years. Tariffs on auto parts would be immediately eliminated. Under the KORUS FTA, South Korea would eliminate its 10% truck tariff immediately, while the US would phase out its 25% truck tariff over seven years. The KOREU FTA would remove South Korea's 10% truck tariff over three to five years, and the EU's 22% truck tariff over the same period. The KOREU FTA includes a duty drawback mechanism not found in the KORUS FTA. The duty drawback provision in the KOREU FTA allows for tariff refunds on customs duties for South Korean manufacturers exporting products to Europe, particularly in the automobile industry. This provision could lead to an increase in South Korean imports of car parts from low-cost countries like China, potentially impacting prices. The duty drawback provision in the KOREU FTA could significantly increase South Korean exports to Europe by improving price competitiveness. The provision allows for tariff refunds on customs duties for South Korean manufacturers, potentially leading to increased imports of car parts from low-cost countries like China. The European Commission believes the impact of this provision will be small due to the low level of foreign content in South Korean products. The provision is being closely monitored as it could influence future European FTAs. The KOREU FTA includes a provision for duty drawback that could boost South Korean exports to Europe by refunding tariffs on customs duties. The United States has a snapback provision for automobile exports, while the European Union is considering a similar provision for the KOREU FTA to address import surges. This proposal includes strengthening the safeguard clause and allowing for regional safeguard measures in exceptional cases. The unresolved issue raises concerns for the European Union regarding regional application and industry impact. The unresolved issue with the KOREU FTA raises concerns for the European Union regarding regional emergency safeguard measures and potential delays in ratification. U.S. and EU carmakers fear access to the South Korean market could remain limited due to non-tariff barriers, impacting approval processes for foreign producers. South Korea's safety and environmental standards apply to all car manufacturers, but local manufacturers can better absorb the costs. South Korean manufacturers can better absorb costs of non-tariff barriers (NTBs) due to domestic market sales. Skepticism remains in the U.S. and EU auto sectors about South Korea's enforcement of NTB obligations, citing past agreements not being respected. Ford Motor Company has highlighted barriers to auto imports in South Korea in a statement to USTR on the pending KORUS FTA. In September 2009, Ford expressed concerns about South Korea enacting technical requirements that disproportionately affect importers. The South Korean ambassador stated in August 2010 that the auto market is no longer protected, highlighting unique safety and environmental standards as barriers for U.S. and European carmakers. Some of the flagged import barriers include front tow hooks, headlamp standards, tinted rear-windows, and vehicle emissions changes. The KORUS and KOREU FTAs address these standards to reduce compliance costs. The KORUS and KOREU FTAs address unfair standards for U.S. and EU automakers. Motor vehicle safety standards are regulated globally by the U.S. and Canadian self-certification system, and the UNECE international standards. South Korea can enforce its own standards, making it costly for foreign manufacturers to export cars there. The KORUS and KOREU FTAs address unfair standards for U.S. and EU automakers. South Korea's unique auto standards make it difficult for foreign manufacturers to export cars there. The KORUS FTA allows low-volume seller exemptions for U.S. automakers. The December 2010 agreement under the KOREU FTA allows U.S. automakers to sell up to 25,000 vehicles per year in South Korea built to U.S. safety standards without additional modifications, a significant increase from the previous limit of 6,500 vehicles per year. This enables U.S. carmakers to export cars to South Korea without incurring extra costs for adjustments to South Korean standards. South Korea will recognize UNECE regulations for automotive products as equivalent to its domestic standards for core safety, with 29 standards to be harmonized within five years. The KOREU FTA agreement aims to harmonize technical standards between the EU and South Korea, with UNECE regulations to be adopted within five years. The European Commission asserts strong provisions for harmonization, including recognition of safety standards like crash tests. However, some argue that South Korea will still maintain its own unique rules, limiting EU access to the South Korean car market. The KOREU FTA aims to align technical standards between the EU and South Korea, with a focus on safety and environmental regulations for car manufacturers. The EU seeks equal footing with U.S. automakers in the South Korean market by implementing common auto norms. USTR is examining differences to understand implications for U.S. auto manufacturers. Environmental protection standards, including emissions requirements, are also crucial for exporting cars to South Korea. The KOREU FTA aims to align technical standards between the EU and South Korea, focusing on safety and environmental regulations for car manufacturers. Concerns exist regarding the additional costs for U.S. and EU automakers to meet South Korean environmental standards and potential future standards. Non-tariff barriers such as tax structures, rules of origin, and consumer sentiments impact automotive trade. Specific taxes on motor vehicles are seen as barriers to foreign car sales in South Korea. Specific taxes on motor vehicles, including special consumption tax, educational tax, value-added tax, registration tax, and subway bond, are considered barriers to foreign car sales in South Korea. These taxes, often based on engine size, result in higher taxes for vehicles with larger engines, typically foreign cars from the US or EU. The 2008 WTO trade policy review noted that these taxes raise the effective rate of protection to above 12%, which is criticized by European and US car industry associations. The KORUS FTA addresses South Korea's motor vehicle tax system and includes provisions to reduce certain aspects. The KOREU FTA affirms modifications to South Korea's auto taxes on a \"most favored nation\" basis, applying changes to all WTO members. Expedited automotive dispute settlement mechanisms differ between the KOREU FTA and KORUS FTA, with shorter arbitration timelines in the former. Automotive working groups in both agreements aim to address potential trade barriers related to testing and certification standards. The KORUS FTA addresses potential trade barriers related to testing and certification standards for autos. U.S. automakers have raised concerns about South Korea's Green Growth Act leading to stricter standards. The agreement includes transparency measures and rules of origin to ensure duty-free eligibility. The KORUS FTA requires a minimum percentage of domestic value-added in products to receive tariff benefits, with permissible foreign content for autos raised to 45%. The agreement aims to resolve negative perceptions of auto imports into South Korea and eliminate anti-import activities. Measures include tax audits and banning foreign cars at company parking lots. The 1998 MOU between the US and South Korea aimed to improve the perception of foreign cars and address anti-import policies. Ford claims South Korea still has an anti-import bias. Remanufactured goods impact the auto parts sector and other industries, defined as products made from recovered components combined with new ones. The automotive industry is interested in FTA provisions for remanufactured goods, valued at $85 to $100 billion worldwide. South Korea allows imports of remanufactured goods, providing market opportunities for U.S. remanufacturers under the KORUS FTA. The Kaesong Industrial Complex (KIC) in North Korea was established in 2002 to earn hard currency. It produces textiles, clothing, metals, and machinery. The automotive industry may establish more manufacturing plants in the KIC. The treatment of KIC-produced goods under the pending KORUS and KOREU FTAs needs clarification. The KORUS FTA and KOREU FTA differ in their treatment of products from the Kaesong Industrial Complex (KIC). The KORUS FTA requires legislative approval for duty-free treatment of KIC products, while the KOREU FTA does not specify evaluation criteria or require additional approval. Implementation of these FTAs could impact various manufacturing sectors beyond automobiles, with South Korea being a significant market for U.S. manufacturers. In 2009, South Korea ranked as the 10th largest market for U.S. manufactured goods. U.S. and EU exporters face tariffs of 5% or more on 80% of industrial products when exporting to South Korea. The elimination of these tariffs under the KORUS and KOREU FTAs will enhance price competitiveness for U.S. and EU manufacturers. Non-tariff barriers in various manufacturing sectors are also addressed in these FTAs. The KORUS FTA addresses barriers in selected manufacturing sectors like household appliances, consumer electronics, textiles, and pharmaceuticals. The home appliance sector is dominated by U.S., European, and South Korean manufacturers. Concerns have been raised about U.S. companies struggling to sell products in South Korea, while South Korean manufacturers have a larger market share in the U.S. and EU. The KORUS FTA addresses barriers in the home appliance sector, with U.S. exports to South Korea hindered by an 8% tariff. South Korean manufacturers have expanded production facilities in North America and Europe. Pending FTAs aim to eliminate South Korea's 8% tariff on large home appliances, benefiting U.S. and European exporters. Samsung's acquisition of Amica will help it sell appliances in the $50 billion European market. The KORUS and KOREU FTAs aim to address non-tariff barriers in the home appliance sector, benefiting U.S. and European exporters. South Korean manufacturers have a competitive advantage in both markets, with higher appliance imports from South Korea than U.S. exports to South Korea in 2009. The KORUS and KOREU FTAs aim to address non-tariff barriers in the home appliance sector, benefiting U.S. and European exporters. South Korean manufacturers have a competitive advantage in both markets, with higher appliance imports from South Korea than U.S. exports to South Korea in 2009. Despite concerns from the European digital technology industry about the KOREU FTA, the U.S. electronics industry supports the KORUS FTA. Transportation costs and competition from Chinese manufacturers restrain export flows from South Korea to the U.S. and EU markets. Europe's technology industry is not actively lobbying against the KOREU FTA, but has reservations about the closed South Korean market for electronics. Europe's technology industry is not actively lobbying against the KOREU FTA. Tariff elimination is expected to have minimal impact on exports to South Korea as most IT and electronics products already have duty-free access. Non-ITA electronic products like digital cameras and color TVs could see increased exports due to tariff elimination. TV manufacturers in the US are unlikely to be affected as major companies have ceased production in the country. Sony closed its last U.S. TV manufacturing facility in Pennsylvania in 1992. South Korean consumer electronics makers could benefit from the removal of EU and U.S. tariffs on consumer electronics, with exceptions for products like microwave ovens in the EU. The KOREU FTA includes a special annex on non-tariff barriers for consumer electronics, allowing EU manufacturers to sell products in South Korea based on a declaration of conformity with South Korean standards. This streamlines the export process for EU manufacturers. The KOREU FTA makes it easier for EU manufacturers to export consumer electronics to South Korea by reducing costs and bureaucratic hurdles. A three-year transition period applies to some products, with exceptions for certain products requiring third party certification. Textiles and apparel are also sensitive sectors in the trade relationship among the markets. The International Trade Commission notes that the South Korean textile and apparel industry stands to benefit significantly under the FTA, with potential displacement of some U.S. domestic production. Tariffs in the U.S. and EU protect their textile and apparel manufacturers, with average MFN tariffs of 8% and 6.6% respectively, while South Korea's average MFN tariff on textiles is higher at 9.1%. Apparel tariffs in all three markets range from 11.5% to 12.6%. Implementation of the FTAs would abolish most tariffs on textiles and apparel, with immediate enforcement expected to benefit U.S., EU, and South Korean industries. The KORUS FTA and KOREU FTA will provide greater market access for U.S., EU, and South Korean textile and apparel manufacturers. The \"yarn forward\" rule is adopted, allowing preferential tariff treatment for apparel using yarn and fabric from the U.S. and South Korea. Special safeguards are included to address import surges. The KORUS FTA establishes a Committee on Textile and Apparel Matters, while the KOREU FTA does not have a separate committee for textiles. The KOREU FTA does not have a separate committee for textiles, unlike the KORUS FTA. Textile and apparel products from the KIC are not explicitly covered in the KOREU FTA due to labor issues. Some U.S. textile manufacturers are concerned about competition from South Korea's textile industry under the KORUS FTA. The textile chapter in the KORUS FTA is criticized for potentially favoring South Korean producers with nonreciprocal tariff phase-out schedules, weak rules of origin, and inadequate customs enforcement. U.S. exports to South Korea face a 10% VAT, while imports from South Korea do not. The American Apparel & Footwear Association has a more positive view on the agreement. The American Apparel & Footwear Association supports the KORUS FTA, while Europe's textile sector is concerned about job losses due to the KOREU FTA. The European Trade Union Federation opposes the KOREU FTA citing issues with duty drawback provision and rules of origin. EURATEX is more supportive of the agreement and has signed a cooperation agreement with the Korea Federation of Textile Industries for better information exchange and monitoring. South Korea's pharmaceutical and medical device sectors are significant markets in Asia, heavily relying on imports from the US, EU, and Japan. The pharmaceutical market was valued at $9 billion in 2008, with foreign-based manufacturers holding a 30% market share. South Korea imported $3 billion in pharmaceutical products in 2009, with the EU accounting for over 50% of these imports. Future growth for US and EU medical device companies is expected to come from emerging markets like South Korea. In 2009, South Korea imported $3 billion in pharmaceutical products, with the EU accounting for over 50% of these imports. Swiss and Japanese pharmaceutical manufacturers also had significant sales in South Korea. The country's medical equipment and supplies market was worth $2.1 billion in 2009, with 77% of the market being supplied by imports. South Korea is projected to have one of the fastest-growing medical device markets in Asia, with a forecasted growth rate of 11.2% between 2009 and 2014. U.S. trade groups support the KORUS FTA. The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) and U.S. industry support the KORUS FTA to increase trade with South Korea by easing tariff and non-tariff barriers. Both agreements address concerns about South Korean government policies favoring local manufacturers and include provisions to eliminate tariffs on pharmaceutical products and medical devices. South Korea's tariffs on pharmaceutical imports are to be phased out. Many of South Korea's tariffs on pharmaceutical imports will be phased out immediately or within three years under the pending KORUS and KOREU FTAs. Tariffs for medical device exports will also be removed, with some phased in over three years and others over a longer period. The agreements aim to tackle non-tariff barriers, such as improving NTB provisions in the KORUS FTA. The pending KORUS FTA aims to improve transparency in the reimbursement process for medical devices and pharmaceuticals, establish a Medicines and Medical Devices Committee, and promote regulatory cooperation. U.S. imported car models have not ranked among the top 10 in the South Korean market for the past 10 years. In 2009, Japanese cars were among the top 10 best-selling imports in South Korea. The European Union and South Korea are exploring free trade agreements with other countries such as Canada, India, Singapore, Vietnam, and China. South Korea is seeking free trade deals with various countries including Australia, Canada, India, Japan, and Mexico. There is also consideration for a free trade arrangement between South Korea and China. The proliferation of FTAs could pose challenges for U.S. exporters in foreign markets."
