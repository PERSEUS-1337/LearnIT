    "content": "The \"Recalcitrant Cancer Research Act of 2012\" is cited as the short title. It amends the Public Health Service Act to include a scientific framework for recalcitrant cancers. The \"Recalcitrant Cancer Research Act of 2012\" mandates the development of a scientific framework for research on identified recalcitrant cancers, including a review of literature on prevention, diagnosis, and treatment, as well as biologic processes regulating the cancer. The \"Recalcitrant Cancer Research Act of 2012\" requires a scientific framework for studying specific cancers, focusing on biological processes, epidemiology, scientific advances, and researcher availability. The Recalcitrant Cancer Research Act of 2012 mandates a scientific framework for studying specific cancers, including the availability of qualified individuals for scientific research, coordinated research initiatives, and research resources like patient registries and tissue banks. The Recalcitrant Cancer Research Act of 2012 mandates a scientific framework for studying specific cancers, including research resources like patient registries and tissue banks to facilitate research in various areas and identify research questions that have not been adequately addressed. Recommendations for advancing research and appropriate actions are also included. The Recalcitrant Cancer Research Act of 2012 mandates actions to ensure availability of qualified individuals, promote research initiatives, develop resources, and strengthen existing resources for identified cancers. Timing for initial development and updates is also specified. The Director of the Institute must develop a scientific framework for each recalcitrant cancer within 18 months of enactment and update it every 5 years. Updates can be done as necessary, and public notice must be given within 30 days of completing each framework. The Director of the Institute must identify two or more recalcitrant cancers with low survival rates and high mortality within 6 months of enactment. The identified cancers must have a 5-year relative survival rate of less than 20 percent. The Director of the Institute must identify recalcitrant cancers causing at least 30,000 deaths annually in the US. Working groups will be formed to develop scientific frameworks for each identified cancer. The Director of NIH will ensure biennial reports include information on actions taken for recalcitrant cancers, research grants awarded, progress in improving outcomes, and activities under section 413(b)(7). The Director of the NIH will submit a report to Congress on the effectiveness of scientific frameworks for recalcitrant cancers, and consider these frameworks for exception funding recommendations for grant applications. Recalcitrant cancer is defined as a cancer with a five-year relative survival rate below 50 percent."
