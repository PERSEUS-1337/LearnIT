    "content": "Bitcoin is a decentralized virtual currency system that allows users to trade without a central authority. Transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain are public, but the original structure prioritizes security over direct analysis of address transactions. Our proposed computationally efficient model analyzes Bitcoin blockchain addresses for use with machine learning algorithms, compared against MLSLs. Bitcoin is a virtual currency system that enables secure transactions without a central authority, utilizing cryptographic methods on a peer-to-peer network. Altcoins emerged after Bitcoin gained widespread attention in 2011. Bitcoin, the most widespread cryptocurrency, represents over 81% of the total market. Its market capitalization is around $177.8 billion, accounting for 90% of the total market capitalization of virtual currencies. Bitcoin uses public key cryptography for secure transactions, with addresses generated for users. Transactions consist of source and destination addresses for transferring coins. Bitcoin transactions involve coins being collected and sent to different destination addresses. Analyzing address transaction data is challenging due to its decentralized nature. Address2vec is compared to MLSLs for generating sparse embeddings of graphs using LSTMs. Address2vec is a computationally cheaper approach for embedding generation models. The text discusses the use of an autoencoder to compress transaction data from blockchain blocks into a single number. This compressed data is used to construct a transaction graph using networkX, where each transaction includes sending and receiving addresses along with the compressed features. The text discusses using an autoencoder to compress transaction data and generate node embeddings for a graph using the node2vec algorithm. A small network is then used to predict address behavior, specifically whether a bitcoin address will be empty after 1 year. Results show comparable performance to MLSLs at a lower computational cost. Further improvements are expected by making the model end-to-end differentiable and testing on different bitcoin behaviors. Address2vec is being tested on various bitcoin behavior tasks, such as measuring user similarity and predicting market rates by analyzing recent addresses on the blockchain."
