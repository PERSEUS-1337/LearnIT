    "content": "The \"Employment Protection Act of 2011\" may impact employment and economic activity through EPA regulatory activity. The \"Employment Protection Act of 2011\" defines key terms such as Administrator and de minimis negative impact, which sets thresholds for job loss and economic activity decrease. The \"Employment Protection Act of 2011\" sets thresholds for job loss and economic activity decrease, requiring the Administrator to analyze impacts on employment levels and economic activity before implementing regulations or denying permits. Economic models are used for this analysis. The Administrator must use economic models for analyzing impacts on employment levels and economic activity before implementing regulations or denying permits. The Comptroller General must submit an annual report on the economic models used for this analysis. The Administrator is required to post the analysis for any regulation, requirement, policy statement, guidance document, endangerment finding, program, or permit denial. The Administrator must post the analysis of job losses and economic impact due to permit denials on the EPA website and request Governors to post it in State Capitols. Public hearings are required if the Administrator concludes a regulation or policy has negative impacts. The Administrator must hold public hearings in each State if a regulation, policy, or permit denial will have a significant negative impact on employment or economic activity. The hearings must be held at a convenient time and location for impacted residents. The Administrator must prioritize locations in a State with the highest job losses for public hearings. If the Administrator fails to hold a required public hearing, residents can take legal action to enforce compliance and potentially stop the regulation. The text discusses the process of enjoining regulations, requirements, and permits, with the possibility of awarding attorneys' fees and costs. Appeals of injunctions must adhere to specific timelines and procedures set by the court of appeals. The Administrator must make a final decision within 90 days of filing an appeal. If a regulation will have a significant negative impact on employment or economic activity in a State, notification must be provided to the relevant parties 45 days before the regulation takes effect or 7 days before a permit denial."
