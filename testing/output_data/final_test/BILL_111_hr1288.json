    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Saudi Arabia Accountability Act of 2009\". The findings of Congress highlight the importance of refraining from supporting terrorist acts, denying safe haven to terrorists, and addressing terrorist financing, particularly from individuals and charities in Saudi Arabia. The Council on Foreign Relations reported that Saudi donors to terrorist groups have not been publicly punished since 9/11. The National Commission on Terrorist Attacks listed Saudi Arabia as a prime location for terrorist bases. Freedom House's report found Saudi Arabia responsible for promoting hatred and violence in US mosques. Saudi Arabia is a key source of financing for terrorism, with reports indicating that a significant portion of Hamas' budget comes from individuals in Saudi Arabia. Additionally, Saudi support for Palestinian causes has been highlighted in various reports. The Saudi royal family has been a major financial supporter of Palestinian groups fighting Israel, funneling over $4 billion to finance the intifada. US Government personnel complained that Saudis refused to cooperate in investigating Osama bin Laden before and after 9/11. After the 1996 Khobar Towers bombing in Saudi Arabia, the Saudi government denied US officials access to suspects linked to the attack, including one with knowledge of a plot to use poison gas in the New York City subway system. The United States Commission on International Religious Freedom has criticized Saudi Arabia for its actions. The Saudi Arabian Government-funded textbooks used in Islamic schools and mosques in North America encourage violence against non-Muslims. There are efforts to combat terrorism since the 2003 suicide bombings in Riyadh. The Saudi government restricts visas for Israeli passport holders and those who do not follow Saudi traditions. Alcohol consumption is prohibited in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Pilgrims should follow specific regulations and contact the consulate for more information. Jewish people face restrictions in the country. SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS. The sense of Congress is that the Government of Saudi Arabia must provide complete cooperation to the United States in investigating groups suspected of terrorism and close any organizations funding or supporting terrorism within the Kingdom. The Government of Saudi Arabia must cease support for terrorist organizations, including funding for families of terrorists, both within the Kingdom and abroad. The President should judge if Saudi Arabia has continued efforts to combat terrorism after the 2003 bombing in Riyadh. SEC. 4. SANCTIONS. Restrictions on Exports and Diplomatic Travel will be imposed on the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia if the President does not make a specific certification. This includes prohibiting the export of defense articles and services, as well as restricting the travel of Saudi diplomats in certain U.S. cities. The President may waive restrictions on Saudi diplomatic travel within a 25-mile radius of specific U.S. cities if it is in the national security interest, with a certification required for cooperation with the United States. The Government of Saudi Arabia is fully cooperating with the United States to investigate and prevent terrorist attacks. They have closed all Saudi-based terror organizations, stopped funding offshore terror groups, and are blocking funding from private Saudi citizens to offshore terrorist organizations. The Secretary of State must submit an annual report on Saudi Arabia's progress in meeting specified conditions. Visa issuance to Saudi citizens by the US is halted until Saudi Arabia stops discriminating based on religious affiliation. The term \"appropriate congressional committees\" in this Act refers to the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate."
