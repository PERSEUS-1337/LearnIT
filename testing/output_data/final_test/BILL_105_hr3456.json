This includes an annual appropriation of budget surpluses to the social security plus fund for crediting to personal social security plus accounts. The Secretary of the Treasury transfers 80% of the budget surplus to the Social Security Plus Fund annually. The Commissioner of Social Security then evenly allocates this amount to eligible individuals' personal social security plus accounts. Eligible individuals are defined for each calendar year. An eligible individual is defined as someone whose wages and self-employment income in a calendar year are sufficient to earn 4 quarters of coverage. The curr_chunk is about the \"social security plus fund.\" Sec. 252 establishes the Social Security Plus Fund in the Treasury of the United States. The Fund consists of transferred amounts, earnings from investments, and payments made from the Fund. The Commissioner of Social Security has powers and duties over the Fund similar to the Executive Director of the Thrift Savings Fund. The Social Security Plus Fund appropriations are available without fiscal year limitation for investing, making distributions, paying administrative expenses, and purchasing insurance. The funds can only be used for the specified purposes and not for any other purpose. \"Personal social security plus accounts are available for investing, distributions, administrative expenses, and insurance purchases.\" The Commissioner of Social Security establishes personal social security plus accounts for individuals with a social security number. Account balances are determined by the excess of certain sums. The excess in a social security plus account is calculated by subtracting the amounts paid out from the sum of all deposits and allocations made to the account. Earnings and losses from investments are allocated to each account based on credited sums, minus a share of administrative expenses. The excess in a social security plus account is reduced by a share of administrative expenses paid out of the net earnings, as determined by the Commissioner. The curr_chunk discusses rules governing personal social security plus accounts, including investment, accounting, reporting, and taxation. The regulations prescribed by the Commissioner of Social Security apply to the Social Security Plus Fund and accounts maintained in the same manner as the Thrift Savings Fund, covering investment, accounting, reporting, and taxation. The Social Security Plus Fund is to be maintained similarly to the Thrift Savings Fund, with the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board and the Commissioner of Social Security exercising the same powers and responsibilities as required for the Thrift Savings Fund. References in sections 8438 and 8439 to employees or former employees are considered to refer to account holders in the Social Security Plus Fund. \"Distributions from personal Social Security Plus accounts\" The balance in a personal social security plus account is distributed to the account holder upon entitlement to old-age insurance benefits. The distribution can be in the form of equal annual installments over the account holder's life expectancy or as an immediate annuity. The balance in a personal social security plus account is distributed to the account holder upon entitlement to old-age insurance benefits. If the account balance is $3,500 or less, the Commissioner of Social Security will pay the balance in a single lump sum payment. Adjustments to this amount are made annually based on cost-of-living adjustments. \"Fiduciary responsibilities\" Under regulations of the Secretary of Labor, provisions of sections 8477 and 8478 of title 5, United States Code apply to the Social Security Plus Fund and personal social security plus accounts. The Secretary of Labor has investigative authority to determine violations, and exculpatory provisions and insurance are included in agreements. Any provision in an agreement relieving a fiduciary from responsibility under this part is void. The Social Security Plus Fund can purchase insurance to cover fiduciary liability without recourse against the fiduciary. The curr_chunk discusses the assignment, alienation, and treatment of deceased individuals. The regulations for assignment and alienation under chapter 84 of title 5, United States Code, apply to personal social security plus accounts in the Social Security Plus Fund. In the event of a deceased account holder before retirement age, the Commissioner of Social Security will close the account and transfer the balance to the surviving spouse's account. In case of a deceased account holder, the balance will be transferred to the surviving spouse or the legal representative of the estate, or to the entitled person under the laws of the deceased account holder's domicile."
