    "content": "Chapter 5 of the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946 is amended to include a new section on spot market purchases of livestock by packers. The new section in Chapter 5 of the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946 defines key terms related to livestock transactions, including 'cooperative association of producers', 'covered packer', and 'nonaffiliated producer'. The new section in Chapter 5 of the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946 defines key terms related to livestock transactions, including criteria for a producer to be considered a nonaffiliated producer when selling livestock to a packer in a spot market sale. This includes having less than 1 percent equity interest in the packer, no shared officers, directors, employees, or owners with the packer, no fiduciary responsibility to the packer, and no equity interest from the packer. The new section in Chapter 5 of the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946 defines key terms related to livestock transactions, including criteria for a producer to be considered a nonaffiliated producer when selling livestock to a packer in a spot market sale. This includes ensuring a reasonable competitive bidding opportunity exists, with no agreements or circumstances preventing the producer from soliciting bids from other packers. The new section in Chapter 5 of the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946 requires covered packers to slaughter a certain percentage of livestock through spot market sales from nonaffiliated producers. The applicable percentages vary based on whether the packer is a cooperative association of producers or not, with exceptions for packers with a high percentage of captive supply cattle. The 2001 annual report to Grain Inspection, Packers and Stockyards Administration of the United States Department of Agriculture states that applicable percentages for captive supply cattle must be met by packers, with specific percentages set for each calendar year from 2004 onwards. In 2008 and each year after, covered packers must meet a 25 percent captive supply cattle requirement. For cooperative associations of producers with over 87.5 percent captive supply cattle in their 2001 report, the percentage will be the greater of the difference between reported captive supply and 100, or specific percentages for 2004 and 2005 set at 5 percent each. In 2008 and beyond, covered packers must meet a 25 percent captive supply cattle requirement. This section does not preempt state requirements for packers to purchase more livestock on the spot market. It does not impact the interpretation of other sections of the Act."
