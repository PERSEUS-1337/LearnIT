    "content": "Cannabidiol (CBD) is a compound derived from the Cannabis sativa plant, promoted for various conditions like seizures, PTSD, anxiety, and inflammation. Limited scientific evidence exists to support its efficacy. In the US, CBD is found in food, beverages, supplements, cosmetics, and tobacco products like electronic cigarettes, regulated by the FDA. Epidiolex, a pharmaceutical drug containing CBD, is FDA-approved for treating epilepsy. CBD and THC are the main cannabinoids in the Cannabis sativa plant. THC is psychoactive and found in high levels in marijuana, while CBD is nonpsychoactive and can be derived from hemp or marijuana. The FDA treats cannabis-derived products like any other regulated products, subject to the same authorities and requirements. The FDA regulates cannabis-derived products like any other FDA-regulated products, regardless of whether they are classified as hemp under the 2018 Farm Bill. In contrast, the DEA does not regulate cannabis or cannabis-derived compounds that meet the statutory definition of hemp. Marijuana and hemp have separate definitions in U.S. law and are subject to different requirements. Under the CSA, unauthorized activities related to marijuana and its derivatives are prohibited, while hemp can be legally cultivated under federal law. Hemp is used in various products and was previously subject to the same restrictions as marijuana until the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018. The Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 removed hemp and its derivatives from the CSA definition of marijuana, allowing hemp production to be regulated by USDA as an agricultural commodity. CBD products that do not meet the statutory definition of hemp remain prohibited under the CSA and regulated by DEA. The 2018 farm bill aimed to create market opportunities for hemp-derived products while preserving FDA's authorities over hemp-derived products. The FDA regulates cannabis and cannabis-derived products under the FFDCA and Section 351 of the Public Health Service Act. It is illegal to introduce food with added CBD into interstate commerce or market CBD as dietary supplements. CBD is found in the prescription drug Epidiolex and is also used in food, beverages, dietary supplements, cosmetics, and tobacco products. Each product type is governed by different regulations. The FDA regulates various products such as drugs, food, dietary supplements, cosmetics, and tobacco products, including those containing CBD. Different regulatory requirements apply to each product type, with FDA overseeing safety and effectiveness. Regulatory authority is also shared with other entities like the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau and the Federal Trade Commission. OTC drugs can be used without a prescription if they have a safe margin, low potential for abuse, and clear labeling for self-diagnosis and management. New drugs require FDA approval and clinical trial data to ensure safety before being introduced into the market. The FDA requires data from clinical trials to prove a drug's safety and effectiveness. Manufacturers must submit an investigational new drug (IND) application before conducting clinical testing in humans. After completing clinical trials, the manufacturer submits the results in a new drug application (NDA) to the FDA for review. The FDA evaluates the drug's safety, effectiveness, labeling, manufacturing methods, and quality controls in the NDA process. The NDA process can be used for both prescription and over-the-counter (OTC) drugs, including switching a drug from prescription to OTC status. FDA requires data from clinical trials for drug approval. Manufacturers submit an NDA for review, including for Rx-to-OTC switches. Label comprehension and self-selection studies may be required. In June 2018, FDA approved Epidiolex for seizures, containing CBD with unknown mechanism of action. The FDA approved Epidiolex in June 2018 for seizures, containing CBD with unknown mechanism of action. DEA rescheduled Epidiolex to Schedule V in September 2018, allowing its prescription at specialty pharmacies. Epidiolex is the first pharmaceutical CBD formulation in the US with seven years of marketing exclusivity as an orphan drug. The FDA granted Epidiolex seven years of marketing exclusivity, meaning no other NDA with CBD as the active ingredient for treating seizures can be approved for the same disease. The FDA oversees human and animal food safety, ensuring compliance with regulations and truthful labeling. The FDA regulates food safety, ensuring compliance with regulations and truthful labeling. Food additives must be approved through premarket review, unless they are generally recognized as safe. Approval is granted for specific uses to improve taste, texture, appearance, nutritional value, safety, and freshness. The FDA regulates food safety and approves food additives through premarket review. Food additives can be determined to be Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) through scientific procedures or common use before 1958. The FDA also established a voluntary GRAS notification process for substances considered safe for their intended use in human food. Under the FFDCA, it is illegal to introduce food with added drugs into interstate commerce, except under specific circumstances such as prior approval or for enhancing food safety. The FDA has determined that it is unlawful to introduce food containing added CBD into interstate commerce, as CBD is an active ingredient in an approved drug. However, cannabis-derived ingredients without CBD or THC may not be subject to this prohibition. Foods with trace amounts of CBD, such as hemp seed, may be marketed lawfully under certain conditions. FDA has evaluated GRAS notices for hemp seed-derived ingredients. The FDA completed evaluation of three GRAS notices for hemp seed-derived ingredients, allowing them to be marketed in human foods without food additive approval. These ingredients can be used in beverages, soups, dressings, baked goods, snacks, and nutrition bars as a source of protein, carbohydrates, oil, and nutrients. CBD has not been approved as a food additive. FDA has not approved CBD as a food additive for human or animal consumption. Animal food, like human food, is not subject to premarket approval unless it meets the definition of a food additive. In some cases, animal food may be considered both a food and a drug simultaneously, requiring FDA approval before marketing. The FDA does not require premarket approval for most animal food, but federal and state regulations govern their production and sale, including labeling and ingredient requirements. It is prohibited under the FFDCA to introduce animal food with added drugs into interstate commerce, unless approved by the FDA. Some cannabis-derived ingredients without CBD may be exempt from this prohibition and can be marketed with FDA approval. However, the FDA has not approved any food additive petitions or GRAS notices for hemp seed and hemp-seed derived ingredients in animal food. The FDA has not approved any food additive petitions or GRAS notices for hemp seed and hemp-seed derived ingredients in animal food. FDA works with states and AAFCO to regulate the use of animal food products, providing scientific assistance for ingredient safety. CVM recognizes AAFCO-listed ingredients as acceptable for animal food use. The FDA has not approved any food additive petitions or GRAS notices for hemp seed and hemp-seed derived ingredients in animal food. AAFCO guidelines on hemp in animal food align with FDA's policy, stating that CBD-infused materials should be treated as drugs due to associated drug claims. This means parts of the hemp plant may not be approved as animal feed ingredients, and products containing CBD as a feed ingredient could be labeled adulterated or misbranded. Regulatory actions by state agencies may be taken against such products. Dietary supplements, defined as products intended to supplement the diet, are regulated as food under the FFDCA. They contain vitamins, minerals, herbs, amino acids, and other substances. FDA does not pre-approve their safety and effectiveness but they must comply with CGMPs. Supplements cannot claim to diagnose, cure, mitigate, treat, or prevent diseases. Dietary supplements are subject to FDA regulations, including notifying FDA 75 days before marketing a supplement with a new dietary ingredient (NDI). An NDI is a dietary ingredient not marketed before October 15, 1994, with exceptions for certain cases. The FDA requires notification 75 days before marketing a supplement with a new dietary ingredient (NDI). The NDI notification must include evidence of safety and other information. FDA keeps the information confidential for 90 days and issues response letters, not approvals. Under the FFDCA, a notification for a new dietary ingredient (NDI) must be submitted to the FDA 75 days before marketing a supplement. The notification should include safety evidence and other relevant information. If the notification is incomplete, a letter listing deficiencies may be issued. Additionally, objections regarding safety concerns or regulatory issues can be raised. Articles that are active ingredients in approved drugs or under investigation as new drugs are excluded from being marketed as dietary supplements, unless FDA issues a regulation allowing it. FDA regulations prohibit the marketing of CBD as a dietary supplement due to its status as an active ingredient in an FDA-approved drug. However, there is a possibility for FDA to create an exception through a regulation allowing CBD to be marketed as a dietary supplement after notice and comment. FDA regulations currently prohibit marketing CBD as a dietary supplement, but interested parties can request a regulation change through a citizen petition. If FDA were to allow CBD as a supplement, it would need to comply with various requirements. Despite FDA's determination that marketing CBD as a dietary supplement is unlawful, products containing CBD derived from hemp are still on the market. The Consumer Healthcare Products Association (CHPA) submitted a citizen petition to FDA on November 14, 2019, requesting a regulatory pathway for CBD-containing dietary supplements. It is unclear if other petitions have been submitted for this purpose. The FFDCA defines cosmetics as products intended for beautifying or altering appearance. The FDA has the authority to enforce actions against adulterated or misbranded cosmetics, which may contain harmful substances or have misleading labeling. Products making therapeutic claims are considered drugs and must meet FFDCA requirements. Marketing a new drug without FDA approval is a violation. The FDA has limited authority over cosmetic products compared to other regulated products. Legislation in the 116th Congress aims to expand FDA's authority over cosmetics, including a safety review of certain ingredients like CBD. The FDA regulates tobacco products under the FFDCA and TCA, defining them as products made or derived from tobacco intended for human consumption. Nicotine is an addictive compound found in tobacco, present in products like cigarettes, cigars, and ENDS. The FDA regulates tobacco products containing nicotine under the FFDCA and TCA. In 2016, the deeming rule extended FDA's authority over all tobacco products, including ENDS. E-liquids used in ENDS may contain nicotine, flavorings, and other ingredients. If an e-liquid contains CBD and makes therapeutic claims, it may be considered an unapproved drug. Products containing both nicotine and CBD may still meet the statutory definition of a tobacco product. The FDA regulates tobacco products containing nicotine under the FFDCA and TCA. E-liquids used in ENDS may contain nicotine, flavorings, and other ingredients. If an e-liquid contains CBD and makes therapeutic claims, it may be considered an unapproved drug. Products containing both nicotine and CBD may still meet the statutory definition of a tobacco product. However, if the e-liquid contains CBD only, with no tobacco-derived compounds, and does not make therapeutic claims, FDA's enforcement options might be limited. FDA intends to regulate products with CBD as tobacco products on a case-by-case basis. As a regulator of alcoholic beverages, the FDA determines approved ingredients for production. Producers must seek formula approval from TTB before using hemp in alcohol production. Approved formulas are required for distilled spirits, wine, and beer, with any changes needing a new filing. Formula approval is required for any fermented product that is not recognized as traditional in beer production. Labeling requirements and permits are necessary for interstate commerce in alcohol. TTB does not approve formulas with controlled substances like marijuana. Updates on using hemp in alcohol production are in progress. TTB is updating guidance on using hemp ingredients in alcohol beverages to comply with the 2018 farm bill. They consult with the FDA on ingredient safety and may require FDA documentation for certain ingredients. Hemp-derived ingredients must be FDA-approved or determined to be GRAS. FDA has evaluated GRAS determinations for hemp seed-derived ingredients without CBD, but not for alcoholic beverages. CBD is not allowed in food for interstate commerce due to its drug status. The FDA has determined that it is unlawful to introduce food with certain drug ingredients like CBD into interstate commerce. CBD has not been approved as a food additive and lacks scientific information supporting its safety. Formulations using hemp extracts, including CBD, are unlikely to be approved by TTB. CBD interacts with cell receptors in the body differently than THC, producing different effects. CBD has low affinity for intoxicating receptors, making it non-intoxicating. It shows potential therapeutic effects in reducing seizures, pain, and anxiety. The mechanism of action for these benefits remains uncertain, even in approved drugs like Epidiolex. GW Pharmaceuticals' Sativex, a cannabis extract spray with a 1:1 ratio of CBD and THC, is approved in over 25 countries for treating spasticity in MS patients. In Canada, it is also used for neuropathic pain in MS and as an adjunctive analgesic in cancer patients. However, Phase III trials showed it was not superior to placebo in treating cancer pain. CBD is known for its anti-inflammatory properties. CBD is being studied in ongoing clinical trials for various conditions including chronic pain, Parkinson's tremors, and anxiety. GW Pharmaceuticals is researching CBD and its variants for autism and schizophrenia, while other pharmaceutical companies are exploring its use for severe acne and graft-versus-host disease. CBD is being studied in clinical trials for various conditions, including chronic pain, Parkinson's tremors, and anxiety. Research is also being conducted on CBD and its variants for autism and schizophrenia. Trials for severe acne and graft-versus-host disease are ongoing. However, conclusive evidence supporting the use of CBD for various health conditions is limited. The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine published a review noting research gaps in treating conditions such as cancer, chemotherapy-induced nausea, epilepsy, and PTSD with CBD or CBD-enriched cannabis. CBD is promoted as a treatment for various conditions, including PTSD, anxiety, inflammation, and sleeplessness, despite limited scientific evidence. Research on marijuana is hindered by its Schedule I status under the CSA, leading to stringent DEA requirements for conducting studies on Schedule I substances. DEA limits the quantity of marijuana manufactured each year due to its Schedule I classification. The DEA restricts the amount of marijuana produced annually, which can delay research efforts. The 2018 farm bill removed hemp and hemp-derived CBD from DEA regulation. CBD preparations with over 0.3% delta-9 THC are still subject to Schedule I requirements. Conducting research on these substances remains challenging. The FDA currently prohibits adding CBD to interstate commerce food products. The FDA prohibits adding CBD to food sold in interstate commerce and marketing it as a dietary supplement. FDA has not issued regulations allowing CBD in food or dietary supplements, as it is an active ingredient in FDA-approved drugs. The agency has not made the same determination for other cannabis-derived compounds. Therapeutic claims in CBD-containing cosmetics may be subject to FDA regulations. If a product makes therapeutic claims, FDA would likely consider it a drug subject to approval requirements. CBD can be marketed as a drug with FDA approval. FDA has approved Epidiolex for treating seizures. Firm seeking to market CBD as a therapeutic product would need FDA approval. FDA held a public hearing to gather data on CBD products. The FDA has been focusing on the safety, manufacturing, quality, marketing, labeling, and sale of products containing cannabis or cannabis-derived compounds. Despite FDA's stance that adding CBD to food or marketing it as a dietary supplement is illegal, CBD products are still being marketed in violation of this. Enforcement actions are prioritized against products making false claims about treating diseases. The FDA is expected to change its enforcement policy regarding CBD products in light of recent developments. Some industry stakeholders recommend complying with federal regulations for supplements and food in the absence of an FDA regulatory framework for CBD products. This includes facility registration, adherence to CGMPs, and meeting labeling requirements. An organization has established a third-party certification program for hemp products, independent of federal requirements. FDA has not validated any third-party certification program for hemp. At the retail level, CBD products are being marketed in various consumer goods despite FDA regulations. These products are sold through specialty retailers, online sales, and large retailers like CVS and Walgreens. Marijuana-derived CBD remains prohibited under the CSA if it does not meet the statutory definition of hemp. DEA registration is not required to grow hemp. The DEA has confirmed that a registration is not required to grow or research hemp plants and CBD preparations that meet the statutory definition of hemp. Despite federal prohibition, marijuana-derived CBD products not approved by the FDA are available in states where cannabis is legal, violating federal law. These products may contain high levels of THC, leading to psychoactive effects. In 2018, CBD sales in the United States reached $534 million, with sales from hemp-derived, marijuana-derived, and FDA-approved Epidiolex products. Over 1,000 companies were producing and marketing CBD products, with sales rising fivefold since 2014. Sales of hemp- and marijuana-derived CBD were $240 million and $264 million, respectively, while Epidiolex sales were $30 million. Projections indicate expected growth, with sales expected to exceed $1 billion in 2020 and nearly $2 billion in 2022. Sales of CBD in the United States are projected to reach $2 billion in 2022, with growth expected in hemp-derived, marijuana-derived, and pharmaceutical CBD markets. U.S. consumers believe in the wellness benefits of cannabis, leading to high demand. Despite regulatory uncertainties, CBD sales are anticipated to increase, especially in markets where cannabis is legal. Despite restrictions on marketing CBD as a food additive or dietary supplement, Congress supports a regulatory framework for hemp-derived CBD in FDA-regulated products. FDA has been directed by Congress to exercise enforcement discretion for CBD products meeting the statutory definition of hemp. This includes funding for research, policy evaluation, and regulatory activities related to CBD products under FDA jurisdiction. The FDA is directed by Congress to provide progress reports on obtaining data for enforcement discretion of CBD products meeting the definition of hemp. A sampling study of the CBD marketplace to identify mislabeled or adulterated products is also required. This directive does not mandate setting a safe level for CBD in consumer products, but it may inform future regulations. Congress could consider further legislative action in addition to these activities. Congress could consider further legislative action, such as requiring FDA to issue a regulation permitting CBD derived from hemp to be used as a food additive or dietary supplement. This would involve setting conditions for safe usage, including specified quantities and labeling requirements. Additionally, Congress could amend FFDCA provisions that restrict marketing of CBD in food and supplements. Congress could exclude CBD that meets the definition of hemp from restrictions on marketing CBD-containing products as dietary supplements. However, other FFDCA requirements may still apply, such as submitting an NDI notification for dietary supplements or obtaining approval for food additives. FDA has stated that CBD is not generally recognized as safe for use in food, so a food additive petition may be necessary. Food and dietary supplements are not evaluated by FDA for safety and effectiveness before marketing. Congress may consider the potential adverse health effects of dietary supplements, such as liver injury and drug interactions with CBD. Other concerns include dosing, cumulative effects, and populations for whom CBD may not be appropriate. FDA's position on CBD could impact other agencies and incentives for conducting clinical trials. The FDA's position on CBD could impact other agencies' policies and guidance, such as TTB and AAFCO. TTB may allow CBD in alcoholic beverages if FDA issues a policy of enforcement discretion. AAFCO's guidelines on hemp in animal food may also be affected. The USPTO's guidance limits trademark registrations for CBD products, stating that compliance with federal law is necessary for registration. Marks for CBD-containing goods will still be refused as unlawful under the FDCA, even if derived from hemp. The USPTO's guidance restricts trademark registrations for CBD products, requiring compliance with federal law. FDA has determined that CBD cannot be added to any food sold in interstate commerce, and the agency has never approved the use of CBD as a food additive. FDA is looking to further clarify the conditions under which CBD foods, beverages, dietary supplements, or pet treats may be lawfully marketed. The FDA is authorized to establish regulations for food additive approval through a notice and comment process. A food additive petition must include information on the additive's name, chemical identity, proposed use conditions, relevant data on its intended effects, and quantity required. The FDA requires detailed information in a food additive petition, including the additive's name, chemical identity, proposed use conditions, and safety investigations. FDA regulations specify additional requirements for petition submissions. Within 30 days of filing, FDA must publish notice of the proposed regulation, and within 90 days, issue an order either denying or establishing conditions for safe use of the additive. The FDA may extend the 90-day period for evaluating the safety of a food additive. Regulations may not be issued if data fails to establish safe use or if it would deceive consumers or result in adulteration of food. Tolerance limitations may be set to ensure safe use, considering factors like probable consumption and cumulative effects in the diet. The FDA allows for the submission of objections and requests for public hearings regarding food additive regulations. Interested parties can petition for new uses of approved additives. If a food additive is already regulated for its intended use, premarket approval is not required. Additionally, individuals can submit a GRAS notice to FDA asserting that a substance is Generally Recognized as Safe and not subject to premarket review requirements. The FDA requires a complete submission for a GRAS notice, consisting of seven parts. If any part is missing, an explanation is needed. FDA evaluates the submission and notifies the submitter of its decision within 180 days, with a possible 90-day extension. The FDA evaluates GRAS notice submissions within 180 days, with a possible 90-day extension. Filed GRAS notices are made public by the FDA."
