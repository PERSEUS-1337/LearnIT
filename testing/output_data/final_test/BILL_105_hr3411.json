    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Commission for American Mathematics Leadership Act\". The Congress aims for U.S. students to excel in math within the next decade. The TIMSS study showed U.S. students lag behind in math skills compared to other nations, despite spending more time on math. Problems in math and science education in the U.S. are largely attributed to research findings. The challenges in science education in the United States stem from the lack of a coherent curriculum, assessment instruments, and commitment to teacher preparation. Problems exist with current teaching styles in math and science, leading to superficial learning. A developed framework for math and science should be coherent and focused. The failure of math and science teaching methods in the United States requires a systemic retraining and increased emphasis on professional development of teachers. Teachers should be well-trained professionals with sound subject knowledge, necessary skills, and understanding of student learning and assessment. The \"Commission for American Mathematics Leadership\" is established with 12 members appointed by the President, Speaker of the House, and President pro tempore of the Senate. Their duties include addressing the failure of math and science teaching methods in the US through teacher retraining and professional development. The Commission for American Mathematics Leadership, established with 12 members appointed by key officials, is tasked with reviewing research on math education, proposing professional development priorities, and formulating recommendations to improve math teaching in the US within a decade. The Commission for American Mathematics Leadership, established with 12 members appointed by key officials, is required to submit a report with findings and recommendations within 180 days. The Commission has the power to hold hearings, take testimony, and receive evidence as needed. The Commission will elect a chairman and requires seven members for a quorum to conduct meetings. Personnel matters are addressed in terms of the Commission's procedures. SEC. 8. PERSONNEL MATTERS. Members of the Commission will not be paid for their service.
