    "content": "Resale price maintenance, also known as vertical price fixing, involves agreements between manufacturers and retailers to set specific prices for products, violating antitrust laws. Setting minimum resale prices has been considered a per se violation since 1911, depriving consumers of competitive advantages. Imposition of maximum resale prices, or other agreements affecting price without specifying a level, has been analyzed under a more lenient Rule of Reason standard. Three key cases in the 1970s and 1980s made significant changes in the law of vertical restraints. The Continental T.V., Inc. v. GTE Sylvania Inc. case distinguished between price and non-price restraints, leading to a return to Rule of Reason analysis for non-price vertical restraints. The Court further clarified its stance on dealer-termination cases, defining the dividing line between permissible and impermissible practices. The Court clarified the dividing line between per se vertical price restraints and Rule of Reason non-price restraints in cases like Monsanto v. Spray-Rite Service Corp. and Business Electronics Corp. v. Sharp Electronics Corp. Per se illegality is reserved for restraints that include an agreement on price or price levels. In 1997, the Court imposed further delineations in the law of vertical restraints in State Oil Co. v. Khan, acknowledging the use of maximum RPM to disguise arrangements to fix minimum prices. The Court found the conceptual foundations of the per se treatment of maximum RPM to be gravely weakened and overruled Dr. Miles, allowing for Rule of Reason treatment of minimum RPM. Vertical retail-price agreements can have procompetitive or anticompetitive effects, depending on the circumstances. Justice Kennedy, along with Chief Justice Roberts and Justices Scalia, Thomas, and Alito, argued against adopting a per se rule for administrative convenience alone. They emphasized that antitrust laws are meant to protect interbrand competition, which can lead to lower prices. The Supreme Court decision on vertical retail-price agreements focused on protecting interbrand competition to promote lower prices. Justice Kennedy justified the abandonment of stare decisis in this case by highlighting the lesser compulsion of precedents involving the Sherman Act compared to statutory interpretation. Legislative changes should be left to Congress with less force regarding the Sherman Act, which evolves to meet modern economic conditions. Economic literature suggests the per se rule is not suitable for resale price maintenance. The Department of Justice and the FTC recommend assessing long-term impacts of RPM. The Court rejected the argument that Congress ratified the per se rule for vertical price restraints when repealing the authorization for state Fair Trade Laws. Congress did not codify the rule of per se illegality but instead rescinded provisions that made them per se legal, placing these restraints under the Sherman Act. Congress intended \u00a7 1 to allow courts to develop governing principles of law in the common-law tradition. The Leegin case was remanded to the 5th Circuit, which then remanded to the district court for proceedings consistent with the Supreme Court's opinion. The dissent, written by Justice Breyer and joined by Justices Stevens, Souter, and Ginsburg, disagreed with the majority's departure from stare decisis. They acknowledged that while the lawfulness of certain practices is typically determined under the Rule of Reason, there are practices with serious anticompetitive consequences or difficult-to-prove justifications that warrant a rule of per se unlawfulness. The dissent, led by Justice Breyer, questions the certainty of allowing economic discussions to inform antitrust analysis, emphasizing the need for clear rules and precedents in antitrust law. They raise concerns about the potential harms and benefits of Resale Price Maintenance (RPM) and the difficulty in separating beneficial practices from anticompetitive ones. The dissent emphasizes the importance of clear rules and precedents in antitrust law, questioning the certainty of allowing economic discussions to inform analysis. They argue that enacting legislation based on the per se rule of Resale Price Maintenance (RPM) constitutes significant public reliance on that rule. The dissent in the case argues against overturning Dr. Miles, citing reasons such as statutory interpretation and the long-standing precedent of the case. Justice Breyer dissents the decision to overrule Dr. Miles, arguing that it would unsettle the law, raise retail prices, and create legal turbulence. He believes that the per se rule associated with Dr. Miles should be maintained due to its considerable reliance and embedded nature in our national culture. Justice Breyer dissents the decision to overrule Dr. Miles, arguing that it would unsettle the law, raise retail prices, and create legal turbulence. He believes that maintaining the per se rule associated with Dr. Miles is important due to its considerable reliance and embedded nature in our national culture. The majority has not shown sufficient new conditions to warrant overruling a decision of such long standing."
