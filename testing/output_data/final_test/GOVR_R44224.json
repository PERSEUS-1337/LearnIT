    "content": "Medicare is a federal insurance program that covers health care services for individuals aged 65 and older and certain disabled persons. In 2015, it is expected to cover about 55 million people at a cost of $649 billion. Most individuals aged 65 and older receive premium-free Medicare Part A, with the option to enroll in Part B for additional coverage. Medicare Advantage (Part C) requires enrollment in both Part A and Part B, while Part D provides optional prescription drug coverage. Medicare Part B is financed through a combination of beneficiary premiums and funds from the U.S. Treasury. In 2015, Part B spending is estimated to reach $281 billion, with $70 billion expected to be paid by beneficiary premiums. Beneficiaries also have out-of-pocket costs, including a $147 annual deductible for Part B services and 20% coinsurance for Medicare-approved expenses. Additional coverage beyond Medicare helps with these costs. Additional coverage beyond Medicare, such as Medicaid, Medigap, or retiree coverage, helps pay for deductibles and coinsurance. Part B premiums are deducted from Social Security checks and must cover 25% of annual costs for aged beneficiaries. The Social Security Act includes a provision to prevent Part B premium increases from reducing Social Security benefit checks for most beneficiaries. This hold-harmless provision affects only a small fraction of beneficiaries in a typical year. In a year with Medicare Part B premium increases but no Social Security benefit increase, the hold-harmless provision has a larger impact. This report discusses Medicare Part B premiums, the relationship with Social Security COLA, and the potential impact of a projected 0% COLA in 2016 on Medicare premiums. Most Medicare Part B participants pay a standard premium of $104.90 per month, which can be adjusted for late enrollment and high-income beneficiaries. In 2015, the standard Medicare Part B premium is $104.90 per month, covering about 25% of the average per enrollee cost. Changes in the premium reflect the growth in total Part B expenditures, with costs not covered by premiums paid through transfers from the General Fund. Medicare beneficiaries receive a 75% subsidy for Part B, with all income credited to the Part B account of the SMI Trust Fund. Part B premiums are based on expected program costs for aged enrollees. The actuarial rate for aged and disabled enrollees is used to determine the needed amount of matching general revenue funding. Each year, CMS sets the Part B premium to cover 25% of expected expenditures for beneficiaries aged 65 and older. Contingency margin adjustments are made to accommodate potential variation in actual expenditures. The premium is set for the year and will not be changed during that year. For 2015, CMS estimated the monthly Part B premium for aged enrollees to be $104.90, based on projected costs. This amount includes a contingency adjustment and accounts for interest on trust fund assets. The premium covers 25% of expected expenditures for beneficiaries aged 65 and older. The contingency margin is set aside to cover cost variations, especially when Part B expenditures exceed projections. CMS adjusts premiums to account for potential legislative changes that could increase expenses, like the override of scheduled physician payment reductions. Certain payments are excluded from the contingency margin calculation, and additional revenues from drug manufacturers reduce the need for a higher margin. In 2015, adjustments to Medicare Part B premiums for high-income enrollees were implemented, with the income-related monthly adjustment amount (IRMAA) ranging from 35% to 80% of the standard premium. Individuals with incomes exceeding $85,000 and couples with incomes over $170,000 are subject to higher premium amounts. The contingency margin adjustment of $3.41 reflects the expected net effects of various factors, including additional revenues from drug manufacturers. High-income Medicare beneficiaries are subject to higher premium amounts based on income categories. The Social Security Administration uses the most recent federal tax return to determine eligibility for high-income premiums, based on modified adjusted gross income (MAGI). Taxable income increases, such as from property sales, are considered in determining future premium liabilities. High-income Medicare beneficiaries may request a more recent income determination in certain major life-changing events, such as death of a spouse, marriage, divorce, work stoppage, loss of income-producing property, or pension income reduction. Investment losses or events affecting expenses are not considered qualifying events. Medicare beneficiaries with limited income and assets may qualify for assistance with Part B premiums from state Medicaid programs. About one in five beneficiaries are eligible for this assistance, known as dual-eligibles. Full dual-eligibles have most of their healthcare expenses covered by Medicare or Medicaid, with Medicaid also providing coverage for services not covered by Medicare. Those who do not qualify for full Medicaid benefits may still receive assistance with Part B premiums if their income is less than 135% of the federal poverty level. Beneficiaries with limited income and assets may qualify for assistance with Part B premiums through Medicare Savings Programs (MSPs). Three MSPs provide coverage for Part B premiums: Qualified Medicare Beneficiaries (QMB) for those at or below the federal poverty level, Specified Low-Income Medicare Beneficiary (SLMB) for those with income between 100% and 120% of FPL, and assistance for individuals with income between 120% and 135% of FPL. In 2015, individuals with income between 120% and 135% of FPL may qualify for assistance as Qualifying Individuals (QIs) with monthly income limits of $1,345 for individuals and $1,813 for couples. The QI program is fully funded by the federal government from the Medicare SMI Trust Fund up to a state's allocation level. States are only required to cover a certain number of people to reach their allocation level, with any additional expenditures being voluntary and covered by the state. Late-enrollment penalties may apply for beneficiaries who do not sign up for Part B when first eligible. In 2014, approximately 1.4% of Part B enrollees paid a penalty for late enrollment, resulting in their total premiums being about 29% higher. The surcharge is calculated as a percentage of the monthly standard premium amount and is added to the beneficiary's premium each month. There is no upper limit on the surcharge amount, and it is recalculated each year based on the standard premium amount for that year. Part B premiums may be paid in various ways, including automatic deduction from Social Security or Railroad Retirement benefits. Some beneficiaries are exempt from late-enrollment penalties, such as working individuals with group coverage, military retirees, and those receiving premium assistance through an MSP. Premium surcharges increase with premium hikes each year. Premium payments for Medicare Part B can be deducted from Social Security, Railroad Retirement, or Civil Service Retirement benefits. Beneficiaries receiving state public assistance through an MSP have their premiums paid by their state Medicaid programs. Other options include payment by an employee, union, lodge, or through a group-billing arrangement with CMS. Those not covered by these methods must pay their premiums separately. Some individuals not covered by Social Security may still qualify for Medicare and must pay premiums directly to CMS. Medicare may bill enrollees every three months, and premiums can be paid by the enrollee or a third party. Nonpayment of premiums leads to termination of enrollment in Part B. Nonpayment of premiums results in termination of enrollment in the Part B program, with a grace period for direct payment. Social Security benefits are adjusted annually based on the Consumer Price Index, reflecting changes in prices of goods and services. The cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) is announced in the last quarter of each year and is payable in January of the following year. Since 1975, Social Security benefits have been adjusted annually based on the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W). If the CPI-W rises, benefits increase proportionately, but they do not decrease if the CPI-W falls. The lowest implemented COLA was 1.3% in 1987 and 1999, with no COLA in 2010 or 2011. For 2012-2015, retirees received COLAs ranging from 1.5% to 3.6%. Due to lower CPI-W averages in 2015, it is expected that there will be no COLA in 2016. The final numbers for the 2016 COLA will be released on October 15, 2015. The Medicare Trustees estimate that monthly beneficiary premiums may need to increase from $104.90 in 2015 to about $120.70 in 2016 due to projected Part B spending increases. Higher-than-expected Part B expenditures in 2015 were attributed to legislation enacted in 2014 and 2015, as well as increased utilization of Part B services. Premiums for some beneficiaries may be lower or higher than the estimated amount. The Medicare Trustees estimate that financing for 2015 should cover expected expenditures, but future funding may need to increase to restore the financial status of the Part B account. Higher-than-expected 2015 spending will impact future estimates and premiums for 2016. Trustees must maintain an adequate reserve fund in the Part B account of the SMI Trust Fund. The trustees aim for reserves of 17% of expected expenditures for Part B financing. Unexpected expenditures in 2015 will draw down on reserves, projected to represent 12% of 2016 costs. Financing for 2016 needs adjustment to rebuild reserves to 17%. Premiums may be adjusted to cover prior year shortfalls and future Part B spending is expected to accelerate. The Medicare Trustees project faster benefit spending growth over the next five years, with a 6.7% Part B average annual growth rate. Medicare spending growth is expected to increase due to greater utilization of care and higher payment rates driven by improved economic conditions. Most beneficiaries are protected by the hold-harmless provision in the SSA when the annual Social Security COLA is not sufficient to cover the standard Medicare Part B premium increase. The hold-harmless provision in the SSA protects most Medicare beneficiaries when the annual Social Security COLA is not enough to cover the standard Medicare Part B premium increase. This provision ensures that the Part B premium is reduced to prevent a decline in the individual's Social Security check. It was established in 1984 and made permanent in 1988 to limit the impact of Part B premium increases on Social Security benefits. The hold-harmless provision applies to Medicare beneficiaries who received Social Security benefit checks in December and January, with Part B premiums deducted. It ensures that their premiums are reduced if their net Social Security benefits would otherwise decline. Those not covered by the provision pay the standard premium. The hold-harmless provision primarily protects beneficiaries with low Social Security payments, especially in years without a COLA. However, high-income individuals and those whose Medicare premiums are not deducted from Social Security are not covered by this provision. The hold-harmless provision does not apply to certain groups, including those whose Medicare premiums are paid by someone else, individuals who do not receive Social Security, and those who receive benefits exclusively through a different retirement plan. Those excluded from the hold-harmless provision include federal retirees under the Civil Service Retirement System, state and local government workers with their own pension plans, new Social Security or Medicare enrollees, individuals who had Medicare premiums paid by Medicaid but lost coverage, and SSDI recipients with a 24-month waiting period for Medicare eligibility. Some beneficiaries protected by the hold-harmless provision may still face reduced Social Security checks due to higher Medicare Part D premiums. Late-enrollment penalties are not fully covered by the provision, as they are calculated based on nonstandard premiums. If there is no Social Security COLA and Medicare Part B premiums increase, like in 2010 and 2011, most Medicare beneficiaries are affected. The hold-harmless provision protects most Medicare beneficiaries from increased Part B premiums in certain years, like 2010 and 2011. It ensures that premiums for those not protected are higher to cover the costs. The provision also affects general revenue transfers and is required to maintain a balance in beneficiary contributions towards program costs. The hold-harmless provision in Medicare protects most beneficiaries from premium increases in certain years, leading to higher premiums for those not protected. This can reduce SMI Trust Fund income from premiums and general revenues, with beneficiaries not held harmless bearing the entire increase in Part B costs. The law does not specify how premiums and general revenues should be established in these years, potentially resulting in significant premium hikes for some beneficiaries. In 2010 and 2011, due to low inflation, Social Security benefits did not receive COLA adjustments. Most Medicare beneficiaries were protected by the hold-harmless provision, keeping their premiums at $96.40. However, those not protected saw their premiums increase to $110.50 to cover rising Part B costs. This led to equity issues as beneficiaries not held harmless bore the entire increase in Part B costs. In 2011, 27% of Medicare beneficiaries were not eligible for hold-harmless protection, with premiums increasing to $115.40. New enrollees accounted for 3%, high-income beneficiaries 5%, Medicaid covered 17%, and 2% did not have premiums withheld from Social Security. Actuarial rates in 2010 and 2011 included lost premium income from hold-harmless provision in aged rate calculations. In 2010 and 2011, contingency margins were added to actuarial rates for aged beneficiaries to offset lost premium income from hold-harmless provision. Without these adjustments, funding from premiums and general revenues would have been insufficient to cover expenditures. In 2012, when hold-harmless provision ended, the contingency margin was lower, and actuarial rates were reduced accordingly. Social Security beneficiaries received COLA increases in 2012 and 2013. In 2012 and 2013, Social Security beneficiaries received COLA increases of 3.6% and 1.7%, respectively, which covered Part B premium increases. In 2014 and 2015, with COLA increases of 1.5% and 1.7% and no change in Part B premiums, the hold-harmless provision did not apply. However, projected Part B spending increases may lead to beneficiary premium hikes to $120.70 per month in 2016, with no expected Social Security COLA. Most beneficiaries would be held harmless, keeping their premiums at the 2015 amount of $104.90 per month. In 2016, 30% of Medicare beneficiaries not held harmless would see their premiums increase to about $160 per month, while those held harmless would continue to pay $104.90 per month. The hold-harmless provision is expected to end in 2017, with standard premiums decreasing to around $120.70 per month. About 70% of Part B enrollees are expected to be held harmless for premium increases in 2016. In 2016, about 30% of disabled Medicare beneficiaries may see their Part B premiums increase to $160 per month, while 55% of disabled and 75% of aged beneficiaries would be held harmless, paying the same $104.90 per month. Not all beneficiaries are protected by the hold-harmless provision, including higher-income individuals and new enrollees in 2016. In 2016, some Medicare beneficiaries may see their Part B premiums increase, with potential premium hikes ranging from $54.40 to $174.10 per month based on income tiers. About 6% of Part B enrollees are expected to face income-related premium increases, with high-income individuals potentially seeing premiums go up to $509.80 per month. In 2016, high-income couples could face annual combined Medicare Part B premiums between $5,352 and $12,235.20. Approximately 19% of Part B enrollees have their premiums paid by Medicaid and would not be held harmless. Additionally, about 5% of beneficiaries are new to Medicare or Social Security and not protected by the hold-harmless provision. About 3% pay premiums directly to CMS and are also not held harmless. Late-enrollment penalties are determined as a percentage of the standard premium. In 2016, those subject to the late-enrollment penalty for Medicare Part B could see a significant increase in their penalty payments. For example, a 30% penalty could rise from $31.50 to close to $47.80 per month. This would be in addition to the standard premium of $104.90 for those held harmless and an estimated $159.30 for those not held harmless. The Part B Trust Fund will need $306.7 billion in income from premiums and revenue contributions in 2016 to cover expenses. Without a Social Security COLA, premiums must increase substantially for those not held harmless to prevent Trust Fund exhaustion. In 2016, Medicare Part B late-enrollment penalties could increase significantly. The Part B Trust Fund requires $306.7 billion in income to cover expenses. Without a Social Security COLA, premiums for those not held harmless must rise substantially to prevent Trust Fund exhaustion. Low-income beneficiaries who receive premium subsidies make up the majority of those not held harmless, with Medicaid covering their Part B premiums. If Congress reduces premiums for those not held harmless, additional funds would be needed to ensure the SMI Trust Fund remains solvent. In the absence of a Social Security COLA, Medicaid costs increase substantially, with states and the Treasury bearing the burden. One analysis suggests Medicaid spending would increase by $5.6 billion in 2016, with the state share at $2.3 billion. Higher premiums could limit Medicare beneficiaries' access to premium assistance through the Qualifying Individual program. In 2015, the QI program covered Part B premiums for 500,000 beneficiaries. The Part B deductible was $147 in 2015 and is estimated to increase to $223 in 2016 due to a 52% increase in the actuarial rate. In 2016, the Part B deductible is estimated to increase by 52% to $223. In 2017, deductibles are expected to decrease to $169. The increased deductible will impact most beneficiaries, including those with Medigap and retiree plans. The SSA does not specify how Medicare premiums are set in years with no Social Security COLA. The hold-harmless provision protects most beneficiaries from premium increases, but does not address those not covered under these circumstances. The SSA requires beneficiary premiums to be set at 25% of per capita costs, with revenue from general revenues based on the aggregate amount of premiums. Increasing premiums for those not held harmless is necessary to address revenue shortfalls caused by the hold-harmless provision. The Medicare Trustees have noted that this is the only method available under current law, as other approaches would require legislation. The interaction between Social Security benefits and Medicare premiums raises complex issues, especially for seniors with no Social Security COLA. Several bills introduced in the 111th Congress aimed to address issues related to Social Security and Medicare, including the impact of no Social Security COLA on seniors facing higher deductibles and the hold-harmless provision affecting Part B premiums. These bills proposed changes to provide COLA increases, one-time additional payments, and other adjustments to benefit seniors. Several bills introduced in the 114th Congress focused on creating a new inflation index, the Consumer Price Index for the Elderly (CPI-E), to better reflect seniors' expenses like housing and healthcare. H.R. 3351, the CPI-E Act, aimed to index Social Security COLA to this new measure. Additionally, bills in the 111th Congress addressed the impact of the hold-harmless provision on Medicare premiums due to no COLA in Social Security benefits, with proposals like H.R. 3631, the Medicare Premium Fairness Act, freezing 2010 Medicare Part B premiums at 2009 levels. The Premium Fairness Act aimed to freeze Medicare Part B premiums at 2009 levels for all enrollees. Other bills like the Medicare Prescription Drug Affordability Act of 2009 and Protecting Medicare Beneficiaries Act of 2015 also addressed premium levels and deductibles for Medicare beneficiaries. The 2015 standard premium and deductible for Medicare Part B would remain the same in 2016. The loss of income from keeping premiums flat would be balanced by increased general revenue contributions."
