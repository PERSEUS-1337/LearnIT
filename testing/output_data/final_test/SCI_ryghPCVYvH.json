It uses a shared representation of data from various views and can incorporate different types of models. A novel training procedure is proposed to update the network parameters by jointly learning features and shared representation. Experiments show the framework's potential through qualitative evaluation of generated samples. Various models based on a probabilistic framework with latent variables have been proposed, including Variational Auto-Encoders and Restricted Boltzmann Machines. Adversarial training models like Generative Adversarial Networks have also gained popularity. Auto-regressive models such as Pixel Recurrent Neural Networks model the conditional distribution of individual pixels. Each approach has its own advantages and disadvantages. Currently, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are considered state-of-the-art for generative modeling tasks, producing high-quality images but are challenging to train due to unstable dynamics. Different datasets contain various data representations or views, such as sounds, images, videos, etc. Utilizing information from all views together can enhance learning quality. Latent variable modeling aims to represent data with uncorrelated or independent components. Latent variable modeling aims to represent data with uncorrelated or independent components, such as Independent Component Analysis, Hidden Markov models, Probabilistic Principal Component Analysis, Gaussian-Process Latent variable model, and factor analysis. Disentangled variables contain interpretable information reflecting separate factors of variation in the data. A representation with statistically independent variables is considered a good starting point for disentanglement. In this work, a new generative mechanism called Generative RKM (Gen-RKM) is proposed based on Restricted Kernel Machines (RKMs). RKMs provide a representation of kernel methods linking Kernel PCA, LS-SVM, and RBMs. The framework has a non-probabilistic training procedure using eigenvalue decomposition for normalization. Suykens (2018) utilized the RKM framework to develop tensor-based multi-view classification models. Contributions include a novel multi-view generative model, methods for computing feature vector pre-images, and the flexibility to incorporate kernel-based and neural network models. The model is capable of generating high-quality images and shows potential on multi-view datasets. The Gen-RKM model utilizes the orthogonality of eigenvectors in the kernel matrix to learn uncorrelated latent variables, resembling a disentangled representation for generating data with specific characteristics. The paper discusses the training and generation mechanism for multiple data sources, incorporating kernel methods and neural networks through implicit and explicit feature maps. Experimental results on public datasets are presented, with conclusions and future directions in Section 6. Additional materials are provided in Appendix A. The Gen-RKM framework, detailed in Appendix A, consists of a training and generation phase similar to Energy-Based Models. The objective function captures dependencies between variables by assigning energies. The schematic representation is akin to Discriminative RBMs, with a latent space dimension analogous to hidden units in RBMs. The Gen-RKM framework involves a training objective function for generative RKM, modeling a common subspace between two data sources X and Y using feature maps and interconnection matrices. The training objective function for generative RKM involves unknown interaction matrices and latent variables modeling a common subspace between input spaces X and Y. Regularization parameters lead to stationary points of the objective function, involving an eigenvalue problem with kernel matrices and feature maps. Positive-definite kernel functions form elements of the kernel matrices. In this section, we derive equations for the generative mechanism of RKMs, which resemble energy-based models. Inference involves clamping observed variables and finding configurations that minimize energy. A centered kernel matrix can be obtained using a specific equation. The procedure can be extended to multiple data sources beyond X and Y. The generative mechanism of RKMs involves learning interconnection matrices U and V for multiple data sources. The objective function includes a regularization term on data sources and aims to generate reconstructed visible units or explore latent space. Stationary points of the objective function are characterized by generated feature vectors using U and V. To obtain generated data, inverse images of feature maps need to be computed. The objective of RKMs is to learn interconnection matrices U and V for multiple data sources, with a regularization term on data sources. To generate reconstructed visible units or explore latent space, inverse images of feature maps \u03c61(x) and \u03c62(y) need to be computed. Finding the pre-image is a challenging problem due to the high-dimensional feature space mapping by kernels. Various approximation techniques have been proposed to solve this issue, and explicit pre-image maps can also be defined. In section 3.2, parametric pre-image maps are defined and learned by minimizing the objective function. The next section elaborates on pre-image methods for cases where the feature map is known or unknown. Approximations are used when x may not exist, with techniques shown by Schreurs & Suykens (2018). The pre-images are obtained using the kernel-smoother method, with scaled similarities between data points and the number of closest points considered. In experiments, neural networks are used as feature maps and pre-image maps to minimize reconstruction errors. The network parameters are learned by minimizing the mean-squared error, with generated points in feature space computed from the subspace H. Different loss functions can be used based on the dataset. The combined training objective involves using a stabilized objective function with a regularization constant to control stability and reconstruction accuracy. This approach combines feature-selection and subspace learning in the same training procedure, with a connection to autoencoders. Gen-RKM minimizes the objective function towards zero by substituting solutions back into it. Gen-RKM, similar to an autoencoder, minimizes reconstruction error using kernel PCA as a denoiser. Interpreting kernel PCA within LS-SVM setting allows for one-class modeling with zero target value. Choosing a good feature map results in normally distributed latent variables, resembling the regularization term in VAE. Kernel PCA provides uncorrelated components in feature space. By designing a good kernel and using kernel PCA, a disentangled representation for images can be achieved, enhancing model interpretation. A novel algorithm called Gen-RKM combines kernel learning and generative models efficiently for training and evaluation on large datasets. The procedure involves feature selection, common-subspace learning, and pre-image map learning through an optimization process involving an eigendecomposition of the kernel matrix. The algorithm Gen-RKM combines kernel learning and generative models efficiently for training on large datasets. It involves feature selection, common-subspace learning, and pre-image map learning through an optimization process using eigenvectors of the kernel matrix. The Gen-RKM model combines kernel learning and generative models for training on various datasets like MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, CelebA, Dsprites, and Teapot. The algorithm involves feature selection, common-subspace learning, and pre-image map learning through an optimization process using eigenvectors of the kernel matrix. The experiments involved using implicit and parametric explicit feature maps with Gaussian kernel and deep neural networks on datasets like CIFAR-10, CelebA, Dsprites, and Teapot. Training with kernel methods includes constructing the kernel matrix and solving an eigenvalue problem, while explicit feature maps involve defining convolutional and fully connected neural networks. Architecture details are provided in Table 3 in the Appendix. The training procedure involves minimizing J c using the Adam optimizer, subdividing datasets into mini-batches, and updating the value of H. Qualitative examples show generated images using convolutional and transposed-convolutional neural networks. Reconstructed samples are visually of better quality than others, and random sampling from a GMM is also shown. Details on datasets and hyperparameters are provided in Table 4 in the Appendix. The model's performance is evaluated qualitatively by comparing reconstruction and random sampling, with results shown in Figure 8. Quantitative assessment is done using Fr\u00e9chet Inception Distance (FID), with results reported in Table 1. Experiments were conducted with different latent-space dimensions (h dim). The experiments in Table 1 show that FID scores are better for Gen-RKM with different latent-space dimensions. As the dimension increases, VAE generates smoother images but Gen-RKM's performance slightly decreases due to noise in the kernel matrix. It is crucial to select the number of latent variables based on the mini-batch size and kernel matrix spectrum. Multi-view generation is illustrated in Figures 3 & 4. The model's multi-view generative capabilities are demonstrated in Figures 3 & 4, where labels are treated as an additional view of the image. One-hot encoding of labels was used for training. The latent variables are uncorrelated, indicating a potentially disentangled representation. This is supported by empirical evidence in Figure 5, showing uncorrelated features learned on the Dsprites and celebA datasets. In experiments with Dsprites and celebA datasets, uncorrelated features learned by models were explored. The Dsprites dataset consisted of oval and heart-shaped objects, with 2 principal components chosen. Reconstructed images showed traversing along eigenvectors preserved object shapes. On celebA dataset, Gen-RKM was trained with 15 components, showing changes in hair color while preserving faces when moving along principal components. When comparing Gen-RKM with VAE and beta-VAE on Dsprites and Teapot datasets, the performance was measured using a proposed framework by Eastwood & Williams (2018). The reconstructed images in Gen-RKM were found to be more blurry due to selecting fewer components to model H. The two largest variances in the dataset corresponded to brightness and background light-source when 2 principal components were used during training. Gen-RKM outperforms VAE and beta-VAE on Dsprites and Teapot datasets based on disentanglement, completeness, and informativeness measures. Gen-RKM shows good performance with a latent space dimension of 2 for Dsprites, capturing the 2 generating factors effectively. For Teapot, a latent space dimension of 10 is more suitable to capture all variations with 5 generating factors. Overall, Gen-RKM's performance is comparable to other methods. The paper introduces Gen-RKM, a novel framework for generative models based on RKMs with extensions to multi-view generation and learning uncorrelated representations. It allows for defining the feature map using kernel functions or neural networks. Training involves solving an eigenvalue problem with kernel functions or using (transposed) networks for explicit feature mapping. The proposed training procedure includes joint feature-selection and subspace learning, scalable to large datasets. Experiments demonstrate the framework's effectiveness for generation quality and disentanglement on benchmark datasets. The proposed Gen-RKM framework demonstrates its effectiveness for generation quality and disentanglement. Extensions include adapting the model to multi-view datasets involving speech, images, and texts, as well as further analysis on feature maps, pre-image methods, loss-functions, and uncorrelated feature learning. The framework suggests new research directions worth exploring. The Gen-RKM training objective function is derived using Eq. 12, leading to an eigen-decomposition problem for the covariance matrix. The latent variables h i can be computed through matrix multiplications. Stabilizing the objective function involves proving propositions regarding stationary solutions and smooth functions. The stationary points of the objective function J(x) are obtained when the gradient is zero. Stabilizing the objective function involves ensuring it is bounded for minimization with Gradient-descent methods. The kernel matrix is centered using a specific equation. The kernel matrix is centered using a specific equation, and details on model architectures, datasets, and hyperparameters are provided in Table 3 and 4. The PyTorch library in Python was used with an 8GB NVIDIA QUADRO P4000 GPU for random generation in CelebA. Comparison between Gen-RKM and standard VAE for reconstruction and generation quality is shown in Figure 8, with original and reconstructed images displayed for MNIST and CelebA datasets."
