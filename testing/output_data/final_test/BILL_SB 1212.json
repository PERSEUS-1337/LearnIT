    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature establishes the act to expand 2-1-1 services statewide in California to enhance disaster preparedness and provide access to community services. 2-1-1 is a free, accessible, 24/7 telephone number offering information on health services, crisis intervention, and disaster response. 2-1-1 service is a crucial resource during emergencies, providing information on health and human services, rent assistance, employment opportunities, and support for various needs. It reduces nonemergency calls to 9-1-1, allowing emergency responders to focus on life-threatening situations. The 2-1-1 service call centers are crucial during emergencies, staffed with specialists who provide information on health and human services. They can answer calls in over 150 languages and aim to expand services to rural counties in California lacking access. The Legislature intends to support the expansion and create a statewide database for comprehensive information and referrals. The Legislature aims to enhance access to disaster preparedness information through a 2-1-1 telephone service. The Public Utilities Code will be amended to provide discounted rates for schools, colleges, libraries, hospitals, and community organizations to promote universal service. The California Teleconnect Fund Administrative Committee advises the commission on providing discounted rates for qualifying schools, colleges, libraries, hospitals, and community organizations to promote universal service. The California Teleconnect Fund Administrative Committee advises the commission on providing discounted rates for qualifying entities. Revenues collected by telephone corporations for the program are submitted to the commission and transferred to the Controller for deposit. Moneys from the fund are used exclusively by the commission for program costs. The California Teleconnect Fund Administrative Committee Fund in the Budget Act of 2003 is subject to Section 16320 of the Government Code. The commission must notify the Director of Finance if there is a need for funds from the fund. Rates for the program cannot be increased while funds are outstanding unless specific conditions are met. The Director of Finance must repay any loan from the California Teleconnect Fund Administrative Committee Fund within 30 days of notification by the commission. The commission must notify the Director of Finance and the Chairperson of the Joint Legislative Budget Committee 30 days in advance of any intended rate increase to fund the program.

The commission may expend up to $1,500,000 from the California Teleconnect Fund for one-time costs to help close 2-1-1 service gaps in counties lacking access to disaster preparedness services. 2-1-1 California, as the lead agency, can apply for these funds in counties without 2-1-1 service. The California Teleconnect Fund can be used to close 2-1-1 service gaps in counties for disaster preparedness services, including implementing a coordinated database for referrals.
