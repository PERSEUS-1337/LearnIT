    "content": "Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, government-sponsored enterprises, were placed under government conservatorship in 2008. Congress established the conforming loan limit in 1980, starting at $93,750 for a single-family home with annual increases tied to a housing price index. This limit dictates the maximum mortgage value the GSEs can purchase. The conforming loan limit is the maximum value of a mortgage that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac can purchase. It was initially set higher than the national average home price and has remained higher with indexation. In 2008, temporary higher limits were created in high-cost areas based on median house prices. The 2009 ARRA made changes to high-cost area loan limits, with the expiration of the 2011 Appropriations Act, the limit is now determined by the 2008 HERA, resulting in a high-cost limit of $625,500. A study showed that if HERA limits had applied in 2010, 1.3% of eligible mortgages would not have been purchased by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act of 2012 set the high-cost limit for FHA-insured mortgages at 125% of area median house price, not to exceed $729,750. Most recent home purchase mortgages are guaranteed by FHA and securitized by Ginnie Mae, while Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac mostly purchase refinanced mortgages. Since 2008, Congress has adjusted the conforming loan limit five times, with the first bill being ESA, which temporarily increased the limit. The 2008 conforming loan limits were based on either $417,000 or 125% of the area median home price, not exceeding $729,750. HERA later removed the single conforming loan limit for the contiguous 48 states, with higher limits in high-cost metropolitan statistical areas. The conforming loan limit for high-cost areas was adjusted under HERA, setting it at 115% of the median home price with a cap at 150% of the statutory limit. After the temporary limits expired in 2008, GSEs could purchase high-cost conforming loans. ARRA returned the limit for 2009 mortgages in high-cost areas to 175% of the statutory limit or $729,750. FHFA was authorized to create subareas for regulation. The FHFA, regulator and conservator of the GSEs, has not created subarea limits. The ESA limits applied to mortgages in 2010 and 2011 but not in 2012. Current conforming loan limits are set by HERA. Some areas now follow the nationwide limit, previously considered high-cost areas. The GSE subsidy benefits are not evenly distributed due to high-cost housing areas. Fannie and Freddie can borrow at lower rates, passing on some of the subsidy to home buyers. In 2003, they purchased 35.1% of all mortgages nationwide, varying by state. In high-cost areas, their operations are limited by conforming loan limits. Prior to the recent recession, there was a large secondary market for jumbo mortgage loans, with a securitization rate of 45.6%. Conforming mortgage loans have lower interest rates than nonconforming loans, with a spread between them ranging from 18-60 basis points. The spread between conforming and nonconforming mortgage loans ranges from 18-60 basis points. Factors such as property price volatility and limited economies of scale in the jumbo market contribute to this spread. Estimates vary on how much of the spread is due to the GSE subsidy, with some suggesting as low as 4 basis points. The impact of allowing GSEs into the jumbo market on the spread remains uncertain. Increasing the conforming loan limit could potentially lead to savings for borrowers, with estimates suggesting savings of around $10,750 over a 10-year mortgage period if interest rates decrease. Even a small decrease in interest rates could result in savings of about $4,400 over the same period. This could also stimulate the jumbo mortgage market, providing a boost to the housing sector and the economy. The jumbo mortgage market is facing tight credit conditions with widened spreads between jumbo and conforming loan rates. Since 2007, the market for private, non-GSE mortgage-backed securities has disappeared due to investor reluctance to accept risks without GSE guarantees. Non-conforming loans are more expensive because lenders must hold the loans on their books without a secondary market for jumbo loans. Allowing GSEs to securitize some jumbo loans has restored liquidity to the secondary market. Some jumbo loans restored liquidity to the secondary market, enabled risk transfer for lenders, and increased affordability. Government support for GSEs reduces risk for jumbo loans. Non-GSE MBS issuance has slightly increased. The case for a higher conforming loan limit is based on equity concerns due to uneven geographical distribution of benefits. In high-cost areas like San Francisco or New York City, a large proportion of real estate transactions exceed the current limit of $417,000. However, raising the limit may primarily benefit mortgage holders with high incomes, potentially having a minor impact on fostering home ownership. The non-conforming jumbo home market is currently dormant due to high perceptions of risk, making lenders and MBS investors more cautious. GSE entry into the jumbo market could reassure MBS buyers and encourage lenders to offer more affordable rates, but it would shift the risk to taxpayers. The GSEs have lost billions of dollars and rely on federal support due to rising foreclosures. The impact on taxpayers is uncertain. Some suggest raising conforming loan limits to prevent further damage to the housing market, while others argue it could delay necessary market adjustments and create expectations of investor bailouts."
