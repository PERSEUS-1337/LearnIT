    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Humanitarian Assistance Facilitation Act of 2013\". It includes findings related to humanitarian assistance. The 2011-2012 drought in East Africa, exacerbated by stagnating agricultural development and terrorist obstruction of aid in Somalia, led to a preventable famine affecting 4 million Somalis. The famine resulted in 258,000 deaths between October 2010 and April 2012. The famine in East Africa from 2011-2012 caused 258,000 deaths, with over half being children under five. US humanitarian organizations need a license from OFAC to assist in al-Shabaab-controlled areas of Somalia. USAID has a specific license for operations in Somalia but only covers organizations funded by USAID, not independent ones. Prior to OFAC issuing USAID its license, no licenses for humanitarian assistance to the people of Somalia were issued before the United Nations declared a famine in al-Shabaab-controlled areas of Somalia. Organizations operating in al-Shabaab-controlled areas without a license may face prosecution for violating US law, especially concerning activities involving al-Shabaab. Executive orders have undone protections for humanitarian operations in Shabaab-controlled areas of Somalia, discouraging donors from contributing to aid efforts and preventing access to civilians. The executive orders have hindered humanitarian operations in Shabaab-controlled areas of Somalia, obstructing access to civilians and aid efforts, ultimately empowering terrorist organizations as the main providers of assistance. Congress believes that humanitarian organizations should not be hindered by Executive orders or counterterrorism laws from providing aid to civilian populations in humanitarian crises, like the famine in al-Shabaab-controlled areas of Somalia. Amendments to Section 203 of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act are proposed. Amendments to Section 203 of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act include an additional exception allowing donations to foreign persons subject to sanctions to relieve human suffering.

The person subject to US jurisdiction must provide subsequent notice to the Secretary of State summarizing their operations in connection with donating or providing goods or services. The person must also ensure they are not the subject of any publicly-available debarment, suspension, or Executive order that prohibits receiving funding from the US Government. Additionally, they must avoid engaging in any speech or communication with a foreign person subject to sanctions. The Act allows for the provision of goods or services to alleviate civilian suffering under sanctions, without prohibiting the export of standard goods or services necessary for such operations.
