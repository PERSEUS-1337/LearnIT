    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Endangered Salmon and Fisheries Predation Prevention Act\". It includes findings related to the protection of endangered salmon and fisheries. The Congress finds that there are 13 groups of salmon and steelhead listed as threatened or endangered species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 that migrate through the lower Columbia River. The people of the Northwest United States are united in their desire to restore healthy salmon and steelhead runs, as they are integral to the region's culture and economy. The Columbia River treaty tribes retain important rights with respect to salmon and steelhead. Federal, State, and tribal governments have spent billions of dollars to assist the recovery of Columbia River salmon and steelhead populations. One factor impacting salmonid populations is increased predation by marine mammals, including California sea lions. The population of California sea lions has increased 6-fold over the last 3 decades, with more than 1,000 sea lions foraging in the lower 145 miles of the Columbia River. The percentage of spring salmonid run eaten by sea lions at Bonneville Dam has increased 7-fold since 2002. Sea lions have been congregating near Bonneville Dam and entering fish ladders with greater frequency. The increased population of California sea lions in the Columbia River has led to a significant impact on the salmonid population. Efforts to deter sea lions from entering fish ladders near Bonneville Dam have been ineffective. A more expedited procedure is urgently needed to remove sea lions to protect threatened and endangered salmonids in the area. On December 21, 2010, the Pinniped-Fishery Interaction Task Force recommended removing more California sea lions in 2011. On August 18, 2011, Washington, Oregon, and Idaho requested lethal removal of sea lions impacting salmon recovery. On September 12, 2011, the National Marine Fisheries Service accepted the States' application for sea lion removal. The Pinniped-Fishery Interaction Task Force will consider States' application for permits under the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 to address concerns about pinniped predation impacting fish stocks other than salmonids. Testimony from State and tribal witnesses highlighted the need for timely action to control predatory behavior. The Act restricted control of predatory pinnipeds' impact to endangered salmonids only. SEC. 3. Taking of sea lions on the Columbia River and its tributaries to protect endangered and threatened species of salmon and other nonlisted fish species. Section 120 of the Marine Mammal Protection Act is amended to allow the Secretary to issue permits for the lethal removal of sea lions in the Columbia River and its tributaries to protect endangered and threatened species of salmon and other nonlisted fish species. An eligible entity can apply for a permit from the Secretary to lethally remove sea lions in the Columbia River to protect endangered fish species. The permit must be approved or denied within 30 days and is valid for up to one year, with a limit of 10 sea lions per permit. The permit allows for the removal of sea lions in the Columbia River to protect endangered fish species, with a limit of one percent of the annual potential biological removal level. Delegation of permit authority is allowed, and NEPA requirements are waived for permits issued within a 5-year period. The Secretary may suspend permit issuance if lethal removal authority is no longer needed to protect fish species from sea lion predation. The term 'eligible entity' includes various states and tribes. Permit holders are required to undergo training in wildlife management. Permit holders with lethal removal authority must undergo training in wildlife management. The Congress emphasizes the importance of preventing sea lion predation, recovering salmonid stocks, and avoiding future fish stock listings in the Columbia River. The Federal Government should fund both lethal and nonlethal measures for this purpose. Additionally, the Act does not impact any treaty or rights of federally recognized Indian tribes."
