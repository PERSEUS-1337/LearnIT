    "content": "The 112th Congress has been focusing on improving emergency communications, especially for first responders and 911 call centers. Pressure has increased for a comprehensive solution after the 10th anniversary of September 11, 2001. Despite common agreement on the need for action, a plan has not been agreed upon yet. The White House has shown support for allocating additional resources. The White House supports allocating additional radio frequency spectrum and funding for a new wireless public safety communications network, which has widespread support. Proposed federal funding has raised concerns about costs, but the FCC has suggested a public-private partnership to reduce costs by sharing network infrastructure with a commercial partner. This plan has received support from the commercial sector and policymakers who believe it will increase competition and lower costs for all users of wireless networks. The White House supports allocating additional radio frequency spectrum and funding for a new wireless public safety communications network, which has widespread support. Proposed federal funding has raised concerns about costs, but the FCC has suggested a public-private partnership to reduce costs by sharing network infrastructure with a commercial partner. Congress has faced challenges in reaching agreement on bills related to emergency communications goals. The curr_chunk discusses the evolution of emergency communications planning in the United States, highlighting the need for better coordination and interoperability among first responders. Federal agencies have played a role in assisting with technical expertise and funding for multi-jurisdictional and multi-disciplinary response efforts. The Public Safety Wireless Advisory Committee (PSWAC) was created to provide recommendations on first responders' communication needs. The committee's Final Report was significant in public safety communications planning. Post-9/11, concerns raised by PSWAC gained new attention. In 2003, a National Task Force on Interoperability revisited the report findings, emphasizing the need for infrastructure investment, more funding, better planning, coordination among agencies, and additional radio frequency spectrum allocation. In 2007, the Office of Emergency Communications (OEC) was established within the Department of Homeland Security to prepare a National Emergency Communications Plan. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) prepared the National Emergency Communications Plan (NECP) in 2008, while Congress required the National E9-1-1 Implementation Coordination Office (ICO) to develop a plan for Next Generation 911 (NG9-1-1). The FCC's 2010 National Broadband Plan also aimed to enhance public safety communications networks. These planning efforts involved various stakeholders, including key public safety associations. The FCC's broadband plan advocated deploying IP-enabled technologies for NG9-1-1 and wireless broadband networks for public safety radios. Planning efforts for emergency communications have been initiated by the FCC, favoring local planning over federal and regional authority. Larger cities and prosperous counties lead in deploying new communication systems, while smaller communities struggle with implementation due to lack of funds and personnel. The Department of Homeland Security encourages local communities to find their own emergency communications solutions within established frameworks. However, the autonomy in technology choices has led to incompatible equipment and inefficient markets. Proprietary technology tailored to specific needs has created a gap in technology available to first responders compared to commercial solutions. The future of emergency communications systems is expected to be local, national, and international in reach, with flexible applications tailored to any emergency situation. Technologies will be developed for common IP-enabled platforms, allowing for advanced services on IP-enabled wireless devices like LTE. This next generation of technology may change the patterns of the past 30 years in public safety radios and systems. The future of emergency communications systems is expected to be local, national, and international in reach, with technologies developed for common IP-enabled platforms. This next generation of technology may change the patterns of the past 30 years in public safety radios and systems, with a focus on governance, decision making, cost estimates, sources of revenue, spectrum management, and technology development. Congress may consider policy recommendations and legislative actions to expedite improvements in emergency communications across the country. Governance at the federal level involves evaluating programs, managing expenditures, and providing grants through various agencies. Currently, there are over 40 active grant programs administered by nine departments, including the Office of Emergency Communications, SAFECOM Program, and FEMA within DHS. These agencies formulate policies, plan exercises, and provide guidance for emergency communication grants. The Department of Justice's Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) program and Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant (JAG) program provide funds for emergency communications. The NTIA administers grants through the Broadband Technologies Opportunity Program (BTOP) for public safety communications and 911 services. The ENHANCE 911 Act of 2004 established a 911 grant program shared by NTIA and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. The Digital Transition and Public Safety Fund, created by the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005, provides less than $50 million for improving 911 services. The Digital Transition and Public Safety Fund, created by the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005, allocated approximately $13 billion in federal funding for emergency communications from FY2001 through FY2010. However, there is limited transparency on how this money was utilized. Oversight for investments in public safety communications systems is primarily at the community level, with federal audits lacking detailed information on the specific use of funds by recipients. The governance of emergency communications deployments involves managing partnerships between the commercial sector and state/local agencies. Public-private partnerships blend public and private governance methods, raising questions about the federal role in governance and funding. Continuous transfers of new commercial technologies to public safety agencies are suggested for maximizing innovation and cost-saving benefits. Federal grants for emergency communications projects have limitations in terms of efficiency due to their single-project focus and limited timeframe. There are other funding sources available for building and operating communication systems. The coordination of a nationwide network for first responders may be hindered by the rules attached to federal grants. Multiple federal agencies are involved in planning and decision-making guidance for state and local agencies, but there is little coordination among these programs. The DHS and FCC have authority to support public safety, including planning and implementing communication solutions. The Office of Emergency Communications within DHS manages statewide planning for interoperable communications. FEMA also participates in emergency communications planning. The FCC is mandated to promote safety through communication technologies. The FCC, along with other federal agencies like NTIA and NIST, oversee public safety planning and investments. The FCC created a Public Safety and Homeland Security Bureau in 2006 to consolidate programs for public safety, including the administration of public safety broadband frequencies at 700 MHz. Regional Planning Committees manage spectrum assignments for voice networks in the 700 MHz band. The Public Safety Communications Research program, a joint effort between NIST's Office of Law Enforcement Standards and the NTIA, works with state agencies to plan for public safety, homeland security, and emergency communications. Statewide Interoperability Coordinators (SWICs) administer Statewide Communication Interoperability Plans (SCIPs) that align with federal guidelines like the NECP. SCIPs are described as locally-driven plans to enhance emergency communications, promoting a coordinated practitioner-driven approach. Grants may be awarded directly to agencies for specific purposes. Planning and decision making for emergency communications equipment purchases at the county level is often based on approved equipment lists provided by the state or regional buyers cooperative. Funds and authority are typically dispersed according to the administrative structure of the county, city, or town. State officials generally manage communications coordination. The FCC advocates for a public-private partnership between public safety agencies and wireless carriers to share responsibility for planning and decision making for a national wireless communications network. This partnership aims to provide robust communication capabilities, information sharing, and interoperability for public safety needs. Sharing spectrum and network facilities with commercial users would benefit public safety through economies of scale and access to additional spectrum during emergencies. Building a network exclusively for public safety is favored due to current shortcomings in commercial wireless services. Public safety representatives express concerns about sharing authority with commercial partners. Policy makers' decisions on the network's number, location, and type will impact commercial participation. Most public safety representatives oppose sharing arrangements that allow commercial partners to dictate access to capacity. Partnerships with commercial entities for public safety spectrum resources are being considered, with different agencies envisioning various governance structures for a national network. The National Emergency Number Association proposed merging the Public Safety Broadband License with the D Block for commercial operators to develop public safety networks. The FCC required the creation of a not-for-profit corporation, the Public Safety Broadband Licensee (PSBL), to hold the license for spectrum assigned for public safety broadband. The PSBL works with commercial partners to develop a broadband network for public safety use. The FCC awarded the administration of the PSBL to the Public Safety Spectrum Trust (PSST) and created the Emergency Response Interoperability Center (ERIC) to implement standards for national emergency response. The FCC created the PSBL to hold the license for public safety broadband spectrum. The PSST and ERIC were tasked with implementing standards for national interoperability. Conditional waivers were provided for agencies to deploy broadband networks in the 700 MHz band. Spectrum management rights were transferred to jurisdictions, giving them decision-making authority and funding responsibility. The FCC, ERIC, and the PSST are key players in planning the PSBN. Future grants for the network must align with FCC's plans developed through ERIC. The FCC will have decision-making power depending on negotiations with stakeholders and congressional actions. Guidelines for commercial partnerships in the network should be established early in the planning process. The PSBL's role in negotiations with commercial partners and decision-making processes for the PSBN are unclear. The FCC may face pressure to share responsibilities with stakeholders, potentially impacting network efficiency. Building the network requires capital expenditures for infrastructure and ongoing expenses for software. The Public Safety Wireless Advisory Committee reported in 1996 that nonfederal public safety communications networks had an estimated value of $25 billion with a 15-year useful life. Recent reports from the National Emergency Management Association (NEMA) have highlighted interoperable communications expenditures. These expenditures cover software upgrades, maintenance, network operations, training, and other recurring costs for wireless communications infrastructure, including backhaul networks linking radio towers to communication backbones. In its biennial reports, NEMA highlighted the increasing costs of achieving nationwide interoperable communications. In 2006, states estimated a total cost of $7 billion, with an average expenditure of $160 million per state. By 2008, the estimated cost had risen to $12 billion, citing obstacles such as changing technologies, lack of cooperation, and resources. The 2010 report did not address interoperable communications. The FCC proposed a public-private partnership to build a public safety broadband network in 2008, with estimated costs ranging from $18 billion to $40 billion. The auction of the D Block, allocated for this purpose, failed, but in 2010, the FCC proposed a new auction with rules for sharing infrastructure with a separately funded Public Safety Broadband Network. The estimated costs to public safety were based on assumptions of shared infrastructure with commercial operators. The FCC proposed a public-private partnership to build a public safety broadband network in 2008, with estimated costs ranging from $18 billion to $40 billion. The new network would be data and video only, using LTE technology. The total present value of the capital expenses and ongoing costs for the network over the next ten years is approximately $12-16 billion, with $6.5 billion for capital expenditures. A stand-alone public safety network would cost $15.7 billion over 10 years, including investments in tower sites, backhaul, and operations centers. The estimated costs for a stand-alone network over 10 years range from $34.4 billion to $47.5 billion based on 44,800 cell sites. Costs may vary depending on the use of pre-existing public safety sites and the efficiency of network operations. Communication capabilities for emergency response are generally more expensive due to unique requirements and limited production runs in the industry. The FCC proposed a public-private partnership in 2008 with estimated costs of $18 billion to $40 billion for a public safety broadband network using LTE technology. The NPSTC Governing Board recommends a national network with seven core networks for public safety broadband to improve efficiency and reduce costs. They argue that a single nationwide network would be more cost-effective than a \"network of networks\" approach proposed by others. NPSTC believes that managing, maintaining, and upgrading one network will be the most cost-efficient option in the long term. Costs to manage and refresh a network over the long term will be the largest cost component regardless of configuration. Coordinating funding and system upgrades across multiple networks could lead to operability and interoperability issues. A cost analysis from Carnegie Mellon University presents scenarios for public safety communication networks, including voice-only, data-only, and voice and data options. Estimates are based on network traffic, capacity, and technical parameters to determine the number of cell sites needed for each network type. The cost analysis estimates the investment needed to deploy voice and data networks on public safety spectrum, with deployment costs of $11.1 billion for 10 MHz and $9.7 billion for 20 MHz in a public-private network. The analysis does not include costs for radios and is based on the number of cell sites required for each scenario. The White House has assumed an investment of $10 billion is needed to deploy a wireless broadband network for public safety using 20 MHz of dedicated spectrum. Wireless communications come through towers and switches linking them to telecommunications and Internet networks. As technology evolves, network support for wireless traffic is changing. Some states and communities have built their own links to backbone networks to supplement or replace network access through commercial carriers. IP-enabled public safety networks are being developed where commercial carriers are not providing service. IP-enabled public safety technologies are transitioning to networks designed to support NG9-1-1, emergency alerts, and wireless network backhaul. Studies estimate the cost of providing 911 services over a life cycle from 2009 to 2028, with cumulative investments ranging from $9.3 billion to $13.1 billion for acquisition and implementation, and $46.4 billion to $65.8 billion for operations and maintenance. The estimated costs for building a new NG9-1-1 network as a stand-alone network range from $8.7 billion to $9.1 billion in cumulative investment, and $51.1 billion to $49.2 billion in operating costs. States plan on sharing network infrastructure to reduce costs, with BTOP grants supporting the construction of multi-purpose broadband networks. Commercial partners are expected to lead and fund the development costs of radio technologies for the Public Safety Broadband License and the D Block frequencies. The participation of commercial carriers in developing crucial radio components for public safety is expected to lower the cost of radios to $500, compared to $3,000 for narrowband networks. The latest radios for public safety are estimated to cost between $4,000 to $6,000. There are debates about the feasibility of a broadband network carrying both data and voice traffic for public safety use. Most officials do not consider using existing 3G networks for LTE devices as a viable option. The FCC has found that proprietary technologies have hindered the development of public safety radios and interoperability. Some experts believe LTE solutions can be quickly adapted, while others think integrating voice and data will be slow. Public safety officials debate whether a single unified network can meet all their needs or if separate radios and networks are necessary. The House Committee on Energy and Commerce inquired about interoperability issues in public safety communications in 2010. In April 2011, questions were raised to the FCC regarding equipment vendors for the PSBN. Concerns included the impact of proprietary broadband technologies on costs, innovation in wireless technologies, and interoperability among networks provisioned by different vendors for public safety users. The FCC's response to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce in 2010 regarding interoperability issues in public safety communications focused on the waiver process for equipment vendors for the Public Safety Broadband Network (PSBN). The FCC emphasized the importance of technical interoperability nationwide, even with the use of proprietary technologies. Out of the 20 waiver recipients, only two had selected a vendor, and eight were in the process of identifying one. The FCC is working on rules to ensure interoperability, despite challenges with vendor selection. The FCC does not require competitive bidding for waiver recipients in vendor selection. Planning is based on a nationwide network by a single license-holder, while states seek waivers to build their own networks. Network availability is crucial for assured access, not ownership. Sharing infrastructure between public safety and commercial license-holders could reduce costs. The FCC proposes sharing infrastructure between public safety and commercial license-holders to lower costs and increase national availability. NPSTC suggests a nationwide public safety network with operational cores for public safety agencies to improve network availability and save costs. NENA proposes turning over network construction to the commercial sector, which could further reduce costs but may limit public safety access without strict capacity rules. Building multiple public safety broadband networks could increase costs and reduce available capacity due to coordination complexity. The network design choice is crucial for the network's effectiveness. The design choice for a nationwide public safety network is crucial for cost estimates and funding plans. States and localities need clarity on financial obligations for constructing and operating the network. Public safety agencies have multiple obligations to ensure emergency communications capabilities, with costs being a fraction of total obligations. Coordination of interoperable access and decision-making authority are key for a solid network design. The construction of a new nationwide public safety network requires significant investment from all participants. Federal financial support mainly comes from grants and congressionally directed funding, while other funding sources include state and local budgets, government bonds, private foundations, and revenue from fines and taxes. Local funds are often raised through community-supported efforts like bake sales and fund-raising drives. Many public safety agencies are considering partnerships with commercial network operators to generate revenue from public safety spectrum assets. The decision on how spectrum access will be divided among 65,000 agencies is still pending, with some seeking commercial partnerships for financial benefits. Commercial resources may include access to public safety spectrum in exchange for financial consideration. The value of spectrum access for public safety agencies depends on geographical coverage. Leased or shared spectrum in small communities may have little commercial value. Proceeds from commercial license auctions could be used for public safety communications expenses. Several proposals suggest using auction proceeds to fund public safety communications investments and operating costs. The government is considering creating a special fund to receive revenue from spectrum auctions for specific purposes, allowing grants administrators to borrow against future revenue for immediate grants. This would be a departure from current law where auction proceeds go directly to the Treasury. Past acts have established similar funds for specific purposes like the Digital Television Transition and Public Safety Fund and the Commercial Spectrum Enhancement Act. The Commercial Spectrum Enhancement Act established a Spectrum Relocation Fund to reimburse federal entities for moving costs. Current law prohibits the FCC from considering spectrum revenue in auctions, but high yields may be needed for grant programs. Congressional oversight may be necessary to maximize national spectrum asset value. The sale of radio frequency spectrum could increase federal funding for infrastructure, potentially shifting decision-making authority from states to federal agencies. States and localities may struggle to afford participation, prompting consideration of private sector investment. Spectrum allocation for public safety agencies influences technology, governance, and funding decisions. In the upper 700 MHz band, 24 MHz is allocated for public safety use, with 10 MHz designated for a new broadband network. The remaining 12 MHz is used for constructing narrowband networks for mission-critical voice communications. Construction of these voice networks is coordinated between states and counties, with counties and major cities responsible for building on the assigned spectrum. Figure 1 shows the frequencies assigned for public safety and adjacent commercial licenses in the upper 700 MHz band. The upper 700 MHz band allocates 24 MHz for public safety, with 10 MHz designated for a new broadband network. LTE technology is recommended for the new Public Safety Broadband Network, with coordination needed between public safety requirements and commercial LTE standards development. Other commercial licenses are in Bands A and B in the lower part of the band. Coordinating development of 700 MHz band standards among network participants can maximize benefits for public safety. Smartphone apps linking devices to emergency centers enable proactive participation in disaster response. The CrisisConnection Project tests crowd-sourced communications for emergency management. Kahn, from the Innovation Lab, leads a team developing a smartphone app for disaster reporting. Users can upload photos of damage with geo-location, names of survivors, and other details onto a map for emergency response coordination. The text discusses the importance of effective wireless communications for emergency response personnel and the potential use of LTE networks for a nationwide emergency communications grid. Effective spectrum management aims to create opportunities for innovative technologies in wireless communication. The evolution of public safety communications has lagged behind commercial and military sectors in receiving recent innovations. Congress has provided access to spectrum in the 700 MHz for public safety, allowing for increased network capacity and innovation in emergency communications technologies. Public safety agencies are also investing in infrastructure for other technologies on different frequency assignments. Public safety communications utilize various networks at different frequencies, including below 512 MHz, 700-800 MHz, and 4.9 GHz. These networks operate separately with different technologies and radios. The commercial sector is transitioning to IP-enabled networks like LTE, with plans for LTE Advanced to increase capacity and performance. LTE Advanced is expected to facilitate the transition to new technologies by phasing out older infrastructure more easily and cost-effectively. The push to IP-enabled technologies is expected to converge commercial, military, and emergency response technologies on interoperable platforms. Infrastructure, spectrum, and mobile devices will be shareable, with a focus on developing applications to meet mission needs. The military and public safety community are both transitioning to IP-enabled networks for communication, with the Department of Defense using the term internetwork for its Global Information Grid. The internetwork, also known as the Convergence Layer, facilitates transport and analysis of communications activity. The Link and Transport Layer provides entry and distribution links to services supported by the internetwork. An Emergency Communications Grid, similar to the military's GIG, uses a common IP-enabled network structure to connect with any IP-enabled system, network, or device. It can send emergency alerts, capture sensor information, manage the Smart Grid, and support response and recovery actions. The Emergency Communications Grid is a unified approach to ensure access and interoperability among various communication devices and applications. The United States Army is adapting commercial wireless technologies through the Multi-Access Cellular Extension (MACE) project to incorporate new technologies and faster data rates. The MACE project aims to integrate new technologies with military needs, supporting cellular communications over smart phones and links through cellular base stations to tactical systems. Mesh networking will be used to ensure seamless operation in WiFi/cellular environments. One smart phone app being tested is for mapping Improvised Explosive Device locations, allowing for better route planning. The MACE project integrates new technologies for military and public safety response. It identifies parallels between military and first responder deployments, emphasizing the need for robust communications technology. The U.S. military incorporates commercial technologies into existing tactical systems, while public safety lacks a similar system. The new narrowband and broadband networks for public safety will be incompatible with each other and with other networks for the foreseeable future. Only a small part of the existing public safety infrastructure is expected to be usable in the development of new networks at 700 MHz. Public safety agencies may need to use commercial infrastructure and technologies to improve service and reduce operating costs by moving to technologies that use Internet protocols. The transition to IP-enabled technologies in public safety communications presents opportunities to overcome barriers to change and reshape the command-and-control hierarchy of first responders. Access to these networks is crucial for incorporating new technologies and fostering innovation. The House of Representatives approved the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2011 to support these advancements. The Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2011 (H.R. 3630) was approved on December 13, 2011. It includes provisions from the Jumpstarting Opportunity with Broadband Spectrum (JOBS) Act of 2011. The focus of discussion in the conference committee is on extending payroll tax cuts and funding them. The Senate may include provisions from the American Jobs Act of 2011 and the Public Safety and Wireless Innovation Act in response to H.R. 3630. The overview of H.R. 3630, Title IV, includes \"Administration bills\" reflecting policies on public safety and spectrum. Possible paths for federal policy post-9/11 include state and local government involvement in planning and purchasing decisions. Technologies for public safety communications have evolved since 9/11. The Administration bills before Congress aim to support public safety agencies in transitioning to next-generation IP-enabled networks for more effective communication. This includes assigning licenses to a Public Safety Broadband Corporation and funding a nationwide network through loans and fee income. H.R. 3630 aims to provide federal leadership in developing a plan for interoperable broadband communications among states. A federally appointed Administrator would manage distribution of frequency assignments, with states assuming responsibility for building and operating their networks in partnership with the commercial sector. The federal government would provide funds for a matching grant program, while states would determine their own funding sources and could generate fee income through partnerships. Planning and implementation of public safety broadband networks are still in early stages. The development of broadband networks for public safety communications is in the early stages, with barriers such as incomplete technology, planning, coordination, governance, and funding. Proposed bills aim to address these issues by establishing planning and governance mechanisms, grants programs, and a not-for-profit corporation for a nationwide network. H.R. 3630 would create an Administrator and a Public Safety Communications Planning Board to oversee state systems' construction and operation. States would need to adhere to the requirements set by the act if they choose to build a network. The bills aim to establish broadband networks for public safety communications, requiring adherence to set requirements for using designated spectrum. They propose assigning additional radio frequency spectrum in the 700 MHz band for public safety use, combining existing licenses into a single license to be transferred by the FCC. The Administration bills suggest assigning the license to a new Public Safety Broadband Corporation, while H.R. 3630 would assign it to the Administrator of the National Public Safety Communications Plan. The Administration bills and H.R. 3630 propose assigning the broadband license for public safety communications to different entities. The license would be administered as a single, national license, with oversight by the Administrator. Public safety agencies are also building narrowband networks within the 700 MHz band for voice communications. The bills affirm the FCC's right to allow flexible use on these narrowband frequencies. The FCC would prepare reports on spectrum efficiency under S. 1549 and H.R. 2482, with different focuses. H.R. 3630 plans to auction narrowband and guard band frequencies for commercial use. H.R. 3630 proposes auctioning frequencies for public safety voice over broadband network. $1 billion from auction proceeds for state grant program to purchase radio equipment. Allows aggregation of public safety and commercial licenses, repurposing commercial spectrum for public safety use. Establishes Public Safety Broadband Corporation for managing spectrum licenses, national network construction, and administrative duties. Private, nonprofit corporation in DC with federal representatives on Board of Directors. The proposed legislation involves the appointment of nonfederal board members with specific expertise in public safety, technical, network, and financial fields. S. 1549 includes cybersecurity experience as a qualification. H.R. 3630 requires the NTIA to select an Administrator through a request for proposal process. The bill requires the NTIA to choose an Administrator through a request for proposal process to oversee the deployment of broadband communications for public safety. It also mandates the FCC to establish a Public Safety Communications Planning Board with federal and nonfederal members representing various interests. The FCC would have authority over the Administrator to ensure spectrum is used without interference. The bills specify powers and duties of the corporation for the public safety network, allowing it to incur debt. H.R. 3630 establishes limited powers for the Administrator to carry out requirements of the act and the Public Safety Communications Plan. State compliance with the plan for the network build-out, maintenance, and operation is required. The Administrator for the new public safety network would be funded through the Public Safety Trust Fund. Proposals for building out the network must include a timetable with coverage, service levels, and performance criteria. H.R. 2482 includes provisions for seeking commercial partners, while S. 1549 specifies construction of \"an Evolved Packet Core or Cores.\" H.R. 3630 (\u00a74221) mandates states to establish a State Public Safety Broadband Office for coordinating responsibilities with the Administrator and Public Safety Communications Planning Board. Each office must negotiate contracts with a commercial wireless services provider approved by the Administrator for building and operating a state public safety broadband network. The operation of a state public safety broadband communications network involves partnerships with commercial mobile service providers to meet requirements set by the Public Safety Communications Plan. Public-private partnerships allow commercial partners access to spectrum and network resources. Non-public safety entities can access the network on a secondary basis. The Administrator must ensure pre-emptive access for public safety users. Regional consortia are permitted, but construction, collaboration, or sharing of evolved packet cores is not required. Deployment standards may impact the Public Safety Communications Plan. The Public Safety Communications Plan requires state public safety broadband networks to be interconnected and interoperable. Administration bills aim to improve public safety users' ability to roam onto commercial networks and gain priority access in emergencies. H.R. 3630 (\u00a74202) prohibits public safety requirements applicable to commercial wireless providers. All bills establish a State and Local Implementation Fund and allow NTIA to borrow against future deposits. The Administration bills propose a State and Local Implementation Fund for connecting to the Public Safety Broadband Network, with matching grants for states and localities. NIST would assist in research and standards development for wireless public safety communications. States must adhere to deployment standards, including using commercial models and being backward-compatible with commercial services. The Administration bills propose funding for the Public Safety Broadband Corporation, with S. 1549 appropriating $50 million for start-up costs and H.R. 2482 authorizing loans without a specified amount. The bills require the corporation to collect various fees to cover expenses. H.R. 3630 would require the NTIA to advance up to $40 million to the Administrator, repayable from the Public Safety Trust Fund. Total payments from the fund would be $40 million. The State and Local Implementation Fund would receive $250 million under H.R. 2482; $200 million under S. 1549; and $100 million under H.R. 3630. Funds from auction proceeds for the Public Safety Broadband Network would total $11.75 billion under H.R. 2482 and $6.45 billion under S. 1549. H.R. 3630 would provide $4.96 billion from initial spectrum auction proceeds for grants to states to build their networks; up to $1.5 billion more might be provided if auction revenues exceed expectations. Research and development of new technology for public safety would receive $500 million under H.R. 2482 and $300 million under S. 1549. The 911 system needs modernization to meet user expectations, requiring investment in Next Generation 911 technologies. H.R. 2482 allocates $500 million for research and development, while S. 1549 allocates $300 million. H.R. 3630 does not have a comparable provision for this. The Next Generation 911 (NG9-1-1) technologies should incorporate Internet Protocol (IP) standards. H.R. 2482 and H.R. 3630 aim to expedite the transition to NG9-1-1 by requiring studies and connecting states building broadband networks to 911 call centers and NG9-1-1 networks. These bills also re-authorize the 9-1-1 Implementation Coordination Office. The 112th Congress proposed bills to improve emergency communications by transitioning public safety agencies to next-generation IP-enabled networks. S. 28, S. 1040, and H.R. 607 would involve the FCC in decision-making and planning for network construction, with S. 1040 and H.R. 607 also including DHS in planning efforts and grant responsibilities. The bills aim to assign the D Block license to the Public Safety Broadband Licensee for a new broadband network. The 112th Congress proposed bills to improve emergency communications by transitioning public safety agencies to next-generation networks. S. 911, H.R. 2482, S. 1549, and H.R. 12 would create a new corporation for nationwide network development, funded by auctioning spectrum licenses. These bills include the Public Safety Spectrum and Wireless Innovation Act, the Broadband for Public Safety Act of 2011, and the SPECTRUM Act. The Broadband for First Responders Act (H.R. 607) and the American Jobs Act of 2011, Title II, Subtitle H (S. 1549, Reid and H.R. 12, Larson) propose governance of a public safety broadband network shared by multiple agencies. S. 28 would establish an advisory board for FCC consultation, authorize annual appropriations through 2018 for the Emergency Response Interoperability Center, and assign NTIA to administer grants for network construction in consultation with the FCC. The FCC would oversee a maintenance and operation reimbursement fund, require annual status reports from license-holders, and mandate audits by the Comptroller General. The Broadband for First Responders Act (H.R. 607) and the American Jobs Act of 2011, Title II, Subtitle H (S. 1549, Reid and H.R. 12, Larson) propose governance of a public safety broadband network shared by multiple agencies. S. 28 would empower the FCC to ensure the deployment of the network, set standards for network build-out, establish requirements for rural areas, and determine spectrum license distribution. Revenue sources would include proceeds from spectrum auctions and fees from secondary users. The Broadband for First Responders Act and the American Jobs Act of 2011 propose governance of a public safety broadband network shared by multiple agencies. S. 28 would direct the FCC to reallocate the D Block to public safety use, establish rules for secondary access to licenses, and set requirements for public safety to access commercial spectrum and infrastructure. An antidiversion prohibition would ensure funds for public safety programs are spent according to FCC guidelines. The Broadband for First Responders Act proposes governance of a public safety broadband network shared by multiple agencies. S. 28 would direct the FCC to reallocate the D Block to public safety use, establish rules for secondary access to licenses, and set requirements for public safety to access commercial spectrum and infrastructure. The FCC would set technical and operational rules for the network and develop standards necessary to ensure interoperability, security, and functionality. The bill would extend auction authority to capture spectrum license auction revenues and give authority to the FCC to organize and conduct voluntary auctions. The FCC has requested authority to provide financial incentives to television broadcasters for repurposing spectrum holdings. S. 911 and H.R. 2482 propose creating a Public Safety Broadband Corporation for a nationwide interoperable network. The corporation's board would include federal and nonfederal members to deploy and operate the network according to the bills' provisions. The bills propose creating a Public Safety Trust Fund to support a nationwide interoperable network. The fund would receive proceeds from auctions of commercial spectrum licenses, with grants allocated to the Public Safety Broadband Corporation. A grant of $11.75 billion would be provided, with $10.5 billion for the radio network and $1.25 billion for technology development. A State and Local Implementation Fund of $250 million would be established to connect to the network, and the Corporation would generate revenue through fees for network use. The FCC would reallocate the D Block to public use.

The bills propose creating a Public Safety Broadband Corporation for a nationwide interoperable network. The board of directors would include key government officials. At least 15 MHz of spectrum would be made available for auction within a year. The bills propose creating a Public Safety Broadband Corporation with a board of directors including government officials and nonfederal members. A Public Safety Trust Fund would receive auction proceeds for commercial spectrum licenses, with funding of $6.45 billion allocated for the corporation. The bills propose creating a Public Safety Broadband Corporation with a board of directors to distribute grants for connecting to a nationwide network. The Corporation would develop revenue streams through collecting fees for network use. The FCC would reallocate the D Block for public safety entities and allow flexible use of narrowband spectrum. A Wireless Innovation Fund of up to $300 million would support public safety research. The FCC's auction authority would become permanent to capture spectrum license auction revenues. The bills propose making the FCC's auction authority permanent and authorizing incentive auctions. A $1 billion Incentive Auction Relocation Fund would be established. The NTIA must make 15 MHz of spectrum available within a year. The Broadband for Public Safety Act of 2011 would establish a governance structure for grants administration under DHS. The FCC would retain power over the Public Safety Broadband Corporation's roles and responsibilities. The bill S. 1040 aims to expand the Board of Directors of the PSBL by appointing representatives from over 40 associations and allowing for the election of additional members. States would need to submit deployment plans for a new network to DHS and the FCC for approval. Grants could be used for infrastructure improvements in the 700 MHz, 800 MHz, or 4.9 GHz bands. The OEC would provide guidance to grant recipients, and funds from spectrum license auctions would be allocated to the Construction and Maintenance and Operation Funds. The bill S. 1040 aims to allocate auction proceeds from designated auctions to different funds. The Construction Fund would receive the first $5.5 billion, the Maintenance and Operation Fund would get proceeds between $5.5 billion and $11 billion, and any revenue above $11 billion would go towards deficit reduction. Unspent money in the Construction Fund would be transferred to the Maintenance and Operation Fund. The FCC would reallocate the D Block for public safety use and assign the license to the PSBL for the construction of wireless broadband public safety networks. The bill S. 1040 aims to reallocate spectrum for public safety networks, allowing shared use with commercial users. The FCC would set rules for interoperability and prioritize public safety services. Public safety licenses between 170 MHz and 512 MHz would not be renewed, and a report on reallocating spectrum through auction would be submitted to Congress. The bill S. 1040 aims to reallocate spectrum for public safety networks, allowing shared use with commercial users. Within five years, a recommendation to transfer communications systems below 512 MHz to public safety licenses in the 700 MHz and 800 MHz bands must be provided to Congress. Federal law enforcement agency communications not on commercial networks must transfer to frequencies in the 700 MHz and 800 MHz bands within 10 years. Minimum requirements for the broadband network will be established by the FCC, with standards set by DHS and NIST. A report and order will be issued by the FCC, in consultation with DHS and NTIA. The FCC, in consultation with DHS and NTIA, would issue a report and order on using IP-enabled networks for interoperability. S. 1040 extends auction authority to FY2020 to capture spectrum license revenues. An auction of at least 15 MHz of contiguous spectrum is required within a year of enactment, with additional frequencies identified for auction by January 31, 2014. H.R. 607 expands the PSBL Board of Directors, mandates network plan reports to Congress, and requires audits by the Comptroller General. FCC will establish rules for public safety service providers. The FCC would establish rules for public safety service providers to construct and operate a network, with funds from spectrum license auctions deposited into Construction and Maintenance and Operation Funds. H.R. 607 would reallocate the D Block to public safety use and allow access to the broadband spectrum. The bill mandates the transition to networks operating on public safety frequencies in the 700 MHz and 800 MHz bands, with detailed plans required from the FCC and stakeholders. Technical and operational rules for the network would be set by the FCC, NIST, and others to ensure interoperability, security, and functionality. DHS and NIST would develop standards, and the FCC would issue a report on the use of IP-enabled networks for interoperability. H.R. 607 extends auction authority to capture spectrum license revenues. H.R. 607 extends auction authority to capture spectrum license revenues by potentially extending the FCC's authority to FY2021. Frequencies below 512 MHz used by public safety agencies may be reassigned for commercial auction, including spectrum at 420-440 MHz and 450-470 MHz. The bill encourages the FCC to reconfigure spectrum to increase the value of these bands, some of which are currently used for amateur radio. Additionally, the FCC might be given authority to establish incentive auctions with statutory protections for TV broadcasters participating in or affected by the auctions. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has proposed a public-private partnership to build a broadband network for public safety using commercial frequencies at 700 MHz. The FCC provided for two national licenses of 10 MHz each, with one assigned to a Public Safety Broadband Licensee (PSBL). This partnership aims to create a shared, national network for public safety and commercial use. The FCC's plan for a public-private partnership to build a broadband network for public safety using commercial frequencies at 700 MHz faced setbacks when the auction for the D Block license failed in 2008. This led to a reset in the planning process, prompting the FCC to seek input on restructuring the auction to meet public safety needs. The FCC's plan for a public-private partnership to build a broadband network for public safety using commercial frequencies at 700 MHz faced setbacks when the auction for the D Block license failed in 2008. This led to new suggestions on how to use the spectrum, with constraints from the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 requiring the auction of the D Block. Various proposals have been made to the FCC, sparking debates on alternative actions, including whether public safety or commercial interests will control decision-making. Possible agency or legislative actions may be needed to implement these proposals, such as auctioning the D Block to commercial interests or agreeing to new auction rules. The FCC may auction the D Block to commercial interests without obligations to share with public safety, potentially transferring auction proceeds to public safety. This approach aligns with the FCC's goal of a shared network benefiting both public safety and commercial interests. The FCC may auction the D Block to commercial interests without obligations to share with public safety. Congress could transfer auction proceeds to public safety through existing grants programs like the PSIC grant program or create new legislation for distribution. The D Block could be assigned to Public Safety Licensees or the Public Safety Broadband Licensee for a nationwide, interoperable broadband network for public safety. Assign the D Block frequencies to the Public Safety Broadband Licensee for a nationwide, interoperable broadband network. Congress may need to amend the law to enable this option. The Obama Administration's 2012 Budget endorses this approach, which includes spectrum license auctions for revenue. Alternatively, the D Block could be assigned to state, local, or regional network managers to collaborate with commercial partners on building and funding a shared network, ensuring nationwide interoperability. Combine the D Block with the existing public safety broadband license and award the license to a new not-for-profit corporation for building and administering the network. Funding would come from federal and private sector investment, with auction proceeds potentially going to public safety. Congress may need to amend legislation for funding and spectrum allocation. Congress may need to amend legislation to address investment in network infrastructure for public safety communications. Grants have been used for interoperability equipment, planning, and training. Congressional efforts have set guidelines and performance goals for public safety communications, leaving implementation decisions to federal agencies and state officials. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 and subsequent legislation aimed to improve communications interoperability in public safety networks, responding to recommendations from the 9/11 Commission. These laws provided the foundation for the Department of Homeland Security to develop a national strategy for interoperable networks. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 mandated the allocation of frequencies in the 700 MHz band for public safety, leading to the creation of the Public Safety National Coordination Committee by the FCC. The National Coordination Committee (NCC) was active from 1999 to 2003, with a Steering Committee from government, public safety, and telecommunications. They developed recommendations for the 700 MHz band, including interoperable channels. Regional Planning Committees (RPCs) manage these channels, with oversight from the FCC and the National Public Safety Telecommunications Council (NPSTC). The Homeland Security Act of 2002 instructed DHS to address public safety communication issues in emergency preparedness and critical infrastructure. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 instructed DHS to address public safety communication issues in emergency preparedness and critical infrastructure. The newly created DHS placed responsibility for interoperable communications within the Directorate for Science and Technology, focusing on standards and research for communications technology. SAFECOM, under the George W. Bush Administration, became the lead agency for coordinating federal programs for interoperability. The Office of Interoperability and Compatibility (OIC) was assigned by the Secretary of Homeland Security to prepare a national strategy for communications interoperability. This move was later ratified by Congress in the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act, which included improvements in communications capacity based on recommendations from the 9/11 Commission. Congress should support pending legislation for better communication systems. In 2001, Congress recommended expedited assignment of radio spectrum for public safety, establishment of signal corps units in high-risk urban areas, and federal funding for these units. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act amended the Homeland Security Act to prioritize interoperable capacity in high-risk areas. The Secretary of Homeland Security was required to collaborate with the FCC for this purpose. The Security Act required collaboration with the FCC, Secretary of Defense, and state/local authorities to establish minimum capabilities for government agencies and first responders. The Secretary of Homeland Security had to create trial programs in high-threat areas to improve interagency communications. The development process aimed to contribute to a national strategic plan and consult with the Secretary of Defense on standards and protocols. The Security Act mandated the development of test projects to review standards, equipment, and protocols for interoperable communications. Congress set program goals for the Department of Homeland Security, including establishing a national approach, coordinating with federal agencies, developing minimum capabilities, and prioritizing research and development. Funding requests for interoperable communications required an approved Interoperable Communications Plan. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 mandated an Interoperable Communications Plan for response providers, with criteria outlined in the act. It also recommended legislation to expedite spectrum release, addressed in P.L. 109-171. The act planned for spectrum release by February 18, 2009, created a fund for auction proceeds, and established a grant program of up to $1 billion for public safety agencies, administered by the NTIA. Congressional Budget Office projected $100 million for public safety grants in FY2007. The 109th Congress passed a bill requiring the public safety grants program to receive at least $1 billion by September 30, 2007. The NTIA transferred management of the program to DHS in February 2007, with an MOU outlining the administration of the Public Safety Interoperable Communications Grant Program. The Public Safety Interoperable Communications Grant Program was announced in July 2007 with $968,385,000 in funding for all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and U.S. Territories. States were required to submit project descriptions and meet grant guidelines, including having an approved Statewide Communication Interoperability Plan. Expenditure amounts are reported as states tap into their allocations. The PSIC grant program provided $968.4 million to states and territories for interoperable communications systems. An audit in 2010 showed that 31% of the funds had been drawn down. The need for such systems was highlighted by the destruction caused by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005. The DHS was criticized for its minimal response to congressional mandates for improving emergency communications systems after hurricanes. The Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act of 2006 reorganized FEMA, gave new powers, and addressed public safety communications. The 21st Century Emergency Communications Act of 2006 established the Office of Emergency Communications (OEC) and the position of Director to coordinate emergency communications planning at the state and regional level. This included working with Regional Administrators and creating Regional Emergency Communications Coordination (RECC) Working Groups. Other responsibilities included conducting outreach programs, providing technical assistance, and promoting the development of standard operating procedures for interoperability. The National Emergency Communications Plan (NECP) established nonproprietary standards for interoperability, developed a national communications plan, and reviewed grants. It included requirements for assessments, reports, and a feasibility study for a mobile communications capability. The plan aimed to improve emergency communications and interoperability but did not address network infrastructure for public safety communications. The DHS sponsored an Emergency Response Council (ERC) in 2007 to support interoperability in public safety communications. The ERC published guiding principles and agreements for a Nationwide Plan for Interoperable Communications. The council's role is to advocate for partnerships, design interoperable systems, educate policymakers, and allocate resources. In 2007, the DHS sponsored an Emergency Response Council (ERC) to support interoperability in public safety communications. The ERC published guiding principles and agreements for a Nationwide Plan for Interoperable Communications. Congress directed the OEC to coordinate with FEMA's Regional Emergency Communication Coordination (RECC) Working Groups to establish a platform for coordinating emergency communications plans among states. Plans for forming RECCs were announced in December 2007, with organization charts developed in 2008. A National RECC Coordinator was appointed, and plans were made to appoint administrators for each region. The key proposal for the RECC structure is to serve as a single Federal emergency communications coordination point for interaction with State, local, and tribal governments. The Regional Emergency Communication Coordination (RECC) Working Groups were formed in response to requests from the public safety community to expand interoperable communications planning. While Congress emphasized assisting first responders, the RECCs are not limited in setting more inclusive goals. Currently, they primarily serve as a forum for FEMA's Disaster Operations Directorate to relay guidelines and orders. The focus of the RECCs, as outlined in the National Emergency Communications Plan, is to assist first responders in preparing for disaster response. Leadership will be provided by FEMA, and governance will follow the chain-of-command of the agencies' directorates. Nonfederal members of the RECC include first responders. The Regional Emergency Communication Coordination (RECC) Working Groups include first responders, state and local officials, emergency managers, and 911 call centers. They coordinate with various communication providers, hospitals, utilities, and other relevant entities. The National Emergency Communications Plan (NECP) sets goals for interoperability, aiming for 90% of designated areas to demonstrate response-level emergency communications by 2010. The goal is to improve emergency communications for first responders by achieving response-level communication within one hour for routine events and within three hours for significant incidents by 2013. This effort is coordinated through FEMA's Regional Emergency Communications Coordination Working Group, with seven objectives focused on organization and coordination."
