Qualified natural gas production includes domestic crude oil from marginal or new wells, with limitations on production amounts to qualify for the credit.

Proportionate reductions apply for short taxable years or wells not in production for the entire year. The tax credit for qualified natural gas production includes reductions for crude oil produced from marginal wells, which are domestic wells with production treated as marginal under specific criteria. The limitations for marginal wells are proportionately reduced based on the number of days in production compared to the total days in the taxable year. The term 'barrel equivalent' refers to a conversion ratio of 6,000 cubic feet of natural gas to 1 barrel of crude oil for wells with average daily production not exceeding 25 barrel equivalents and producing water at a rate of at least 95 percent of total well effluent. The definition of 'new well' applies to domestic wells drilled after December 31, 1994, and terms like 'crude oil', 'natural gas', 'domestic', and 'barrel' are defined as per section 613A(e). The tax credit for crude oil and natural gas production is determined based on the taxpayer's revenue interest in the production compared to all operating interest owners. The credit can only be claimed on production attributable to the holder of an operating interest as defined in section 614(d).
