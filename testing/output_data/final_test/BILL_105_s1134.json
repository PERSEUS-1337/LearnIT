    "content": "The consent of Congress is given to an interstate forest fire protection compact known as the Northwest Wildland Fire Protection Agreement. This agreement is between State, Provincial, and Territorial wildland fire protection agencies. The Northwest Wildland Fire Protection Agreement aims to promote effective prevention, presuppression, and control of forest fires in the region by providing mutual aid and establishing procedures in operating plans. The agreement becomes effective when ratified by two or more Members from specific states and provinces, with the possibility for contiguous territories to join with unanimous approval. Article III outlines the role of Members in enhancing prevention, presuppression, and control of forest fires, coordinating plans and aid, and developing cooperative operating plans. Article IV states that a majority of Members is needed for decision-making, with motions carried by a simple majority. Each Member has one vote. Article V highlights the agreement among Members to provide aid in controlling wildland fires. Whenever a Member's forces are assisting another Member under the Agreement, the employees operate under the direction of the receiving Member's officers and have the same privileges and immunities. Members providing aid are not liable for any actions or equipment use, and the receiving Member agrees to indemnify them as per its laws. The assisting Member will be reimbursed for any loss, damage, or expenses incurred while providing aid. Personnel are considered employees of the sending Member for compensation purposes. The Members will provide compensation to injured employees and death benefits to representatives of deceased employees who were injured or killed while rendering aid to another Member. Procedures for claims and reimbursement will be formulated by the Members. Article VII outlines the allocation of costs among Members, the requirement to maintain accurate financial records, and the acceptance of donations and grants. Members are expected to share expenses equally, keep detailed financial records open for inspection, and can receive donations subject to regulations. Article VIII states that this Agreement does not limit any Member's powers to prevent, control, and extinguish wildland fires or enforce laws for this purpose. It also does not impact existing or future Cooperative Agreements between Members and their Federal agencies. Article IX outlines the process for requesting the United States Forest Service to coordinate the Northwest Wildland Fire Protection Agreement. Members will have an annual meeting to review and modify the Agreement as needed. Amendments can be made by a simple majority vote. Article X states that the Agreement remains in force until a Member withdraws, with a 60-day notice period. Article XI of the Agreement states that no Member is obligated to provide funds beyond what is approved by legislative action. Other states can join the compact with Congress' consent. The right to change or repeal the Act is reserved."
