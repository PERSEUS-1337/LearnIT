    "content": "In 1891, Congress established the U.S. Courts of Appeals, known as \"circuit courts,\" to hear appeals from federal district courts and agency regulations. The circuit courts are the last avenue of judicial review before the Supreme Court. There are 11 numbered circuit courts covering federal judicial districts in the 50 states and U.S. territories, with the D.C. Circuit and Federal Circuit having specialized jurisdictions. The Ninth Circuit is the largest in geography, population, and appeals filings. The Ninth Circuit is the largest in geography, population, and appeals filings. Recent proposals to split the Ninth Circuit have sparked debate, with opponents arguing that it should remain intact to protect judicial independence. The debate focuses on geography, population, judgeships, caseloads, case disposal speed, and cost implications. House and Senate bills introduced during the 109th Congress propose splitting the circuit, with potential impacts being analyzed. The debate over splitting the Ninth Circuit into two or more circuits has been ongoing for decades. Two commissions, the \"Hruska Commission\" in 1973 and the \"White Commission\" in 1998, reached different conclusions on the matter. The Hruska Commission recommended dividing the Ninth Circuit, while the White Commission recommended against it, proposing instead to create three autonomous divisions within the circuit. Since the 1970s, there has been a debate on splitting the Ninth Circuit into multiple circuits. The Hruska Commission recommended division, while the White Commission suggested creating three autonomous divisions within the circuit. Various bills have been introduced in Congress to split the Ninth Circuit, with one bill passing the House in 2004 but not the Senate. In the 109th Congress, multiple bills were introduced proposing a split. The Federal Judgeship and Administrative Efficiency Act of 2005, sponsored by Representative James Sensenbrenner, aimed to split the Ninth Circuit into proposed new Ninth and Twelfth Circuits. However, the language was dropped from the budget reconciliation bill during conference negotiations. Multiple bills in the Senate and House proposed splitting the Ninth Circuit, with H.R. 4093 and S. 1845 receiving the most attention during the first session of the 109th Congress. During the first session of the 109th Congress, H.R. 4093 and S. 1845 were the focus of attention regarding the proposed split of the Ninth Circuit. The Senate Judiciary Committee held a hearing on S. 1845, with discussions on whether to divide the Ninth Circuit into two or three new circuits. Various bills were introduced, including H.R. 3125 and H.R. 4093, each proposing different approaches to the division. The proposed bills (H.R. 3125, H.R. 4093, S. 1296, S. 1845) aim to split the Ninth Circuit into two circuits: the new Ninth and the Twelfth, with specific geographic boundaries. The new Ninth Circuit would include California, Guam, Hawaii, and the Northern Mariana Islands, while the Twelfth Circuit would include Alaska, Arizona, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Oregon, and Washington. The bills also specify where the reorganized courts would meet and be headquartered. The proposed bills aim to split the Ninth Circuit into two circuits: the new Ninth and the Twelfth. Different bills propose varying arrangements for the new circuits, specifying meeting locations and potential headquarters. Some bills suggest the new Ninth Circuit meeting in Honolulu, Pasadena, and San Francisco, while others propose the Twelfth Circuit meeting in Phoenix, Portland, and Missoula. Headquarters locations are also specified in some bills, with one bill proposing the Twelfth Circuit headquarters in Phoenix. H.R. 212 proposes creating a new Ninth Circuit with Arizona, California, and Nevada, and a Twelfth Circuit with Alaska, Guam, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Northern Mariana Islands, Oregon, and Washington. The Ninth Circuit would meet in Pasadena, Phoenix, and San Francisco, while the Twelfth Circuit would meet in Portland and Seattle. Other bills suggest dividing the current Ninth Circuit into three circuits, with different states included in each. The proposal to split the Ninth Circuit into multiple circuits has been a topic of debate in Congress. Different bills suggest creating a new Ninth Circuit with Arizona, California, and Nevada, and a Twelfth Circuit with other states. There is discussion about where these circuits would meet, with some bills proposing locations in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Portland, and Seattle. Senators have shown support for both two-way and three-way splits, with the focus generally on splitting the current Ninth Circuit into two circuits. The debate over splitting the Ninth Circuit focuses on geography, judgeships, caseloads, case disposal speed, cost, en banc procedures, and rulings. Proponents argue the court is too big to operate effectively, while opponents claim it delivers justice effectively and provides legal continuity for the western US. They also argue that splitting the court is a way to eliminate its liberal reputation. Proponents deny this, stating that effective judicial administration is the main concern. Opponents of splitting the Ninth Circuit argue that the court handles its appeals well with professional case management and innovative practices. They believe duplicating staff and administrative functions in a reorganized circuit would be costly and unnecessary. Supporters of a split claim the Ninth Circuit is overworked and reducing its caseload by dividing the circuit is necessary. Supporters of splitting the Ninth Circuit argue that reducing the circuit's caseload by dividing it falls within Congress's responsibility to manage the federal courts. They believe that adding new judgeships would allow for more effective case management and timely access to justice. Additionally, they argue that the Ninth Circuit's current administrative innovations are only a short-term solution to a long-term problem. The debate over splitting the circuit often revolves around the efficiency of the court, although there is no universally accepted definition of \"efficiency\" in this context. The Ninth Circuit's geography and population are controversial due to its large area and dominance of cases from California. With over 58 million people in its jurisdiction in 2004, it surpasses all other federal circuits in both land area and population. Split proponents argue that reducing the Ninth Circuit's population could improve judicial administration. The Ninth Circuit's population and geography are contentious issues. Proponents of splitting the circuit argue that reducing its population could improve judicial administration. However, opponents believe that the large geography is crucial for maintaining a unified legal voice for the western United States. Senator Dianne Feinstein, a Judiciary Committee member, opposes a split, emphasizing the importance of uniformity in law across western states. Judge Diarmuid O'Scannlain, supporting a split, highlights the need for change. Judge Diarmuid O'Scannlain argues against the need for a unified legal voice for the West and Pacific Coast, stating that the Atlantic Coast has five separate circuits. Currently, there are 167 authorized judgeships for the 11 numbered circuits and the D.C. Circuit, filled with full-time, active judges. Temporary judges and senior judges also assist in handling judicial business. Temporary judgeships are filled by additional appointments, temporarily increasing the number of judgeships for a specific circuit or district. The Ninth Circuit has 28 authorized circuit judgeships, with two vacancies. There are also 23 senior judges assigned to the circuit, making a total of 49 judges currently serving. Senior judges are not included in caseload estimates. In FY2005, the Ninth Circuit led the nation in appellate filings, accounting for 21-27% of the nation's workload. Appeals filings for the Ninth Circuit increased by 75.3% between FY2000 and FY2005, while other circuits saw a smaller increase of 15.1%. The Ninth Circuit continues to have a large workload, with 15,953 appeals filed, 13,590 appeals terminated, and 17,262 appeals pending in the one-year period ending March 31, 2006. The Eleventh Circuit had the highest caseload in the nation in FY2005, with 644.3 filed appeals per authorized judgeship, followed by the Ninth Circuit with 572.8 appeals filed per authorized judgeship. The Ninth Circuit has a high workload, with 572.8 appeals filed per authorized judgeship. The Second Circuit and Fifth Circuit follow closely behind. In 2005, the Judicial Conference recommended the Ninth Circuit receive additional judgeships. Bills proposing to split the Ninth Circuit in the 109th Congress align with this recommendation. Bills introduced during the 109th Congress propose to split the Ninth Circuit, with differences in how judgeships would be allocated to new circuits. Most bills suggest a two-way split, with 19 judgeships in a new Ninth Circuit and 14 in a Twelfth Circuit. Temporary judgeships would go to the new Ninth Circuit. A three-way split proposed by H.R. 211 and S. 1301 would allocate 19 judgeships to the new Ninth Circuit, compared to eight and six for the Twelfth and Thirteenth Circuits. Senior judges would choose their assigned circuit. The Ninth Circuit's caseload was estimated to be divided between the proposed new Ninth and Twelfth Circuits, with the new Ninth Circuit expected to carry 71.7% of cases compared to 28.3% for the new Twelfth Circuit. The seven bills introduced in the 109th Congress to split the Ninth Circuit would result in different caseload distributions among the proposed new circuits. Five bills would create a new Ninth Circuit with slightly higher caseloads than the current Ninth Circuit, but when temporary judgeships are included, estimated caseloads would fall below current levels. The current Ninth Circuit has a caseload of 561.3 appeals per judge, while proposed bills would create a new Ninth Circuit with varying caseloads. One bill would reduce the caseload to 542 cases per judge, while another would substantially reduce it to 469.8 appeals per judge. The data suggests that proposed bills would create varying caseloads for a new Ninth Circuit, with one bill reducing it to 542 cases per judge and another substantially reducing it to 469.8 appeals per judge. Judge Thomas testified that under S. 1845, the caseload for judges in a new Ninth Circuit would have been 526 cases per judgeship, compared to 316 cases per judgeship for the Twelfth Circuit. At a hearing, Chief District Judge John Roll and Ninth Circuit Judge Richard Tallman presented data supporting a split of the Ninth Circuit. The data showed that a new Ninth Circuit would have 518 cases per active judgeship under one proposal and 495 cases per active judge under another, compared to 351 and 341 cases per active judgeship for a Twelfth Circuit, respectively. The quantitative data highlights the potential caseload distribution between the circuits. The Ninth Circuit's caseload is impacted by a large number of immigration cases, particularly from the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA). In 2005, BIA appeals for the circuit had increased by 570%, with 88% of those filed in California. Judge Thomas mentioned that while the volume of immigration cases is expected to decrease as the BIA catches up with case processing, the courts can still anticipate a high volume of appeals in the coming years. The Ninth Circuit's caseload is heavily impacted by immigration cases, especially from the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA). Judge Thomas noted that as the BIA catches up with case processing, the volume of immigration cases should decrease. Centralized circuit staff resolve over 80% of immigration petitions before reaching judges. Congress considered transferring immigration appeals to the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in 2006. Judge Roll expressed that centralizing immigration appeals outside regional circuits may not eliminate the need to split the Ninth Circuit. Judge Roll suggested centralizing immigration appeals and splitting the Ninth Circuit to reduce caseload. If S. 1845 or H.R. 4093 were adopted, the new 9th Circuit would keep 60% of the current caseload. The Judicial Conference opposed centralizing immigration appeals, fearing it would reduce the Ninth Circuit's influence on immigration law. In FY2005, the Ninth Circuit disposed of cases in a median of 16.1 months after filing. In FY2005, the Ninth Circuit disposed of cases in a median of 16.1 months after filing, ranking last among the 12 circuits. Supporters of splitting the circuit argue that its size and workload are too much, while opponents believe the current Ninth Circuit functions well due to its experienced judges and staff. Factors like case type and complexity, as well as judges' efficiency in reaching decisions, may impact caseload considerations. Opponents of splitting the Ninth Circuit argue that the administrative costs of establishing new headquarters and staff support for a proposed Twelfth Circuit are unnecessary and would strain financial resources. Supporters acknowledge short-term costs but believe long-term savings and improved judicial administration will outweigh them. Cost estimates for the split vary, with the AO estimating startup costs over $94 million and annual recurring costs over $10 million if the Twelfth Circuit's headquarters were in Phoenix. The estimated costs for establishing a Twelfth Circuit headquarters in Phoenix would be over $94 million for startup and over $10 million annually. If located in Seattle, the expenses would be significantly lower at over $12 million for startup and $7 million annually. The variance in estimates is mainly due to construction costs for a new facility versus renovating an existing one. The Congressional Budget Office also estimated costs ranging from $20 million to over $80 million depending on the location and type of facility. Staff expenses such as relocation costs and equipment were also considered. The estimated costs for establishing a Twelfth Circuit headquarters in Phoenix would be over $94 million for startup and over $10 million annually, while in Seattle, it would be over $12 million for startup and $7 million annually. Proponents of splitting the Ninth Circuit argue that its reliance on limited en banc procedures allows a minority of judges to speak for the entire court. Some judges support splitting the Ninth Circuit due to concerns that limited en banc procedures allow a minority of judges to represent the entire court. They argue that this system may lead to inconsistent rulings and does not accurately reflect the judiciary as a whole. Ninth Circuit Chief Judge Mary M. Schroeder announced an increase in en banc panel size from 11 to 15 judges to address criticism of inconsistent rulings. The first enlarged panels began hearing cases in March 2006, with only a small percentage of cases being reheard en banc. Opponents argue that the issue is not a major concern due to the low number of cases appealed for rehearing. Judge Thomas challenged claims that en banc panels are unrepresentative of the entire circuit, stating that very few decisions made by en banc panels involved close votes. He also mentioned that the circuit's Evaluation Committee found en banc opinions to be representative. Voting on en banc hearings is open to all active judges, and any judge can request one. Some of the Ninth Circuit's rulings, such as the 2002 decision on the Pledge of Allegiance, have been controversial. Some proponents argue that the Ninth Circuit's rulings do not align with the conservative political culture of the western United States, leading to calls for a split. They point out that the Supreme Court reverses the Ninth Circuit more frequently than any other circuit. Opponents argue that the Ninth Circuit's reversal rates are not significantly different from other circuits. Supporters of splitting the Ninth Circuit argue that it would improve judicial administration due to the ongoing caseload explosion. Former Senator Pete Wilson also mentioned that any change would be gradual and not likely noticed in our lifetimes. Governor Wilson opposes splitting the Ninth Circuit, despite some judges supporting it. Chief Judge Mary Schroeder reported on a retreat where judges discussed the split and voted on three options. Judge Schroeder reported that out of the 47 judges on the Court, 30 opposed circuit division, 9 were in favor, and 8 abstained from voting. Among the active judges, only 4 favored division, while 15 opposed it and 6 abstained. Among the senior judges, 15 opposed division, 5 were in favor, and 2 abstained. Additionally, more than 30 Ninth Circuit judges wrote an article against the split in March 2006, and Chief Judge Schroeder reiterated her objections to the split at a conference in July 2006. Judge Schroeder and Judge Bea, along with other Ninth Circuit judges, have expressed concerns about the potential split of the circuit. They believe that it would lead to an imbalance in caseload, affect law enforcement at the border, and result in all sitting Latino judges being moved to a new Ninth Circuit. Judge Bea specifically raised worries about Arizona losing its Latino judges in the reconfigured court. Factors such as race, ethnicity, or gender could be used in filling the additional five seats most bills propose for a new Ninth Circuit, or for future Twelfth Circuit appointments. Opposition from the majority of the circuit's judges is a compelling argument against splitting the circuit, as well as opposition from state and local bar associations, law professors, environmental organizations, and other groups. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce supports splitting the circuit, while the U.S. Judicial Conference has chosen not to take a position on the matter. Some supporters of splitting the Ninth Circuit believe that district judges within the circuit may not necessarily oppose the split. District Judge John M. Roll testified in 2005 that there is much support for a split among district judges, especially for the proposed new Twelfth Circuit. On June 29, 2006, a group of 24 Ninth Circuit judges wrote to Senate Judiciary Committee chairman Arlen Specter urging hearings on the matter. At a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, Assistant Attorney General Rachel L. Brand supported legislation for additional federal judgeships and a split of the Ninth Circuit due to concerns about delays in cases involving the federal government. Senator Dianne Feinstein requested more information on the Justice Department's position, as Congress has not yet split the Ninth Circuit. The impact of a split would depend on the final boundaries. The debate over splitting the Ninth Circuit focuses on geography, judgeships, case disposal speed, cost, en banc procedures, and rulings. Analysis suggests different effects on these areas. History indicates the circuit's population will likely increase. Bills in the 109th Congress aimed to reduce states, area, and population in proposed new circuits. In the 109th Congress, bills were introduced to create a new Ninth Circuit with California, Guam, Hawaii, and the Northern Mariana Islands, reducing the population by approximately 20 million from the current Ninth Circuit. This would make the new Ninth Circuit the most populous in the nation. A new Ninth Circuit, including California, Guam, Hawaii, and the Northern Mariana Islands, would be the most populous circuit in the nation. Opponents fear a caseload disparity between reorganized circuits, while proponents argue that California would receive additional judgeships to handle the workload. Analysis of proposed bills during the 109th Congress suggests that creating new Twelfth or Thirteenth Circuits would result in lower caseloads compared to a new Ninth Circuit, with some bills even reducing caseload estimates below current levels. One bill (H.R. 3125) would have produced a higher estimated caseload in a Twelfth Circuit than in a new Ninth Circuit. H.R. 3125 introduced during the 109th Congress aims to create rough caseload parity between proposed new Ninth and Twelfth Circuits. The Ninth Circuit faced the second-highest per-judge caseload in the nation, taking over 16 months to dispose of cases in FY2005. In comparison, the Sixth Circuit had a smaller caseload but took almost as long to dispose of cases. The Eleventh and Fifth Circuits had high caseloads in FY2005 but disposed of cases faster than most other circuits. The Ninth Circuit had high caseloads in FY2005, disposing of cases faster than most other circuits. Estimates for splitting the Ninth Circuit vary widely, with start-up costs ranging from $20 million to $94 million. Renovating existing courthouses could help limit costs, along with considering administrative expenses. Administrative expenses may impact cost estimates for splitting the Ninth Circuit, but proposed legislation would not change en banc procedures. A new Twelfth Circuit would likely sit en banc with all authorized judges, while bills splitting the Ninth Circuit authorize at least 19 judges for a new Ninth Circuit. This would allow for a limited en banc procedure if chosen by the court. On March 2, 2005, Representative Michael Simpson introduced H.R. 1064 to prohibit the Ninth Circuit from using limited en banc procedures. The bill has not been acted upon since being referred to committee on April 4, 2005. Debate surrounds the motivation for splitting the Ninth Circuit, with opponents fearing a threat to judicial independence and supporters citing administrative concerns. If split, three-judge panels would still hear most cases. The proposal to split the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals has sparked debate over the potential impact on judicial independence and administrative concerns. If split, new circuits would be formed with little geographic diversity, potentially leading to a more \"liberal\" court. The future of legislative proposals to split the Ninth Circuit remains uncertain amidst ongoing discussions. The debate over splitting the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals continues, with uncertainty surrounding current legislative proposals. In the first session of the 109th Congress, attempts to split the circuit were made but dropped in the Senate. In the second session, there has been no official legislative action on the matter beyond reporting the bill from committee. The FY2007 budget resolution assumes reorganization of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals and creating additional judgeships. The Senate Judiciary Committee held a hearing on S. 1845, echoing previous discussions on splitting the Ninth Circuit. H.R. 4093 in the House and S. 1845 in the Senate have received significant legislative and media attention, with no further action taken on splitting the Ninth Circuit. S. 1845 and H.R. 4093 offer similar revisions to the Ninth Circuit, with the main difference being that H.R. 4093 also authorizes additional judgeships nationwide and creates a court in the U.S. Virgin Islands. S. 1845 focuses solely on splitting the Ninth Circuit. Proponents argue that the rapid population growth in the Ninth Circuit will worsen management challenges if not addressed. The debate over splitting the Ninth Circuit revolves around management challenges and differing opinions on the necessity of division. Data and analysis suggest that the impact of splitting the circuit would vary in areas such as caseload, cost, and en banc procedures. Congress has potential benchmarks to consider in deciding whether to split the Ninth Circuit or maintain the status quo. Different measures or variables may lead to alternative findings compared to the analysis presented in this report."
