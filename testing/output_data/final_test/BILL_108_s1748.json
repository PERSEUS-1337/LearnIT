    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Presidential Sites Improvement Act\". Congress finds that there are numerous Presidential sites in the United States, owned and maintained by non-Federal entities, often requiring costly maintenance and improvements due to insufficient funding. The preservation of these historic sites is crucial for promoting understanding of U.S. history. The Federal Government should provide grants for the maintenance and improvement of Presidential sites to preserve historic sites linked to Presidents of the United States. The Act defines key terms such as \"Grant Commission,\" \"Presidential site,\" and \"Secretary.\" It establishes the Grant Commission for Presidential sites and outlines criteria for sites eligible for grants. The Secretary awards grants for maintenance and improvement projects at Presidential sites. Grants can be used for repairs, capital improvements, and modifications to achieve ADA compliance. The Secretary awards grants for maintenance and improvement projects at Presidential sites, with funds allocated for emergency projects and grants for sites with a small operating budget. The Secretary awards grants for maintenance and improvement projects at Presidential sites, with funds allocated for emergency projects and grants for sites with specific operating budget criteria. The Secretary may use unexpended funds for grants in another project category. Owners of Presidential sites can apply for grants, which are then forwarded to the Grant Commission for consideration within 60 days. The Grant Commission must return applications with recommendations within 60 days. The Secretary considers the Commission's recommendations when awarding Presidential site grants within 180 days of receiving an application. The Presidential Site Grant Commission, composed of the Director of the National Park Service, is established to oversee the awarding of grants for projects at Presidential sites. The Federal share of project costs shall not exceed 50 percent, and the non-Federal share may be provided in cash or in kind. The Grant Commission, consisting of the Director of the National Park Service and 4 appointed members, reviews grant applications for Presidential site projects and recommends projects to the Secretary.
