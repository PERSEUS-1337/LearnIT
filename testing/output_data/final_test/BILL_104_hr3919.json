    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"American Opportunity Grant Act\". The Congress recognizes the importance of education for a democratic society and economy. A high school education is essential for lifelong learning in the 21st century, with college education being a valuable investment. Every American has the right to free education through high school, with State and local governments responsible for providing it. About 90 percent of Americans receive their basic education from public schools. Postsecondary education is funded by various sources and requires a new partnership to ensure financial access. The increasing cost of postsecondary education is creating financial strain for many American families. The national government should increase its contribution to postsecondary education to make it more affordable for all high school graduates. This will ensure that every student has access to the training they academically qualify for, while also controlling the rising cost of attendance. Federal assistance should prioritize students over institutions or state governments, supplementing public resources for education without replacing state funding. In exchange for financial aid, students should meet academic standards for eligibility and ongoing support. American Opportunity Grants are introduced in Section 3. The Higher Education Act of 1965 is amended to designate basic grants as 'American Opportunity Grants' and revise the grant program for eligible institutions. The amount of the basic grant for eligible students is determined for the academic year 1998-1999. The amount of the grant for eligible students in the academic year 1998-1999 is based on the family's adjusted income and includes the basic award, 'B' average merit award, and public service award. The basic award, 'B' average merit award, and public service award amounts vary based on adjusted income ranges. For example, for incomes less than $10,000, the basic award is $3,000, 'B' average merit award is $1,000, and public service award is $1,000. Income Ranges and Award Amounts:\n20,001 to 25,000: 2,850\n25,001 to 30,000: 2,800\n30,001 to 35,000: 2,750\n35,001 to 40,000: 2,700\n40,001 to 45,000: 2,650\n45,001 to 50,000: 2,600\n50,001 to 55,000: 2,550\n55,001 to 60,000: 2,450 Income Ranges and Award Amounts:\n60,001 to 65,000: 2,200\n65,001 to 70,000: 1,700\n70,001 to 75,000: 1,000\n75,001 to 80,000: 500\n80,001 to 90,000: 0\nMore than 90,000: 0 Limitations on calculations for award amounts: The basic award cannot exceed 50% of the student's cost of attendance, and the 'B' average merit award cannot exceed 15% of the cost of attendance. Students are eligible for the 'B' average merit award if they maintain a grade average of 'B' or better. The institution can grant merit awards to no more than half of its students each academic year. Students can receive a public service award for performing 195 or more hours of qualifying public service in the previous academic year. Family's adjusted income for award purposes includes adjusted gross income. The contribution from assets for award purposes is determined by the family's adjusted gross income and subtracting net worth, excluding certain assets, and $50,000, with a minimum contribution of zero. To be eligible for the American Opportunity Grant program, an institution of higher education must certify to the Secretary that it has maintained a minimum average annual expenditure per student for the preceding academic years. The institution must certify to the Secretary that their general expenses expenditure for the applicable academic year meets certain criteria, including not exceeding a certain percentage of tuition increase compared to previous years. The Secretary will review the certification to ensure that Federal assistance has not been enhanced. The institution must certify to the Secretary that their general expenses expenditure for the academic year meets certain criteria, including not exceeding a certain percentage of tuition increase compared to previous years. The Secretary will review the certification to ensure that Federal assistance has not been used to supplant existing funding by the institution. Waivers may be granted if extraordinary circumstances caused non-compliance. If a student attends an institution of higher education on a part-time basis, their basic grant amount will be reduced proportionally. The period of eligibility for undergraduate students pursuing a baccalaureate degree is 4 academic years if they are enrolled full-time and making satisfactory progress. The Secretary will establish a schedule of reductions for part-time students in accordance with regulations. The Secretary will establish regulations for providing support to nonbaccalaureate degree students for up to 2 terms, each not exceeding 1 year. No student can receive a basic grant from more than 1 institution concurrently. These amendments will be effective for grants starting on or after July 1, 1998. SEC. 4. PRESERVATION OF PELL GRANTS FOR PROPRIETARY SCHOOL STUDENTS. Students attending proprietary institutions of higher education or postsecondary vocational institutions will still be eligible to receive Pell grants, with a maximum grant of $2,500. A report evaluating the financial aid needs of these students will be submitted to relevant committees within 18 months. The Comptroller General will submit a report with alternatives and recommendations to address financial aid needs for students attending proprietary institutions or postsecondary vocational institutions. SEC. 5. EVALUATION. Amendment to the Higher Education Act of 1965 for a study on expenditure and revenue limitations, with recommendations to control tuition and cost increases. Report due by December 31, 1998. SEC. 6. COMMISSION ON CORPORATE WELFARE.

The Commission will meet as needed, with 5 members required for a quorum, and submit a final report to the President and Congress within 6 months of the Act's enactment. The Commission may hold hearings, gather information from federal agencies, and receive $1,000,000 for fiscal year 1997. The Chairperson can appoint an executive director and 6 staff members without following civil service laws.
