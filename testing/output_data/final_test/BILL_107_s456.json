Congress finds that the Department of Veterans Affairs operates the largest healthcare network in the US, serving approximately 25 million veterans, with a growing number seeking medical care. The Department's medical caseload is expected to increase to 3.9 million cases in fiscal year 2001. In fiscal year 2001, outpatient visits to Department facilities are expected to increase by 2,600,000 visits to approximately 40,400,000 visits. The average age of veterans is increasing, leading to additional demands for health care services. The Department is trying to meet the increasing demand for medical care without substantial increases in appropriations by increasing efficiency. Concerns have been raised about the potential loss of quality of care and patient satisfaction due to the need to treat more veterans with limited resources. Many regional networks and hospitals under the Veterans Health Administration report that inadequate funding may jeopardize timely access to high-quality healthcare, impacting patient satisfaction. The Sense of Congress on maximizing and efficiently using healthcare resources by the Department of Veterans Affairs is highlighted in Section 3. The Sense of Congress emphasizes that the Secretary of Veterans Affairs should require healthcare networks to share information on maximizing resources, implement exchange programs for sharing best practices, provide incentives for efficiency, and establish oversight to ensure uniform goals are met.
