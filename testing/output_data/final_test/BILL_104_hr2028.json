The President will establish the Board of Concession Appeals to adjudicate disputes between the Federal Government and concessioners under this Act. Appeals can be made to the Board after one level of agency review. Judicial review of decisions made by the Board can be sought by individuals. For concession service agreements, review is to the United States Court of Federal Claims, and for concession licenses, it is to the appropriate Federal District Court. Disputes under this Act are not subject to the General Accounting Office's jurisdiction for bid protests. The Accounting Office reviews bid protests under the Competition in Contracting Act of 1984. SEC. 13 addresses breach of contract by the Secretary concerned. If the Secretary breaches a concession authorization, they must pay compensation to the concessioner. SEC. 14. RECORDKEEPING. Concessioners must maintain records as prescribed by the Secretary to ensure compliance with the concession authorization terms. The Secretary and authorized representatives have access to these records for audit purposes. The Comptroller General or their representatives can also access and examine relevant books, documents, and records of concessioners for up to five years after the business year ends. SEC. 15. PRIVATIZATION OF FOREST SERVICE AND BLM LANDS SUBJECT TO CONCESSION LEASES. Authorization To Sell. The Secretary of Agriculture and the Secretary of the Interior may sell National Forest System lands and Bureau of Land Management lands to the owners of concession facilities at fair market value. The sale must occur within five years of the enactment of this Act or the expiration of a lease. The lands must be qualifying concession lands subject to a lease for private concession facilities. The appropriate Secretary shall provide for an independent appraisal of the lands and interests to be transferred for private concession facilities with a fair market value greater than $2,000,000, located adjacent to Federal lands or other significant private inholdings. The appraiser must use nationally recognized standards and exclude the value of any improvements made by the concessioner. The appraiser must submit a detailed report to the Secretary. The Secretary can use donated funds to pay for appraisals. 50% of funds from sales will go to the appropriate agency, and the remaining 50% will be deposited in the Treasury. The laws and regulations that do not apply to concession service agreements and licenses under this Act include Title III of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act, the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994, the Brooks Automatic Data Processing Act, Chapters 137 and 141 of title 10, the Federal Acquisition Regulation, the Randolph-Sheppard Act, and the Service Contract Act of 1965. SEC. 17 of the Act emphasizes that concession programs on Federal lands must align with the agency's mission and laws. It also clarifies that the Act does not diminish the United States' rights over land and resources. SEC. 18 mandates the development of unified regulations by the Secretaries of Interior, Agriculture, and Army within a year. These regulations will outline the qualifications for agency personnel involved in concession management. SEC. 19 addresses the relationship of the Act with other existing laws. The Act repeals certain provisions related to concession policies in National Parks and forest service areas. It also supersedes provisions of the Federal Water Project Recreation Act of 1965, the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976, and the Recreation and Public Purposes Act. The Act repeals and supersedes various provisions related to concession policies in National Parks and forest service areas, as well as provisions of Acts such as the Recreation and Public Purposes Act, the Water Resources Development Act of 1986, the Refuge Recreation Act, and the National Wildlife Refuge System Administration Act of 1966. The repeal or superseding of these provisions does not affect the validity of any authorizations entered into under such Acts. The Act preserves the right of renewal for concession contracts and does not change the value of existing possessory interests. It does not affect provisions of the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act. The Interest Lands Conservation Act (16 U.S.C. 3101 et seq.) pertains to revenue-producing visitor services."
