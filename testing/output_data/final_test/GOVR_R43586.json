    "content": "In 1967, the Supreme Court established the \"third-party doctrine,\" stating that individuals have no expectation of privacy in information voluntarily shared with third parties. This doctrine has become a powerful tool for government investigations in today's digital age. There is ongoing debate about whether the courts should reevaluate this doctrine or if Congress should provide statutory protection for such information. The Supreme Court established the \"third-party doctrine\" in 1967, ruling that individuals have no privacy expectation in information shared with third parties. This doctrine allows government access to certain records without a warrant, such as telephone calling and bank records. However, it does not cover all types of information transferred through a third party, excluding the content of voice or email communications. The third-party doctrine allows government access to certain records shared with service providers without a warrant, covering non-content and content information like deposit slips shared with a bank. It also includes non-content information from private interactions, such as telephone numbers dialed or websites visited. This doctrine has been criticized for limiting privacy rights. The third-party doctrine, entrenched in Fourth Amendment case law, allows government access to shared information without a warrant. Court rulings have justified this by stating that activities exposed to the public gaze lose expectation of privacy. Some question the doctrine's practical implications in a society that shares almost every aspect of life with various entities, especially in the digital age with advancements in data generation and processing. There is a debate on whether new technologies and social shifts require courts or lawmakers to revise privacy laws. Two major events fueling this debate are the 2012 GPS tracking case United States v. Jones and the litigation surrounding the National Security Agency's telephone metadata program. Justice Sotomayor believes the third-party doctrine should be reevaluated in light of pervasive government surveillance. The report explores the history and legal foundations of the third-party doctrine in light of shifts in technology and legal thinking. It analyzes Court cases, arguments for and against its application, Congress's response, and potential future alterations post-United States v. Jones. The report delves into the history of government intrusions and the Fourth Amendment, highlighting the shift in investigative methods from physical searches to digital data retrieval. It also discusses the potential impact of United States v. Jones on future legal developments in this area. The Fourth Amendment was influenced by the English case Entick v. Carrington, where government officials conducted an invasive search of John Entick's home under a general warrant. Lord Camden emphasized the sanctity of property rights in his ruling. The Fourth Amendment, influenced by the English case Entick v. Carrington, was ratified in 1791 to prevent government intrusions into people's lives. It was a response to British officials using writs of assistance for house-to-house searches in the American colonies, which were deemed as arbitrary and destructive of liberty. John Adams and James Otis criticized these practices, with Otis calling them the worst instrument of arbitrary power. The Fourth Amendment, part of the Bill of Rights, aimed to protect against such indiscriminate intrusions. The Fourth Amendment, ratified in 1791 as part of the Bill of Rights, protects the right of the people to be secure against unreasonable searches and seizures. Federal courts have grappled with reconciling the requirement for all searches to be reasonable with the need for warrants to meet specific criteria. The Court must determine if the Fourth Amendment's restrictions apply by assessing if a \"search\" has been conducted. The government's definition of a \"search\" under the Fourth Amendment is complex and relies on Supreme Court case law. The landmark case United States v. Boyd in 1886 established that the production of private papers can constitute a Fourth Amendment search. The Supreme Court case Olmstead v. United States narrowed the scope of what constitutes a Fourth Amendment search by ruling that wiretaps placed on phone lines without physical trespass did not qualify as a search. This decision was in contrast to the broader interpretation in United States v. Boyd, which established that the production of private papers could constitute a search under the Fourth Amendment. In Olmstead v. United States, the Supreme Court ruled that wiretaps without physical trespass did not constitute a search under the Fourth Amendment. Justice Brandeis emphasized the broad protection of beliefs, thoughts, and privacy guaranteed by the Constitution. The Court previously assessed searches based on physical trespass, but this decision shifted the focus to unjustifiable government intrusions on individual privacy. In 1967, the Court decided Katz v. United States, abandoning the literal interpretation of the Fourth Amendment for a privacy-based test. This expanded protection to intangible interests like privacy but also limited protection for information exposed to the public or third parties. In Katz v. United States, the FBI investigated Mr. Katz for illegal gambling by attaching a listening device to a telephone booth. The Court ruled that the Fourth Amendment protects people, not just places, emphasizing individual privacy against government intrusion. In Katz v. United States, the Court emphasized individual privacy against governmental intrusion, ruling that what a person seeks to preserve as private may be constitutionally protected. Justice Harlan's two-part framework in Katz became the controlling test for determining privacy interests. In Katz v. United States, the Court established a two-part test for determining privacy interests. The majority ruled that what a person knowingly exposes to the public is not protected by the Fourth Amendment. This concept, known as the secrecy model of privacy, forms the basis of the modern third-party doctrine. The Fourth Amendment jurisprudence has long held that what a person knowingly exposes to the public is not protected. This concept was established in early cases like Ex parte Jackson and United States v. Lee, and later extended to conversations and data shared with third parties. The Supreme Court assessed the constitutionality of using undercover agents in a series of cases throughout the 20th century. In On Lee v. United States, an undercover agent wired with a microphone engaged in incriminating conversation with On Lee in his laundromat. Despite On Lee's argument that this violated the Fourth Amendment, the Court disagreed, stating that he was talking indiscreetly with someone he trusted. In a similar case, Lopez v. United States, the defendant tried to bribe an internal revenue agent wearing a recording device. The Court rejected the argument to suppress evidence of wire recordings, citing that the defendant consented to the agent's presence and knew his statements could be used against him. The listening device was used to obtain reliable evidence of a conversation the agent was entitled to disclose. In Lewis v. United States, a federal agent was allowed to testify about conversations with the defendant regarding marijuana purchases, as the defendant willingly spoke to the agent in his home. In Hoffa v. United States, conversations between a government informant and Jimmy Hoffa were deemed admissible as the informant was invited to participate and not a surreptitious eavesdropper, thus not violating the Fourth Amendment. The Court found that in undercover informant cases, as long as informants were not trespassing into constitutionally protected areas, there was no constitutional invasion. Consent or invitation onto the premises by the defendant negated any claim of trespass. Additionally, voluntarily sharing information with another person, including the government, was seen as giving consent to disclose that information. In Hoffa, the Fourth Amendment does not protect a wrongdoer's belief that their wrongdoing won't be revealed. The focus shifted from property to privacy with Katz. United States v. White involved undercover informant conversations, with the court upholding the surveillance despite speculation that Katz would overrule previous cases. The Supreme Court upheld surreptitious surveillance in United States v. White, stating that the informant was not an uninvited eavesdropper but a party to the conversation. The Court combined ideas of privacy expectations and assumption of risk, leading to resolutions in third-party doctrine cases in the 1970s. In the 1970s, United States v. Miller and Smith v. Maryland established the modern third-party doctrine, allowing government access to transactional data without a warrant. In Miller v. United States, agents investigating Mitch Miller subpoenaed banks for his financial records without informing him. In United States v. Miller, agents subpoenaed banks for financial records without a warrant. The Supreme Court ruled that obtaining bank records through a subpoena did not violate the Fourth Amendment. Justice Powell noted that requiring banks to retain customer records did not constitute a Fourth Amendment search. The Supreme Court ruled in United States v. Miller that obtaining bank records through a subpoena did not violate the Fourth Amendment. The Court concluded that banking documents were not \"confidential communications\" but rather negotiable instruments required for business transactions. Once shared with the bank, the documents could be given to the government without violating privacy expectations. The Supreme Court ruled in United States v. Miller that bank records could be shared with the government without a search warrant. Justice Powell stated that customers risk their information being shared with the government when revealing it to a third party. The Court's third-party doctrine allows information shared with a third party to be obtained by the government, even if shared under limited purposes. Therefore, Miller had no expectation of privacy in his bank records during his prosecution. The Supreme Court's ruling in United States v. Miller established that bank records could be disclosed to the government without a search warrant, citing the third-party doctrine. This doctrine allows information shared with a third party to be accessed by the government, as seen in the case of Smith v. Maryland where telephone records were obtained without a warrant. In Smith v. Maryland, the police used a pen register to connect Smith to a robbery by tracing a call from his home to the victim's phone. Smith argued that the evidence violated his Fourth Amendment rights, but the court ruled that the installation of the pen register was not a Fourth Amendment search. The Supreme Court questioned whether Smith had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the numbers he dialed. The Court in Smith v. Maryland ruled that there was no reasonable expectation of privacy in the numbers dialed on a phone, as customers are aware that phone companies record this information for various reasons. This decision was based on the idea that information voluntarily given to third parties does not have an expectation of privacy. The Court in Smith v. Maryland found that there was no expectation of privacy in information voluntarily given to third parties, such as telephone numbers dialed. This decision has been applied in various contexts involving electronic information transfers. The Supreme Court has ruled that non-content addressing information, such as phone numbers dialed, is covered by the third-party doctrine, while the content of communication, like the body of an email, is not. This distinction dates back to the 19th century and is based on the role of companies as intermediaries in communication. In Jackson, the Supreme Court ruled that the content of a mailed letter is protected under the Fourth Amendment, while non-content information like the address on the outside is not. This distinction between content and non-content was further developed in Katz and Smith. Katz protected the content of communication (voice), while Smith left non-content information (numbers dialed) unprotected. This distinction has also been applied in lower courts, as seen in United States v. Warshak. In United States v. Warshak, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals recognized a reasonable expectation of privacy in email content, emphasizing the need for strong Fourth Amendment protection. However, in United States v. Forrester, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that non-content information like email addresses and IP addresses are not protected under the Fourth Amendment. The Ninth Circuit found that email and Internet addressing information is akin to telephone numbers in terms of government access. While the government can make educated guesses about the content of messages or websites visited, this information does not necessarily reveal more than phone numbers. However, access to post-call dialed digits is considered a Fourth Amendment search as they may contain sensitive information like bank account or Social Security numbers. The dividing line between protected and unprotected information lies in the identity of the service provider in the chain of communication. If the provider is a recipient of the information, it is considered \"business records\" subject to the third-party doctrine. This is similar to the rationale applied in undercover informant cases, where information provided directly to the agent is not protected. Alternatively, if the company acts as a conduit and passively conveys information to an end-user, it may be protected. The Sixth Circuit in Warshak held that ISPs act as intermediaries for email communication, similar to the post office or telephone company. Just as a warrant is required to access postal or phone communications, the court ruled that a warrant should also be needed for modern forms of communication. This contrasts with the Miller case, where bank records were given directly to banks for business use. The court in Warshak ruled that ISPs are intermediaries for email communication, requiring a warrant for access. This contrasts with cases involving bank records given directly to banks for business use. In a similar vein, a Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals case treated cell location data as a business record not protected by the Fourth Amendment. The court found that cell site records are considered business records under the third-party doctrine, allowing access to cell location information without a warrant. However, some judges are challenging this approach, arguing for Fourth Amendment protection for cell phone location data. The Third Circuit Court of Appeals found that constant surveillance over 113 days raised privacy concerns that warranted an exception to the third-party doctrine. They argued that the aggregation of location information can reveal sensitive details, challenging the idea that cell phone users voluntarily share their location with providers. The court left it to the magistrate judge's discretion on whether a warrant would be required for such data. The lower courts are debating whether the third-party doctrine should apply to \"cell tower dumps,\" where the government seeks cell phone records of unknown individuals after a crime. Courts are divided on whether a warrant is needed, with arguments for and against the doctrine's existence. One argument in favor is its alignment with Fourth Amendment case law. The third-party doctrine aligns with Fourth Amendment case law, as seen in cases like California v. Greenwood and United States v. Knotts, where the Court ruled that individuals do not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in information voluntarily shared with the public. The third-party doctrine aligns with Fourth Amendment case law, where individuals do not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in information voluntarily shared with the public. This theory has been applied in cases where police conducted aerial surveillance over private property, and in United States v. Jacobsen, where opening a mailed package was not considered a search after its contents had been viewed by a third party. Law enforcement often relies on assistance from third parties in investigations. The third-party doctrine allows law enforcement to obtain information from third parties without a warrant, similar to how witnesses can be compelled to testify in investigations. Professor Orin Kerr argues that this doctrine maintains a balance between privacy and security in the digital age. Professor Orin Kerr argues that the third-party doctrine maintains a balance between privacy and security in the digital age by providing the same level of protection regardless of whether a criminal acts alone or through a third-party service. Kerr highlights the potential privacy-security imbalance that could arise if criminals could use third-party services to commit crimes without exposing themselves to public surveillance, creating a Catch-22 situation for law enforcement. Courts may not be the best branch of government to handle privacy disputes involving information shared with third-parties. Some argue that Congress and legislatures are better suited to create rules for new technologies, balancing privacy and security while allowing for flexibility. The third-party doctrine is supported by the idea that companies \"own\" the records they possess and can transfer them without the subject's permission. This theory was relied upon by the Court. The third-party doctrine allows companies to transfer records without the subject's permission, as seen in the case of Miller where bank records were considered business records. Critics argue that privacy is not lost once information is shared, and that sharing with third-party companies is often necessary in modern society. The third-party doctrine allows companies to transfer records without permission, necessary in modern society. Critics argue that privacy is not lost once shared, challenging the secrecy model of the Fourth Amendment. Justice Marshall emphasized privacy as not an all-or-nothing commodity. Justice Marshall emphasized that privacy is not a discrete commodity and argued that there is a distinction between information broadcasted to the public and information disclosed in a controlled environment. He highlighted that individuals who share information for a specific purpose should not expect it to be released for other reasons. The Fourth Amendment protects limited sharing of information in legitimate transactions. There is inconsistency in the protection of information shared with third parties, as seen in cases like Katz v. United States and Berger v. New York. Justice Stewart pointed out the incongruity in extending privacy protection to conversation content but not to telephone numbers dialed. Justice Stewart argued for extending privacy protection to telephone numbers dialed, emphasizing that revealing such information could expose the most intimate details of a person's life. He also challenged the notion of voluntary conveyance of information in business transactions, questioning the validity of the third-party doctrine. The defendant voluntarily conveyed numerical information to the telephone company, and there is disagreement about the voluntary nature of these transactions. Justice Brennan argued that disclosing financial affairs to a bank is not entirely volitional. Justice Marshall argued that individuals cannot avoid surveillance when using necessities like telephones, similar to disclosing financial affairs to a bank. Unlike undercover agent cases, refusing medical treatment or education is not a realistic option, leading to an unproductive existence. The third-party doctrine's assumption of risk argument is challenged, as people do not willingly assume legal risks when sharing information with third parties. Justice Harlan expressed concern about how courts determine privacy protection expectations and risks assumed by individuals when sharing information with third parties. He argues that people's expectations and risks are shaped by laws set by courts or legislatures, and judges should not simply recite them without analyzing their impact on society. Instead, courts should assess the nature of specific practices and their potential impact on individuals' sense of security. Justice Harlan suggested that courts should evaluate each surveillance practice to determine its impact on individual privacy interests, rather than applying the phrase \"assumption of the risk\" in every legal context. One commentator proposed that government access to records should not be unrestricted, and the level of protection should vary based on the nature of the documents requested. Arguments against the application of certain privacy protections have also been made. Justice Harlan raised concerns about the third-party doctrine, stating that it could erode trust in communication. He believed that knowing conversations could be monitored would lead to more cautious speech. This issue is exemplified in the NSA controversy, where sharing information with tech companies could lead to distrust and financial losses for American businesses. The third-party doctrine has the potential to engender distrust and cost American businesses significant revenues. Recent opinions in the GPS tracking case United States v. Jones raise questions about its continued application, suggesting a shift in the Court's thinking about technology's impact on government data collection. In Jones, the Court ruled against the government's warrantless GPS tracking, despite previous case law. In United States v. Jones, the Court ruled 9-0 against the government, holding that attaching a tracking device to Jones's car constituted a Fourth Amendment search. The majority opinion, written by Justice Scalia, focused on the physical trespass onto Jones's vehicle as the basis for the Fourth Amendment violation. This ruling may not have significant implications for the third-party doctrine unless government trespass extends to an individual's \"papers\" or \"effects.\" In United States v. Jones, the Court ruled against the government, stating that attaching a tracking device to Jones's car was a Fourth Amendment search due to physical trespass. Justices Sotomayor and Alito's opinions in Jones suggest a reevaluation of the third-party doctrine, especially regarding government monitoring. Justice Sotomayor questioned the idea that individuals have no expectation of privacy in information shared with third parties, highlighting the challenges of privacy in the digital age. The curr_chunk discusses the privacy concerns related to the disclosure of individuals' online activities to the government without a warrant. Justice Sotomayor questions the third-party doctrine and suggests limiting its reach, especially when the government accesses extensive data about an individual. This challenges the notion that information shared with third parties has no expectation of privacy, highlighting the complexities of privacy in the digital age. Justice Sotomayor questions the third-party doctrine and suggests limiting its reach, especially when the government accesses extensive data about an individual. Justices Sotomayor and Alito's opinions call into question the continued application of the third-party doctrine, particularly in cases of pervasive government monitoring. Justice Alito, joined by Justices Ginsburg, Breyer, and Kagan, found that long-term GPS monitoring impinges on privacy expectations. Justice Sotomayor agreed with Justice Alito's approach and proposed prohibiting short-term monitoring in some instances. The Supreme Court Justices expressed concerns about government monitoring, particularly regarding GPS tracking, due to the extensive information it can gather about a person's movements and associations. This raised privacy issues and the potential for revealing more about an individual than isolated pieces of information. The District of Columbia Court of Appeals also found that prolonged location tracking constituted a Fourth Amendment search. Prolonged location tracking is considered a Fourth Amendment search as it can reveal detailed information about a person's activities and associations over time. Repeated visits to specific places, sequences of movements, and patterns of behavior can paint a comprehensive picture of an individual's lifestyle and habits. The Supreme Court Justices expressed concerns about the aggregation of personal data and the potential for technology to erode traditional barriers to law enforcement surveillance. Justice Alito found prolonged tracking to be overly intrusive due to the government's ability to monitor every movement over an extended period. Justice Sotomayor criticized the third-party doctrine, while Justice Alito's concurrence may be limited to monitoring by government agents rather than third-party data collection. The Supreme Court Justices raised concerns about personal data aggregation and technology's impact on law enforcement surveillance. Lower federal courts have applied the mosaic theory from Jones concurrences to cases involving third-party data collection, such as invalidating the NSA's phone call records collection. Judges have also used Jones and the mosaic theory to rule government tracking as a Fourth Amendment search in cell phone location monitoring cases. In the long run, it may take a more pertinent set of facts for the Justices to advance the arguments enunciated in Jones. Despite some concurring opinions, most court precedent leaves non-content information unprotected by the Fourth Amendment. Congress has provided varying levels of privacy protection for this type of information, but these protections are not as strong as the warrant requirement. Seven years after the Smith ruling, Congress enacted provisions in the ECPA requiring a court order for using pen registers or trap and trace devices. The ECPA requires a court order for using pen registers or trap and trace devices, allowing the government to gather non-content information relevant to criminal investigations. The court must issue the order if the government certifies the information's relevance, without requiring independent judicial inquiry into the facts. The court does not conduct an independent judicial inquiry into the facts when issuing an order for pen registers or trap and trace devices. The government certifies the information's relevance, and the court's role is limited to proofreading errors, leading to concerns about potential misuse and abuse. In the context of subpoenas, the information sought must have a reasonable possibility of being relevant to the investigation. Some suggest raising the evidentiary threshold to a reasonable suspicion standard. The Stored Communications Act provides varying levels of protection for information outside the Fourth Amendment's reach. Service providers must provide subscriber information if the government can establish specific and articulable facts. The government can access subscriber information under the Stored Communications Act if they can establish specific and articulable facts showing relevance to a criminal investigation. This standard is similar to Terry reasonable suspicion and has been applied to data like email addresses and website IP addresses. Section 2703(c)(2) requires providers to disclose customer information with a subpoena. Congress has passed privacy protection laws for credit card and bank account numbers, cable subscribers, and video store customers. Senator Paul introduced the \"Fourth Amendment Restoration Act of 2013\" to prevent NSA spying on US citizens without a warrant. Congress can play a role in setting limitations on government surveillance authorities, such as Senator Paul's bill to protect the Fourth Amendment. Other measures aim to restrict access to individuals' information held by third parties and alter the third-party doctrine. Location monitoring bills would require warrants for sharing customers' location information. The future of third-party data privacy remains uncertain. The future of the third-party doctrine and government's collection of non-content data is uncertain. Justice Sotomayor supports reducing the doctrine's scope, while Justice Alito's opinion in Jones hints at a possible reconsideration. Lower federal courts may limit the doctrine in specific instances, like in the NSA telephone metadata case. The future of the third-party doctrine and government's collection of non-content data is uncertain. Lower federal courts may limit the doctrine in specific instances, like in the NSA telephone metadata case. Justice Alito suggested that Congress may be best suited to address privacy concerns in the face of technological advancements. Congress may be more inclined to engage in a subject-by-subject approach to limit the third-party doctrine in certain areas, as seen in statutes providing protection for telephone toll records, Internet metadata, and video customer records. This approach balances privacy and public safety comprehensively."
