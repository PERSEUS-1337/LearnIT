    "content": "The Commemorative Works Act (CWA), enacted in November 1986, provides a legal framework for placing commemorative works in the District of Columbia. It ensures appropriate design, construction, and location of such works in areas administered by the National Park Service (NPS) and the General Services Administration (GSA). The CWA delegates oversight to the Secretary of the Interior, the Administrator of the GSA, the National Capital Planning Commission (NCPC), and the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts. Placement of commemorative works is restricted to specific areas in the District of Columbia. The Commemorative Works Act (CWA) governs the placement of memorials in the District of Columbia, requiring federal maintenance unless specified otherwise. Some memorials, like the Air Force Memorial, end up outside CWA jurisdiction, such as in Arlington, VA, where the Department of Defense is responsible for maintenance. The report highlights in-progress works and memorials with lapsed authorizations since the passage of the CWA in 1986. It includes information on the statute(s) authorizing the work, sponsor organization, legislative extensions, and memorial locations. The CWA divides areas in DC into three sections for memorial placement, with standards specified in law and congressional approval required. The Reserve, created in 2003, prohibits future memorials in a defined area of the Mall. Area I, defined as the central cross-axis of the Mall from the Capitol to the Lincoln Memorial, is reserved for commemorative works of significant historical importance. New commemorative works are prohibited in this area to preserve its integrity. Area II, encompassing all sections of the District of Columbia and its surroundings not part of the Reserve or Area I, is designated for subjects of lasting historical significance to the American people. Of the 37 authorized commemorative works in DC since 1986, 19 have been completed, 12 are in progress, and 6 have lapsed authorizations. Factors affecting completion include site selection, design approval, and fundraising. The process of selecting a memorial site location in Washington, D.C. is a significant task for sponsor groups. Due to the creation of the Reserve in 2003, placing a future memorial on the National Mall has become challenging. Sponsor groups aim to choose sites as close to the National Mall as possible to ensure easy visitor access. For example, the Dwight D. Eisenhower Memorial will be located south of the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum, providing a prominent location just off the Mall. Similarly, the foundation planning a memorial for John Adams evaluated sites near the National Mall. Congress authorized the NCPC and the CFA in 1986 to approve memorial designs. The NCPC and the CFA were authorized in 1986 to approve memorial designs in Washington, D.C. Their goals include preserving the comprehensive design plans for the Nation's Capital, ensuring public use of open space, and locating commemorative works within the urban fabric. Sponsor groups sometimes face challenges in creating memorials. Sponsor groups often struggle to meet the design specifications of the NCPC, CFA, and NCMAC when creating memorials in Washington, D.C. They may need to present multiple designs and raise funds for the project, with some facing difficulties in fundraising. Feedback from the NCPC is crucial in ensuring compliance with guidelines for memorial construction. Since 1986, 37 memorials and monuments have been authorized by statute under the Commemorative Works Act. Congress has occasionally provided appropriations to aid sponsor groups in fundraising efforts, such as the $10 million allocated in 2005 for the Martin Luther King, Jr. Memorial. Legislation is regularly proposed in Congress for additional commemorative works. Since 1986, 37 memorials and monuments have been authorized under the Commemorative Works Act. Currently, 12 commemorative works are in progress, including the Dwight D. Eisenhower Memorial and the Slaves and Free Black Persons Who Served in the Revolutionary War Memorial. Additionally, the World War II Prayer plaque is being planned with a site location. Several memorials are being planned and evaluated for site locations, including the World War II Prayer plaque, World War I Memorial, Korean War Memorial Wall of Remembrance, Second Division Memorial modifications, Desert Storm and Desert Shield Memorial, Peace Corps Memorial, Gold Star Mothers Memorial, John Adams and his Family's Legacy Memorial, Global War on Terrorism Memorial, and Emergency Medical Services Memorial. The Dwight D. Eisenhower Memorial is currently under construction, with the most recently dedicated memorial being the Victims of the Ukrainian Manmade Famine of 1932-1933 Memorial. Congress created a federal commission in 1999 to plan a permanent memorial to Dwight D. Eisenhower, which was later amended in 2002 to formally authorize. In 2002, Congress authorized a commission to create a memorial for Dwight D. Eisenhower. Representative Dennis Moore praised Eisenhower's contributions as a key figure in 20th-century history, highlighting his roles in World War II, as President, NATO commander, and President of Columbia University. Ike's leadership influenced significant changes in America. Dwight D. Eisenhower's extraordinary leadership as President led to significant changes in America. He created the Interstate Highway System, NASA, and other key government agencies. Eisenhower also desegregated the District of Columbia, ended the Korean War, and defused international crises. His national security policies guided the nation for three decades, ultimately contributing to the peaceful end of the Cold War. Eisenhower's dedication to peace, freedom, and security shaped his presidency, always prioritizing what was best for America. The Dwight D. Eisenhower Memorial, designed by architect Frank Gehry, is currently under construction in Washington, D.C. The final design was approved by the CFA and NCPC in 2017, with a groundbreaking ceremony held in November of that year. Congress authorized the placement of a plaque containing President Franklin D. Roosevelt's D-Day prayer at the World War II Memorial in the District of Columbia. Representative Bill Johnson supported this decision during debates in Congress. Representative Bill Johnson supported the legislation (H.R. 2070) to add President Franklin D. Roosevelt's D-Day prayer to the World War II Memorial in Washington, D.C. The prayer, titled \"Let Our Hearts Be Stout,\" provided solace and strength during the war. Johnson emphasized the importance of honoring the 16 million who served and the 400,000 who died in World War II. The prayer plaque will be located at the \"Circle of Remembrance.\" The prayer plaque, favored by the NCPC and CFA, will be located at the \"Circle of Remembrance\" at the World War II Memorial. Congress authorized a commemorative work to honor courageous slaves and free Black persons who served during the American Revolution, repealing a previous authorization for a memorial to black Revolutionary War veterans. Rose Oakar summarized the need for a memorial to black Revolutionary War veterans, highlighting their contributions from the Revolutionary War to Vietnam. The memorial, authorized in 1986 and located in Area I, serves as a tribute to their bravery and valor. The Black Revolutionary War Patriots Foundation's authorization for the memorial expired in 2005, but was reauthorized three times, with the latest in 2012. The Black Revolutionary War Patriots Memorial was authorized in 1986 to honor 5,000 slaves and free Black persons who served during the American Revolution. The memorial's location was approved in Constitution Gardens in 1988, with the final design approved in 1996. The authorization for the memorial expired in 2005, but was reauthorized in 2012. The Black Revolutionary War Patriots Memorial Foundation faced challenges in raising funds for construction, leading to its disbandment in 2005. S. 883 authorizes the National Mall Liberty Fund D.C. to construct a commemorative work honoring the same individuals. President Obama signed H.J.Res. 120 in 2014 to provide the memorial with a location in Area I. The sponsor group considered three potential sites for the memorial. In the 114th Congress, legislation was introduced to designate the Secretary of Agriculture as responsible for considering the site and design proposals for a World War I Memorial on the National Mall. No further action was taken on the measure. Pershing Park was re-designated as a World War I Memorial in December 2014. The General Pershing Commemorative Work at Pershing Park includes sculptural and commemorative elements to honor US Armed Forces in World War I. The winning design, titled \"The Weight of Sacrifice,\" symbolizes the sacrifices made for liberty. The latest design was presented to the NCPC and CFA in 2019, following a ceremonial groundbreaking in 2017. A revised concept design for the World War I Memorial was presented in November 2017. Congress authorized a wall of remembrance to be added to the Korean War Memorial in Washington, DC, to honor fallen members of the Armed Forces. Representative Sam Johnson highlighted the importance of this addition to properly convey the sacrifice made by Korean War veterans. The proposed Korean War Veterans Memorial Wall of Remembrance aims to honor the brave Americans who gave their lives in defense. The Wall of Remembrance at the Korean War Memorial in Washington, DC, will honor fallen members of the Armed Forces who sacrificed their lives in defense of freedom. Modifications to the Second Division Memorial were authorized to add commemorative elements for the Second Infantry Division's fallen members. The current design of the Second Division Memorial honors fallen members of the Second Infantry Division. Congress authorized the establishment of a National Desert Storm and Desert Shield Memorial to commemorate those who served in Operations Desert Storm and Desert Shield. Representative Doc Hastings highlighted the importance of recognizing the success of over 600,000 American servicemen who led a coalition to secure Kuwait's independence. The National Desert Storm Veteran's War Memorial will be located at the southwest corner of Constitution Avenue, NW, and 23rd Street, NW. President Trump signed S.J.Res. 1 to provide the memorial with a location in Area I. Congress authorized the Peace Corps Memorial Foundation to establish a commemorative work in the District of Columbia to honor the mission and ideals of the Peace Corps. The Peace Corps Memorial, authorized by S. 230, commemorates President Kennedy's legacy and the accomplishments of the Peace Corps. It will be located between 1st Street, NW, Louisiana Avenue, NW, and C Street, NW. The bill signifies unity in passing meaningful legislation early in the new year. The Peace Corps Memorial Foundation presented its design concept for the memorial in early 2019 to the CFA and NCPC. The CFA approved the concept design in March 2019, while the NCPC raised concerns in May 2019 about the design not fully embracing the site's strengths or addressing challenges. Congress authorized the Adams Memorial Foundation in November 2001 to establish a commemorative work honoring former President John Adams and his family in the District of Columbia. In March 2019, Congress created the Adams Memorial Commission to honor the Adams family's legacy of public service, including John Adams, Abigail Adams, John Quincy Adams, and their descendants. The Adams Memorial Commission was created by Congress to replace the Adams Memorial Foundation as the sponsor of the memorial. The commission will now oversee the siting, design, and construction of the memorial. The foundation's authorization expired in December 2013, and prior to that, they were working with the NCMAC on potential site recommendations. Congress also authorized the Gold Star Mothers National Monument Foundation to establish a commemorative work in December 2012. The Gold Star Mothers National Monument Foundation was authorized by Congress to establish a memorial to honor the sacrifices made by mothers and their sons and daughters in the Armed Forces. Representative Jon Runyan explained the need for the memorial, highlighting the tradition of displaying flags with blue stars during World War I, which later evolved to gold stars for those who never returned home. The Gold Star Mothers National Monument Foundation was authorized by Congress to establish a memorial to honor the sacrifices made by mothers and their sons and daughters in the Armed Forces. In December 2013, the foundation presented its site analysis to the National Capital Memorial Advisory Commission, expressing a preference for a location near Arlington National Cemetery. In January 2015, the NCPC and CFA approved a site next to the Arlington National Cemetery Visitor's Center. In August 2017, Congress authorized the Global War on Terrorism Memorial Foundation to establish a commemorative work in the District of Columbia to honor members of the Armed Forces who served in the Global War on Terrorism. Representative Tom McClintock emphasized the importance of a memorial for the Global War on Terrorism, despite the statutory prohibition against war memorials for ongoing conflicts. The Commemorative Works Act requires a war to be ended for at least 10 years before planning a national memorial can begin, allowing history to provide context and appreciation for the war's significance. The unique nature of the war on terrorism, now approaching its 16th anniversary, highlights the sacrifices made by veterans in defending the country. The measure suspends the 10-year period in current law to allow for a memorial for the Global War on Terrorism, acknowledging the sacrifices made by veterans and their families. It sets aside the requirement for ongoing conflicts, like the current war on terrorism, to have a memorial. A bill (H.R. 1037) aims to establish a memorial in DC honoring emergency medical services providers for their dedication and sacrifices. Representative Tom McClintock highlighted the importance of recognizing the 850,000 EMS providers who respond to 30 million calls annually, facing dangers to save lives. Since 1986, six memorials authorized by Congress to honor various figures and create a National Peace Garden and Vietnam Veterans Visitor Center have not been completed due to time constraints and lack of extensions. EMS providers, who respond to emergencies and disasters, have not been honored with national memorials like their law enforcement and firefighting peers. In June 1987, Congress authorized the construction of a 'Peace Garden' in Washington D.C. to honor the commitment of the American people to world peace. Representative Steny Hoyer emphasized the need for a memorial to peace, highlighting the nation's dedication to protecting freedoms and seeking peaceful resolutions. A Peace Garden symbolizes efforts for peaceful resolution of world conflicts amidst a history of violence. The National Peace Garden was approved in 1988 at Hains Point in Washington, DC, with reauthorizations in 1987 and 1992. The Peace Garden was reauthorized twice, with the authorization expiring in 2002. In 1992, Congress authorized a memorial for Thomas Paine, a Revolutionary War patriot known for inspiring the American Revolution. Representative William Lacy Clay emphasized Paine's impact on oppressed peoples worldwide. The authorization for the Thomas Paine memorial was extended once, expiring in 2003. Additionally, in 1998, Congress authorized a memorial in Washington, DC to honor interdependence. The Council of the District of Columbia authorized a memorial for Benjamin Banneker to be located on the L'Enfant Promenade in Southwest Washington. The authorization expired in 2005, and a bill to reauthorize the memorial in the 111th Congress did not progress. In November 2000, Congress authorized the Frederick Douglass Gardens, Inc., to establish a memorial and gardens in honor of Frederick Douglass, a prominent leader in the abolitionist movement. Representative James Hansen highlighted Douglass's significance as a defender of human rights and eloquent orator. Douglass, born into slavery in 1818, escaped to the North and became a respected voice against racial injustice. The Frederick Douglass Memorial Gardens, Inc. expressed a preference for a site near the Douglass Memorial Bridge in Southeast Washington, but no action was taken by Congress. The authorization for the Frederick Douglass Memorial expired in 2008, with one unsuccessful attempt to reauthorize it during the 110th Congress. In May 2008, Congress authorized the Marion Park Project instead. Daniel N. Wenk supported legislation for a Brigadier General Francis Marion Memorial in testimony before the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. Brigadier General Francis Marion Memorial meets criteria for commemoration in DC. He led Williamsburg Militia in SC, delaying British forces with innovative tactics. Marion Park Project chose site at Marion Park. National Capital Planning Commission supported the site. Marion Memorial was reauthorized once. The Marion Memorial was reauthorized once, with authorization expiring on May 8, 2018. Congress authorized the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Fund to create a visitor center at the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in November 2003 to educate the public about the Vietnam War. The Vietnam Veterans Memorial has helped heal the nation's wounds from the Vietnam War, with over 4.4 million visitors annually. The Vietnam Veterans Memorial Fund was authorized to create a visitor center at the Vietnam Veterans Memorial to educate the public about the Vietnam War. The proposed visitor center would provide an educational experience for visitors through self-guided tours, remembrance displays, and historical exhibits. It was approved by the NCPC and CFA in 2015. The Vietnam Veterans Memorial Fund announced in 2018 their decision not to extend the authorization to build a visitor center at the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, despite legislation introduced for an extension. The fund had previously received two extensions for the project."
