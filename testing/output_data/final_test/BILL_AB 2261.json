    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 98.7 of the Labor Code is amended to read: 98.7. (a) (1) Any person who believes they have been discriminated against can file a complaint with the Labor Commissioner within six months. The Labor Commissioner will investigate discrimination complaints and inform complainants of their right to file a separate complaint with the United States Department of Labor. Each complaint of unlawful discharge or discrimination is assigned to a discrimination complaint investigator who submits an investigation report to the Labor Commissioner. The division can initiate investigations of employers suspected of violating labor laws. The Labor Commissioner may designate officials to handle these investigations. The Labor Commissioner may designate officials to receive and review investigation reports, conduct interviews with relevant parties, and review documents related to the complaint. The Labor Commissioner may hold an investigative hearing if necessary to establish facts, where the investigation report will be part of the record. The complainant and employer can present further evidence, and the Labor Commissioner can issue subpoenas as needed. If a violation is found by the Labor Commissioner, the employer must cease the violation, remedy it by rehiring or reimbursing lost wages, pay attorney's fees, and post notices. The Labor Commissioner may seek temporary relief from the court if necessary. If no violation is found, the Labor Commissioner will notify the parties involved. If the Labor Commissioner determines no violation, the complaint will be dismissed. The complainant may be directed to pay attorney's fees if the complaint was frivolous. The complainant can then bring an action in court to determine if a violation occurred. The Labor Commissioner determines violations and advises complainants of their right to seek relief in court. Appropriate relief may include reinstatement, lost wages reimbursement, and other compensation. If a complaint is dismissed, the complainant can take legal action in court or file a complaint with the United States Department of Labor. The Labor Commissioner's determination of violations allows complainants to seek relief in court, including reinstatement and lost wages reimbursement. A timely complaint against the state program with the United States Department of Labor can stay the dismissal of the division complaint until a determination is made. The Labor Commissioner must notify the parties of their decision within 60 days of the complaint filing. Appeals can be made by the complainant or employer. The appeal process allows the complainant or employer to appeal the Labor Commissioner's determination to the Director of Industrial Relations within 10 days. The appeal must specify the grounds for considering the determination unjust or unlawful. The director may modify, affirm, or reverse the determination and notify the parties within 10 days. Employee rights under this section do not limit other legal remedies available. In enforcing this section, there is no need to exhaust administrative remedies. Section 98.74 of the Labor Code allows the division to investigate and take action against employers who discriminate against individuals, in addition to receiving employee complaints under Section 98.7."
