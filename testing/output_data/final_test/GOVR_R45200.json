The country enforces strict internet censorship to maintain social stability, control online content, and monitor platforms like WeChat for any sensitive issues. WeChat is used for more than just messaging and calling, including mobile payments, but all data shared on the app is also shared with the Chinese government. Censors at the 2017 Communist Party Congress restricted certain words and expressions on social media while promoting government-friendly information.
