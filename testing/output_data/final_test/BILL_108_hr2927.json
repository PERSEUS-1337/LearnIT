The Secretary allocates funds to grant recipients based on population size, with a minimum of 20% going to local governments with 50,000-250,000 residents and 50% to those with less than 50,000. No grants can be withheld or have additional requirements imposed unless consistent with the authority provided in the chapter. The Federal share of project costs is 80%, with exceptions for orphan highways accessing Federal or Indian land. Grant recipients can use up to 2% of funds for administrative costs.
