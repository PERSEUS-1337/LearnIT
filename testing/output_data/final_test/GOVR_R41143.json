The most common PTA is a free trade agreement (FTA), like NAFTA or the U.S.-Australian FTA. PTAs are allowed by the WTO under certain conditions, but their impact on trade liberalization is debated. Preferential trade agreements (PTAs) can either promote trade creation or trade diversion, depending on whether they increase trade among member countries or divert it from non-members. PTAs have become essential in global trade diplomacy as countries aim to enhance market access for their exporters and investors, especially with the slowdown in multilateral trade liberalization efforts. The proliferation of Preferential Trade Agreements (PTAs), particularly Free Trade Agreements (FTAs), has increased significantly in recent years. The European Union (EU) has played a central role in this trend, with around 50% of world trade now covered by PTAs. The EU has the largest network of PTAs, with 35 agreements involving the EU out of 199 in force globally. The EU has the largest network of PTAs in the world, with 35 agreements involving the EU out of 199 globally. The EU trades with only 10 WTO members under the MFN regime, accounting for 43.9% of its total merchandise imports in 2009. After a moratorium on negotiating new PTAs, the EU began negotiating more ambitious FTAs in 2007, aiming for greater trade benefits and comprehensive agreements. The EU has been negotiating more ambitious FTAs since 2007 with countries like South Korea, India, Canada, and ASEAN. The US FTA policy has been on hold since 2007, with no new agreements being negotiated. The Obama Administration's focus has shifted to the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) Agreement negotiations after approving FTAs with South Korea, Panama, Columbia, and Peru. The U.S. business community is urging for a more active FTA policy to prevent losing market share to EU competitors with more favorable access to foreign markets. This report compares EU's PTAs with U.S. PTAs and discusses the implications for the U.S. economy's need for export growth. Europe's PTAs can be categorized into four groups based on their primary motives: agreements with neighboring countries, agreements for stability around EU borders, agreements with developing countries in Africa, the Caribbean, and the Pacific, and agreements with more distant countries to prevent discrimination against EU exports. The EU's primary objective in its PTAs is to neutralize discrimination against EU exports and secure commercial benefits. Unlike the US, the EU does not use a standard model for its PTAs, negotiating agreements flexibly to suit specific cases. PTAs are often in the form of Association Agreements, which cover political, security, economic, trade, and human rights issues, requiring ratification by all EU member states. The EU's preferential trade agreements aim to eliminate discrimination against EU exports and secure commercial benefits. These agreements, such as Association Agreements, cover various issues and require ratification by all EU member states. The EU is open to considering accession or alternative relationships with close neighbors in Europe, including countries like Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, Switzerland, Central and Eastern European countries, Western Balkans, and Turkey. The EU has expanded its membership from 12 to 27 states over the past 15 years through accession agreements. New members had to terminate their bilateral trade agreements with foreign countries as part of their EU obligations. The enlarged EU membership increases market access to the EU's preferential partners. The EU's free trade agreements with EFTA members (Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, Switzerland) date back to the 1970s. The European Economic Area (EEA) was established in 1994, extending the EU's internal market to Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway. The EEA allows participation in the internal market without full EU membership responsibilities, covering freedom of movement of goods, persons, services, and capital. This arrangement aims to provide economic benefits of a single market without political ties. Relations between the EU and Switzerland are governed by the EC-Switzerland Agreement of 1972, which includes free trade and 16 bilateral agreements. The Western Balkans have special relations with the EU through the Stabilization and Association Process (SAP) to align legislation with the EU. The Western Balkan countries are in the process of aligning their legislation with the EU in exchange for potential EU membership. Stabilization and association agreements have been signed with Croatia, FYROM, Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, and Montenegro. Free trade agreements have been established with Albania, Montenegro, and Bosnia and Herzegovina, focusing on liberalizing trade, aligning rules with the EU, and protecting intellectual property. Nonreciprocal duty-free access has been granted to the Western Balkan countries by the EU. The EU has granted duty-free access to Western Balkan countries for most goods until 2010. The European Commission supports Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, and Serbia's accession to the WTO. Accession negotiations with Turkey began in 2005, with trade continuing under the EU-Turkey Customs Union. Agriculture integration into the customs union has no set timetable. Turkey also participates in the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership. The EU has customs union agreements with Andorra, San Marino, and the Faeroe Islands. Free trade agreements with countries bordering the EU aim to promote economic prosperity and political stability. Trade relations with Mediterranean countries are governed by these agreements. The EU has trade agreements with Mediterranean countries under the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership. These agreements provide duty-free access to the EU market for manufactured goods and preferential treatment for agricultural and fisheries exports. Negotiations are ongoing to liberalize trade in services with Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco, and Tunisia. Talks for an FTA with the Gulf Cooperation Council have seen some suspensions. Negotiations between the EU and Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) have been ongoing for two decades, with suspensions. Talks started in 1990, paused for the GCC customs union creation, and resumed in 2002 with a 5% unified customs tariff. The proposed FTA aims to enhance economic integration, liberalize trade in goods and services, and cover various areas like government procurement, intellectual property rights, and dispute settlement. Despite progress on most chapters, negotiations were last suspended in December 2008. Negotiations between the EU and Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) have been ongoing for two decades, with suspensions. Sticking points include GCC's opposition to EU demands for political and human rights reforms, and the EU's heavy carbon tax on oil and petrochemicals. In spring 2008, the EU and Ukraine began negotiations on a new Association Agreement, making good progress after 17 rounds. The agreement will replace a 1998 Partnership and Cooperation Agreement and include a comprehensive FTA. The EU has Cooperation Agreements with several neighboring countries, including Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Krygyzstan, Moldova, and Uzbekistan. Ukraine aspires to be an EU candidate, but its membership prospects are still debated. The EU also has agreements with 71 developing countries in Africa, the Caribbean, and the Pacific, mainly former colonies of EU member states, aimed at development and poverty alleviation. The EU and ACP countries are negotiating EPAs to create FTAs, enhance trade cooperation, and support development. The EPAs aim to remove trade barriers on a nondiscriminatory basis. The EU-Caribbean EPA was signed in 2008, with ongoing negotiations for full EPAs with African and Pacific groupings. The EU's GSP program offers duty-free access to 176 developing countries and territories until December 31, 2011. These agreements aim to secure commercial benefits for EU exporters and investors by providing preferential access to foreign markets. The PTAs with more distant countries contain provisions that are deeper, wider, and more reciprocal than previous agreements. The EU's PTAs aim to secure commercial benefits for EU exporters by providing preferential access to foreign markets. These agreements include regional negotiations with ASEAN, the Andean Community, Central America, and Mercosur, as well as bilateral agreements with Canada, Chile, India, Mexico, South Africa, and the Republic of Korea. Despite slow progress in regional negotiations, the EU has negotiated FTAs with Peru and Colombia and started bilateral FTA talks with Singapore and Malaysia. EU member states and stakeholders advocate for promoting regional economic integration based on the EU's own experience. The EU's promotion of a distinctive European approach to integration is a key element of its foreign policy. Negotiations for region-to-region Association Agreements with the Andean Community and Central American countries began in 2007, focusing on political dialogue, cooperation, and a free trade area. Disruptions occurred in the Andean negotiations due to disagreements, but bilateral free trade agreement negotiations with Colombia and Peru progressed successfully. On March 1, 2010, the EU signed free trade agreements with Colombia and Peru. Negotiations for an Association Agreement with Central American countries were concluded in May 2010. Talks with ASEAN began in June 2007 but faced challenges, including disagreements over Burma (Myanmar) and economic differences within the region. The EU decided to exclude Laos and Cambodia from negotiations due to limited progress, leading to a \"pause\" in regional talks at the end of 2008. The EU paused regional negotiations with ASEAN and began informal talks with individual members like Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam for separate FTAs. This approach was criticized for dividing ASEAN. The EU continued to express interest in a regional framework while also launching bilateral FTA negotiations with Singapore and Malaysia. Negotiations with Mercosur countries began in 2001. Negotiations between the EU and Mercosur countries began in 2001 to strengthen trade ties. Talks were put on hold in 2004 due to disagreements over farm subsidies, quotas, and tariffs. Agriculture accounts for a significant portion of Mercosur exports to the EU. Negotiations between the EU and Mercosur countries resumed in 2010 with the aim of reaching a comprehensive free trade agreement. Key factors for success include Mercosur meeting EU's high ambitions and EU offering increased market access for agricultural products. EU prefers regional agreements but also negotiates bilateral deals. Overcoming trade diversion from US PTAs is a motivation for EU. EU-Canadian CETA negotiations started in 2009. Negotiations for an EU-Canadian Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) began in 2009, with multiple rounds held since then. The agreement aims to cover various aspects of trade and sustainable development, with both sides hoping to finalize it by 2011. Canada is the EU's 11th most important trading partner, while the EU is Canada's second most important trading partner after the United States. The EU and Canada have a significant trade relationship, with high-value goods dominating trade. Agriculture and energy also play a role. Services, foreign direct investment, and an FTA with Chile are key aspects of the trade dynamics. The EU-Chile FTA includes liberalization of services, government procurement, investment, and intellectual property rights. Future efforts will focus on trade in agriculture and services. FTA negotiations with India started in 2007, with slow progress due to disagreements on tariff liberalization, government procurement, and intellectual property protection. India is resisting EU demands on intellectual property protection and nontrade issues in the agreement. There is also resistance to WTO-plus liberalization of regulatory barriers in services and investment. The EU is hesitant to grant better access for Indian investors and service suppliers due to India's lower labor costs and skilled workforce. Despite European resistance, trade negotiators on both sides remain optimistic about reaching a deal for greater mobility of Indian labor force in Europe. Negotiations for a free trade agreement between Mexico and the EU began in October 1996, with the agreement coming into force on July 1, 2000. The FTA covers trade in goods and services, public procurement, competition policy, intellectual property rights, investment, and dispute settlement. The EU-Mexico Free Trade Agreement (FTA) aimed to eliminate duties on nonagricultural imports by 2003 for the EU and by 2007 for Mexico. The agreement also included provisions for liberalizing agricultural and fishery trade gradually. Mexico granted the EU treatment equivalent to that of the US and Canada under NAFTA in services and government procurement. Additionally, the FTA aimed to increase cooperation in various sectors such as mining, energy, transportation, tourism, statistics, and science and technology. Mexico sought to reduce its reliance on the US for exports and attract more foreign direct investment. The EU-South Korea Free Trade Agreement (FTA) aimed to reduce dependence on the US for exports and attract more foreign direct investment from Europe. The FTA included liberalization of tariffs, nontariff barriers, and services, with new disciplines in competition policy, intellectual property rights, labor, and the environment. Industrial tariffs on over 96% of traded items will be eliminated over five years, with some agricultural exceptions. Korea will recognize many European standards under the agreement. The EU-South Korea Free Trade Agreement (FTA) aims to reduce dependence on the US for exports and attract more foreign direct investment from Europe. It includes liberalization of tariffs, nontariff barriers, and services, with new disciplines in competition policy, intellectual property rights, labor, and the environment. Industrial tariffs on over 96% of traded items will be eliminated over five years, with some agricultural exceptions. Korea will recognize many European standards and certificates, eliminating bureaucratic barriers to trade. The FTA also addresses nontariff barriers in the auto sector and offers protection for EU geographical indicators. Trade relations between the EU and South Africa are governed by a Trade, Development, and Cooperation Agreement (TDCA) aimed at establishing an FTA by 2012 covering 90% of bilateral trade. The EU-South Africa Free Trade Agreement (FTA) aims to cover 90% of bilateral trade by 2012. It includes asymmetrical liberalization in favor of South African goods and services, with duty-free status for 86% of imports from the EU and 95% of South African exports. Some sensitive agricultural products are excluded, and negotiations were stalled over concerns about wine and spirits. A compromise allowed for the sale of South African wine in exchange for stopping the use of \"port\" and \"sherry\" names on export wines. The EU-South Africa Free Trade Agreement aims to cover 90% of bilateral trade by 2012, with asymmetrical liberalization in favor of South African goods. Negotiations were stalled over concerns about wine and spirits, leading to a compromise to stop using \"port\" and \"sherry\" names on export wines. PTAs are complex agreements with technical text, and comparisons between EU and U.S. agreements show differences in overall approaches and provisions. The EU and U.S. PTAs are compared in terms of trade coverage and competition. The U.S. approach to FTAs is based on NAFTA, with standardized scope and uniform provisions. U.S. FTAs are symmetrical and reciprocal, focusing on reciprocal market access. In contrast, Europe's PTAs have been characterized by differentiation, flexibility, and modest ambition in market-opening. EU agreements vary based on partner development levels and importance. The EU's PTA policy considers factors like partner development levels and importance for European security. Agreements with different regions offer varying trade benefits, with emerging markets aligning with other countries' PTAs. The EU tends to include asymmetric provisions in its agreements, favoring either the partner or itself. The EU's PTA policy considers partner development levels and security importance. Agreements offer varying trade benefits, with asymmetric provisions favoring either party. WTO-plus provisions in PTAs go beyond current WTO obligations, such as tariff reductions and commitments in areas like customs, SPS measures, TBT, services, government procurement, state trading enterprises, state aid, and IPR. The analysis of WTO-plus provisions in U.S. and EU PTAs found a high degree of similarity in coverage. Differences mainly related to services, trade-related investment measures, and enforceability. U.S. agreements included trade-related services and investment obligations, while EU agreements did not. U.S. agreements also had more legally enforceable provisions. The U.S. agreements had more legally enforceable obligations concerning trade-related investment measures, technical barriers to trade, and services compared to EU agreements. The U.S. FTAs aimed for almost 100% elimination of tariffs on industrial products, with some remaining for agricultural products. U.S. PTA partners agreed to gradually eliminate all tariff lines, while using longer transition times to protect sensitive industries. The EU's tariff cuts cover nearly 100% of industrial products but exclude many agricultural lines like beef, poultry, dairy, olive oil, rice, barley, wheat, rye, sugar, and wine. EU agreements vary in coverage and flexibility, allowing partners to reintroduce tariffs if needed. US PTAs are more comprehensive in services and IPR coverage, going beyond GATS obligations. The U.S. agreements exceed GATS obligations in financial and telecommunications services, using a more liberalizing \"negative\" list approach. U.S. PTAs extend copyright terms to 75 years and trademark protection to 10 years. In contrast, the EU's approach to services and IPR is less ambitious, using a positive-list approach for services and focusing on compliance with existing international standards for IPR. The EU uses PTAs to promote TRIPs-plus protection for geographical indicators, facing opposition from the US and other partners. Both US and EU PTAs are generally WTO-consistent, not WTO-plus, except for tighter time limitations on safeguard actions in US PTAs. EU's approach to SPS measures is considered WTO-minus in the LSE study. The EU's approach to SPS measures allows for social considerations in risk assessment, potentially making it easier to restrict trade for public health and safety reasons. EU PTAs include WTO-extra provisions not covered by current WTO regulations, extending beyond current obligations more frequently than US PTAs. The Bruegel analysis found that EU PTAs contain almost four times as many WTO-extra provisions as U.S. agreements. Recent EU agreements have incorporated even more of these provisions. Only 8 out of 38 WTO-extra provisions in U.S. and EU PTAs are legally enforceable, covering areas like intellectual property rights, investment, and movement of capital. Other areas like anti-corruption, environment, and labor are mostly in U.S. agreements, while competition policy and social matters are in EU agreements only. The Bruegel study found that EU PTAs have more WTO-extra provisions than U.S. agreements, with recent EU agreements incorporating even more of these provisions. Only a small number of legally enforceable WTO-extra provisions are present in either U.S. or EU PTAs, focusing on areas like intellectual property rights, investment, and movement of capital. New provisions breaking ground compared to existing WTO agreements are limited to environment and labor standards for U.S. agreements and competition policy for EU agreements. These provisions address regulatory issues that have been contentious in previous attempts to incorporate them into WTO rules. The Bruegel study found that EU PTAs have more WTO-extra provisions than U.S. agreements, focusing on areas like intellectual property rights, investment, and movement of capital. EU agreements also include provisions on environment and labor standards, while U.S. agreements include competition policy provisions. EU's PTAs were valued at $511 billion in exports in 2008, representing 27% of the EU's exports to the world, with potential increase to $669 billion including other PTAs. The EU's PTAs cover a significant amount of trade, accounting for 70% of total EU exports. U.S. PTAs, on the other hand, represent 40% of U.S. total trade. The EU's PTAs cover 70% of total EU exports, while U.S. PTAs represent 40% of U.S. total trade. The United States has additional agreements with Korea, Colombia, and Panama, covering 44% of total U.S. exports valued at $571 billion. Comparatively, the EU's PTAs cover 74% of total EU exports valued at $3.5 trillion. This data can be used to evaluate the impact of U.S. and EU PTAs on international trade dynamics and regulatory influence. The EU's PTAs cover a significant portion of total exports, with U.S. PTAs lagging behind in comparison. The EU's PTAs cover nearly twice as much exports in percentage terms and seven times as much in value terms than U.S. PTAs. However, the data may be biased as the amount of trade covered by preferential agreements may not reflect the actual trade conducted on a preferential basis. The EU's participation in PTAs may not provide a discriminatory advantage in international trade agenda control. Concerns about falling behind and trade diversion have led to negotiations for separate but similar PTAs with five trading partners. The EU and the US are negotiating separate PTAs with five trading partners (Israel, Mexico, Morocco, Chile, and Jordan). Market share gains from these initiatives have been limited, indicating a lack of demonstrable success in improving market shares. The EU and the US are negotiating PTAs with five trading partners, including Israel. Market share gains from these initiatives have been limited, with various factors influencing trading partner imports. Israel has trade agreements with the US and the EU, but neither has significantly increased their market share since the agreements took effect. The US and EU have trade agreements with Israel, but neither has seen a significant increase in market share since the agreements took effect. The US market share in Israel averaged 17.4% in the 1990s, dropped to 15% from 2000 to 2008, and further decreased to 12.5% from 2005 to 2008. The EU's market share in Israel averaged 46.7% from 1982 to 1999, but dropped to 42.3% from 2001 to 2008 after the agreement. The free trade agreement with Mexico is the largest of the overlapping agreements. The US market share of Mexico's imports under NAFTA decreased from 74.5% in 1995-2000 to 56.5% in 2001-2008. The EU's market share in Mexico slightly increased from 10.4% in 1993-2000 to 11.0% in 2001-2008. The EU lost over 1% market share in the 1990s after its agreement with Mexico in June 2000. The implementation of free trade agreements with Jordan and Chile has led to a decline in import market share for both the United States and the EU. In Jordan, the U.S. share of imports decreased from 9.2% to 6.1% post-FTA implementation, while the EU's share dropped from 31.0% to 25.2%. In Chile, both the U.S. and EU also lost market share post-FTA implementation, with the U.S. market share averaging 15% compared to 16.2% before the agreement. In January 2004, the U.S. market share averaged 15%, compared to 16.2% from 1999-2003 and 17.4% from 1997-2003. The EU's market share dropped by 3%-4% depending on the time frame. Since the FTA was implemented in March 2005, the EU market share averaged 13.3%, compared to 16.2% for the previous five years and 17.3% for the previous eight years. Morocco is the only country where the FTA led to a small rise in market share for both the U.S. and EU. The U.S. gained 0.5% market share post-FTA implementation in December 2001, rising from 4.5% to 5.0% from 1998-2005 to 2006-2008. The EU gained about 1.5% market share post-FTA implementation in March 2000, going from 54.5% to 56.0% from 1998-2000 to 2001-2008. Europe's PTA program has implications for the multilateral trading system and U.S. trade policy. Assessments of how Europe's PTAs impact the multilateral trading system vary, with some believing PTAs can boost multilateral activity by serving as a prod for negotiations. Examples like NAFTA and the EU's single market progress are cited as instances where PTAs have pushed multilateral trade negotiations to successful conclusions. Europe's PTAs have not significantly liberalized trade and have not been a driving force in the Doha Round of multilateral trade negotiations. The EU's PTA partners are small, limiting the impact on EU exports. Potential FTAs with larger partners like Korea or Canada could lead to more trade diversion and push for further negotiations. The EU's PTAs have not greatly liberalized trade or influenced the Doha Round of multilateral trade talks. Potential FTAs with larger partners like Korea or Canada could prompt more trade diversion and encourage further negotiations. EU officials aim for future PTAs to be comprehensive, liberalize most trade, and exceed current WTO rules to support the multilateral trading system. The EU-Korea FTA, finalized in 2010, aligns with these criteria. The EU-Korea FTA, implemented in 2010, aligns with the EU's aim for comprehensive PTAs that exceed WTO rules to support multilateralism. While similar to the U.S.-Korea FTA, it differs in certain aspects such as tariff commitments for industrial goods and lacks an investment chapter. The EU faces challenges in negotiating deep PTAs with other trading partners. Efforts to finalize PTA negotiations with Mercosur and the Gulf Cooperation Council have not succeeded, while attempts to start new PTA negotiations with India and ASEAN have been slow or abandoned. The impact of PTAs on multilateral trade is debated, with concerns about discrimination, complex rules of origin, and the spread of competing regulatory structures. The outcome of the EU's FTA negotiation with Canada remains uncertain. Some analysts view Europe's PTAs as a threat to the multilateral trading system due to the focus on extending rules and regulations rather than opening closed sectors to trade. The competition between the U.S. and EU in extending their rules lacks a clear plan for strengthening the multilateral trading system. The EU's new FTAs with Korea and Canada could impact future U.S. FTA debates. The EU's PTAs have raised concerns about their impact on U.S. markets, but most have been with small countries or those already having FTAs with the U.S. U.S. multinational corporations in Europe stand to benefit from EU trade agreements. However, the EU-Korea FTA and potential EU-Canada FTA could change this dynamic, especially for U.S. exporters and manufacturers. The EU-Korea FTA raises concerns for U.S. exporters, as European producers may gain a price advantage in the Korean market. Studies estimate over $30 billion in lost exports and 200,000 job losses for the U.S. if the U.S.-Korea FTA is not implemented. Proponents argue for rapid implementation to neutralize any disadvantage. The EU-Korea FTA raises concerns for U.S. exporters due to potential price advantages for European producers in the Korean market. Implementation of the U.S.-Korea FTA awaits approval from the Korean Parliament. EU negotiations with Canada over an ambitious FTA could impact the U.S. FTA debate, with a focus on tariffs, services, nontariff barriers, intellectual property protection, and government procurement. The involvement of Canadian provinces is seen as crucial, as they have jurisdiction over key investment opportunities and labor market competencies, potentially expanding the scope of the agreement. The EU is also pushing for increased patent protection for pharmaceutical companies in the negotiations. The EU-Canada FTA aims to increase access to the EU market for various sectors like agriculture, aerospace, chemicals, and automotive. The absence of a US-EU FTA is highlighted, with potential significant trade and welfare effects if established. Increased patent protection for pharmaceutical companies is a key focus in the negotiations. The EU's PTA policy could have significant effects on trade and welfare, as well as on the multilateral system. There are differing opinions on whether such an FTA would encourage other countries to raise ambitions in the Doha Round or if it would be too threatening to most WTO members. The EU's Global Europe policy aims to negotiate WTO-compliant PTAs with middle-sized economies like Korea, India, and Canada to gain better market access without major concessions in agriculture and services barriers. The EU is considering targeting bigger economies like the United States, China, Japan, and Australia for bilateral negotiations on PTAs. These negotiations could bring significant economic benefits but may face opposition in sectors like agriculture and services. Some European economists believe that the competitiveness of EU firms is more important than reducing protective barriers. Some European economists argue that the competitiveness of EU firms relies more on internal market conditions than on opening export markets through PTA negotiations. They suggest focusing on unilateral liberalization of protected sectors and domestic market reforms, including completing a single market for services by removing barriers between member states. This would help lower service prices relative to goods and improve access for industrial and services firms. European policymakers may need to explore alternative approaches to trade liberalization with the United States and China if public support in the EU is lacking for significant agricultural reforms and services liberalization. Possibilities include intensified regulatory cooperation, sector-specific initiatives, and tariff elimination for the United States, while negotiations with China currently occur under a Partnership and Cooperation Agreement. An improved Partnership and Cooperation Agreement (PCA) is suggested as an alternative to multilateral agreements or FTAs for addressing bilateral trade tensions and improving market access for European companies. Stakeholders in Europe may prioritize concluding multilateral agreements to ensure smooth and predictable trade flows globally, aligning with EU and U.S. trading interests."
