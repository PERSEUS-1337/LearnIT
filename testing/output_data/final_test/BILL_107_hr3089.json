    "content": "The \"Renewable and Distributed Energy Net Metering Act\" aims to enable small businesses and individuals to reduce electric bills, promote private investment in renewable energy, diversify the nation's electric supply, reduce price volatility, and protect the environment by encouraging clean energy sources through net metering. The \"Renewable and Distributed Energy Net Metering Act\" promotes private investment in renewable energy and encourages clean energy sources through net metering. SEC. 215 introduces State Net Metering Programs under Part II of the Federal Power Act. The \"Renewable and Distributed Energy Net Metering Act\" defines terms like customer generator, net metering, and qualified generation unit to regulate electricity generation and distribution. The \"Renewable and Distributed Energy Net Metering Act\" defines terms like metering, qualified generation unit, retail electric supplier, and local distribution system in relation to electricity generation and distribution regulations. Each State, electric utility, and Federal power marketing agency should consider establishing or modifying a net metering program to meet minimum Federal standards. The \"Renewable and Distributed Energy Net Metering Act\" requires States, electric utilities, and Federal power marketing agencies to establish a net metering program meeting minimum Federal standards within 2 years. If not done, the Commission will establish a program consistent with the standards. Qualified generation units for net metering must be fuel cell, solar, wind, or biomass-powered with a capacity of up to 200 kilowatts located on specific premises. The net metering program requires qualified generation units up to 200 kilowatts to be located on customer-controlled premises, operate in parallel with the electric supplier, primarily offset the customer's energy requirements, and not provide credits for other locations. Retail electric suppliers must offer net metering service upon request, with customer-generators covering any incremental costs. The customer-generator must cover any additional costs for equipment or services required to meet safety or performance standards. If deemed beneficial, they may need to use a specific meter and pay for its installation. Rates and charges for retail electric service to customer-generators, including net metering, are also addressed. The rates and charges for retail electric service to customer-generators, including net metering, shall be established by the appropriate regulatory authority. Safety and performance standards for qualified generation units and net metering systems must meet national electrical code requirements. State authority allows for the adoption of additional standards for net metering programs, as long as they align with the section's purposes and do not overly burden customer-generators. This includes the ability for states to establish requirements or incentives beyond the minimum standards set forth in the section. State authority allows for the adoption of additional standards for net metering programs, such as higher capacity limits, varying credit amounts, limits on aggregate generating capacity, and administrative procedures. These standards must align with the section's purposes and not overly burden customer-generators. The net metering program should not impose an unfair burden on customer-generators. Net metering credits are not considered wholesale sales under Federal or State law."
