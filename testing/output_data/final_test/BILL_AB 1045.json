    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The California Integrated Waste Management Act of 1989 promotes composting to reduce waste. Despite leading in waste reduction, California still disposes of over 15 million tons of compostable organics annually. Composting provides environmental and agricultural benefits by reducing volatile organic compounds and ammonia. The Economic and Technology Advancement Advisory Committee under the California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 has identified composting as a cost-effective technology for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Composting in agriculture and landscaping offers soil-carbon sequestration, water quality benefits, erosion control, and reduces the need for synthetic fertilizers and pesticides. The state aims to reduce organic waste in the waste stream by 50% by 2020 and requires organic waste generators producing four cubic yards or more of organic waste a week to recycle this material. The state aims to reduce organic waste in landfills by promoting composting facilities and ensuring state regulations consider emissions reduction and water quality benefits. The California Environmental Protection Agency, along with other agencies, will develop policies to divert organic waste by using it as compost feedstock and promoting its appropriate use statewide. The California Environmental Protection Agency aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by promoting compost use on working lands, such as agricultural land and rangeland. They will work with the Department of Food and Agriculture to achieve this goal and ensure proper coordination of agency regulations. The California Environmental Protection Agency will assess the state's progress in developing organic waste processing infrastructure to meet state goals. They will consult with stakeholders regularly and hold public workshops annually for feedback. The California Environmental Protection Agency will develop recommendations for promoting organic waste processing and recycling infrastructure statewide by January 1, 2017. A policy will be created to coordinate permitting and regulation of composting facilities while protecting the environment. This section will be in effect until January 1, 2021, and will be repealed on that date unless a later statute extends it."
