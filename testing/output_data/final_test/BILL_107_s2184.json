    "content": "AUTHORITY TO ISSUE A RULE RELATING TO ERGONOMICS. The National Academy of Sciences reported on musculoskeletal disorders in the workplace, highlighting the significant impact on workers and the economy. The Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 aims to ensure safe working conditions for all workers. The need for a workplace ergonomics standard is crucial to address musculoskeletal disorders and protect workers. The cost of compliance and scientific evidence should be considered in developing this standard. The Secretary of Labor is required to issue a final rule on ergonomics within 2 years of the Act's enactment. The rule must address work-related musculoskeletal disorders and workplace ergonomic hazards, taking effect within 90 days of promulgation. The final rule on ergonomics must address workplace ergonomic hazards, emphasize injury prevention, and cover all industries with feasible measures to control hazards. The final rule on ergonomics must consider the best available evidence, employer practices, and existing standards to prevent work-related musculoskeletal disorders. The Secretary of Labor must have specific authorization from Congress to issue a new ergonomic rule, ensuring it does not expand the application of State workers' compensation laws. This does not restrict the Secretary's authority under the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 to adopt health or safety standards. Additionally, the Secretary must provide information and training materials before implementing the new rule. Labor must develop information, training materials, and an outreach program to assist employers and employees with compliance to the new rule before it becomes effective."
