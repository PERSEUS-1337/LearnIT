    "content": "The \"Bright Idea Act of 2007\" is the short title of the Act. It establishes technical standards for general service lamps. The \"Bright Idea Act of 2007\" mandates the Secretary of Energy to establish technical standards for general service lamps, consulting with various stakeholders. The initial standards should provide illumination levels equivalent to those in 2007, with a minimum lumens per watt rating of 30. The \"Bright Idea Act of 2007\" requires the Secretary of Energy to set standards for general service lamps, with a minimum lumens per watt rating of 30 by 2013 and 45 by 2018. If lamps meeting these standards are widely available at comparable costs, at least 95% of lamps sold must meet the requirements. The Secretary of Energy sets standards for general service lamps, with exceptions for certain lamps where compliance is not feasible. Revised standards can be made after consultation with interested parties. The Secretary of Energy will periodically report to specific committees on the development of standards for lamps and related technology, including findings and recommendations. The Secretary of Energy may conduct a lighting technology research and development program to support the advancement of lamps and related technologies in the United States. The program aims to assist manufacturers in producing general service lamps that meet specific efficiency standards. $10,000,000 is authorized for each fiscal year from 2008 to 2013, and the program will end on September 30, 2015. Additionally, there is a separate consumer education program outlined in Section 4. The Secretary of Energy, in consultation with the Federal Trade Commission, will implement a national consumer education program promoting energy-efficient light bulbs. $1,000,000 is authorized annually from 2008 to 2014. Additionally, a report on mercury reduction in light bulb manufacturing and a report on lamp labeling will be submitted to Congress. SEC. 6. REPORT ON LAMP LABELING. The Commissioner of the Federal Trade Commission, in cooperation with the EPA and the Secretary of Energy, will submit a report to Congress on current lamp labeling practices and recommendations for a national standard within 1 year of this Act's enactment."
