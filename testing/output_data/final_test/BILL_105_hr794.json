This Act amends the Internal Revenue Code to provide this option for taxpayers. Every individual with an adjusted income tax liability of $5 or more can designate $5 to the House of Representatives General Election Trust Fund. The taxpayer can choose the Democratic Party, Republican Party, or another political party as the recipient. Adjusted income tax liability is the tax liability reduced by any amount designated to the Presidential Election Campaign Fund. Joint returns are also covered.

The manner and time of designation follow the rules of section 6096.
