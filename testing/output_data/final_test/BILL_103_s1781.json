    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Black Lung Benefits Restoration Act\" and references amendments to the Black Lung Benefits Act. Section 2 addresses benefit overpayments. The \"Black Lung Benefits Restoration Act\" adds Section 436, stating that repayment of benefits is not required if a claim is denied unless fraud is involved. The trust fund must refund payments made for benefits if a claim is denied, and reimburse operators for benefits paid if a claim is denied. The Secretary determines eligibility for benefits. The responsible operator must start paying benefits within 30 days of a determination or award. Failure to make timely payments results in the determination or award becoming final. SEC. 3. EVIDENCE. Section 422 (30 U.S.C. 932) is amended to allow up to 3 medical examinations and interpretations of chest roentgenograms as evidence for benefits claims. The responsible operator or trust fund may require claimants to undergo medical examinations at no cost, but cannot submit more exams than the claimant. Additionally, they can offer one set of chest roentgenogram results as evidence. The administrative law judge may require a miner to undergo a medical examination if there is uncertainty about their eligibility for benefits. The complete pulmonary evaluation and any hospitalization or medical treatment records related to pulmonary diseases must be submitted as evidence. The miner may undergo medical examinations for benefits eligibility. Medical records related to pulmonary diseases can be submitted as evidence. Parties can provide interpretive medical opinions based on chest roentgenograms, blood gas studies, or pulmonary function studies. Requests for modification of denied claims are treated as new claims. The treating physician's opinion can be considered. The treating physician's opinion holds substantial weight in determining a miner's eligibility for benefits if they are board-certified in a relevant specialty. Medical examinations for pneumoconiosis diagnosis include physical exams and clinical studies. SEC. 4. SURVIVOR BENEFITS. The amendment to Section 422 (30 U.S.C. 932) states that if an eligible survivor files a claim for benefits and the miner was receiving benefits for pneumoconiosis or was totally disabled by pneumoconiosis at the time of death, the death will be considered due to pneumoconiosis unless proven otherwise. Additionally, rules for widows and widowers are outlined, specifying that those married to the miner for less than 9 months preceding the death are not eligible for benefits. The widow or widower of a miner must have been married for less than 9 months preceding the miner's death to qualify for survivor benefits, unless they were the natural or adoptive parent of the miner's child. If the widow or widower remarries before the age of 50, they are disqualified from receiving benefits. Additionally, there will be no increase in survivor benefits due to a remarriage. SEC. 5. RESPONSIBLE OPERATOR. Section 422(h) (30 U.S.C. 932(h)) is amended to include a process for determining operator liability under the Act. The Secretary must conduct an investigation, provide notice, and hold a hearing to determine if an operator meets the criteria for liability. If a hearing is requested, the decision must be issued within 120 days and is not subject to further review. If a hearing is deemed to be without reasonable grounds, the administrative law judge may assess penalties. The administrative law judge may assess the operator for the costs of the proceeding if a hearing is deemed to be without reasonable grounds (not to exceed $750). SEC. 6. ATTORNEY FEES. Section 422 (30 U.S.C. 932) is amended to allow claimants entitled to benefits to receive all reasonable costs and expenses, including expert witness and attorney's fees, incurred in administrative or judicial proceedings. This applies to any prior determinations made on the claim. The court will determine and assess all reasonable costs and expenses, including expert witness and attorney's fees, incurred by the claimant in connection with judicial proceedings. The determination of these costs and expenses must be made within 60 days of the claimant's petition submission, and they should be paid within 45 days of the determination unless a motion to reconsider is filed. The court assesses costs and expenses, including expert witness and attorney's fees, for claimants in judicial proceedings. Payment must be made within 45 days of determination, unless a motion to reconsider is pending. If an operator pays these costs and the claimant is later found ineligible for benefits, the operator will be reimbursed. The Act applies after enactment and does not affect claims filed before that date and refiled later. SEC. 7. ADMINISTRATION. Appeals to the Benefits Review Board require an order by an administrative law judge. The Secretary of Labor cannot delegate the authority to refuse to acquiesce in a Federal court decision to the Benefits Review Board. SEC. 8. REFILING. Claims under the Black Lung Benefits Act filed after January 1, 1982, can be refiled for de novo review on the merits after the enactment of this Act. SEC. 9. DEFINITIONS. The Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 is amended to include provisions related to coke ovens and operations reasonably related to them. The Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 is amended to include provisions related to coke ovens and operations reasonably related to them, such as working at a coke oven or in any operation related to it.

The Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 is amended to include provisions related to coke ovens and operations reasonably related to them. Amendments also specify that pneumoconiosis can result from working in a coal mine or coke oven. Additionally, a Benefits Review Board is established. The Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act is amended to change the appointment and compensation process for Benefits Review Board members.

The Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act is amended to cap the rate of compensation for Benefits Review Board members at the maximum rate specified in section 5376 of title 5, United States Code.
