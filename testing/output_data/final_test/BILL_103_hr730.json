    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"National Biological Resources Research and Development Act\". The Congress acknowledges the inadequate information on biological resources, the potential consequences of their loss, and the need for increased research to ensure sustainable use. Existing laws and programs are deemed uncoordinated and insufficient. The Act defines \"biological resources\" as the variety of living organisms and their ecosystems, \"genetic diversity\" as differences within and among populations, \"species diversity\" as the richness of species in a location, and \"community diversity\" as variety among species assemblages in different areas. The term \"United States\" encompasses all States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, American Samoa, and other territories under US jurisdiction. The term \"United States\" includes all States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, American Samoa, and other territories under US jurisdiction. The Act aims to coordinate efforts to gather data on biological resources, support research, and promote understanding of their importance. The Act aims to promote better understanding of the importance of biological resources and prevent biological impoverishment. The Act establishes a National Center for Biological Resources (Research and Development) to promote understanding and prevent biological impoverishment. The National Center for Biological Resources (Research and Development) is established within the Smithsonian Institution to set research priorities, promote knowledge of the biota in the United States, and make this knowledge accessible to researchers worldwide. The Center will be administered by a Director and will focus on understanding the composition, distribution, status, ecological relationships, and economic value of the biota, as well as the impact of human activities on it. The National Center for Biological Resources (Research and Development) within the Smithsonian Institution aims to enhance knowledge of biota for sustainable development. It prepares lists and maps of biotic communities in decline, publishes information on flora and fauna, and assesses factors affecting their development. The National Center for Biological Resources aims to publish information on flora and fauna, identify areas in need of study, provide research funding, and make recommendations on data management. The National Center for Biological Resources focuses on technical management of data collection, training, fundraising, and researching natural products. A Board of Trustees provides advice on policies and operations. The Board of Trustees for the National Center for Biological Resources consists of 19 members representing various organizations such as the Smithsonian Institution, Fish and Wildlife Service, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, National Park Service, Department of Energy, National Science Foundation, Agricultural Research Service, Environmental Protection Agency, and Forest Service. The Board of Trustees for the National Center for Biological Resources includes representatives from various organizations such as the Forest Service, Bureau of Land Management, Department of Defense, State biological surveys, private organizations with large biological databases, nonprofit research institutions, universities, institutions with biological specimen collections, and companies developing products from biotic resources. Members listed under clauses (xii) through (xv) of subparagraph (A) are appointed by the President from nominees recommended by the National Academy of Sciences. Board of Trustees members serve five-year terms and may serve multiple terms. Non-government members receive travel expenses and per diem in accordance with section 5703 of title 5, United States Code. The advisory board members serve without compensation, but are reimbursed for travel expenses and per diem. The Board of Trustees selects a Chairman, and funding arrangements are overseen by the Center's Director. The Director of the Center will arrange administrative support for the Board of Trustees. $10,000,000 is authorized for fiscal years 1994, 1995, and 1996 for this purpose."
