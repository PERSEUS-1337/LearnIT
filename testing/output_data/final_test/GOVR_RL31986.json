    "content": "Senator Lugar introduced S. 2144, the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, FY2005, replacing S. 925. The House Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 2004 and 2005 (H.R. 1950) aimed to authorize the Department of State's operations and programs at over $27 billion for FY2004 and FY2005. It also addressed U.S. policy on the Israeli-Palestinian peace plan, export controls, security assistance to certain foreign countries, and funding for the U.N. Population Fund. The House passed the foreign relations authorization legislation on July 16, 2003, providing authority for State Department and related foreign policy agencies. This legislation authorizes foreign policy programs, enacts changes in U.S. foreign policy, and allows Congress to influence executive branch management of foreign policy. Authorization for agencies like USAID and U.S. economic, development, and military assistance is typically included in this legislation. Authorization of foreign policy agencies and programs is required before expenditure of Foreign Operations and State Department appropriations. The foreign relations authorization legislation authorizes State Department spending for various activities such as salaries, passport processing, embassy operations, and public diplomacy. Congress had reauthorized foreign policy agencies every two years until 1994, with P.L. 107-228 being the first standalone bill since then. Authorization is required before expenditure of Foreign Operations and State Department appropriations. The 108th Congress legislation on foreign relations authorization includes H.R. 1950 and S. 2144, which cover various foreign policy issues and activities such as nonproliferation, human rights, and international environment issues. The Senate bill authorizes spending for FY2005 with divisions for Foreign Relations and Foreign Assistance, while H.R. 1950 includes divisions for Millennium Challenge Account, Peace Corps Expansion Act, Department of State Authorization Act, and Defense Trade and Security Assistance. Since 1994, Belarusian President Aleksandr Lukashenko has established an authoritarian regime, earning the title of \"Europe's last dictator\" from the Bush Administration. The State Department's 2002 Human Rights report criticized Belarus's poor human rights record, citing restrictions on democracy, free speech, and religion. Lukashenko has extended his term through illegitimate means, suppressed opposition, closed independent media, and faced sanctions from the US and EU. The visa ban against Lukashenko and other top Belarusian officials was lifted in April 2003 after the OSCE office was reopened. Belarus allegedly has ties with rogue regimes and has been involved in arms transfers to states supporting terrorism. Congressional concerns about Belarus are reflected in H.R. 1950, which authorizes U.S. aid to assist Belarusian democracy and increased broadcasting to Belarus by Voice. Section 1602 authorizes increased broadcasting to Belarus by Voice of America and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty. Section 1603 calls for sanctions on Belarus until democratization conditions are met. Section 1604 urges the President to coordinate with European countries for similar measures. Section 1605 requires reporting on weapons sales to regimes supporting terrorism and the wealth of Belarusian leaders. This title focuses on aid for Belarus democratization and VOA broadcasting. Title XVI of the bill focuses on aid for Belarus democratization and VOA and RFE/RL broadcasts. Some U.S. allies in Europe may have concerns about potential sanctions against Belarus leading to isolation of Lukashenko. However, supporters argue that sanctions and support for pro-democracy groups are necessary to depose Lukashenko's regime and restore stability in the region. The current Senate bill (S. 2144) does not contain provisions similar to the previous version (S. 925). U.S. farmers are adopting genetically engineered crops to lower costs, but face trade barriers in foreign markets like the EU. Both S. 2144 and H.R. 1950 aim to address these issues. Both S. 2144 and H.R. 1950 aim to promote agricultural biotechnology in international trade and development. The Senate bill authorizes support for outreach activities on the benefits of biotechnology, while the House version requires providing scientific evidence to other countries and developing a program demonstrating biotechnology benefits for the developing world. The biotechnology industry and agricultural groups strongly support a provision in legislation promoting U.S. agricultural biotechnology products in foreign markets. Some consumer and environmental advocacy organizations express safety concerns, while federal agencies are already working to open foreign markets to U.S. biotechnology. State is the lead department for the Cartagena Biosafety Protocol. The Cartagena Biosafety Protocol, established in January 2000 under the U.N. Convention on Biological Diversity, regulates the safe handling and movement of bio-engineered organisms. The United States, not a party to the Protocol, works with other countries to ensure smooth implementation without hindering U.S. biotechnology exports. USDA promotes GE products in international trade through various programs, including technical assistance and dispute resolution. The 2002 farm bill created the Biotechnology and Trade Section 3204. Section 3204 of the 2002 farm bill created the Biotechnology and Trade Program to address barriers to U.S. agricultural exports involving biotechnology, food safety, and disease. It authorizes annual appropriations of up to $6 million through FY2007. Additionally, Section 702 of S. 2144 amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to declare aliens inadmissible if they support a child being abducted from a parent in the United States. Section 275, H.R. 1950 addresses inadmissible aliens involved in child abduction cases, requiring reports to Congress on such cases. It also mandates the Secretary of State to establish procedures for U.S. embassies in child abduction situations. Additionally, Section 276 adds the \"spouse of the abducted child\" to the list of inadmissible relatives, with an annual reporting requirement. H.R. 1950 (Section 730) includes a \"Sense of Congress on\" provision. H.R. 1950 (Section 730) includes a \"Sense of Congress on Climate Change\" urging the U.S. to lead in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, participate in international climate change negotiations, and protect economic interests while recognizing shared responsibility. The House bill H.R. 1950 urges the U.S. to lead in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and participate in international climate change negotiations. The Senate bill S. 2144 does not include the same provisions as the previous bill S. 925. Both bills acknowledge the impact of manmade greenhouse gases on global climate change and the United States' role in the UNFCCC. The United States has chosen not to join the Kyoto Protocol for legally binding greenhouse gas reductions but supports other nations' efforts. President Bush rejected the Protocol in 2001, opting for voluntary domestic actions instead of mandatory regulations. The current U.S. policy emphasizes voluntary initiatives to address climate change risks and asserts a leadership role in reducing these risks. The curr_chunk discusses the proposal for U.S. participation in a future binding treaty on climate change, emphasizing the need for developing country involvement and protecting U.S. economic interests. It also mentions international copyright protection and treaties related to intellectual property rights. Various treaties establish minimum protection and enforcement standards for copyright and intellectual property rights, including the Agreement on TRIPS, the Berne Convention, and the WIPO Internet Treaties. WIPO and WTO provide legal-technical assistance to developing countries for enhancing technical cooperation activities. WIPO has assisted over 130 developing and least developed countries in TRIPS implementation, providing technical cooperation and training assistance. Developing countries had until January 1, 2000, and least developed countries until January 1, 2005, to comply with TRIPS obligations. Developed countries, like the United States, are required to offer technical cooperation upon request to assist in implementation. The US has been providing assistance through its IPR Training Coordination Group, involving federal agencies and private sector industry associations. The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) is actively combating IPR piracy through various efforts, including bilateral and regional free trade agreements, WIPO Internet Treaties, and a focus on reducing counterfeiting of optical media products. They are also addressing trademark counterfeiting, internet piracy, and unauthorized software use, with attention to profits from piracy funding terrorist organizations. Some developing and least developed countries have made progress in implementing laws against IPR infringement, while others have recently enacted laws but lack enforcement. Section 814 of S. 2144 authorizes $5 million for combating copyright piracy in non-OECD countries, providing assistance such as equipment and training for law enforcement. The provision in Section 814 of S. 2144 authorizes $5 million for combating copyright piracy in non-OECD countries through training and assistance in compliance with international IPR treaty obligations. The program will be carried out by the Bureau of Economic Affairs of the State Department, with a focus on promoting integration into the global intellectual property system. The Foreign Relations Authorization Act for FY2004 and FY2005, Section 1810 of H.R. 1950, authorizes funds for addressing deficiencies in IPR enforcement in countries on the USTR Priority Watch List. Priority would be given to these countries, but others could also receive assistance. The House bill H.R. 1950 authorizes $15 million for FY2004 and FY2005 to support democracy-building efforts in Cuba. It is U.S. policy to support freedom and democracy in Cuba, including human rights dissidents, journalists, and opposition groups. The funds are designated only for Cuba-related programs and should not be diverted. The House bill H.R. 1950 authorizes $15 million for democracy-building in Cuba, while S. 2144 does not contain similar language. USAID has provided assistance to increase information on democracy and human rights in Cuba, supporting NGOs for a peaceful transition to democracy. The annual foreign operations appropriations bill has provided increasing funding for various Cuba projects, with the Administration requesting $9 million for public diplomacy in FY2005. The United States also supports democratization in Cuba through the National Endowment for Democracy, with funding steadily increasing over the years. Funding levels for NED's Cuba projects in FY2004 are not yet available. The House provision to increase funding for democracy building in Cuba is supported as a response to the Cuban government's crackdown on human rights activists in 2003. However, the Administration has already been funding significant democracy building efforts in Cuba for years. The House provision would more than double the estimated $7 million provided for such efforts in FY2004, in addition to the $25 million spent on another program supporting the Cuban people through Radio and TV Marti. The Senate and House bills for FY2005 funding of international broadcasting activities differ, with the Senate bill authorizing $584.3 million and the House bill setting funding at $650.9 million. Both bills include provisions for a Mideast Broadcasting Network, building on previous initiatives like the Middle East Radio Network and the proposed U.S. Middle East Television Network. Congress has allocated funds for these programs in response to the Cuban government's crackdown on human rights activists. In FY2003, Congress allocated $30.5 million for Middle East Television Network and radio broadcasting to Iraq. Both Senate and House bills authorized grants for a Mideast/Middle East Broadcasting Network, establishing a Board of Directors and emphasizing independence from the U.S. government. Some experts warn of potential backlash from fundamentalists in the Muslim/Arab world. The proposed H.R. 1950 aims to reorganize international broadcasting by creating the United States International Broadcasting Agency, headed by the Broadcasting Board of Governors. It would establish a full-time director appointed by the Board to improve accountability and authority. The Senate bill does not have a similar provision. Title V, subtitle B of H.R. 1950 aims to establish an office within the BBG to counter internet blocking globally, develop technology to prevent blocking, and pressure repressive governments. This provision is not present in S. 925. Other measures in H.R. 1950 include expanding broadcasting to North Korea, improving broadcasting to Cuba, and countering jamming of radio and TV Marti. Radio Free Asia improved broadcasting measures to Cuba and counter jamming of radio and TV Marti. A coordinator for International Free Media was established in the Department of State. A pilot program to promote travel and tourism in the United States via international broadcasting was initiated. Measures were taken to prevent the elimination of international broadcasting in Eastern Europe. H.R. 1950 would authorize funding of the International Organizations accounts within the State Department budget at $1,040.8 million for U.S. Contributions to International Organizations (CIO) for FY2005, while S. 2144 would authorize CIO at $1,109.2 million for the same year. H.R. 1950 and S. 2144 address U.S. contributions to international peacekeeping. H.R. 1950 authorizes necessary funds, while S. 2144 authorizes $650 million for FY2005. The legislation also focuses on implementing the Brahimi Report, which offers recommendations for reforming UN peacekeeping operations. The U.N. Security Council has implemented recommendations from the Brahimi Panel, with Secretary-General Annan issuing reports on progress. Section 402 of S. 925 requires a report assessing implementation progress, including strengthening the U.N.'s capability for deploying civilian police and rule of law teams in emergencies. The report also covers U.S. government policies supporting these recommendations. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee is interested in how the U.S. government is contributing to the development of a more robust U.N. peacekeeping capacity, especially in civilian police and rule of law areas. Section 402 of S. 2144 requires a report on this, with a reporting date of 120 days after enactment. Congress limited U.S. assessed payments to U.N. peacekeeping accounts to 25% as of October 1, 1995, due to increasing costs of U.N. peacekeeping operations. The U.S. government faced increasing costs in U.N. peacekeeping operations due to a gap in assessment levels. In 2001, the U.S. peacekeeping assessment level started to decrease following a U.N. General Assembly agreement. Congress later set a 25% cap for peacekeeping payments in 2002. In 2002, Congress raised the 25% cap for peacekeeping payments to a range of 28.15% for CY2001 to 27.4% for CY2004 to enable full payment of U.S. peacekeeping assessments. Senate recommended setting the assessment limit at 27.4% beyond 2004, while the House recommended 27.1% for 2005 and 2006. S. 925 would establish 27.4% as the assessment level cap for the future, while H.R. 1950 would set it at 27.1% for two years. The recommendation for U.S. peacekeeping contributions beyond 2006 would require a decision to either maintain the 27.1% cap or change it. In May 2000, Israel was temporarily admitted to the Western European and Others Group at the United Nations, allowing for potential participation in U.N. bodies. Israel's eligibility for membership in U.N. bodies is hindered by the lack of consensus within the Asian Group. The Western European and Others Group was considered as an alternative location for Israel, but a decision has not been made yet. Israel's membership in U.N. bodies is hindered by disputes in the Middle East. WEOG decided to review Israel's membership after four years, with limitations on nominations for the first two years. Israel was elected as a candidate from WEOG to the Open-Ended Working Group on Disarmament in 2003. Additionally, Israel was elected to the U.N. Commission on Narcotic Drugs for a four-year term starting in 2004. Congress has expressed concerns about Israel's lack of equal access for full participation in the U.N. due to not being a member of a regional group. The current legislation, Section 721 of P. L. 106-113, aims to promote Israel's full participation in the United Nations by encouraging acceptance into regional blocs and addressing persistent inequities. Congress requires the Secretary of State to report on actions taken to ensure Israel's equal participation in the UN. The report submitted to Congress in January 2003 emphasized efforts to gain Israel's admittance into WEOG or similar groups at UN agencies outside of New York. U.S. officials are required to pursue diplomatic efforts to upgrade Israel's membership in the Western European and Others Group at the United Nations. The Secretary of State must provide semiannual reports on progress until September 30, 2005. The Committee urged extension of WEOG membership in UN bodies and affiliated agencies worldwide. S. 925 and S. 2144 do not contain similar provisions. Section 105 of S. 2144 and Section 115 of H.R. 1950 allocate $50 million for settling Jewish migrants in Israel. Section 806 of S. 2144 and Section 223 of H.R. 1950 call for a report on U.S. efforts to promote wider Israeli diplomatic relations. The bill aims to expand Israel's diplomatic relations by encouraging other nations to develop and maintain ties. The Senate bill and House bill aim to expand Israel's diplomatic relations by encouraging other nations to develop and maintain ties. Additionally, the bills call for the Administration to press for membership in the International Red Cross for the Israeli Magan David Adom society, which was refused due to symbol issues. The Senate bill establishes a non-profit Middle East Foundation for grants in various areas, while the House bill has unique provisions. H.R. 1950 includes provisions not in the Senate bill, such as adding details to the State Department terrorism report on attacks against U.S. citizens in Israel, Israeli administered territory, and Palestinian territory. It also lists U.S. citizens killed by Palestinian terrorists since 1993 and urges UNRWA to address funding issues. H.R. 1950 includes provisions urging UNRWA to resettle refugees, eliminate anti-Jewish textbooks, stop terrorist funding diversion, and anti-Israeli incitement. It extends FMF assistance to Israel and aid to Egypt. It ensures financial record access for U.S. aid to the West Bank and Gaza, with funds not used for terrorism. Members of Congress support recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital. The passage discusses resolutions and bills related to the U.S. embassy moving to Jerusalem, with disagreements on Jerusalem's final status. Sections in S. 2144 and H.R. 1950 address funding restrictions for a U.S. Consulate in east Jerusalem and the listing of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. Additionally, H.R. 1950 allows people born in Jerusalem to list Israel as their birthplace on U.S. passports. The House passed H.R. 1950 with provisions related to Mexico, including a possible bilateral migration accord. The Senate did not pass a similar bill in July 2003 or in March 2004. President Vicente Fox has advocated for a migration accord. President Vicente Fox and President Bush have discussed a migration accord to legalize undocumented Mexican workers in the United States. Cabinet-level negotiations were planned to address migration and labor issues between the two countries. Various proposals were being considered by the Administration and Congress to deal with the existence of numerous undocumented workers. Leaders of both U.S. political parties were seeking to gain favor with Hispanic voters. The two presidents pledged to reach agreement on a range of issues. In 2001, Presidents Fox and Bush aimed to reach an agreement on border safety, a worker program, and undocumented Mexicans in the US. After the 9/11 attacks, focus shifted to border security. Progress was noted in migrant safety in 2002, but negotiations for a migration accord faced challenges. When H.R. 1950 was marked up in the House International Relations Committee in 2003, Representative Menendez proposed an amendment for a migration accord with Mexico. Representative Ballenger later offered a substitute amendment focusing on key issues for both nations, including opening Mexico's state-run petroleum monopoly to reform and U.S. investment. The House International Relations Committee proposed a migration accord with Mexico in 2003, focusing on key issues such as opening Mexico's state-run petroleum monopoly to reform and U.S. investment. Representative Gallegly also raised concerns about extradition and law enforcement cooperation in any migration agreement between the countries. Congress stated the need to negotiate a migration accord with Mexico addressing key concerns in both nations. In 2003, the House International Relations Committee proposed a migration accord with Mexico, focusing on key issues like opening PEMEX to U.S. oil companies and addressing extradition and law enforcement issues. Mexican officials criticized the provisions related to PEMEX and extradition as interference in domestic affairs. The Mexican Presidency stated that negotiating a migration agreement in exchange for foreign investment in PEMEX was unacceptable, emphasizing modernization efforts to keep oil in Mexican ownership. During floor consideration on July 15, 2003, the House approved an amendment proposing negotiations between the United States and Mexico for a comprehensive migration accord. This agreement should address key concerns for both nations, including extradition and law enforcement cooperation. The House approved an amendment expressing the sense of Congress that the U.S. should prioritize treaty negotiations with Mexico for a wastewater treatment facility. It also urged the Mexican government to work with their Supreme Court to reconsider a ruling affecting extradition issues. The House approved restrictions on consular ID cards issued by Mexican consulates, citing concerns about their use by illegal aliens for benefits and potential involvement in money-laundering and terrorist activity. The House approved restrictions on consular ID cards issued by Mexican consulates to prevent misuse for benefits, money-laundering, and terrorist activity. The amendment requires verification of citizenship through birth certificates, voter IDs, and passports, with automated record-keeping to prevent fraud. Non-compliance could lead to suspension of visa issuance to nationals of the country. Supporters of the amendment argued that consular ID card issuance needed control, while opponents saw it as an attack on Mexican identity. The Senate considered providing $100 million in rural development assistance to Mexico, but did not pass the bill. The Peace Corps Charter for the 21st Century Act was included in the Senate bill. The 21st Century Act, part of the Senate bill S. 2144, responds to the Bush Administration's initiative to double the Peace Corps size. Both S. 2144 and H.R. 1950 support an expanded volunteer force with training in infectious diseases. Reporting requirements include plans to increase volunteers, country security concerns, and recruitment efforts. The two bills reaffirm the Peace Corps' independence and focus on utilizing returned volunteers (RPCVs) for programs in Muslim countries. They differ in authorization levels and reporting requirements, with H.R. 1950 requiring more reports and placing recruiting responsibility on the Peace Corps. H.R. 1950 and S. 2144 differ in the minimum readjustment allowance for volunteers, Advisory Council composition, and grant program details. H.R. 1950 raises the allowance to $275 in FY2004 and $300 thereafter, with 6 RPCVs on the Council. S. 2144 sets the allowance at $275, with 4 RPCVs on a 7-member Council. Both bills authorize a grant program for RPCVs, with S. 2144 focusing on projects promoting understanding of other cultures and allocating $10 million in additional funds. H.R. 1950 authorizes additional funds for the Peace Corps budget, expanding the Crisis Corps volunteers and supporting the goal of doubling the Peace Corps by FY2007. However, budget constraints may hinder rapid growth, with the FY2003 request of $317 million reduced to $295 million in the final appropriations bill. The administration's request for $317 million for the Peace Corps was reduced to $295 million in the final appropriations bill. Senate appropriators expressed concerns about the expansion plan being \"overly ambitious\" and suggested that it may need to be drawn out over more than five years. The FY2004 request of $359 million was cut to $325 million, with $310 million in the regular Peace Corps account and $15 million transferred from the Global HIV/AIDS account. Public diplomacy involves U.S. government activities to promote American culture and understanding of U.S. policies by foreign publics. The House and Senate bills include funding authorization and new program authority for government exchange programs, international information programs, and U.S. government international broadcasting. Title VI, S. 2144, focuses on developing an international information strategy for regions with significant Muslim populations. It also includes provisions for public diplomacy training in the Foreign Service and expanding educational and cultural exchanges to promote religious freedom, information technology, and sports diplomacy. Title II of Div C, Subtitle A emphasizes the importance of public diplomacy in U.S. foreign policy. It calls for coordination among federal agencies, establishment of a public diplomacy reserve corps, and development of an annual public diplomacy strategy. The strategy should specify goals, agency responsibilities, and resources needed, with a focus on assessing impact on target audiences worldwide and by region. Public diplomacy is established as a priority. Section 204 of H.R. 1950 prioritizes public diplomacy in recruiting and training Foreign Service officers, particularly those proficient in languages spoken in predominantly Muslim countries. It also includes reporting requirements, enhancements to the Advisory Commission on Public Diplomacy, a pilot program to improve literacy in foreign countries, and a directive to include predominantly Muslim populated countries in sub-Saharan Africa in the Department's public diplomacy activities. H.R. 1950, Title II of Div C, Subtitle C focuses on exchange initiatives for predominantly Muslim countries, including expanding Fulbright and Humphrey Fellowship programs, journalism training, grants for teaching English overseas, and library training exchange. It also authorizes spending levels for the Department of State and related agencies. S. 2144 contains similar measures, such as authorizing a U.S. diplomacy center and raising pay allowances for Foreign Service Officers. Between 1992 and 1996, responsibility for decisions regarding export of commercial communications satellites was transferred from the State Department to the Commerce Department. In 1997, issues arose in connection with the launch of U.S.-built satellites by China, raising concerns about whether U.S. satellite manufacturers were abiding by export licenses granted by the Commerce Department. Congress directed export control measures to address potential military information sharing with China. The transfer of export control responsibility for U.S.-built satellites from the State Department to the Commerce Department in 1992-1996 raised concerns. Congress later directed the return of control to the State Department in 1999. The controversy lies in the competitive disadvantage faced by U.S. companies due to delays in license approval. This shift in jurisdiction was attributed to U.S. satellite manufacturers losing market share to foreign companies in 2000. Congress directed the Secretary of State to establish an export regime with expedited approval for exports to NATO allies and major non-NATO allies in 2000. The FY2000 State Department authorization act included expedited approval for exports to NATO allies and major non-NATO allies. Efforts to shift jurisdiction over satellite exports back to the Commerce Department have continued. In the 108th Congress, there was a proposal to leave the decision on agency jurisdiction to the President for exports to NATO countries or major non-NATO allies. The Security Assistance Act reduced Congress's review time for exporting commercial communications satellites to Russia, Ukraine, and Kazakhstan from 30 days to 15 days. H.R. 1950 passed by the House changes the time period back to 30 days. S. 2144 includes a provision exempting marketing information related to satellite sales to NATO countries, Australia, Japan, or New Zealand from export licensing requirements. This exemption does not apply to defense items and services. Title XVI of Div. C, H.R. 1950 addresses the effort to achieve peace between Israelis and Palestinians, emphasizing the need for new Palestinian leaders free from terror ties and promoting democratic reforms. The United States will support the creation of a Palestinian state once new leaders and security arrangements are in place, with certain aspects of sovereignty being provisional until a final settlement in the Middle East. The President emphasized the need for Israeli forces to withdraw to pre-2000 positions and for Israeli settlement in occupied territories to cease. He outlined a vision for peace based on UN Resolutions 242 and 338, with a negotiated settlement leading to Israeli withdrawal to recognized borders. The Quartet developed a three-phase roadmap for a two-state solution, focusing on ending terror and violence, building Palestinian institutions, and improving humanitarian and economic conditions. The Roadmap for peace in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict was presented on April 30, 2003. It includes phases focusing on security, normalization of Palestinian life, dismantlement of Israeli settlement outposts, and the creation of an independent Palestinian state with provisional borders. The Roadmap calls for Israeli actions to accompany those of the Palestinians, with differing views on whether it should be a parallel or sequential process. Title XVII, Sec. 1602 of the President's June 24, 2002 speech declares Israel's security as a national interest of the United States. It supports a two-state solution for Israel's security, contingent on a peaceful, democratic Palestinian state that renounces terrorism. Sec. 1603 offers assistance to Palestinians post-peace agreement, while Sec. 1604 requires Palestinian government transformation for peace talks. Sec. 1605 prohibits recognition of a Palestinian state until it aligns with the President's vision, and Sec. 1606 allows aid post-international peace agreement. The bill bans aid to the Palestinian state with provisional borders from Phase II of the Roadmap, but the President can waive this if in U.S. national interest. Assistance for economic development, democratization, security cooperation with Israel, and compensating Palestinian refugees is allowed. Senate bill has no similar provisions. H.R. 1950 requires annual certification by the Secretary of State regarding control of items on the Missile Technology Control Regime Annex. The certification must include reasons for any failures to meet the requirement, updates to International Traffic in Arms Regulations and Export Administration Regulations, and any overlaps or omissions in regulations related to MTCR Annex items. Section 1201 of H.R. 1950 aims to strengthen controls by assigning specific accountability for U.S. missile-related activities. It requires reporting on international transfers of MTCR equipment or technology, analysis of regulatory effectiveness, and designates the Secretary of Commerce and the Attorney General for oversight. The proposed changes in Section 1201 of H.R. 1950 include adding the Secretary of Commerce and the Attorney General to the review and certification process for U.S. missile-related activities. This may lead to improvements in missile nonproliferation efforts. However, the proposal of an annual certification may face opposition, raising questions about its purpose and potential legal implications. The proposed changes in H.R. 1950 call for cooperation among key government agencies to improve control of MTCR-related items. There is debate over whether the goal is to establish legal accountability or enhance cooperation. Alternative legislative language could achieve the same intent. H.R. 1950 also proposes seeking international restrictions on offensive ballistic missiles with a range of at least 300 km. This proposal aims to address offensive ballistic missiles with a range of at least 300 km and a payload capacity of 500 kg or more, applying to both conventional and weapons of mass destruction-armed missiles. It excludes surface-to-air missiles, ballistic missile defense interceptor missiles, cruise missiles, and unmanned aerial vehicles. The binding instrument could take the form of a multilateral treaty, United Nations Security Council Resolution, or another international law instrument, with enforcement measures such as interdiction, seizure, and impoundment of illicit shipments. The Senate version of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, S. 2144, does not address the establishment of a binding agreement restricting the trade of ballistic missiles. It is unclear if the proposed instrument would replace the MTCR and the International Code of Conduct Against Ballistic Missile Proliferation (ICOC), or if it would complement these voluntary arrangements. U.S. sponsorship of a Security Council resolution or multilateral treaty could be controversial. Attempts to include enforcement mechanisms like interdiction, seizure, and impoundment may face resistance. Some experts question the need for an international enforcement organization to oversee illicit ballistic missile shipments. Congress members supporting nonproliferation efforts may back legislation to strengthen controls. Skepticism exists regarding the compliance of proliferating countries with a new treaty. The U.S. aerospace industry, particularly companies involved in missile interceptors, cruise missiles, and UAVs, may support the treaty as it does not restrict these systems. The U.S. aerospace industry, particularly companies involved in missile interceptors, cruise missiles, and UAVs, may support the treaty as it does not include restrictions on these systems. H.R. 1950 calls for U.S. sponsorship of a U.N. Security Council Resolution prohibiting North Korea from transferring missile-related equipment and technology, which could receive support from countries concerned about North Korean missile proliferation to countries like Iran, Pakistan, and Libya. Proponents of the proposed U.S.-sponsored ballistic missile treaty believe it could hinder North Korean missile sales and impact Iran, Pakistan, and Libya's ballistic programs. Critics argue that a U.N. Security Council resolution may face enforcement challenges, citing the 2002 incident of North Korean SCUDs seized at sea as a legal precedent. Resistance is expected if the resolution allows interdiction without Security Council approval. Some analysts suggest that the resolution would need provisions for Security Council review of evidence and \"probable cause\" before authorizing interdiction or seizure. H.R. 1950, as passed by the House, includes provisions related to export controls and new reporting requirements. Specifically, technical amendments to the Arms Export Control Act are outlined in Sections 1202-1204. Amendments to the Arms Export Control Act (AECA) in Sections 1202-1204 require advance certification to Congress for comprehensive export authorizations over $100 million, repeal clause (B) of paragraph 2 of section 36(c) to establish a 30-day waiting period for satellite launches by Russia, Kazakhstan, and Ukraine, eliminate advance notification for agreements involving the manufacture abroad of significant military equipment valued under $7 million for major defense equipment and under $25 million for other significant military equipment, and establish an accelerated ten-day munitions license approval procedure for Australia and the United Kingdom. The House bill includes provisions for an accelerated ten-day munitions license approval procedure for Australia and the United Kingdom. It also requires the Secretary of State to establish a coordinator for small business affairs in the Office of Defense Trade Controls. Additionally, there are reporting requirements for U.S. missile technology export controls. The House bill includes provisions for an accelerated ten-day munitions license approval procedure for Australia and the United Kingdom, as well as reporting requirements for U.S. missile technology export controls. Section 1206 of the bill aims to expedite administrative functions related to arms exports and requires consultation with relevant departments and the public to assess the benefits of co-locating munitions control functions. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee reported on bills related to foreign assistance for FY2004, with technical amendments to current law including raising dollar thresholds for reporting defense sales to Congress under the Arms Export Control Act. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee reported on bills related to foreign assistance for FY2004, with technical amendments to current law including raising dollar thresholds for reporting defense sales to Congress under the Arms Export Control Act.

The President must make certifications to Congress before issuing authorizations for the export of defense items to eligible countries. Exceptions and exemptions are provided for certain countries like Australia and the United Kingdom. Section 2233 of the AECA outlines restrictions and certifications required for 38(j) exemptions for Australia and the United Kingdom. The President must make specific certifications to Congress before authorizing these exemptions, and an annual report detailing actions with Australia and the UK must be submitted for five years. Section 2238 grants Haiti eligibility for defense purchases for the Coast Guard. H.R. 1950 includes provisions on military assistance. For more information, refer to CRS Reports RL31675 and RL31559 on arms sales and proliferation control regimes. The House bill, in Title XIII, includes provisions for military assistance and arms export control, authorizing funding for various security assistance programs. This includes authorizations for Foreign Military Sales, International Military Education and Training, de-mining assistance, and non-proliferation efforts. The bill also allows for the transfer of certain defense articles to Israel and expands authority to loan material for research and development to friendly foreign countries. Reporting requirements to Congress on cooperative efforts with foreign governments for missile defense are also established. The House bill authorizes funding for security assistance programs, including Foreign Military Sales and non-proliferation efforts. It also allows for the transfer of defense articles to Israel and expands authority to loan material for research and development to friendly foreign countries. Reporting requirements to Congress on cooperative efforts with foreign governments for missile defense are established.

The Senate bill, S. 2144, includes provisions for military assistance and arms export control, authorizing appropriations for security assistance programs like Foreign Military Sales, de-mining assistance, non-proliferation efforts, and International Military Education and Training. It also allows the Secretary of State to receive excess property for foreign governments and waives the requirement for net proceeds from defense articles disposal to be paid to the US. Section 2208 authorizes the President to transfer defense items to Israel in exchange for concessions. Section 2209 allows the transfer of excess items to the War Reserve Stockpile in Israel. Section 2212 permits the disposal of de-mining equipment on a grant basis in foreign countries. Section 2213 updates authorities for providing economic and military assistance. Section 2240 provides statutory authority for certain transfers. Section 2240 authorizes the transfer of naval vessels to Bahrain, Portugal, and Chile. Section 501 in S. 2144 aims to prevent terrorist organizations from being removed from designation without proper review, improving U.S. ability to track and sanction these groups. It removes the current requirement for designation as a Foreign Terrorist Organization. The Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO) designation automatically lapses after two years unless renewed by the Secretary of State. The FTO must petition to be removed within a four-year period, or the Secretary will review the designation. The four-year evaluation and procedures are not subject to judicial review. The ability to revoke the FTO's designation by Congress remains. Placing the burden on the FTO could be useful for the U.S. government in gathering counterterrorism information. The process of petitioning to be removed from the Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO) list can be useful for the U.S. government in gathering counterterrorist intelligence. Designation as a terrorist organization carries legal implications, giving the Executive branch leverage in identifying and controlling terrorist groups. Section 501(b) allows the Secretary to amend an FTO's designation to account for name changes, preventing groups from evading the law. Title XI of H.R. 1950 addresses preventing terrorists and their state sponsors from acquiring arms. It includes amendments to the Arms Export Control Act to strengthen regulations on foreign access.

Section 1106 expands the list of prohibited items under the Arms Export Control Act. Section 1107 of H.R. 1950 strengthens penalties for violations of the Arms Export Control Act, particularly involving state sponsors of terrorism. Section 1108 requires increased coordination for high-risk exports, and Section 1110 mandates a report on foreign-supplied items found in Iraq by coalition forces. No similar measures are present in Senate bill S. 2144. The House bill (H.R. 1950) includes a provision to strengthen the central government in Kabul due to security concerns in Afghanistan. This provision calls for expanding the mandate of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) and increasing the number of forces dedicated to U.S.-led efforts in the region. The House bill includes a provision criticizing the Administration for insufficient resources devoted to Afghan reconstruction. Security concerns in Afghanistan, including regional leaders' control and reluctance of relief organizations to work in certain areas, are highlighted. Administration officials acknowledge security difficulties but believe they are manageable. The departing U.S. commander of the 9,000 troops in Afghanistan stated that security is improving, and the U.S. may start reducing forces by mid-2004. Lt. Gen. Dan McNeill mentioned that most of the country is stable, and the Afghan National Army is progressing towards self-sufficiency. The U.S. has trained 4,500 recruits with plans to expand to 70,000 troops, but it may take several more years to reach that goal. International peacekeeping forces will be necessary in the meantime. The United States and international peacekeeping forces will be required to ensure stability in Afghanistan. Several Africa-related provisions in S. 2144 were removed from the bill, and the amended version contains specific measures for Africa, including the Development Fund for Africa. Section 2101 (d) would technically amend Section 497 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to authorize $17 million for the African Development Foundation in FY2005. The ADF provides small grants to African self-help organizations to alleviate poverty and promote sustainable development in Africa. The Congo Basin Forest Partnership (CBFP) is an association supporting sustainable management of Central African forests and wildlife. It aims to improve residents' quality of life through natural resource management and eco-tourism projects. Title XXII, Subtitle A, Section 2223 endorses CBFP's goals and recommends U.S. participation in FY2005. The State Department reports that private press in Ethiopia is critical of the government but faces restrictions, with journalists often prosecuted for violating press laws. Despite some lack of professionalism and inaccurate reporting, some print media are becoming more responsible. Title XXV, Subtitle B, Section 2513 aims to strengthen journalists' capacity and increase access to printing facilities in Ethiopia. Title XXV, Subtitle B, Section 2514 addresses human rights abuses in Central Africa, supporting efforts to account for past crimes and promote reconciliation. Title XXV, Subtitle B, Section 2514 supports reconciliation efforts in Central Africa by providing funding for justice mechanisms and programs to address gender-based violence. It also requires a report on U.S. actions to implement these policies. Additionally, the African Contingency Operations Training and Assistance (ACOTA) program aims to enhance African militaries' capabilities for peace support operations and humanitarian crises through tailored training programs. The African Contingency Operations Training and Assistance (ACOTA) program aims to improve equipment maintenance, force protection, negotiations skills, logistics support, refugee protection, convoy escort operations, and command and control capabilities in high-threat contexts. It also focuses on enhancing sub-regional organizations' abilities to coordinate peacekeeping operations. Title XXV, Subtitle B, Section 2516 authorizes $15 million for ACOTA in FY2005, with eligibility for participation based on willingness to engage in peace support operations, military capability, human rights record, and adherence to democratic governance principles. The bill recommends providing information about ACOTA training activities to countries prior to implementation, monitoring military units receiving ACOTA training, and reporting on monitoring efforts to Congress. Additionally, debt relief is proposed for the Democratic Republic of Congo emerging from dictatorship. The Democratic Republic of Congo, emerging from dictatorship and armed conflict, has a total external debt of $8.21 billion in 2002, with $2.28 billion owed to the United States. The Heavily Indebted Poor Country Initiative proposes debt cancellation for U.S. loans before June 20, 1999, with an appropriation of $105 million in FY2005 and FY2006. The Africa Society is involved in this debt relief initiative. The Africa Society, at the request of the Treasury Department, implements the National Policy Plan of Action for U.S.-Africa Relations. Chaired by Andrew Young, the Society hosts Africa-focused public policy forums and is involved in debt relief initiatives for the Democratic Republic of Congo. The Africa Society, chaired by Andrew Young, implements the National Policy Plan of Action for U.S.-Africa Relations. They host Africa-focused public policy forums and are involved in debt relief initiatives for the Democratic Republic of Congo. The Society has initiated a joint project with the University of California, Los Angeles to establish a National Research Institute on African Affairs. Title XVIII, Section 1815, of H.R. 1950 authorizes grants to the Africa Society for programs that advance U.S. interests and values in Africa.

They host Africa-focused public policy forums and are involved in debt relief initiatives for the Democratic Republic of Congo. Title XVIII, Section 1815 of H.R. 1950 authorizes grants to the Africa Society for programs that advance U.S. interests and values in Africa. Section 1815 was adopted by voice vote by HIRC on May 8, 2003, after being offered by Representative Donald M. Payne. The House passed H.R. 1950 on July 16, 2003, with provisions relating to Colombia and neighboring countries in the Andean region. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee reported out S. 925 on April 24, 2003, with a provision to repeal the requirement for a semi-annual report. The Senate considered various bills related to Colombia, including S. 925 and S. 2144, reflecting concerns about the conflict in Colombia and the involvement of the United States. HIRC reported out H.R. 1950 with reporting requirements similar to previous legislation. The House-passed bill includes provisions for reporting on Colombian authorities' efforts to combat paramilitary and terrorist organizations, such as FARC and ELN. It also addresses concerns about illicit arms trafficking and illegal activities of paramilitary groups. The House-passed bill includes provisions for reporting on Colombian authorities' efforts to combat paramilitary groups like the AUC, responsible for non-combatant killings and disappearances. The State Department's report found collusion with the AUC by Colombian security forces. Section 708 requires a report on the impact of U.S. assistance in Colombia on neighboring countries. The Committee report criticizes the inadequacy of a State Department report on the impact of U.S. assistance on Ecuador and neighboring countries. It calls for a detailed report addressing the counter-drug repercussions of Plan Colombia, humanitarian and economic development implications, and the authority for U.S. counter-drug assistance. Section 1802 of the Committee report requires the Secretary of State to ensure that all pilots in the U.S. opium eradication program in Colombia are Colombian and well-trained. Local Colombian police pilots are preferred for their familiarity with the terrain, enhancing efforts to eradicate the opium crop that fuels U.S. heroin use. The opium crop in Colombia fuels U.S. heroin use, with efforts to reduce involvement of U.S. private contractors. Legislation includes provisions for international narcotics control programs, with funding for the Andean Counterdrug Initiative. The bill allocates $731 million for the Andean Counterdrug Initiative to combat narcotic trafficking and terrorism in Colombia. It maintains limits on the number of U.S. military and contract employees in Colombia, prohibits military personnel from engaging in combat operations, and conditions assistance on human rights respect. Senate approved amendments related to Colombia and Andean region assistance, including changing reporting requirements for U.S. personnel involved in anti-narcotics campaigns.

U.S. personnel involved must adhere to personnel caps and human rights conditions set forth in previous legislation. Information on U.S. businesses involved in counter-narcotics activities may be reported as required. Contracts for the Andean Counterdrug Initiative in Colombia, authorized by H.R. 1950, may be included in the annual report on counter-narcotics performance. The Senate bill S. 2144 includes a Congo Basin initiative without specifying funding. Section 1809 of H.R. 1950 authorizes $18.6 million for the Congo Basin Forest Partnership program for fiscal years 2004 and 2005. The CBFP, announced by Secretary of State Colin Powell in 2002, is described as an innovative conservation program for the Congo Basin region. It aims to protect 25,000,000 acres of landscape from logging, highlighting the importance of the region for human livelihoods, species existence, and environmental protection. The initiative was announced at the World Summit on Sustainable Development in 2002 and involves various African countries, the EU, World Bank, ITTO, and NGOs. The United States announced a $12 million per year increase in funding for the Central African Regional Program for the Environment (CARPE) to support the Congo Basin Forest Partnership (CBFP). Non-governmental organizations pledged to match the U.S. government's contribution, with other partners expected to provide additional support. The bill authorizes $16 million annually for CARPE, the lead program for U.S. participation in the CBFP. Congress last enacted a broad foreign assistance authorization act in 1985. The Foreign Assistance Authorization Act, Fiscal Year 2005, Division B of S. 2144 aims to reinforce the Senate Foreign Relations Committee's role in foreign assistance policy making. It provides necessary authorization for program appropriations in FY2005 and updates selected legislative provisions. Committee Chairman Lugar plans to revamp the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 in the future. Division B is divided into five titles, including FY2005 authorizations for most foreign aid programs. Title XII updates and amends existing foreign aid authorities, including additional aid for Haiti. The legislation authorizes about $16.9 billion for 22 foreign assistance programs, matching the account structure of annual Foreign Operations appropriations. The bill increases spending for HIV/AIDS, development aid, assistance to the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, and nonproliferation programs. Title XXII of the legislation addresses the threat of radiological dispersal devices (RDDs) used by terrorists. It requires reports on the threat of a radiological attack on U.S. missions and authorizes aid to foreign countries to address threats posed by radioactive materials. The bill also includes the Global Pathogen Surveillance Act, providing $35 million to enhance developing nations' capability to detect and contain infectious disease outbreaks. The legislation aims to enhance developing nations' disease surveillance capabilities and support global disease monitoring. It includes provisions for expanding CDC facilities overseas and addresses security assistance issues. The Senate measure also covers reporting requirements for U.S. counternarcotics aid to Colombia and the Congo Basin Initiative. Division B of S. 2144 introduces new issues not addressed in H.R. 1950, potentially requiring negotiation between House and Senate. The United States Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act of 2003 authorized $3 billion annually to fight diseases globally, focusing on 12 African countries, Guyana, and Haiti. Some Caribbean leaders and Members of Congress seek to expand assistance to the Caribbean. Some Caribbean leaders and Members of Congress are advocating for expanding assistance to combat HIV/AIDS in the region, arguing that high mobility necessitates a regional approach. Concerns have been raised that only Haiti and Guyana are currently identified to benefit from increased assistance, with calls to include 14 additional Caribbean countries in the legislation. The United States Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act of 2003, H.R. 1298 (P.L. 108-25), added several Caribbean countries to receive assistance, and there is a push to include India due to its high HIV-infected population. Some concerns exist about the allocation of funds towards India in the legislation. Some concerns exist about the allocation of funds towards India in the legislation, with contentious provisions on U.S. international family planning assistance and abortion. The Senate added a provision to reverse the \"Mexico City\" policy, while the House voted to delete a section regarding U.S. funding for the U.N. Population Fund. These issues have been among the most controversial matters in foreign aid legislation for nearly two decades. The U.N. Population Fund (UNFPA) has been a key focus in foreign aid legislation for almost two decades. The United States suspended support for UNFPA in 1985 due to concerns over forced abortions and sterilizations in China. The Kemp-Kasten amendment was passed to block funding to organizations involved in coercive practices. Presidents Reagan and Bush deemed UNFPA in violation of this amendment, a decision reversed by President Clinton in 1993. Since 1993, Congress has appropriated around $25 million annually for UNFPA, with a reduction based on spending in China. However, US support for UNFPA was withheld starting in FY2002 due to concerns about coercive practices in Chinese counties. Despite a State Department team finding no evidence of UNFPA's involvement in coercive programs, Secretary of State Powell froze $34 million in funds in 2002. Secretary of State Powell decided to withhold $34 million in funds from UNFPA in 2002, redirecting them to other family planning activities. Despite no evidence of UNFPA's involvement in coercive practices, the funds were frozen. Congress later approved $34 million for UNFPA in FY2003, contingent on the President certifying UNFPA's non-involvement in coercive programs, which was not done. The President did not make the required determination for UNFPA funding, leading to resources being reprogrammed. Critics argue that U.S. policy undermines the organization's work in over 140 countries. Supporters suggest cutting off support to restore eligibility for U.S. funding. The House International Relations Committee approved a $50 million contribution for UNFPA in FY2004 and FY2005. The Crowley amendment in FY2004 and FY2005 aimed to change UNFPA funding eligibility criteria by requiring the President to find that UNFPA did not directly support coercive activities. The amendment defined specific circumstances that would make UNFPA ineligible for funding. Despite this, the House voted to delete the amendment. The Mexico City Policy, implemented in 1984 by the Reagan Administration, restricted U.S. population aid by cutting support for organizations involved in voluntary abortion activities. The policy was lifted by President Clinton in 1993 but reinstated by President Bush in 2001. Critics argue that the policy may lead to cutbacks in family planning services. Supporters of the Mexico City Policy argue that organizations may cut back on services due to uncertainty about restrictions and fear of losing USAID funding. Critics believe the conditions challenge sovereignty and impose a \"gag\" order on promoting changes to abortion laws. They argue that the policy is unconstitutional and that organizations can use USAID resources for legal activities while using other funds for abortions. Critics argue that the Mexico City Policy restricts organizations from using USAID funds for abortions or lobbying, leading to a debate in the Senate over an amendment by Senator Boxer to overturn the policy. The amendment would allow foreign NGOs to receive U.S. funds for health services as long as they comply with local laws and U.S. regulations. Foreign NGOs receiving funds for advocacy and lobbying may be subject to the same conditions as U.S. NGOs, potentially lifting current restrictions. The White House opposes legislation like the Boxer amendment. In international narcotics control, focus is on Plan Colombia and its impact on neighboring countries. Effective narcotics control in Colombia is a key U.S. policy objective, despite challenges such as widespread corruption. The U.S. faces challenges in its narcotics policy in Colombia due to corruption, human rights concerns, and the risk of being drawn into combat. Critics argue that U.S. drug control policy is too focused on Colombia. The Foreign Affairs Authorization Act, Fiscal Year 2005, addresses international narcotics issues. The Foreign Affairs Authorization Act, Fiscal Year 2005 (S. 2144) focuses on international narcotics control issues, particularly in Colombia. It limits U.S. personnel in Colombia to 500 military personnel and 300 contractors, with contractors prohibited from participating in combat operations. Assistance is conditioned on Colombia's commitment to human rights practices. Reporting requirements in the counter-narcotics arena are reduced, including repealing the semi-annual report on extradition of narcotics traffickers. The Foreign Affairs Authorization Act, Fiscal Year 2005 focuses on international narcotics control issues in Colombia. It limits U.S. personnel in Colombia and conditions assistance on human rights practices. Reporting requirements in the counter-narcotics arena are reduced. The House version of H.R. 1950 bans increases in certain non-humanitarian aid programs to Vietnam without certification of human rights progress. The Bush Administration planned to spend $6.6 million on programs promoting Vietnamese business law and U.S.-Vietnam trade relations affected by Division E. The provisions in Division E would allow the President to waive the cap on aid increases. The original version of Division E was introduced as the Vietnam Human Rights Act in April 2003. Authorization of State Department appropriations is required by law every two years. State Department appropriations and authorizations from FY1986-2003, including government shutdown in Nov. 1995 - Jan. 1996 and waiver of authorization requirement for FY2002. The funding for State Department appropriations from FY2000 through FY2004, authorized up to $900 million by P.L. 106-113 sec. 604, includes supplementals from various acts and a transfer of $100.040 million from Foreign Operations appropriations to State Department appropriations for FSA and Seed programs."
