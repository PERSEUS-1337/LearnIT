    "content": "SECTION 1. CONVEYANCE TO LANDER COUNTY, NEVADA. Congress finds that the historical use of Kingston Cemetery predates Forest Service jurisdiction, and it is appropriate for local public ownership. The Forest Service has conveyed 1.25 acres to the Town of Kingston under the Townsite Act to preserve historic gravesites. The Forest Service will convey approximately 8.75 acres to Lander County for the Kingston Cemetery to ensure future gravesite space availability. The conveyance is subject to conditions and excludes valid existing rights. The parcel of National Forest System land known as \"Kingston Cemetery\" consisting of approximately 10 acres will be conveyed to Lander County. The county will be granted an easement for access to the cemetery, and must continue to use the land as a cemetery. If the county uses the parcel for any purpose other than as a cemetery, and fails to discontinue that use, title to the parcel will terminate, revert to the Secretary, and the easement granted to the county will be revoked. SEC. 2. CONVEYANCE TO EUREKA COUNTY, NEVADA. Congress finds that the historical use of the cemetery known as \"Maiden's Grave Cemetery\" predates the jurisdiction of the Bureau of Land Management in Beowawe, Nevada. It is deemed appropriate for the local public ownership of the parcel rather than federal permitting. The Secretary of the Interior is directed to convey the cemetery to Eureka County, Nevada, subject to certain conditions. Eureka County, Nevada will receive ownership of the Maiden's Grave Cemetery parcel of land from the United States. The parcel consists of approximately 10 acres and an easement will be granted for access to the cemetery. The county is required to adhere to certain conditions for the use of the land. The county must use the conveyed parcel as a cemetery. If the county uses the land for any other purpose without discontinuing it, ownership will revert back to the Secretary and the easement will be revoked."
