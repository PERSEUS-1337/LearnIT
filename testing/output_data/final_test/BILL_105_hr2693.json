The Act titled \"Osteoporosis Early Detection and Prevention Act of 1997\" highlights the findings of Congress regarding osteoporosis, a disease characterized by low bone mass and increased susceptibility to fractures. Osteoporosis typically goes undiagnosed until a fracture occurs, and there is no cure for the condition, but drug therapy can help reduce the risk of new fractures. Therapy reduces hip and spine fractures by 50%. Nutrition therapy is also effective. Osteoporosis affects 28 million Americans, with 80% being women. 1.5 million bone fractures occur annually due to osteoporosis. The annual cost of treating osteoporosis in the US is $13.8 billion. The average cost of repairing a hip fracture due to osteoporosis in the United States is $32,000. Fractures from osteoporosis often lead to disability and institutionalization. Early diagnosis through bone mass measurement can help prevent costly fractures. Bone mass measurement is crucial for detecting osteoporosis early and preventing costly fractures. Low bone mass is as predictive of fractures as high cholesterol or high blood pressure are for heart disease or stroke. Medicare will cover bone mass measurement for qualified individuals at risk of osteoporosis starting July 1, 1998. SEC. 2. REQUIRING COVERAGE OF BONE MASS MEASUREMENT UNDER HEALTH PLANS. This section establishes standards for benefits related to bone mass measurement in group health plans. Group health plans and health insurance issuers must cover bone mass measurement for qualified individuals. This includes radiologic or radioisotopic procedures approved by the FDA to identify bone mass, detect bone loss, or determine bone quality, with a physician's interpretation of the results. No specific facility type is required for these measurements. Qualified individuals, including estrogen-deficient women at risk for osteoporosis, those with vertebral abnormalities, receiving chemotherapy or long-term steroid therapy, with certain thyroid conditions, or being monitored for osteoporosis drug therapy, must have bone mass measurements covered by group health plans and insurance issuers. The frequency of these measurements is limited based on established standards. The Secretary will establish standards for the frequency of bone mass measurement benefits for qualified individuals under section 1861(rr)(3) of the Social Security Act, which may vary based on clinical and risk-related characteristics. Group health plans and issuers can impose deductibles and cost-sharing for these measurements, with limitations on such costs. The provision prohibits excessive cost-sharing for bone mass measurements beyond what is applied to similar services. It also prohibits denial of eligibility based on avoiding these requirements and providing incentives to discourage individuals from receiving bone mass measurements. The section prohibits providers from restricting bone mass measurements for qualified individuals, discussing preventive techniques, or penalizing providers for providing such measurements. It also clarifies that individuals are not required to undergo bone mass measurements and requires group health plans to comply with notice requirements. The section allows group health plans to negotiate reimbursement levels with providers for care provided under this section. It also states that state laws providing greater benefits for osteoporosis detection or prevention are not preempted by this section. The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 is amended to include new sections 2704 and 2706. SEC. 713 introduces standards for benefits related to bone mass measurement. SEC. 713 introduces standards for benefits related to bone mass measurement, requiring group health plans to cover bone mass measurement for qualified individuals. Bone mass measurement includes procedures approved by the FDA to identify bone mass, detect bone loss, or determine bone quality, with no specific facility requirements. The standards introduced in SEC. 713 require group health plans to cover bone mass measurement for qualified individuals, including estrogen-deficient women at risk for osteoporosis, those with vertebral abnormalities, receiving chemotherapy or long-term steroid therapy, with certain medical conditions, or monitoring osteoporosis drug therapy efficacy. The standards do not specify facility requirements. The standards introduced in SEC. 713 require group health plans to cover bone mass measurement for qualified individuals, including estrogen-deficient women at risk for osteoporosis, those with vertebral abnormalities, receiving chemotherapy or long-term steroid therapy, with certain medical conditions, or monitoring osteoporosis drug therapy efficacy. This section clarifies that restrictions on cost-sharing for bone mass measurement under group health plans or issuers must not exceed certain limits. The group health plan or health insurance coverage must not deny eligibility based on avoiding requirements. Incentives to discourage bone mass measurements are prohibited, and providers cannot be restricted from discussing with patients. Providers cannot be restricted from discussing osteoporosis preventive techniques or medical treatment options with patients. Reimbursement cannot be penalized for providing bone mass measurements to qualified individuals. Individuals are not required to undergo bone mass measurement. The requirements of this section are considered a material modification in the terms of the plan for notice purposes. The provisions of this section do not preempt State law relating to health insurance coverage for osteoporosis detection or prevention. Section 731(c) and Section 732(a) of the Act are amended accordingly. The table of contents in section 1 of the Act is amended by adding a new item after section 712. Standards relating to benefits for bone mass measurement are outlined in section 2752 of the Public Health Service Act. The provisions of section 2706 apply to individual health insurance coverage in the same way as group health plans. Health insurance issuers must comply with notice requirements similar to group health plans. State laws on osteoporosis detection or prevention may not be preempted if they offer greater benefits. The amendments made to sections 2762(a) and 2762(b)(2) of the Act apply to group health plans and health insurance coverage in the individual market. The effective dates for these amendments are specified for plan years beginning on or after January 1, 1999. State laws on osteoporosis detection or prevention may not be superseded by federal law."
