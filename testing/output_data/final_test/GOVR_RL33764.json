The demographic shifted to include women with children, younger individuals, and more racial diversity compared to previous decades. The traditional \"skid row\" areas with transient single men living in hotels began to change, with homeless individuals becoming more likely to live on the streets and less likely to be employed. The growing homeless population in America, which became more visible in the 1970s and 1980s, consisted of predominantly white individuals with lower incomes, higher rates of mental illness, and drug abuse. Factors contributing to homelessness included the demolition of skid rows for urban development, decreased availability of affordable housing, reduced need for seasonal labor, and changes in mental hospital admissions. The increased visibility of homeless people was also influenced by the decriminalization of certain actions. The visibility of homeless people increased in the 1970s and 1980s due to various factors, including the decriminalization of certain actions. Congress responded with grant programs to address the needs of homeless individuals, leading to the enactment of the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act in 1987. This act created programs for food, shelter, health care, and education for homeless individuals. The Homeless Assistance Grants, administered by HUD, provide housing and supportive services to homeless individuals. These grants include the ESG program, Supportive Housing Program, Shelter Plus Care program, and SRO program. The grants were reauthorized in 2009 under the HEARTH Act. The HEARTH Act (P.L. 111-22) combined existing homeless assistance grants into the Continuum of Care program, renamed the Emergency Solutions Grants program, and introduced the Rural Housing Stability Assistance Program. It authorized $2.2 billion for FY2010 and allowed rural communities to compete for funds. HUD awarded funds under the new ESG program in FY2011. The HEARTH Act combined homeless assistance grants into the Continuum of Care program, renamed the Emergency Solutions Grants program, and introduced the Rural Housing Stability Assistance Program. New regulations regarding the definition of homelessness were implemented in 2012, and HUD released proposed regulations for the RHS program in 2013. The report describes the implementation of HEARTH Act provisions, changes to the definition of homelessness, operation of ESG before and after the Act, and distribution of funds under the CoC program. The definition of homelessness is crucial for Homeless Assistance Grants, determining who can receive assistance. The HEARTH Act changed the definition to be less restrictive, allowing more individuals to qualify for aid. The HEARTH Act expanded the definition of \"homeless individual\" to include those lacking fixed, regular, and adequate nighttime residence, regardless of emergency accommodations or having no place to stay. HUD issued final regulations clarifying this definition on December 5, 2011. The HEARTH Act, effective January 4, 2012, redefined homelessness to include housing instability. It made minor changes to the McKinney-Vento Act, stating that individuals without a fixed nighttime residence, living in shelters or institutions, or in government-funded hotels/motels, are considered homeless. The HEARTH Act redefined homelessness to include housing instability, stating that individuals without a fixed nighttime residence, living in shelters or institutions, or in government-funded hotels/motels are considered homeless. The amended law also added locations not suitable for sleeping, clarified the 90-day limit for institutionalization, and specified that emergency shelters, not transitional housing, qualify as shelters for homeless individuals. The HEARTH Act redefined homelessness to include individuals and families who are imminently losing their housing, lack resources or support networks for permanent housing, and have no subsequent residence identified. HUD previously considered those facing imminent loss within seven days as homeless, but P.L. 111-22 extended this to 14 days. The HEARTH Act expanded the definition of \"homeless individual\" to include unaccompanied youth and homeless families with children who qualify under other federal statutes. HUD defined youth as individuals under 25 years old and listed seven federal programs that can define homeless families and youth. The Department of Education's Children and Youth program defines homeless children and youth as those lacking a fixed, regular, and adequate nighttime residence. Eligibility for services includes those sharing housing due to loss of housing, living in hotels/motels, awaiting foster care placement, living in substandard housing, or being children of migrant workers. The Runaway and Homeless Youth program defines homeless youth as ages 16 to 22 for transitional housing or ages 18 and above. The program defines homeless youth as ages 16 to 22 for transitional housing or ages 18 and younger for short-term shelter. A homeless individual under the Health Care for the Homeless program is someone who \"lacks housing,\" including those in temporary living facilities or transitional housing. Homeless youth and families must have experienced a long-term period without permanent housing, defined as at least 60 days, and instability with at least two moves in the 60 days prior to seeking assistance. The final regulation by HUD defines homeless individuals as those who have experienced at least two moves in the 60 days prior to seeking assistance, with barriers to stable housing including chronic disabilities, substance addiction, and histories of abuse. Communities are limited to using 10% of funds for homeless individuals under other federal statutes unless their homelessness rate is less than one-tenth of 1% of the total population. The definition of homeless individuals was expanded under McKinney-Vento to include those fleeing domestic violence or dangerous conditions in their current housing. HUD regulations now require verification of homeless status for individuals seeking assistance. The final regulations issued in December 2011 create different requirements for verifying homeless status depending on the part of the statutory definition and type of service provided. Service providers should ideally have third party documentation, but under some circumstances, confirmation can be based on observation or certification from the homeless individual. Failure to separately verify homeless status should not prevent individuals from seeking assistance at emergency shelters or from victim service providers. The HEARTH Act expanded the definition of \"chronically homeless person\" to include homeless families with a disabled adult head of household. The regulation clarifies that four or more occasions of homelessness in the last three years must total at least 12 months, with at least seven nights separating each occasion. The definition of disability includes post traumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injury. The HEARTH Act expanded the definition of \"chronically homeless person\" to include homeless families with a disabled adult head of household. The definition of disability includes post traumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injury. HUD began using the new definition in its administration of the Homeless Assistance Grants as part of the FY2010 competition. The Homeless Assistance Grants, established one year prior to McKinney-Vento, are distributed to states and communities to help the homeless. Initially focused on emergency shelter and services, the program broadened under the HEARTH Act to include prevention and rapid rehousing. HUD issued interim regulations for the program in 2011, effective from January 2012. The HEARTH Act expanded the ESG program's purposes and funding, with funds now available for various activities such as renovation, services, prevention, and operational expenses. Prior to the Act, ESG funds had specific limitations on how they could be used. The HEARTH Act expanded the ESG program's purposes and funding, allowing for a greater share of funds to be used for homelessness prevention and rapid rehousing. Funds can be used for rental assistance and housing relocation services for individuals and families who are homeless or at risk of homelessness, defined as those with income at or below 30% of area median income and facing housing instability. The HEARTH Act expanded the ESG program's purposes and funding to allow for more funds to be used for homelessness prevention and rapid rehousing. Individuals and families facing housing instability, with income at or below 30% of area median income, may qualify for rental assistance and housing relocation services. Those at risk of homelessness include those whose current housing will be terminated within 21 days, living in overcrowded housing, leaving an institution, or in an unstable housing situation. Families with children and youth defined as homeless under federal statutes are also considered \"at risk\" of homelessness. The HEARTH Act updated the ESG program, limiting funds for emergency shelter services to 60% of the allocation or the previous amount used. Congress initially allocated 20% of Homeless Assistance Grants to ESG, but subsequent appropriations laws did not require this percentage. The HEARTH Act updated the ESG program, changing the allocation of funds for emergency shelter services. HUD no longer requires 20% of funds to be allocated to ESG, instead specifying a dollar amount ranging from $215 million to $286 million. Recipients can now use up to 7.5% of their grants for administrative costs. ESG funds are distributed to local communities and states through the CDBG program formula, with Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia considered entitlement areas. The interim regulations governing ESG changed the allocations for Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and American Samoa. Previously, these territories received 0.2% of total funds, but now they receive \"up to 0.2 percent, but not less than 0.1 percent\" of the ESG allocation based on population. Tribes do not receive ESG funds; instead, funds for homeless assistance are distributed through the Indian Community Development Block Grant using the CDBG formula. The HEARTH Act did not alter this distribution method. The HEARTH Act did not change the distribution method for ESG funds. Funds are allocated to metropolitan cities, urban counties, and states for community development needs. States and communities must submit a consolidated plan to HUD outlining how they will address these needs to receive ESG funds. The plan integrates housing, community, and economic needs for low- and moderate-income residents over a three- to five-year period. Collaboration between local government officials, organizations, and community members is encouraged in creating the plan. HUD has the authority to disapprove a community's plan for ESG funding. HUD may disapprove a community's consolidated plan for ESG funds if it does not meet requirements. Approved communities receive ESG funds based on their share of CDBG funds from the previous year, with a minimum requirement of 0.05% of the total CDBG allocation. If a community would receive less than 0.05% of the ESG allocation, funds go to the state for other areas. In FY2016, over 360 states, cities, counties, and territories received ESG funds, which are then distributed to local entities and nonprofit organizations. The federal ESG funds are distributed to local government entities, nonprofit organizations, public housing authorities, and local redevelopment authorities to provide services to homeless persons. Recipient organizations are determined by the state or local government through an application process, with each organization required to match the federal funds dollar for dollar. The match can include funding from other sources and be met through various means. The bulk of the funding for Homeless Assistance Grants is awarded through the CoC program, which focuses on longer-term housing and services needs. The CoC program, established under the HEARTH Act, consolidated three separate competitive grants into one program focusing on long-term housing and services for homeless individuals and families. The Supportive Housing Program (SHP) provided funds for transitional and permanent housing, with eligibility for various organizations and match requirements for grant recipients. The Supportive Housing Program (SHP) provided funds for transitional and permanent housing, with eligibility for various organizations and match requirements for grant recipients. The Single Room Occupancy (SRO) program offered permanent housing to homeless individuals in efficiency units, while the Shelter Plus Care (S+C) program provided permanent supportive housing for homeless individuals with disabilities and their families through rent subsidies. Eligible recipients for the S+C program were states and local entities. The Supportive Housing Program (SHP) provided funds for transitional and permanent housing, while the Single Room Occupancy (SRO) program offered permanent housing in efficiency units. The Shelter Plus Care (S+C) program provided permanent supportive housing for homeless individuals with disabilities and their families through rent subsidies. Recipients were states, local government entities, and PHAs. The new consolidated grant now provides funds for all types of housing, supportive services, and rehousing activities under the Continuum of Care program. The Continuum of Care (CoC) program involves collaboration between local communities, HUD, and service providers to address homelessness. The CoC plan aims to meet the needs of homeless individuals through various services like prevention, emergency shelter, transitional housing, and permanent housing. The Continuum of Care (CoC) program was established in 1993 to provide services for homeless individuals, including prevention, emergency shelter, transitional housing, and permanent housing. Over 400 CoCs, including those in territories, cover most of the country. The HEARTH Act codified the process for applying for CoC program funds, with the Collaborative Applicant being any eligible entity. The CoC program allows entities to apply for funds, with the option to become a Unified Funding Agency (UFA) to receive and distribute funds. The program maintains aspects of previous grants and includes new features. Eligible entities to administer activities include states, local governments, PHAs, and nonprofits. The CoC program allows states, local governments, PHAs, and nonprofits to administer rental assistance. Private nonprofit organizations were later allowed to participate. The program includes various components such as permanent housing and supportive services, with specific costs involved in operating each component. The CoC program consolidates various components like transitional housing and permanent housing, with a focus on helping homeless individuals transition to stable housing. Permanent housing under the CoC program is not time-limited and may include supportive services. Grantees may also provide Permanent Supportive Housing according to program regulations. Permanent Supportive Housing and Rapid Rehousing are two key components of the CoC program, providing permanent housing with supportive services and rental assistance to homeless individuals and families. Grantees can offer short-term and medium-term rental assistance, along with a variety of supportive services to help individuals maintain permanent housing. The statute, along with interim regulations, authorizes various services for homeless individuals, including case management, child care, education, employment assistance, housing search, legal services, mental health services, substance abuse treatment, and transportation. Homeless Management Information Systems (HMIS) are databases used by service providers to collect and store information about homeless clients. Prior to the HEARTH Act, SHP grants could be used to fund HMIS. The CoC program allows for various methods of providing housing and services to homeless individuals, including acquisition, rehabilitation, construction, and leasing of properties. Funds can be used for housing or supportive services, but not for facilities solely providing services. Grant recipients must enter into occupancy agreements with program participants. The HEARTH Act allows grantees to use CoC funds for rental assistance, including tenant-based, project-based, and sponsor-based options. Eligible grantees include states, local government units, Public Housing Authorities, and nonprofit organizations. Unlike the S+C program, tenant-based rental assistance may be provided for a limited duration. Tenant-based rental assistance can be short term (up to 3 months) or medium term (between 3 and 24 months) and may also be used for permanent housing without a time limit. Residents must pay a portion of rent according to HUD rules. Grantees can use CoC program funds for personnel costs of supportive services, operating costs for housing and facilities, and administrative costs. The CoC program allows for up to 10% of grants to be used for administrative expenses, including staff salaries, supplies, and training. Prior programs had lower percentages for administrative costs. Collaborative Applicants can use up to 3% for application-related expenses and an additional 3% for fund distribution. The HEARTH Act allows Continuum of Care to use an additional 3% of funds for fund distribution and grants flexibility to high-performing communities in reducing homelessness. High-performing communities must meet requirements on average length of homelessness and repeat instances of homelessness. The HEARTH Act allows Continuum of Care to use an additional 3% of funds for fund distribution and grants flexibility to high-performing communities in reducing homelessness. High-performing communities must meet requirements on average length of homelessness and repeat instances of homelessness. Incentives for Proven Strategies to Reduce Homelessness include submission of data, outcomes for homeless families and youth, comprehensive outreach plans, and success in preventing homelessness for high-performing communities. Collaborative Applicants designated high-performing can use grant awards for eligible activities and rental assistance to assist those at risk of homelessness. The HEARTH Act incentivizes Continuums of Care to reduce homelessness by providing bonuses and incentives for successful efforts in providing permanent supportive housing for those experiencing chronic homelessness and homeless families with children. The Act also maintains the current Continuum of Care application system and codifies it in law. HUD reviews one application for CoC program funds submitted by Collaborative Applicants. HUD reviews one application for CoC program funds submitted by Collaborative Applicants. HUD distributes funds directly to individual project applicants unless a Collaborative Applicant is a Unified Funding Agency. The HEARTH Act required HUD to develop a formula for determining need within two years of enactment using factors appropriate for the Continuum of Care program's goals and objectives. P.L. 111-22 gave the HUD Secretary authority to adjust the formula to ensure Collaborative Applicants have sufficient funds to renew existing contracts for one year. HUD released a proposal in July 2016 to change the CoC formula, removing the use of the CDBG formula. Prior to the HEARTH Act, matching requirements varied by grant type, but now there is a unified match requirement where each recipient community must match 25% of grant funds with other sources. The HEARTH Act expanded options for serving homeless individuals through the CoC program, allowing for more diverse housing options. Prior to the Act, permanent housing was mainly for unaccompanied individuals, but now families with non-disabled adults are eligible. Matching requirements for grant funds have been unified at 25%, except for leasing funds. Third-party services used for matching must be documented. The HEARTH Act expanded eligibility for homeless individuals, requiring a portion of funding to be used for permanent supportive housing for individuals with disabilities or families with a disabled adult head of household. The HEARTH Act increased permanent housing units for homeless individuals with disabilities and families with children. At least 10% of funding for ESG and CoC programs must be used for permanent housing for families with children. Up to 10% of CoC program funds can be used for homeless families with children and unaccompanied youth certified as homeless under other federal programs. The HEARTH Act increased permanent housing units for homeless individuals with disabilities and families with children. The CoC program funds are distributed to eligible applicant organizations through a process that involves both formula and competitive grants. The Act did not significantly change how HUD awards CoC program grants. HUD distributes CoC program funds to eligible organizations through a process involving formula and competitive elements. The need levels of Continuums of Care are determined using the CDBG program formula, setting a baseline for funding. HUD then assesses applicant organizations providing homeless services through a competition to qualify for funds. The need-determination process calculates each community's \"pro rata need\" to address homelessness. HUD uses the CDBG formula to determine a Continuum of Care's preliminary pro rata need (PPRN) as a starting point for its need for homeless services. PPRN is calculated by multiplying the percentage of funds a community received from the CDBG formula by the amount of funds available to the CoC program. The PPRN for each community is added together to arrive at the PPRN for the entire Continuum. This amount may be adjusted by the annual renewal demand (ARD), which is the funds needed to renew existing contracts. The final pro rata need (FPRN) is the higher of PPRN or ARD and serves as the maximum award amount a Continuum of Care may qualify for. Continuums of Care may qualify for more than the FPRN level based on changes to fair market rents, planning costs, and bonus funding. Total funding levels are determined by the CoC program competition, which includes threshold review and a competitive process for new grants. Existing projects must meet a renewal threshold, while HUD ensures eligibility for all participants in new projects. The CoC program eligibility criteria include project quality, HUD requirements, and civil rights standards. Collaborative Applicants are scored based on HEARTH Act criteria, including performance outcomes for homeless clients, funding priorities, and coordination with other entities. HUD evaluates Continuums of Care based on their collaboration with other entities serving the homeless, success in preventing homelessness, and use of a Homeless Management Information System. Continuums of Care can reallocate funds for new projects if deemed more beneficial. Funding for new projects is awarded based on scoring criteria that may vary annually. In the CoC program, HUD may change funding criteria annually based on available appropriations and priorities. In FY2017, approximately $2 billion is available, with a tiered funding process prioritizing permanent housing and HMIS projects. Tier 1 ensures funding for essential projects, while Tier 2 ranks projects that cannot be funded in Tier 1. In the CoC program, projects are prioritized based on funding tiers. Tier 1 ensures funding for essential projects, while Tier 2 ranks projects that cannot be funded in Tier 1. Projects in Tier 1 are scored on a 200-point scale, while Tier 2 projects are scored on a 100-point scale based on CoC application score and ranking. HUD is not awarding points based on type of housing in the current competition. In the CoC competition, funds are used to renew existing grants or create new projects by reallocating funds. HUD allows applicants to apply for new projects at up to 6% of FPRN in FY2017. New and reallocated projects can provide various types of housing for specific populations, including Permanent Supportive Housing (PSH) for chronically homeless individuals or those with disabilities. In FY2017, HUD expanded eligibility for Permanent Supportive Housing (PSH) to include individuals and families with disabilities who do not meet the previous criteria for chronic homelessness. This new housing option, called \"DedicatedPLUS,\" allows individuals and families in transitional housing or those who have experienced homelessness for at least 12 months in the last three years to qualify for PSH. In FY2017, HUD expanded eligibility for Permanent Supportive Housing (PSH) to include individuals and families with disabilities who do not meet the previous criteria for chronic homelessness. Veterans receiving assistance through VA homeless programs who meet homeless status criteria qualify for DedicatedPLUS housing. Rapid Rehousing (RR) projects can serve homeless individuals and families, including unaccompanied youth. Joint Transitional Housing (TH) and RR projects are allowed for the first time in FY2017, focusing on obtaining and retaining permanent housing. Funds can be used to expand existing projects to increase units and serve more people. In FY2017, HUD allowed for the expansion of existing projects to increase units and serve more people. Tiered funding process in FY2016 allocated funds based on CoCs' ARD and FPRN, with tier 1 projects needing to pass threshold review and scoring criteria. Tier 2 projects were scored on a 100 point scale, with up to 50 points based on CoC competition score. In FY2017, HUD allowed for the expansion of existing projects to increase units and serve more people. Tiered funding process in FY2016 allocated funds based on CoCs' ARD and FPRN, with tier 1 projects needing to pass threshold review and scoring criteria. Up to 35 points were available based on CoCs ranking projects, with additional points for project type and housing principles. Funding depended on CoCs ranking, points scored, project type, and ranking within tier 2. In December 2016, HUD announced tier 1 and tier 2 funding awards totaling $1.95 billion distributed to over 7,600 providers. New projects received $139 million, with $103 million reallocated from existing projects. The HEARTH Act retained McKinney-Vento's rural homelessness grant program as the Rural Housing Stability Assistance Program. The HEARTH Act established the Rural Housing Stability Assistance Program (RHS) grants for rural communities, with 5% of Continuum of Care Program funds set aside for them. HUD released proposed regulations for the program, defining rural communities as those outside metropolitan statistical areas. Unused funds are to be returned for use by the CoC program. The Rural Housing Stability Assistance Program (RHS) grants are available for rural communities outside metropolitan statistical areas. Eligible entities include county and local governments, as well as private nonprofit organizations. Grants can be awarded to subrecipients, allowing communities to serve individuals who may not meet HUD's definition of \"homeless.\" The RHS program provides grants to rural communities to rehouse individuals in the worst housing situations, stabilize housing for those at risk of homelessness, and improve affordability for low-income residents. The RHS program grants assist individuals experiencing homelessness with transitional and permanent housing, rapid rehousing, data collection, and supportive services. Additionally, funds can be used for homelessness prevention activities such as rent, mortgage, or utility payments. Assistance may also include relocation for employment, education, or family reunification, emergency housing in motels or shelters, with a general limit of three months. The RHS program provides assistance for individuals experiencing homelessness with transitional and permanent housing, rapid rehousing, and supportive services. Participants must own the home and have income at or below 50% of the area median income. Grantees may incur costs for acquisition, rehabilitation, construction of facilities, rental assistance, operating costs, and administrative costs. Up to 20% of the funds can be used for capacity building among personnel administering housing. The RHS program provides assistance for individuals experiencing homelessness with housing and services. Funds can be used for capacity building among personnel administering programs. Congress played a decreasing role in fund allocation among Homeless Assistance Grants, with changes in funding allocations from FY1987 to FY2017. Despite McKinney-Vento reauthorization legislation, concerns remain about the distribution of Homeless Assistance Grants. Renewing existing housing and services contracts consumes a large portion of funds, leaving little for new projects. The CDBG formula also impacts grant distribution, with 90% of CoC funds in FY2016 going towards renewals. HUD has allowed Continuums of Care to reallocate funds for new permanent housing projects. Continuums of Care can reallocate funds from existing projects to new permanent housing projects, freeing up funds for new initiatives. HUD has allowed this reallocation since FY2005, except for FY2009, to address concerns about renewing existing projects while funding new ones. The HEARTH Act also introduced a way to free up Homeless Assistance Grant funds for new projects. The project-based Section 8 rental assistance account could fund assistance and operating cost contracts, but this may reduce funding for all HUD programs. Congress has not renewed contracts through this account. The effectiveness of using the CDBG formula to target funds for homeless services has been questioned. The CDBG formula for targeting funds for homeless services has been questioned, leading to the development of alternative methods to determine community need for homeless assistance. The HEARTH Act addressed these concerns by directing HUD to develop a formula for the Continuum of Care Program within two years. HUD initially maintained the use of the CDBG formula for determining preliminary pro rata need in participating communities. The CDBG formula uses five factors to award funds to recipient communities: population, number of persons in poverty, housing overcrowding, age of housing, and growth lag. The formula was last changed in 1977. Other proposals have been made to determine need for Homeless Assistance Grants. The HUD Secretary determines need for Homeless Assistance Grants based on factors like number of homeless individuals, affordable housing shortages, and housing affordability. Formula factors for distributing funds are based on data collected by government entities like the Census Bureau. The distribution of Homeless Assistance Grants may be influenced by uncertainties in current measures of homelessness data collection and potential changes to the CDBG formula. HUD and the Administration have proposed adjustments to the formula in the past, but no legislation has been introduced yet. HUD reopened the interim CoC rule on July 25, 2016, to propose changes to the formula used to determine preliminary pro rata need. Four alternative formulas with varying factors were proposed, based on data relevant to measuring homelessness, accuracy, timeliness, and availability. Formula factors were correlated with local point-in-time counts of homelessness to determine effectiveness. The proposed formula factors include population, poverty, and affordability gap. The HUD proposed four alternative formulas for determining preliminary pro rata need based on factors like population, poverty, and affordability gap. They also provided a tool to adjust the weights of each factor. The Supportive Housing Program (SHP) funded transitional and permanent housing for homeless individuals and families, with nearly 69% of HUD competitive grant funds going to SHP grants in FY2011. Eligible applicants included states, local government entities, and public housing. Eligible applicants for SHP grants included states, local government entities, PHAs, nonprofit organizations, and mental health centers. Recipients could provide housing with services or services only. Funds could be used for acquiring, rehabilitating buildings for supportive housing or services. 10% of funds for supportive services, 25% for projects serving families with children, and 25% for homeless persons with disabilities. Funds could also be used for constructing supportive housing buildings. In addition to financing physical structures, SHP grant recipients could use funds for services like case management, health care, child care, housing assistance, nutritional counseling, and employment assistance. They could also use funds for up to 75% of annual operating expenses and to implement a Homeless Management Information System (HMIS). Matching funds were required, with different levels depending on the activity. Acquisition, rehabilitation, or new construction funds had to be matched equally, while supportive services funds had varying match requirements. The Single Room Occupancy Program (SRO) provided permanent housing to homeless individuals in efficiency units. In FY2011, three new competitive grants were awarded to SRO projects totaling $3.2 million. SRO units were funded as part of HUD's Section 8 Moderate Rehabilitation program, requiring recipients to spend at least $3,000 per unit for rehabilitation. Eligible applicants for SRO grants were PHAs and private nonprofit organizations. The SRO program required grant recipients to spend at least $3,000 per unit for property rehabilitation to meet HUD's housing quality standards. Recipients were reimbursed through Section 8 rental assistance payments over a 10-year contract period. The maximum reimbursement amount per unit was $23,000 as of FY2011. After the 10-year contracts expired, renewals were done annually through the Section 8 project-based rental assistance account. The Shelter Plus Care Program provided permanent supportive housing for homeless individuals with disabilities and their families. The Shelter Plus Care Program offered rent subsidies for homeless individuals with disabilities and their families through various forms of assistance like tenant-based vouchers, project-based rental assistance, sponsor-based rental assistance, and single room occupancy housing. Recipients were required to match the grant funds received for rental assistance. Eligible applicants included states, local government entities, and PHAs. Grant recipients under the Shelter Plus Care Program were required to match the grant funds received for rental assistance with an equal amount of funds for supportive services such as health care, counseling, child care, case management, and job training. They could fulfill this requirement with cash, lease value, employee salaries, or volunteer time."
