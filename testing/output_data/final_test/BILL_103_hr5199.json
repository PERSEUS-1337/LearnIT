The Congress finds that advancements in communications technology have increased the volume and value of electronic information, making it harder for the government to access necessary data for public safety and national security. The development of the nation's information infrastructure requires protection of electronic information. The Nation's information infrastructure requires secure, confidential, and authentic electronic information. Encryption technology enhances security, privacy, and authentication. The rights of individuals to protection in their communications should be preserved. The government should have the authority to access electronic information for public safety and national security. The Act aims to promote the development of the Nation's information infrastructure while preserving personal rights and governmental authority. It encourages the use of encryption standards that ensure privacy, protection, and authentication of electronic information. The Act aims to establish Federal policy on encryption standards for electronic information to ensure public safety and national security. The Act establishes Federal policy on encryption standards for electronic information. The Computer System Security and Privacy Advisory Board is required to have privacy expertise and expanded functions to advise on privacy issues related to electronic information and encryption standards. The National Institute of Standards and Technology Act is amended to include new standards and procedures under section 31(b). The National Institute of Standards and Technology Act is amended to include new encryption standards and procedures under section 31. The Secretary, through the Director, will establish an Encryption Standards and Procedures Program to conduct research, make grants, and develop encryption standards. Federal encryption standards can be developed by the Secretary after public notice and comment. The Encryption Standards and Procedures Program will develop encryption standards that prioritize confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of electronic information, enhance national security, and preserve privacy rights. The standards will also allow the government to decipher electronic information obtained through lawful surveillance. The Encryption Standards and Procedures Program will develop encryption standards for electronic surveillance permitted by law. The standards may be implemented in software, firmware, hardware, or any combination thereof, and shall include a validation program. Standards will be developed in consultation with heads of other federal agencies. The Federal Government shall make these standards available for public use, except for key escrow encryption standards. The President will designate at least 2 Federal agencies as key escrow agents for the encryption standard. The designated agencies must have the capability to administer the standard, safeguard sensitive information, and not be authorized for electronic surveillance. The key escrow agent designated under paragraph (1) must establish procedures to safeguard keys, preserve encryption standards, and manage keys in accordance with regulations and encryption standards. The key escrow agent designated under paragraph (1) has the authority to enter into contracts and agreements to fulfill its responsibilities effectively. Limitations on access and use require the agent to release keys only to authorized federal agencies for electronic surveillance purposes. The key escrow agent can release keys only to authorized federal agencies for electronic surveillance purposes. Private persons and foreign citizens are generally restricted from accessing or using encryption keys established under subsection (b), with exceptions for foreign representatives. The President can allow a foreign government representative access to encryption keys if it serves national security interests. Government agencies cannot access keys held by a key escrow agent without authorization. The Secretary shall conduct hearings every 2 years to review encryption standards established under this section and gather feedback from interested parties. A report with findings and recommendations will be submitted to Congress after each hearing. Within one year of the Act's enactment, the Secretary and designated key escrow agents must issue necessary regulations after public notice and comment. The United States is not liable for losses resulting from encryption standard compromises by non-official individuals. The section defines who can be held liable for compromising electronic information, includes definitions for terms like 'content' and 'encryption', and states that if any provision is held invalid, the rest of the section remains unaffected. The curr_chunk defines encryption and encryption standards as methods to protect electronic information and ensure its integrity, authenticity, and confidentiality in electronic communications systems. The curr_chunk explains key escrow encryption as a method that allows the government to decipher encrypted electronic information with a unique secret code held by a key escrow agent. The curr_chunk defines electronic information as any content, source, or destination in electronic form not authorized to be kept secret, stored, processed, or communicated electronically domestically or internationally. The term 'government' is defined as the Federal Government, a State, political subdivision, District of Columbia, or a commonwealth, territory, or possession of the United States. Authorization of Appropriations for the Secretary of Commerce includes $50,000,000 for fiscal years 1995 through 1997, with $1,000,000 allocated for a National Research Council study on national cryptography policy. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1994 allows the Secretary to transfer funds to a key escrow agent for carrying out responsibilities under this section. The transferred funds remain available until expended."
