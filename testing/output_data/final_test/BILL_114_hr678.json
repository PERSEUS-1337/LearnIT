The State Applications section of the 21st Century Classroom Innovation Act requires states to outline their program for awarding grants for blended learning projects, including criteria for grants and waivers of state policies for eligible entities, such as restrictions on funding for instructional materials and enrollment in online coursework. States must also detail how they will inform eligible entities of waiver availability and provide the non-Federal match required. The Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 is amended to allow states to reserve up to 5% of grant funds for blended learning projects. State educational agencies can use these funds to support blended learning initiatives at local educational agencies. The agency can use funds to award grants for blended learning projects in the State, with a 5% reservation for rural areas. Eligible entities must submit an application to the State educational agency to receive a grant. The eligible entity must submit an application to the State educational agency describing the blended learning project, instructional model design, schools involved, and expected impact on student academic achievement. The eligible entity must describe how they will ensure sufficient technology and digital resources, provide professional development for staff, and request waivers from the State for the blended learning project. The eligible entity must describe how they will use the blended learning project to improve instruction for diverse groups of students, evaluate student academic achievement, and sustain the project beyond the grant period. An eligible entity receiving a grant must use it for a blended learning project, including planning activities like developing new instructional models, purchasing digital resources, and professional development. Expenditures cannot be for significant construction or renovation of facilities. The grant program requires eligible entities to use funds for a blended learning project, excluding significant construction or renovation of facilities. Ongoing professional development is also necessary to support project implementation and academic success. State educational agencies must provide a non-Federal match of at least 10% of the grant funds awarded. A blended learning project is an education program that includes online learning, supervised instructional time away from home, student control over pace, and integrated learning experiences. The term 'charter school' and 'eligible entity' are also defined in the context of the grant program. The term 'eligible entity' refers to a local educational agency, charter school, or consortium of these entities in partnership with a for-profit or nonprofit entity."
