    "content": "Unsubsidized employment refers to full- or part-time work in the public or private sector not supported by TANF or other public programs. This includes employment where employers receive tax credits for hiring disadvantaged workers and self-employment. Subsidized employment, on the other hand, involves the employer receiving a subsidy from TANF or public funds to offset wages and costs for employing a recipient. This type of employment provides wages and benefits similar to unsubsidized employees in similar roles. Subsidized Public Sector Employment refers to jobs in the public sector where the employer receives a subsidy from TANF or other public funds to offset wages and costs for employing a recipient. This type of employment should be distinguished from Subsidized Private Sector Employment and counted as \"unsubsidized employment.\" Work experience, also known as \"workfare,\" is a supervised activity performed in exchange for welfare benefits to improve employability for those unable to find unsubsidized employment. Participants do not receive wages or compensation for their work, which includes job search, job readiness activities, and vocational training. On-the-job training is provided to paid employees in the public or private sector to enhance job performance. States subsidize training costs for participants with the expectation of transitioning them to regular, unsubsidized employees. Supported employment for individuals with disabilities may include on-site training as part of on-the-job training activities. \"Employment without significant on-site training should be classified as subsidized employment, not on-the-job training. Job search and readiness involve seeking employment, life skills training, and therapy if necessary. Activities must be supervised regularly by the TANF agency. Job search can include contacting employers, applying for jobs, and interviewing. Participation can be counted for up to six weeks in a fiscal year.\" Job readiness involves preparing for a job search by creating a resume, training in interviewing skills, and addressing barriers to employment like substance abuse or mental health issues. Activities unrelated to work readiness, such as parenting skills training or ESL classes, do not count towards job readiness. Community service programs involve TANF recipients performing work for the community under public or nonprofit organizations. These programs aim to improve employability and must serve a useful community purpose in various fields. Recipients' prior training and skills are considered, and supervision is required on a daily basis. Community service assignments for TANF recipients consider their prior training and skills. Examples include work in schools, churches, Americorps, or private volunteer organizations. Excluded activities are educational programs, substance abuse treatment, and unsupervised tasks like shoveling a neighbor's sidewalk. Vocational educational training is limited to 12 months per individual. Vocational educational training, limited to 12 months per individual, includes programs preparing for specific trades or occupations. These programs can be offered by various educational or training organizations and supervised on a daily basis. Excluded are programs leading to a baccalaureate or advanced degree, as well as general basic skills and language training. Job skills training directly related to employment includes customized training for specific employers or general training for employment preparation, including literacy and language instruction if explicitly stated. Training must be supervised daily and aimed at providing individuals with the skills needed for employment or to adapt to workplace demands. Education directly related to employment includes literacy and language instruction if focused on skills needed for employment, combined with job training, and barrier removal activities like substance abuse counseling. It must be supervised daily and can include programs leading to a GED or High School Equivalency diploma. Hours in monitored study sessions count towards education directly related to employment. Regular attendance at secondary school or GED programs counts towards education directly related to employment. This activity must be supervised daily and includes hours in monitored study. Child care services for TANF recipients participating in community service programs must be supervised daily. Providing child care for other activities does not count."
