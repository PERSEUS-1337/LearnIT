Eligibility requires tax-exempt status, operating as a pregnancy help clinic, and offering medical services supervised by a physician.

Each pregnant woman must be shown the ultrasound image of the fetus and given a description of its characteristics.

They should also receive information on abortion alternatives, such as childbirth and adoption, along with resources for assistance. The entity applying for a grant must have medical malpractice insurance of at least $1,000,000 to cover activities related to the ultrasound machine. The grant amount cannot exceed 50% of the ultrasound machine's purchase price or $20,000, whichever is less. The entity should not receive more than 30% of its revenue from a single source or donor. Grants require an application submitted to the Secretary in the specified form and manner. The application for a grant must meet specific requirements determined by the Secretary.
