    "content": "The \"Transitional Federal Medical Assistance Percentage Act\" extends the increase in FMAP under ARRA until December 31, 2011, with certain amendments to calendar quarters and fiscal years. During the ARRA transitional assistance period from July 1, 2011, to December 31, 2013, a State's FMAP is determined by the adjusted base FMAP, general FMAP adjustment, and unemployment FMAP adjustment. During the ARRA transitional assistance period, the adjusted base FMAP is calculated by subtracting 2 percentage points from the FMAP that would have applied under ARRA for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2011 and subsequent quarters. During the ARRA transitional assistance period, the adjusted base FMAP for a State may not apply if it would be lower than the FMAP without this adjustment. The general FMAP adjustment percentages are as follows: 5.7 points for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2011, 4.95 points for the first quarter of fiscal year 2012, 3.95 points for the second quarter of fiscal year 2012, and 2.7 points for the third quarter of fiscal year 2012. During the ARRA transitional assistance period, the unemployment FMAP adjustment percentages are as follows: 2.7 points for the third quarter of fiscal year 2012, 1.2 points for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2012, and 0.2 points for any subsequent fiscal quarter. During the ARRA transitional assistance period, the applicable reduction amount for the unemployment FMAP adjustment is 0.20 percentage points for the fourth fiscal quarter of fiscal year 2011, and for subsequent quarters, it increases by 0.05 percentage points each time. During the ARRA transitional assistance period, the state unemployment increase percentage is computed based on the most recent 3-consecutive-month period, starting from December 2012. During the ARRA transitional assistance period, the state unemployment increase percentage is calculated based on the most recent 3-consecutive-month period starting from December 2012. The special rule under ARRA for the last 2 calendar quarters of the recession adjustment period is repealed, with a new special rule applied for the first 2 calendar quarters. The adjustments in the FMAP for a State are within the scope of application.
