From 1929 through 1941, authorities forcibly removed individuals of Mexican ancestry from the United States, with as many as two million individuals sent to Mexico, including 1.2 million US citizens. This was in response to public pressure to reduce the employment of Mexican-Americans during the Depression, leading to massive raids on their communities. The raids from 1929 to 1941 targeted individuals of Mexican ancestry, labeling them as \"illegal aliens\" even if they were US citizens or legal residents. These actions separated families, deprived individuals of their rights and livelihoods, with no official inquiry made. The purpose of the Act is to establish a commission to investigate if US citizens and legal residents were forcibly removed to Mexico during this period. From 1929 to 1941, permanent legal residents were forcibly removed to Mexico in violation of the law. This had a significant impact on individuals, their families, and the Mexican-American community in the United States. Appropriate remedies are recommended to address this historical injustice.
