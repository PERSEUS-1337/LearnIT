    "content": "The Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) is the main source of federal aid for elementary and secondary education, with Title I-A providing aid for disadvantaged students. The ESEA was enacted in 1965 to improve educational quality, and was most recently reauthorized by the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) to ensure every child achieves. The ESSA authorized appropriations for ESEA programs through FY2020, with a FY2019 appropriation of $25.2 billion. States and public schools must focus on educational accountability to receive grant funds under Title I-A. Under the ESSA, public schools must monitor and improve student achievement outcomes to receive Title I-A funds. States have more flexibility in developing accountability systems, but must still have standards and assessments in RLA, mathematics, and science. The accountability system must include performance goals, weighted indicators, and differentiation to identify schools needing support. Under ESSA, schools must monitor and improve student achievement to receive Title I-A funds. Other ESEA programs provide grants for various educational purposes. States must submit a plan to receive funds for different educational initiatives. Under ESSA, states must submit a state plan to the U.S. Department of Education to receive funds for ESEA programs. The Secretary approves consolidated state plans for all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. Annual appropriations for ESEA programs are provided through the L-HHS-ED Appropriations Act. The U.S. Department of Education provides ESEA appropriations for FY2016 through FY2019, transitioning from NCLB to ESSA. ESEA Title I aims to close educational achievement gaps by offering fair and high-quality education opportunities. States must submit a plan to receive ESEA funds under ESSA. Title I-A of the ESEA allows states to reserve funds for administration and improvement activities, with federal aid provided to LEAs for disadvantaged children's education. This includes supplementary services for low-achieving students in schools with high numbers of low-income families. Title I-A grants are provided to schools with high numbers of low-income students, including those attending private schools in the same area. The grants are calculated at the LEA level by the Department of Education and distributed to SEAs for school improvement activities. Grant amounts are determined using four different formulas. The Title I-A grants are distributed to schools with high numbers of low-income students, including those in private schools. The grants are calculated at the LEA level using four different formulas based on factors like poverty levels, state expenditures, and equity among LEAs. LEAs must rank their public schools by the percentage of students from low-income families to receive funding. Public schools are ranked by the percentage of students from low-income families to receive Title I-A funds, without regard to grade span. Schools with over 75% low-income students or high schools with 50% or more can be prioritized. Funds are allocated based on the number of low-income students, with flexibility to provide higher grants per child at certain schools. Title I-A programs provide higher grants per low-income child at schools with high rates of these children. There are two types of programs: schoolwide and targeted assistance. Schoolwide programs aim to improve all students' performance, while targeted assistance programs focus on the lowest-achieving students. Funds can be used for professional development, technology upgrades, and new curricula. Title I-A funds can be used in various ways to improve student academic achievement, such as hiring teacher aides or implementing after-school programs. Each State Education Agency (SEA) must submit a state plan to the Department of Education (ED) to receive Title I-A funds, which includes adopting challenging academic standards in reading, math, and science. The academic standards in RLA, mathematics, and science must include three levels of achievement and align with entrance requirements for higher education and state career standards. States can adopt alternate standards for students with disabilities, as long as they align with challenging content standards. English language proficiency standards must address speaking, listening, reading, and writing proficiency levels. The ESEA does not require states to submit standards to the Secretary of Education for approval. Each state plan must show implementation of assessments in RLA, math, and science. Assessments must be administered in grades 3-8 and once in high school for math and RLA, and once in grades 3-5, 6-9, and 10-12 for science. Each state must administer 17 assessments. Each state must administer 17 assessments each school year, with no student taking more than 3 assessments. Assessments must align with state academic standards, including alternate assessments for students with significant cognitive disabilities. State plans must include annual English proficiency assessments for English learners. States receiving Title I-A funds must also participate in the National Assessment of Educational Progress for 4th and 8th grade students. The National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) assesses 4th and 8th grade students in reading and math every two years. State plans must include academic accountability systems with long-term goals for all students and subgroups, including English learners. Indicators must be based on these goals. The state must use indicators based on long-term goals to measure student performance and evaluate public schools. Indicators include student proficiency in reading and math, student growth, graduation rates, English language proficiency, and school quality or student success. The SEA must establish a system for annually differentiating public schools based on indicators like student engagement, postsecondary readiness, and school climate. The system must identify schools for comprehensive support and improvement, including the lowest-performing schools, public high schools with low graduation rates, and schools not showing improvement despite targeted support. The SEA must annually differentiate public schools based on indicators like student engagement, postsecondary readiness, and school climate. Schools are identified for comprehensive support and improvement, including the lowest-performing schools, those with low graduation rates, and schools not improving despite targeted support. Schools failing to improve within a set number of years face more rigorous state-determined actions. States must also identify schools for targeted support and improvement where subgroups of students consistently underperform. These schools must develop evidence-based interventions and address resource inequities. The state requires schools to develop improvement plans with evidence-based interventions. Schools failing to improve face additional actions within a set timeframe. Subgroups with low performance must receive targeted support and improvement activities, addressing resource inequities. If no improvement is seen, the state will intervene and identify the school for comprehensive support and improvement. The Title I-A program requires 95% participation in assessments, certification for teachers, and equitable distribution of effective teachers. States must outline measures for teacher effectiveness and reserve funds for schools in need of improvement. Beginning in FY2018, an SEA can reserve funds for school improvement under the SIG program. States must allocate at least 95% of these funds to LEAs for schools implementing support and improvement activities. SEAs also have the option to reserve up to 3% of Title I-A funds for direct student services, a provision not included in the law before ESSA. Under the ESSA, states must distribute 99% of reserved funds to diverse LEAs through a competitive grant process, prioritizing those serving schools in need of support. Funds can be used for various purposes, including student enrollment in academic courses, credit recovery, and postsecondary instruction. Title I-B of the ESSA authorizes the State Assessment Grant program to support the development and administration of state standards and assessments, including activities to improve assessments for English learners. Funding mechanisms include formula grants for state standards and assessments, as well as competitive grants for additional related activities. The allocation of funds is based on a trigger amount of $369.1 million, with the entire appropriation used for formula grants if annual appropriations are at or below this amount. The ESSA authorizes the State Assessment Grant program to award formula grants to states based on a trigger amount. States receive a minimum grant of $3 million, with additional funds allocated based on the number of students. Any excess funds above the trigger amount are used for competitive grants. The Secretary can reserve up to 20% of funds for assessment system audits, with a minimum annual grant of $1.5 million to conduct statewide audits. The ESEA as amended by the ESSA allows for a new demonstration authority for innovative assessment systems at the state or consortium level. This system can include various types of assessments and support individual learning needs. Up to seven SEAs can have their applications approved in the first three years. No separate funding is provided, but states can use a portion of existing funds for this purpose. Title I-C authorizes grants to SEAs for the education of migratory children and youth who have moved within the last 36 months for agricultural or fishing work or to join a family member in such work. States can use a portion of funding from the State Assessment Grant program to support educational programs for these children, addressing their unique needs during the school year, summer, and intersession periods. Funding is allocated based on the number of migratory children in each state. Title I-D authorizes programs to improve education for neglected, delinquent, or at-risk students aged 3-21. Grants are provided for education in state institutions, community day programs, and adult correctional institutions. Funds are allocated based on the number of children and youth in these facilities. Transition services are also provided for those transferring to public schools. ESEA Title I-A funds support children and youth in correctional facilities and community day programs. Title I-D provides grants for education in these facilities, including transition programs and dropout prevention. Title I-E allows for flexible per-pupil funding to prioritize students from low-income families and other disadvantaged groups. Title I-E allows for flexible per-pupil funding to prioritize students from low-income families and other disadvantaged groups, with a focus on educational disadvantage. LEAs can consolidate federal, state, and local funds to create a single funding system based on weighted per-pupil allocations. The number of LEAs participating is not capped, as long as a \"substantial majority\" meet program requirements. Title I-F develops federal regulations for Title I programs and prohibits federal control over instructional content and curriculum. Title II programs focus on teachers, school leaders, literacy, American history, and civics education. Activities include professional development, recruitment, performance-based compensation, STEM teacher corps, literacy grants, school library support, and high-quality book provision. Title II programs focus on providing books to children and adolescents, American history, and civic education programs for teachers and students.

It supports educators in implementing effective language instruction programs and promotes parental and community involvement. Formula grant allocations are based on the proportion of EL students and immigrant students in each state. The English Language Acquisition program supports ELs and immigrant students to achieve English proficiency and academic success. SEAs allocate funds based on the proportion of EL and immigrant students in each state. SEAs reserve funds for various activities, including teacher preparation, professional development, and grants for entities with a significant increase in immigrant student enrollment. Eligible entities must use funds to enhance English language proficiency for ELs. The English Language Acquisition program supports ELs and immigrant students by providing funds for activities such as increasing English language proficiency, professional development for staff, and implementing strategies to enhance language instruction programs. Eligible entities receiving grants for immigrant students must use the funds to provide enhanced instructional opportunities. Title I-A requires states to establish English language proficiency standards aligned with state academic standards. LEAs must assess proficiency annually using state-aligned assessments. Title III-A funds support national programs for professional development and language instruction. Grants are awarded competitively for up to five years to relevant entities. Title III-A funds support professional development activities for English Learners (ELs) through grants awarded to IHEs or entities with relevant experience. The National Clearinghouse collects and disseminates information on language instruction programs for ELs. Title IV authorizes various programs including block grants, support for charter schools, family engagement, and community support programs. Title IV-A authorizes SSAE grants to improve students' academic achievement through well-rounded education, school conditions improvement, and technology use. States receive formula grants based on Title I-A funding and then distribute subgrants to LEAs for activities supporting educational opportunities, student safety, and health. Title IV-B supports well-rounded educational opportunities, safe and healthy students, and technology use. LEAs must allocate funds accordingly. Formula grants are given to SEAs based on Title I-A funding, which then distribute grants to local entities for three to five years. Local entities may use funds for activities that improve student academic achievement and support student success, such as academic enrichment programs, mentoring, tutoring, technology education, parenting skills programs, and STEM programs. The Charter Schools Program (CSP) supports the startup, replication, and expansion of high-quality charter schools, provides facilities aid, and funds national activities for charter school support and best practices dissemination. 65% of Title I-C funds go towards charter school initiatives, 22.5% for national activities, and 12.5% for facilities financing. Title IV-D provides grants to LEAs to establish and operate magnet schools, which are public schools of choice aimed at promoting voluntary enrollment by students of diverse racial backgrounds. Priority is given to LEAs with court-ordered or federally approved desegregation plans, based on need and evidence-based practices for successful implementation. Admission to magnet schools is typically through methods other than academic exams, such as lotteries, to increase racial diversity. Title IV-E provides grants for family engagement centers to promote parent education and involvement in education programs. Title IV-F authorizes the Education Innovation and Research program for innovative initiatives to improve achievement and attainment.
