The Corporation for National and Community Service will provide grants to states and eligible entities for the creation or expansion of full-time or part-time Clean Energy Corps programs. To be eligible for a grant under this program, a State or eligible entity must submit an application to the Corporation with required information. The Corporation will consult with Conservation Corps for application guidelines. The Clean Energy Corps focuses on disadvantaged youth and allows for higher costs per member for supportive services and flexibility in retention rates. Equal consideration is given to residential Corps programs. The Corporation ensures equal consideration for residential Corps programs in both urban and rural areas, providing opportunities for disadvantaged youth and disaster response-ready crews. The Corporation focuses on providing equal opportunities for disadvantaged youth and disaster response-ready crews in both urban and rural areas. Programs receiving assistance under this subtitle can address public needs such as energy conservation, infrastructure improvement, and emergency operations. This includes improving energy efficiency in housing for elderly and low-income individuals, constructing green housing, environmental and energy education, recycling, and infrastructure facility repair. The current chunk focuses on various infrastructure enhancements, including transportation improvements, military base transformation, tree planting, renewable resource enhancement, and emergency operations assistance. It also emphasizes providing training opportunities for disadvantaged youth for career development. The Clean Energy Corps aims to train disadvantaged youth for careers in clean energy and environmental preservation. Its goals include promoting clean energy use, providing opportunities for personal and professional growth, mobilizing youth for energy conservation, and facilitating a pathway to employment in the private sector. The Clean Energy Corps requires applicants to outline plans for assessing Corpsmembers' skills, providing life and work skills training, offering education and training, forming academic agreements with various institutions, giving career and educational guidance, and recruiting participants without high school diplomas. The Clean Energy Corps gives preference to programs that meet public needs, instill work ethic and public service values, involve youth in team-based structures, and enhance skills and educational opportunities for participants. Participants in programs receiving assistance under this subtitle must be between 18 and 25 years old, with exceptions for summer programs allowing individuals aged 14 to 21. At least 50% of participants must be economically disadvantaged youth. Special Corpsmembers over 25 may be enrolled to contribute their skills. The use of volunteers is also emphasized. The use of volunteer services under SEC. 199V must not displace any participant. SEC. 199W emphasizes cooperation among states for emergency response. States operating a Clean Energy Corps can enter into agreements with other participating States for mutual cooperation in managing declared emergencies or disasters. Participating States can request assistance from each other through authorized representatives, with frequent consultation and exchange of information between State officials and the United States Government. The government facilitates the exchange of information, plans, and resource records for emergency capabilities. The Federal share of the cost for a Clean Energy Corps program is 76 percent. The Corporation will provide technical assistance and disseminate best practices. Training and technical assistance will be provided through a contract with a national organization. Authorization of appropriations is also included. Authorization of appropriations is granted for fiscal years 2010 through 2014 to achieve the goals of this subtitle, with 90% allocated for grants to eligible entities, 5% for technical assistance and dissemination of best practices, and 5% for evaluation."
