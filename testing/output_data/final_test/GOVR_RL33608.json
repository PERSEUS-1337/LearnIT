The US withdrew its membership in June 2018 due to concerns about the Council's focus on Israel, ineffectiveness in addressing human rights, and lack of reform. Policymakers are considering the impact of the withdrawal on the Council's efforts and the US's ability to further its human rights objectives in UN fora. They are also questioning the Council's role in international human rights policy and its effectiveness in addressing specific human rights situations. The report provides background on the United Nations Human Rights Council, including the role of the previous U.N. Commission on Human Rights. It discusses the Council's current mandate, structure, Administration policy, and congressional actions. Policy aspects of interest to the 116th Congress are highlighted, such as the debate over U.S. membership, funding of the Council, alternatives in U.N. fora, and the Council's focus on Israel. The U.N. Commission on Human Rights, established in 1946 under ECOSOC, played a key role in developing human rights standards and treaties, including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. It later focused on monitoring and reporting on human rights violations, such as racial discrimination and freedom of expression. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, controversy arose over the human rights records of some U.N. Commission on Human Rights members, affecting the commission's credibility. Critics claimed countries used their membership to deflect attention from their own human rights violations. The United States was not elected to the commission in 2001, while perceived human rights violators like Pakistan, Sudan, and Uganda were. In 2005, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan proposed a new Human Rights Council to replace the commission due to ongoing controversies. In 2006, the U.N. General Assembly dissolved the U.N. Commission on Human Rights and created the Human Rights Council to promote universal respect for human rights and prevent violations. The Council reports directly to the General Assembly and receives support from the U.N. Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. The Human Rights Council, supported by the U.N. Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, is a political body with 47 members elected for three-year terms. Members are apportioned by geographic region and decisions are not legally binding. The General Assembly can suspend membership for \"gross and systematic violations of human rights.\" The UN Human Rights Council consists of 47 members elected for three-year terms. Countries are nominated by regional groups and elected by the General Assembly through secret ballot. Critics are concerned about lack of competitiveness in Council elections, with some members running unopposed. Supporters argue that the election process is an improvement over the previous commission. The Council's election process is seen as an improvement over the previous commission, with countries like Belarus, Sudan, and Syria pressured not to run or defeated in elections. Some suggest open ballots in Council elections to hold countries publicly accountable. The Council is headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland, and meets for three or more sessions. The Council, headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland, holds regular and special sessions throughout the year. Special sessions can be called for specific human rights issues with the support of one-third of the Council membership. The Council president leads the election of four vice presidents, with the current president being Coly Seck of Senegal. Members elect a president from the bureau for a one-year term. The current president of the Council is Coly Seck of Senegal. All Council members and U.N. member states undergo a Universal Periodic Review (UPR) to assess human rights obligations. The UPR working group, chaired by the Council president, engages in dialogue with the country under review. Observer states and stakeholders like NGOs can participate and provide information. Initial recommendations are made during the first review, with subsequent reviews focusing on implementation. The full Council addresses cases of noncooperation with the review. The United States had its first UPR in November 2010 and second in May 2015. Many governments, observers, and policymakers support the Council's UPR process as it provides a forum to discuss human rights situations in specific countries. NGOs and human rights groups use UPR recommendations as a tool for achieving human rights goals. However, some experts criticize the process for not challenging governments perceived as human rights abusers and giving them a platform to criticize other countries. The UPR process allows countries to criticize others with positive human rights records. Experts are concerned about member states' response. The Council has special procedures for country and thematic mandates, as well as a complaint procedure for reporting abuses. In 2007, a resolution was adopted to address the Council's working methods. The Human Rights Council, funded primarily through the U.N. regular budget, includes the \"human rights situation in Palestine and other occupied Arab territories\" as a permanent agenda item, which has faced objections from some U.N. member states and Council observers. The U.N. Secretary-General expressed disappointment with the Council's decision to single out one specific regional item. The estimated funding for the Council for the 2018-2019 regular budget biennium is $44.43 million. The Human Rights Council receives $44.43 million in funding for the 2018-2019 biennium, with additional voluntary contributions of $16.27 million. U.S. policymakers have supported the Council's purpose but have concerns about its effectiveness in addressing human rights issues. There have been disagreements on whether the U.S. should be a member or provide funding, with past administrations expressing reservations about the Council's credibility. The Obama Administration supported U.S. membership and funding for the Human Rights Council, while the Bush Administration withheld funding in FY2008. The U.S. was elected as a Council member in 2009, 2012, and 2016. Under President Obama, the U.S. opposed Council actions related to Israel and sought reforms in 2011. Some Members of Congress support U.S. participation, while others oppose it due to the Council's focus on Israel. In 2018, the U.S. announced its withdrawal from the Council citing concerns about sovereignty. The United States withdrew from the Human Rights Council in 2018, citing concerns about sovereignty and the Council's focus on Israel. The Trump Administration expressed reservations about U.S. membership and withheld funding totaling $15.3 million over two years. Despite the withdrawal, the U.S. continues to participate in some Council activities and supports reform efforts. The Trump Administration had strong reservations about U.S. membership in the Human Rights Council, citing concerns about its focus on Israel and lack of attention to other human rights abuses. Ambassador Haley criticized the Council as \"corrupt\" and highlighted the presence of \"bad actors\" among its members. Despite this, the U.S. aimed to find value in the Council but threatened to pursue human rights advancement outside of it if reforms were not made. Haley outlined two key reform priorities: changing the voting process in the General Assembly to hold countries publicly accountable and removing Israel as a permanent agenda item. Congress maintains interest in the Council's credibility, effectiveness, and focus on human rights promotion. Members of the 116th Congress enacted legislation in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019 (P.L. 116-6) requiring the Secretary of State to determine if U.S. participation in the Human Rights Council is in the national interest. The act also mandates steps to remove Israel as a permanent agenda item and ensure integrity in the election of Council members. In the context of human rights situations in Sri Lanka, P.L. 116-6 requires the Secretary of State to certify that the Sri Lankan government is supporting a credible justice mechanism in compliance with Human Rights Council resolution 30/1. Previous Congresses have proposed bills addressing U.S. withdrawal from the Council, defunding or withdrawing from the Council, and calling for action on specific human rights issues. The U.N. Human Rights Council has been a topic of debate in Congress, with U.S. policymakers divided on whether the U.S. should be a member. Supporters argue that U.S. participation allows for advocacy of human rights policies and priorities, as well as the opportunity to steer the Council towards a more balanced approach. They also highlight U.S. leadership in the Council leading to increased attention on human rights situations in countries like Iran, Mali, North Korea, and Sudan. Some argue that U.S. membership in the U.N. Human Rights Council provides legitimacy, while others believe it focuses too much on Israel and allows human rights abusers to serve as members. Concerns also exist about a possible leadership gap if the U.S. withdraws, with China and Russia potentially gaining more influence. Critics suggest that U.S. membership allows for criticism of the country during the UPR process. Some policymakers debate withholding U.S. funding for the U.N. Human Rights Council, with recent actions by the Trump Administration withholding millions in contributions. This symbolic policy action has been taken before in 2008. The United States previously withheld funding from the U.N. Human Rights Council in 2008 under the Bush Administration. Some suggest the U.S. could pursue human rights objectives in other U.N. forums like the General Assembly's Third Committee. Increasing support for the U.N. Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights and the Council's independent experts is also recommended by some policymakers. The U.S. has considered addressing human rights issues in various U.N. forums, including the Security Council. Critics argue that alternatives may not have the same influence as the Human Rights Council. Opponents of U.S. withdrawal believe the Council offers unique opportunities for human rights protection. The Human Rights Council includes unique mechanisms to address human rights issues, such as the complaint procedure and Universal Periodic Review process. Congressional concern has been raised over the Council's ongoing focus on Israel and perceived bias against the country, highlighted by actions like the \"Goldstone Report\" in 2009. The Human Rights Council has faced criticism for its focus on Israel, including allegations of bias and possible war crimes. The Council's actions, such as the \"Goldstone Report\" in 2009, have drawn attention and controversy. Additionally, the Council's resolution in March 2016, requesting a database of businesses involved in Israeli settlements, has sparked alarm and opposition from the United States. Some experts believe the Council's attention on Israel is influenced by its membership composition. The Human Rights Council's focus on Israel is influenced by its membership composition, with the Organization of Islamic Cooperation holding a significant number of seats. Other blocs like the African Group and Non-Aligned Movement prioritize economic and security issues over human rights violations."
