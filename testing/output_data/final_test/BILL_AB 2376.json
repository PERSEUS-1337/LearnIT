    "title": "AB 2376",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 31494.2 of the Government Code is amended. A member under Retirement Plan D can switch to Retirement Plan E during active employment by submitting a written application to the board. The change is effective on the transfer date, with rights and obligations governed by the new plan. Benefits prior to the transfer date remain under the original plan. The transfer of benefits from Retirement Plan D to Retirement Plan E during active employment is governed by the new plan, while benefits prior to the transfer date remain under the original plan. Upon transfer to Retirement Plan E, members and their survivors or beneficiaries will receive benefits based on service credited under each plan, with calculations subject to the respective plan's terms. The beneficiaries' benefits under each retirement plan are subject to the plan's specific terms, including definitions of \"final compensation,\" cost-of-living adjustments, minimum retirement age, service requirements, and integration with federal social security payments. However, the total service credited under both plans will be considered for eligibility and vesting of benefits. (c) A member transferring to Retirement Plan E cannot receive disability retirement benefits under Retirement Plan D. If the member dies before retirement, their survivor or beneficiary will receive a refund of contributions to Retirement Plan D with interest. The definitions in this section clarify terms such as \"period of active employment,\" \"Retirement Plan D,\" \"Retirement Plan E,\" and \"transfer date.\" Los Angeles County must elect to make this section operative. Section 31494.5 of the Government Code is amended. A general member under Retirement Plan E can switch to Retirement Plan D during active employment by filing a written application with the board. The change in plan membership is effective on the transfer date, and the member's rights and obligations will be governed by Retirement Plan D thereafter. The transfer of a general member from Retirement Plan E to Retirement Plan D during active employment is governed by written application and is effective on the transfer date. Payments to a member's survivors or beneficiaries will still be governed by Retirement Plan E. If a member elects to change plans from Retirement Plan E to Retirement Plan D, monthly contributions by the member and employer will start on the transfer date. The member's entry age for contribution rate calculation in Retirement Plan D will be based on their age at the nearest birthday to the transfer date. If the member exchanges service credit, their entry age will be adjusted to the age at the nearest birthday to the start of the most recent unbroken service period credited under Retirement Plan D. When changing plans, the member's entry age for contribution rate calculation will be based on their age at the nearest birthday to the transfer date. If exchanging service credit, the entry age will be adjusted to the age at the nearest birthday to the start of the most recent unbroken service period credited under the new plan. A general member changing plans can exchange some or all service credited under Retirement Plan E for an equivalent amount of service under Retirement Plan D. The exchange must be for at least 12 months' service or the total service credited under Plan E. The member must complete the purchase of the service by depositing in the retirement fund, either as a lump sum or regular monthly installments, within a specified time frame determined by the board of retirement. Upon retirement, a member can receive the sum of contributions they would have made to Retirement Plan D, along with regular interest, up to 120 days after retirement or death. A member's entry age for Retirement Plan D is determined by their age at the nearest birthday to the start of their most recent credited service period. Credit for service can only be received under one plan, not both D and E. Failure to complete service purchase results in an exchange under Plan E for equivalent service under Plan D for purchased service only. As of the transfer date, a member transferring to Retirement Plan D will receive benefits based on their service credited under that plan and what they would have received under Retirement Plan E if they had remained a member of that plan. The calculation of benefits from each plan is subject to the specific plan's rules. The calculation of a member's or beneficiary's benefit under each plan is determined by the plan's specific terms, including definitions of \"final compensation\" and provisions for cost-of-living adjustments, age and service requirements, and integration with social security payments. Service credited under Retirement Plan D and Retirement Plan E is combined for eligibility and vesting purposes. (e) A member transferring into Retirement Plan D must meet specific service requirements to be eligible for disability benefits under the plan. If the member does not meet these requirements, they can opt for a deferred or service retirement allowance, or transfer back to Retirement Plan E for calculating their benefits. The member transferring into Retirement Plan D can have service under Retirement Plan E credited during total disability, receiving disability benefits from the employer's plan. If the member dies before meeting specific service requirements, their beneficiary may not be entitled to survivor allowance. A member transferring to Retirement Plan D cannot receive service retirement benefits under Retirement Plan E if they retire for disability under Retirement Plan D. Disability benefits under Retirement Plan D will include a blended benefit based on service retirement calculations. The curr_chunk defines \"active service\" as time spent on duty and authorized paid leaves, excluding leave due to preexisting disability. The board of retirement determines if leave is due to disability. \"Entry age\" is the age used for calculating contributions in Retirement Plan D for transferred members. The curr_chunk defines \"period of active employment\" as time spent working or on authorized paid leave, excluding disability leave. \"Retirement Plan D\" is the contributory plan available to members from June 1, 1979, to December 31, 2012. \"Retirement Plan E\" is the noncontributory plan. \"Transfer date\" is the first day of the month following a plan membership change application. The curr_chunk introduces new sections added to the Government Code for Los Angeles County, including provisions for retirement eligibility and voting rights for alternate retired members. The regulations in Section 31526 of the Government Code are amended to include provisions for the election of officers, filing of sworn statements by members, and forms of annuity certificates."
