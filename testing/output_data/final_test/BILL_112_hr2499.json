    "content": "The Act titled \"Lymphedema Diagnosis and Treatment Cost-Saving Act of 2011\" mandates coverage of lymphedema diagnosis and treatment services under Medicare. The Act mandates Medicare coverage for lymphedema diagnosis and treatment services, including lymphedema compression treatment items. Lymphedema diagnosis services involve identifying the cause of edema and lymphatic deficiency to develop a treatment plan. Treatment services include inpatient or outpatient care provided by a healthcare provider. The text chunk discusses the criteria for lymphedema treatment coverage, emphasizing the need for medically necessary services within the established scope of practice. This includes various modalities like manual lymph drainage, compression therapy, exercise, and patient education. The text chunk outlines the requirements for lymphedema treatment coverage, including initial evaluation, follow-up treatment, cancer-related measurements, and approved treatment modalities. The curr_chunk defines the term 'provider' as any licensed medical or health care provider recognized by their State licensing board for lymphedema diagnosis and treatment. It also explains 'lymphedema compression treatment items' as garments, devices, bandaging systems, and supplies used in lymphedema treatment, prescribed by a provider. The curr_chunk details various lymphedema compression treatment items, including compression bandaging systems, gradient compression garments, non-elastic garments, compression wraps, and ancillary equipment like donning aids and bandage rollers. The curr_chunk expands on lymphedema compression treatment items, including pneumatic appliances, compression garments, bandaging systems, and replacements under section 1834(p)(3). Payment for these items is addressed in section 1833(a) of the Act. The curr_chunk introduces a new paragraph and subsection related to payment for lymphedema compression treatment items under section 1834(p) of the Act. Payment is determined as 80 percent of the payment basis described in the subsection. The payment basis for lymphedema compression treatment items is the actual charge for the item. This subsection is the exclusive provision for payment for these items to home health agencies or as an incident to a physician's service. Allowable quantities are determined in each case. Payment may be made for lymphedema compression treatment items in customary, reasonable, and medically necessary quantities if determined necessary by a provider. Payment is also allowed for replacement of these items when their reasonable and useful lifetime has expired. For lymphedema compression treatment items, payment can be made for replacement or repair if medically necessary. The reasonable and useful lifetime varies depending on the item type: 1 year for type 1, 6 months for type 2, 2 years for type 3, and 1 year for type 4. The reasonable and useful lifetime for lymphedema compression treatment items varies depending on the item type, ranging from 1 year to 2 years as determined by the Secretary in consultation with appropriate health organizations. Amendments are made to the application of supplier requirements in the Act. Amendments are made to the Medicare Act regarding lymphedema diagnosis and treatment services, including the addition of lymphedema compression treatment items. The reasonable lifetime for these items varies from 1 to 2 years as determined by the Secretary. Payment for outpatient lymphedema diagnosis and treatment services by physicians and non-physician practitioners is set at 80% of the actual charge or the applicable fee schedule amount. Amendments to the Medicare Act include coverage for lymphedema compression treatment items with a reasonable lifetime of 1 to 2 years determined by the Secretary. The amendments made by this section apply to items and services furnished on or after 180 days from the enactment of the Act. Conforming amendments are made for payments under section 1834(k) of the Medicare Act."
