Deep domain adaptation, using techniques like Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN), has shown success in transferring learning from labeled to unlabeled data sources. Our aim in this paper is to propose Dual Generator-Discriminator Deep Code Domain Adaptation Network (Dual-GD-DDAN) for transfer learning in software projects to resolve the mode collapsing problem. Experimental results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in software vulnerability detection. The software vulnerability detection problem is crucial in the software industry and computer security. Various techniques and tools have been developed to detect vulnerabilities efficiently, ranging from open source to commercial tools. Previous works in software vulnerability detection have been based on handcrafted features. Recent works have focused on using automatic features in software vulnerability detection (SVD) to overcome the limitations of handcrafted features. While automatic features have shown advantages, there is a challenge of scarcity of labeled projects for training models, as labeling vulnerable code is a tedious and time-consuming process. Applying transfer learning or domain adaptation can automate the process of labeling vulnerable source code, which is tedious and time-consuming. Deep domain adaptation has shown advantages over shallow domain adaptation in terms of predictive performance and handling structural data. The work applies deep domain adaptation to SVD, using GANs to minimize the discrepancy between source and target data in a joint feature space. This approach shows promising predictive performance on real-world source code projects. Deep domain adaptation approaches using GANs may encounter mode collapsing, missing mode, boundary distortion, and data distortion problems. The representations of source and target examples in the joint feature space may degenerate, affecting the manifold/clustering structure. In this paper, the focus is on addressing mode collapsing and boundary distortion issues in deep domain adaptation using GANs. Two approaches are proposed: applying manifold regularization to preserve clustering structures in the joint feature space and using dual discriminators to mitigate missing mode and boundary distortion problems. The mechanism is named Dual Generator-Discriminator Deep Code Domain Adaptation Network (Dual-GD-DDAN). Empirical evidence shows that Dual-GD-DDAN effectively overcomes these challenges. Our Dual-GD-DDAN model addresses missing mode and boundary distortion issues in Deep Code Domain Adaptation. By incorporating conditional entropy minimization and manifold regularization, we introduce Dual-GD-SDDAN. This model outperforms SCDAN in overcoming mode collapsing problems, leading to better predictive performance. The experiments compared Dual-GD-DDAN and Dual-GD-SDDAN with baselines using data from real-world software projects. Results show that the proposed methods outperform rival baselines in predictive performance and overcome issues in deep domain adaptation approaches. In an experiment comparing Dual-GD-DDAN and Dual-GD-SDDAN with baselines using real-world software project data, the proposed methods outperformed rival baselines in predictive performance and addressed issues in deep domain adaptation approaches. To bridge the gap between source and target domains in the joint feature space, data sets are preprocessed before inputting into deep neural networks by standardizing source code, mapping user-defined variables and functions to symbolic names, and embedding statements into vectors. Each statement consists of opcode and statement information, which are embedded into vectors and concatenated for representation. In software vulnerability detection, opcode and statement information are embedded into vectors and concatenated to obtain the final vector representation of a statement. The opcode is embedded using a one-hot vector and an embedding matrix, while the statement information is tokenized, converted to a frequency vector, and embedded using another matrix. These embedding matrices are learnable variables in the architecture proposed for handling sequential data in domain adaptation. The Code Domain Adaptation Network (CDAN) utilizes a Bidirectional RNN to process input from both source and target domains. It includes a fully connected layer to connect the output layer of the Bidirectional RNN with the joint feature layer. The Deep Code Domain Adaptation (DDAN) employs a source classifier, domain discriminator, and seeks optimal generator, domain discriminator, and source classifier. DDAN addresses missing mode and boundary distortion problems in the joint space. DDAN suffers from data distortion and mode collapsing problems due to missing modes in the joint space, leading to source and target data collapse and mode collapse. The joint space in DDAN faces missing mode and boundary distortion issues, causing divergence between source and target distributions. Two discriminators and generators are used to address these problems. In DDAN, two discriminators and generators are utilized to address missing mode and boundary distortion issues in the joint space. The generators are trained to push source and target examples to high value regions of the discriminators, maintaining cluster/manifold structure via manifold regularization to prevent data distortion. The Dual Generator-Discriminator Deep Code Domain Adaptation Network (Dual-GD-DDAN) utilizes two generators (G S and G T) and discriminators (D S and D T) to map source and target domain examples to the joint space. The discriminators are trained to distinguish between source and target examples, while the source classifier (C) is used to classify the source examples with labels. The source classifier classifies examples with labels using cross-entropy loss function. Two generators are trained to maintain manifold structures of source and target data and move target samples towards source samples in joint space. Manifold regularization term is proposed to preserve data structures, and bidirectional RNN hidden states are used to define weights. To resolve missing mode and boundary distortion problems in joint space, an objective function is proposed for minimizing. Generators G S and G T map source and target data to joint layer, while discriminators D S and D T distinguish between them. Source classifier C is trained on labeled source domain. Parameters \u03b1 and \u03b2 are used to update generators G S and G T. The proposed Dual-GD-DDAN resolves critical problems in the DDAN approach by preserving clustering structure in the joint space for both the source and target domains. Discriminators D S and D T are trained to encourage large values for source and target modes respectively, while generators G S and G T move examples to high-valued regions of the opposite domain's discriminator. Dual-GD-DDAN reduces the impact of missing mode and boundary distortion problems, making the target distribution more similar to the source distribution in the joint space. Nguyen et al. proposed Dual-GD-DDAN to bridge the gap between source and target domains in the joint layer, treating target samples as unlabeled data. They minimize conditional entropy and use spectral graph to ensure smoothness of the source classifier C. The smoothness-inspired term involves Bernoulli distributions and Kullback-Leibler divergence. Dual Generator-Discriminator Semi-supervised Deep Code Domain Adaptation Network (Dual-GD-SDDAN) combines S x S and v = G T x T representations in the joint space. Experimental results on real-world software projects show its effectiveness compared to other approaches. The objective function includes parameters \u03b3, \u03bb. In a study by Lin et al. (2018), vulnerable and non-vulnerable functions were analyzed from real-world software projects like FFmpeg, LibTIFF, LibPNG, VLC, and Pidgin. The data sets included multimedia and image applications. Different methods were trained using one-layer bidirectional recurrent neural networks with LSTM cells. Dual-GD-SDDAN utilizes bidirectional LSTM networks for generators, deep feed-forward neural networks for classifiers and discriminators, Adam optimizer, mini-batch size of 64, and specific parameters for training and validation data partitioning. In Python using Tensorflow, eight models are trained and tested with gradient clipping regularization to prevent over-fitting. Experiments are conducted on a computer with an Intel Xeon Processor E5-1660. The proposed Dual-GD-DDAN method's performance is compared with other methods like VulDeePecker, DDAN, MMD, D2GAN, and DIRT-T with VAP applied. The proposed Dual-GD-DDAN method is compared with other methods like VulDeePecker, DDAN, MMD, D2GAN, and DIRT-T with VAP applied. Dual-GD-DDAN aims to alleviate boundary distortion in domain adaptation by quantitatively demonstrating its efficiency in reducing distortion between two data sets. The Dual-GD-DDAN method aims to reduce boundary distortion in domain adaptation by comparing accuracies of predictions on training and testing sets. A 2D t-SNE projection for FFmpeg \u2192 LibPNG domain adaptation is shown, with blue and red points representing source and target domains. Data points labeled 0 are non-vulnerable samples, while data points labeled 1 are vulnerable samples. Our Dual-GD-DDAN method compares accuracies of predictions on source and target data sets in joint feature space to measure boundary distortion in domain adaptation. Results show smaller gaps and higher accuracies compared to DDAN method for FFmpeg and Pidgin domains adapting to LibPNG. Our Dual-GD-DDAN method outperforms the DDAN method in producing better representations for source and target samples with less boundary distortion. Visualization using t-SNE projection shows the efficiency of Dual-GD-DDAN in alleviating boundary distortion during domain adaptation from FFmpeg to LibPNG. Our Dual-GD-SDDAN method improves representation quality for source and target samples with reduced boundary distortion compared to DDAN. Dual-GD-SDDAN shows higher mixing levels of source and target data in each cluster, addressing the boundary distortion issue during domain adaptation from FFmpeg to LibPNG. Our Dual-GD-SDDAN method outperforms SCDAN in detecting vulnerable and non-vulnerable functions across different source and target domains, showing higher F1-measure especially in cases like VLC to LibPNG. This demonstrates its superior ability in handling mode collapsing issues and improving predictive performance in software domain adaptation for software vulnerability detection (SVD). In this paper, the Dual Generator-Discriminator Deep Code Domain Adaptation Network (Dual-GD-DDAN) method is proposed to address issues in software vulnerability detection (SVD) related to labeled vulnerabilities scarcity. Experimental results show that the Dual-GD-DDAN method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in predictive performances. An example using source code functions from VLC and LibPNG projects demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method in software domain adaptation. Transfer learning for software vulnerability detection between different projects is plausible and promising. Functions from VLC and LibPNG projects show similarities in their use of the memcpy function, which can lead to buffer overflow errors. The syntactic and semantic relationships between these functions make it feasible to transfer learning from one project to another. Transfer learning from the first project to the second project involves analyzing source code functions in the C programming language from VLC and LibPNG projects. These functions highlight the same vulnerability related to the misuse of the memcpy function. Recent work in automatic feature learning for software vulnerability detection and deep domain adaptation is also discussed, focusing on minimizing intervention from security experts and employing a Recurrent Neutral Network (RNN) for transforming code tokens into vectorial features. The study introduces a deep neural network that combines learning vector representations and training a classifier for classification purposes, aiming to enhance predictive performance compared to traditional methods."
