Close cooperation with the UK on NATO issues is expected to continue. The U.S. and UK have a strong defense relationship, including joint deployment of forces for reassurance in Eastern Europe and combating ISIS. The 1958 Mutual Defense Agreement covers nuclear cooperation. Brexit is not expected to impact defense ties. Intelligence and counterterrorism cooperation between the two countries is close and well-established. Experts suggest that Brexit could weaken Euro-Atlantic cooperation on security concerns, potentially undermining Western unity in facing threats like terrorism and Russian aggression. The UK's departure from the EU may lead to economic disruption and pose challenges to U.S. foreign policy. Uncertainty surrounds the UK's trade, economic arrangements, and regulatory frameworks post-Brexit, despite the country's consistent economic growth in recent years. The UK economy is slowly recovering from the global financial crises, with trade accounting for 60% of its economy, largely due to reduced trade barriers with the EU. The UK is a significant part of the EU economy, with the EU's GDP surpassing that of the United States and China when including the UK. Trade with the EU makes up a significant portion of the UK's exports and imports. The Single Market has fostered economic ties between the UK and the EU, aiding in the growth of the services sector in the UK.

The continuing political leadership crisis in the UK can impact short-term economic conditions, leading to market uncertainty. The UK's trade and economic arrangements, as well as legal and regulatory frameworks, are also uncertain post-Brexit. Trade accounts for 60% of the UK economy, with close ties to the EU. Various organizations have assessed the economic impact of Brexit. The IMF projected that Brexit could slow UK economic growth to 1.6% in 2016, with potential GDP reductions of 1.4% to 5.6% by 2019. Eurozone members with close trade links to the UK, like Ireland and the Netherlands, would be most affected.

The OECD estimated a 3.3% reduction in GDP in the short run and 5.1% in the long run due to Brexit.

Over 75% of economists predict a negative outcome for the UK from Brexit. The Financial Times predicted a negative outcome for the UK from Brexit, citing concerns over uncertainty in financial markets. Researchers suggest that the economic impact of Brexit could be greater than current estimates. The uncertainty has led to a depreciation of the British pound and foreign investors selling the pound in favor of other safe-haven currencies. This has also steered some investment funds towards the United States, putting upward pressure on the value of the dollar. A depreciated pound may boost UK exports. The UK's exports may not see a significant increase despite a higher valued dollar. Analysts argue that the demand for high-value-added products is not very responsive to price changes.

The UK may regain authority over setting its own external tariffs and trade policy, which is currently controlled by the EU. The economic implications of this shift are unclear. The economic implications of Brexit on UK trade relations are uncertain. The UK may benefit from lower tariffs but could lose access to the EU Single Market and preferential trade agreements. The status of ongoing EU trade negotiations, including the T-TIP FTA, is also in question. Various scenarios for the UK's post-Brexit trade relationship with the EU have been proposed, with differing levels of access to the Single Market. The EU post-Brexit presents various scenarios for the UK's trade relationship, ranging from preferential market access to WTO rules. If no agreement is reached, EU tariffs on the UK would likely revert to WTO levels. EU average tariff rates are relatively low, but higher in sensitive sectors like agriculture. The UK could also negotiate a comprehensive bilateral FTA with the EU. The UK could negotiate a comprehensive bilateral Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with the EU, similar to Canada's Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) with the EU. Other specialized arrangements like the \"Norway model\" exist, where full access to the Single Market is possible but requires adherence to EU rules. The \"Switzerland model\" offers the UK limited access to the Single Market through bilateral agreements with the EU, requiring adherence to EU regulations. The \"Turkey model\" involves a customs union with the EU, granting access for goods but not agriculture or services. These arrangements do not grant voting rights in EU decision-making. Brexit would require the UK to redefine its terms of trade with other countries, including renegotiating its terms of trade within the WTO. The process for such negotiations is unclear, and the associated time period may be lengthy. This would also impact the UK's relations with over 50 countries with which the EU has preferential trade agreements. Brexit could impact the UK's access to existing EU trade agreements with key partners like Mexico and South Korea. It may also affect potential access to agreements with Canada and negotiations like the Trade in Services Agreement and T-TIP with the US.

The World Bank forecasted global growth in 2016 at 2.4%, equal to 2015 but 0.5% below its January 2016 forecast due to Brexit uncertainties and global economic challenges. The uncertainties created by Brexit are expected to have a negative impact on global markets beyond the immediate turmoil. A protracted political leadership struggle in the UK could further add to economic uncertainties. The simultaneous depreciation of the pound and appreciation of the dollar may increase economic pressures on developed and emerging market economies. Central banks like the Swiss National Bank and the Bank of Japan have intervened in foreign exchange markets to prevent further currency appreciation. Capital flight from emerging economies to safe-haven assets could worsen economic challenges for both developed and emerging economies, potentially impacting global growth prospects. The Brexit vote presents challenges for global economic growth, leading to increased volatility in financial markets. Changes in currency exchange rates post-Brexit could have a significant impact on the global economy. Central banks, including the Federal Reserve, will closely monitor these developments and their effects on the U.S. and global economies.
