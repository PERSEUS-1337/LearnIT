    "content": "Article III of the Constitution limits federal courts' jurisdiction to \"Cases\" and \"Controversies,\" with legal doctrines like standing, ripeness, mootness, and the political question doctrine guiding when disputes can be adjudicated. These justiciability doctrines respect the separation of powers and the courts' role in a democratic society. The political question doctrine, in particular, avoids certain controversies that are more suited for resolution within the political branches, sparking controversy due to its implications for the separation of powers. The political question doctrine in federal courts has sparked controversy, especially in cases related to foreign policy. Courts have declined to adjudicate challenges to the \"kill list,\" war powers violations, and claims that could harm foreign policy interests. This has been seen as judicial deference to the executive branch at the expense of Congress. It is important to differentiate this doctrine from cases involving political issues. The political question doctrine in federal courts involves controversies with political ramifications, such as challenges to electoral processes and subpoenas against the President. The doctrine applies to issues best resolved by Congress or the executive branch, but its exact application is unclear and has caused confusion. The Supreme Court has noted the difficulty in determining when the doctrine applies, requiring a delicate exercise in constitutional interpretation. The political question doctrine in federal courts involves controversies with political ramifications, such as challenges to electoral processes and subpoenas against the President. The doctrine requires a delicate exercise in constitutional interpretation to determine its application. The origins of the doctrine can be traced back to Chief Justice Marshall's opinion in Marbury v. Madison. The political question doctrine in federal courts involves controversies with political ramifications, such as challenges to electoral processes and subpoenas against the President. Justice Marshall explained that the Constitution entrusts certain political powers to the executive branch, which are not justiciable. The conclusion is that where the heads of departments are political agents of the executive, their decisions are conclusive. The heads of departments act as political agents of the executive to carry out the President's will. When their actions involve constitutional or legal discretion, they are politically examinable. However, if a specific duty is assigned by law and individual rights are at stake, individuals have the right to seek legal remedies. The definition of a political question by Chief Justice Marshall pertains to matters where the President has unrestricted discretion, not those affecting individual rights. The concept of what constitutes a political question has evolved since Marbury. The concept of what constitutes a political question has broadened since Marbury v. Madison. Courts have found political questions in areas not solely committed to the President's discretion, including when individual rights are implicated. In Luther v. Borden, the Supreme Court declined to adjudicate a challenge to the Rhode Island charter government under the republican form of government clause in the U.S. Constitution. Rhode Island's charter government was challenged as violating the Guarantee Clause, which provides for a Republican form of government in each state. The Supreme Court in Luther v. Borden refused to adjudicate a challenge to Rhode Island's charter government under the Guarantee Clause, stating that it was a political question for Congress to decide. Congress determines the established government in a state before deciding if it is republican, and its decision is binding on all branches of government. The Court did not provide its own interpretation as certain matters were committed to Congress's discretion. The Court in Luther v. Borden noted prudential considerations against judicial resolution, citing the lack of criteria for determination. Subsequent challenges under the Guarantee Clause were dismissed by the Court, including those related to state congressional districting. The modern encapsulation of the political question doctrine in Baker v. Carr clarified challenges to election issues. In Baker v. Carr, challenges to election districts under the Equal Protection Clause were explained. The case involved a challenge to a state's legislative apportionment that allegedly impaired votes and created unjustifiable inequality. The Court distinguished between claims under the Guarantee Clause and the Equal Protection Clause, stating that Guarantee Clause cases involve the judiciary's relationship with the federal government, not the states. The Guarantee Clause lacks judicially manageable standards. The Court in Baker v. Carr ruled that the Equal Protection claim was justiciable, citing well-developed standards under the Equal Protection Clause. They outlined six matters that could present political questions in other circumstances. The Court in Baker v. Carr outlined factors for determining political questions, including the need for adherence to political decisions and potential embarrassment from multiple department pronouncements. They emphasized a discriminating analysis for cases implicating foreign policy. The Court in Baker v. Carr outlined factors for determining political questions, emphasizing a discriminating analysis for cases implicating foreign policy and the possible consequences of judicial action. The political question doctrine is seen as a function of the separation of powers, but its foundation remains unclear, leading to differing views on its application and the proper role of courts in relation to other branches of government. The political question doctrine outlines that courts must adjudicate cases properly presented before them, including interpreting the Constitution, without sidestepping their role. A political question arises only when the Constitution clearly assigns resolution to another branch. The judiciary interprets the Constitution as assigning discretion to another branch, grounding decisions on principle rather than expediency. The \"passive virtues\" theory by Alexander Bickel allows courts to decline adjudicating a case for prudential reasons, aiming to maintain the judiciary's legitimacy. Bickel argued that judicial invalidation of public will could undermine the judiciary's perceived legitimacy, which is crucial for its power. The \"passive virtues\" theory by Alexander Bickel suggests that courts can maintain legitimacy by refraining from adjudicating cases, as invalidating public will or upholding harmful policies can risk legitimacy. Upholding a law as constitutional may unintentionally endorse it, leading courts to engage in dialogue with other branches of government and the public instead. Bickel's theory of the \"passive virtues\" suggests that courts can maintain legitimacy by refraining from adjudicating cases through invoking the political question doctrine. This doctrine is based on the Court's sense of lack of capacity and the inner vulnerability of an institution that is electorally irresponsible. By not issuing rulings that outstrip the mood of the country, courts can avoid unbalancing judicial judgment and instead engage in dialogue with other branches of government and the public. The court can use the passive virtues, like the political question doctrine, to refrain from adjudicating certain issues and allow the political branches to resolve them over time. This approach helps in eliciting correct answers to prudential questions and maintaining legitimacy by not exceeding the mood of the country. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals has described prudential considerations as examining the consequences of a court asserting its jurisdiction. The political question doctrine helps courts avoid certain cases based on prudential and constitutional factors, sometimes overlapping. The Supreme Court has used both factors without clear differentiation, noting the interdependence of the Baker factors in determining political questions. The political question doctrine relies on judicially manageable standards to determine if a case should be dismissed, as seen in Supreme Court rulings. The Baker factors are used to assess if a case raises a political question, with no clear comprehensive rule for identification. Each case must be evaluated individually to determine if it falls under the political question doctrine. The Supreme Court determines if a case raises a political question on a case-by-case basis. Cases have covered foreign policy matters and the impeachment process. Prior to Baker v. Carr, the Court found questions like hostilities, war, Indian tribes, and foreign governments are political. In Goldwater v. Carter, a challenge against President Carter's treaty rescission was deemed nonjusticiable. In Coleman v. Miller (1939), the Court ruled that the efficacy of ratifications by state legislatures is a political question. State legislators challenged the ratification of the Child Labor Amendment, arguing it had been rejected earlier. The Court stated that Congress, not the courts, has the final say on whether a proposed amendment has lost its vitality. In Goldwater v. Carter, the Court found that the Constitution is silent on treaty abrogation, similar to the issue in Coleman. The absence of a constitutional provision on treaty termination indicates that the question is not for the courts to decide. The Court distinguished the matter from the Steel Seizure case, noting that the case involved a dispute between two branches of government with resources to protect their interests. The Court dismissed the case as presenting a nonjusticiable political question, while Justice Powell found it justiciable but not ripe for judicial review. Justice Powell found the case justiciable but not ripe for judicial review due to lack of direct confrontation by Congress with the President. The Court suggested that judicial relief could be limited in cases where the executive branch deems it harmful to U.S. foreign policy interests. In Sosa v. Alvarez-Machain, the Court mentioned potential limitations on relief for violations of international law under the Alien Tort Statute. It referenced class actions seeking damages from corporations aiding the apartheid regime in South Africa, with the U.S. urging dismissal of these cases. The United States entered a Statement of Interest urging dismissal of cases involving claims that might harm U.S. foreign policy interests. The Court noted the importance of considering the Executive Branch's view on such cases. Lower courts have cited similar concerns under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act. The Court's mention of \"deference\" to political branches does not always indicate a political question. The political question doctrine has been used to address cases that could impact foreign policy interests. In Gilligan v. Morgan, students of Kent State University sought injunctive relief against the National Guard for violating their constitutional rights during civil disorder. The Supreme Court deemed the matter a nonjusticiable political question, citing separation of powers concerns. The Supreme Court in Gilligan v. Morgan ruled that judicial review of the National Guard's training procedures would intrude into areas reserved for the Legislative and Executive Branches, citing separation of powers concerns. The Supreme Court has emphasized the importance of civilian control over military decisions, stating that professional military judgments are subject to oversight by elected representatives. Lower federal courts have often dismissed claims involving foreign policy as political questions, but the Supreme Court has clarified that not all cases touching upon foreign affairs are nonjusticiable. In American Cetacean Society v. the Court ruled that interpreting treaties and legislation is a judicial function, not a political question. The Court emphasized the Judiciary's role in interpreting statutes, even if the decision has political implications. In Vieth v. Jubelirer, challenges to partisan gerrymandering were deemed nonjusticiable political questions due to the lack of judicially manageable standards. The Court overturned its previous decision in Davis v. Bandemer, finding that no discernible standard existed to adjudicate political gerrymandering claims. Various proposed standards were considered but deemed inadequate by the Court. The Court found proposed standards for evaluating partisan gerrymandering lacking, citing difficulties in assessing effects and crafting remedies. Justice Kennedy suggested the possibility of developing judicial standards in the future. The Credentials Committee of the Democratic National Convention of 1972 violated the Constitution by recommending the unseating of certain delegates. The Court reviewed the appellate court's order before the seating of delegates was determined, citing the political question doctrine and declining to interfere in political conventions. In Nixon v. United States, a former federal judge convicted of making false statements refused to resign and continued to receive his salary while in prison. The Senate invoked Impeachment Rule XI to impeach and remove a judge who continued to receive his salary while in prison. The judge challenged the use of a committee to take evidence, but the Court upheld the Senate's sole authority to try impeachments. The Court upheld the Senate's sole authority in impeachment proceedings, emphasizing the separation of powers and the impracticality of judicial review in such cases. The Court distinguished the case from Powell v. McMormack, where the judiciary reviewed a congressional decision on a member's qualifications. The Court upheld Congress's authority to determine its members' qualifications, emphasizing the separation of powers. The Powell Court concluded that the House does not have unreviewable authority to determine the qualifications of its members, as specified in the Constitution. The decision on qualifications is textually committed to the House, but the interpretation of these qualifications is not. In contrast, the Nixon Court noted that leaving the interpretation of the word \"try\" with the Senate did not violate any provision of the Constitution. The lower federal courts have dismissed cases involving foreign policy decisions as political questions, citing constitutional and prudential considerations. The application of the doctrine is unclear, with courts sometimes invoking both considerations to dismiss cases that could harm U.S. foreign policy interests. Some lower courts have found that military decisions are within the purview of the political branches, making them non-justiciable. For instance, a court in the D.C. Circuit dismissed a case challenging the U.S. \"kill lists\" as a political question, stating there were no manageable standards for review. The court declined to adjudicate on the President's decision to launch attacks on foreign targets. The court found that there are no judicially manageable standards for reviewing the President's interpretation of military intelligence or his decision to use military force based on that intelligence. It was deemed a political question whether an individual's alleged terrorist activities threaten national security, making it impossible for the court to determine the justification for using force against Al-Aulaqi. The court found that decisions on using military force are textually committed to the political branches, making judicial review nonjusticiable. In El-Shifa v. United States, a suit challenging the President's decision to launch an attack was also deemed a political question. President Clinton ordered airstrikes after the 1998 embassy bombings, including a strike on a factory in Sudan linked to chemical weapons production, leading to a lawsuit by the plant owners. The court found that the destruction of a plant in Sudan by the United States after the 1998 embassy bombings was a political question, as it involved national security and foreign relations. The owners of the plant sued the U.S., alleging violations of the law of nations and defamation. The court explained that decisions on military action are within the political branches' authority and not justiciable in court. The court ruled that decisions on military action are within the political branches' authority and not justiciable in court, as they involve national security and foreign relations. The plaintiffs' claims would require judicial analysis into the airstrikes' justification, but the political question doctrine bars courts from assessing the President's decision to launch an attack. The court's ruling on the political question doctrine was criticized by two separate concurrences, arguing that the dismissal should have been based on statutory grounds rather than the case posing a political question. Judge Ginsberg and Judge Kavanaugh both disagreed with the court's expansion of the political question doctrine, stating that it allowed the court to decline adjudicating cases even if they did not involve deciding a political question. The political question doctrine does not apply to cases involving alleged statutory violations, as it only pertains to violations of the Constitution. Judge Kavanaugh argued that this doctrine systematically favors the Executive Branch over the Legislative Branch by holding that the President's power is exclusive and preclusive under Article II of the Constitution. Judge Kavanaugh argued that the political question doctrine should not be used to address statutory violations, as it only applies to constitutional violations. He believes this doctrine unfairly favors the Executive Branch by asserting the President's power as exclusive and preclusive under Article II. The Third Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed dismissal of a case involving Holocaust survivor claims against German corporations, citing a nonjusticiable political question due to the executive branch's foreign policy interests. Similarly, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals refused to determine Taiwan's sovereignty, deferring to the executive branch's stance. In Lin v. United States, residents of Taiwan sought U.S. nationality and passports based on the San Francisco Peace Treaty with Japan. The court declined to resolve the issue, citing it as a political question and deferring to the executive branch's discretion on sovereignty matters. The judiciary does not dictate to the Executive on matters of foreign sovereignty, as seen in the dismissal of claims under the Alien Tort Statute seeking damages from Japan. The court deferred to the executive branch's judgment, stating that the issue was political and should be handled by the President. Some lower courts have dismissed challenges to the executive branch's law enforcement discretion as nonjusticiable political questions, citing the need to defer to the President's authority in foreign relations. For example, the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals dismissed a suit seeking to compel the executive branch to intervene in market conditions for small farmers, stating that such matters fall under the executive's purview. The court ruled that certain decisions involving the enforcement of banking laws and antitrust suits are nonjusticiable political questions due to the President's authority. Similarly, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals found that a discretionary decision by the Secretary of Commerce regarding export controls was also a nonjusticiable political question. The court ruled that the Secretary's decision to place items on the CCL involved national security and foreign relations concerns, making it a nonjusticiable political question. This case may be distinguished from others due to its national security implications. The court addressed the political question doctrine in a case involving a statutory claim about listing Israel as the birthplace on passports for citizens born in Jerusalem. Zivotofsky, born in Jerusalem, wanted his passport to read \"Jerusalem, Israel,\" but the State Department refused. The D.C. Court of Appeals deemed the case nonjusticiable, citing political question concerns. The Supreme Court reversed the dismissal of the case involving a statutory claim about listing Israel as the birthplace on passports for citizens born in Jerusalem. The Court held that the political question doctrine did not bar adjudication of the claim, as it involved enforcing a specific statutory right and determining the correct interpretation of the statute's constitutionality. The Supreme Court ruled that the political question doctrine did not apply to the case involving listing Israel as the birthplace on passports for citizens born in Jerusalem. The Court analyzed the constitutional commitment and manageability of the issue, noting that the Executive did not have exclusive power to determine the constitutionality of a statute. The Supreme Court ruled that the political question doctrine did not apply to the case involving listing Israel as the birthplace on passports for citizens born in Jerusalem. Justice Sotomayor's concurring opinion listed all six Baker factors, explaining the justifications for withholding judgment on the constitutionality of the statute in question. Justice Sotomayor listed the Baker factors to determine when courts should refrain from deciding on certain disputes, emphasizing caution in forgoing adjudication but acknowledging cases unfit for judicial resolution. She highlighted the possibility of statutes raising nonjusticiable issues, such as providing financial relief for impeachment offenses. Justice Sotomayor disagreed with the majority's finding that the case did not present an issue lacking judicial standards. She explained that the evidence must provide a court a basis to adjudicate meaningfully the issue. If the parties' evidence is inapposite or unilluminating, rendering judicial decision guesswork, then the case relies on ordinary kinds of evidence. The majority opinion in Zivotofsky limited the scope of cases posing a political question, but the doctrine's remaining contours are unclear. Lower federal courts have dismissed cases involving foreign affairs statutes on political question grounds, but Zivotofsky suggests less room for this in the future. Commentators disagree on interpreting the Court's opinion, leaving the first two Baker factors intact for lower courts to apply. The Court's opinion in Zivotofsky narrowed the scope of cases considered political questions, emphasizing the need to first determine the constitutionality of a statute before addressing political issues. This approach may lead to more statutory claims being adjudicated on their merits rather than dismissed as political questions. The Court's opinion in Zivotofsky emphasized the duty of courts to interpret ambiguous statutes and determine their constitutionality. It clarified that cases involving statutory interpretation may not necessarily pose political questions, focusing on examining the constitutionality of the statute in question. The majority in Zivotofsky emphasized the duty of courts to interpret ambiguous statutes and determine their constitutionality. It did not expressly hold that the political question doctrine is always inapplicable to cases involving statutes. The majority's approach suggested that some cases involving statutory interpretation could still pose a political question. The Court did not fully explain why its interpretative approach was the proper one, leaving room for lower courts to interpret cases involving statutory interpretation in a manner that avoids the political question doctrine. The majority in Zivotofsky emphasized the duty of courts to interpret ambiguous statutes and determine their constitutionality. Some cases involving statutory interpretation could still pose a political question, such as when a statute lacks meaningful standards. Tort claims against the federal government may also pose a political question if they involve reviewing military discretionary decisions. A broad reading of Zivotofsky could limit judicial consideration of the political question doctrine and Baker's second factor. The Court rejected the argument that the claim lacked judicially manageable standards. The majority in Zivotofsky emphasized the difficulty of adjudicating the constitutionality of a statute due to a lack of judicially manageable standards. Despite concerns about determining the political status of Jerusalem, the Court argued that courts are equipped to carefully examine textual, structural, and historical evidence. The Court did not explicitly address reliance on prudential factors or Justice Sotomayor's concurrence advocating for their consideration. Justice Sotomayor argued for the importance of prudential factors in the Zivotofsky case, pointing out that evidence similar to that in Nixon was available. She emphasized that the key question for the Court was whether the evidence provided a basis for meaningful adjudication. The majority did not address Sotomayor's concurrence, leaving open the possibility that the political question doctrine's prudential factors may still be relevant. The political question doctrine's prudential factors may have survived, impacting the separation of powers between Congress and the executive branch. Judicial minimalism in cases without disagreement between branches may not have significant consequences, but finding a political question in cases where the executive branch's obligation to a statute is at issue can affect the separation of powers. Some argue that judicial reluctance to enforce a statute leaves constitutional questions to be resolved by political branches rather than the courts. The political question doctrine may impact the separation of powers between Congress and the executive branch. Some argue that judicial reluctance to enforce a statute leaves constitutional questions to be resolved by political branches rather than the courts. The practice of allowing political branches to determine separations of powers disputes may restrict lower courts' discretion in the future, potentially leading to more judicial resolution of such disputes and affirming the judiciary's role in interpreting the law."
