    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Leave Ethanol Volumes at Existing Levels Act\" or the \"LEVEL Act.\" It repeals the expansion of the renewable fuel program. The Clean Air Act is amended to define \"cellulosic biomass ethanol\" as ethanol derived from renewable sources like energy crops, wood, plants, grasses, agricultural residues, fibers, animal wastes, and municipal solid waste. The term 'renewable fuel' refers to motor vehicle fuel derived from animal wastes, other waste materials, or municipal solid waste, with ethanol produced in facilities displacing 90% or more of fossil fuels normally used. The term 'renewable fuel' refers to motor vehicle fuel derived from various organic materials, including grains, oils, natural gas from biogas sources, and other biomass, used to replace or reduce fossil fuels. The term 'renewable fuel' includes cellulosic biomass ethanol, waste-derived ethanol, biodiesel, and blending components derived from renewable fuel. The Clean Air Act is amended to define a small refinery as one with a crude oil throughput not exceeding 75,000 barrels per day. Additionally, regulations and applicable volumes of renewable fuel under the renewable fuel program are modified. The Clean Air Act is amended to update the applicable percentages for renewable fuel, specifying a volume of 7,500,000,000 gallons for each calendar year. This includes changes to the types of fuel considered and the timeframe for compliance. The Clean Air Act is amended to update renewable fuel percentages, with cellulosic biomass ethanol or waste-derived ethanol now equivalent to 2.5 gallons of renewable fuel. Amendments also include changes to the credit program and waivers. Amendments to the Clean Air Act include changes to renewable fuel percentages, such as removing subparagraphs for cellulosic biofuel and biomass-based diesel. Additionally, paragraphs related to periodic reviews, savings clause, and regulations are also amended. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 is amended by repealing sections related to environmental impacts, effective dates, savings provisions, and transition rules. The amendments will take effect on January 1 of the first calendar year following the enactment of the Act. Prior to this date, estimates for the first calendar year will be provided by the Administrator of the Energy Information Administration to the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. The Environmental Protection Agency will estimate the volumes of gasoline projected to be sold in the United States for a calendar year under the Clean Air Act. Based on this estimate, the Administrator will determine and publish the renewable fuel obligation for that year in the Federal Register. SEC. 3. PROHIBITION OF AUTHORIZATION OF HIGHER ETHANOL BLENDS. Prohibition of introducing gasoline with more than 10-volume-percent ethanol for general use in conventional vehicles without proper registration and lawful sale in the US. Repeal of existing waivers. Repeal of waivers allowing gasoline with over 10-volume-percent ethanol for general use in vehicles. The Administrator granted a waiver to increase the allowable ethanol content of gasoline to 15 percent, as published in the Federal Register. This waiver does not apply to gasoline described in specific conditions before the enactment of the Act. The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency will conduct a study on the effects of introducing an ethanol-gasoline blend on consumer products, including vehicles and engines, within 2 years of the Act's enactment. The study will assess the impact of an ethanol-gasoline blend on engine performance, emissions, materials compatibility, and consumer safety. It will also evaluate the infrastructure for distributing the blend. The study will evaluate the impact of an ethanol-gasoline blend on engine performance, emissions, materials compatibility, and consumer safety, as well as the infrastructure for distributing the blend. It will focus on storage configurations, retail equipment certification, and preventing misfueling by consumers."
