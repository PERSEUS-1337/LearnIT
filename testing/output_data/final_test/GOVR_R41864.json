    "content": "After the financial crisis, Congress passed the Dodd-Frank Act to reform financial sector regulation. The 112th Congress is overseeing its implementation, including provisions on corporate governance. Studies have shown that corporate governance failures contributed to the crisis. Directors on public corporation boards have a fiduciary responsibility to shareholders. The board of directors is responsible for overseeing the corporation's best interests and shareholders. They oversee management, approve executive compensation, provide strategic direction, and approve annual business plans. State laws mandate that management is under the board's direction, and shareholders have voting rights for key decisions like electing directors and approving mergers. The board of directors oversees corporate governance matters, including shareholders' right to vote on major transactions and elect directors. Shareholders can appoint proxies to vote on their behalf at meetings, as most do not attend in person. The SEC has the authority to make rules related to proxy voting under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The SEC has broad authority to govern proxies and proxy solicitations under Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act. Proxy materials are used to inform shareholders and solicit votes for corporate decisions. Board-selected director nominees are voted on at annual meetings using proxy materials. The SEC has authority to regulate proxy solicitations under the Exchange Act. Proxy materials are crucial for informing shareholders and securing votes for corporate decisions. Shareholders can use proxy ballots to vote in absentia at annual meetings. The SEC's power over proxy solicitation evolved significantly under the Exchange Act, starting in 1935. The SEC has authority to regulate proxy solicitations under the Exchange Act, allowing shareholders to express their views through shareholder proposals governed by Rule 14a\u20138. This rule gives shareholders the opportunity to place proposals in a company's proxy materials for voting at meetings, with certain procedural and substantive requirements to be met. One substantive basis for excluding a proposal is Rule 14a\u20138(i)(8) under Regulation 14. The SEC's Rule 14a\u20138(i)(8) allows for the exclusion of shareholder proposals related to director elections, known as the \"election exclusion.\" Shareholders wanting to propose alternative board nominees outside of proxy materials must cover distribution costs, which can be a significant obstacle due to the high expenses involved in waging a proxy fight. In May 2009, the SEC proposed two rules on proxy access, with one allowing shareholders with 1%, 3%, or 5% of a company's stock to nominate up to 25% of board seats. This was the third time in seven years the SEC addressed shareholder proxy access. The proposed Rule 14a-11 was controversial, sparking debate on corporate governance. The SEC proposed Rule 14a-11 for proxy access, sparking debate among pension fund groups and the business community. The rule aimed to make boards more accountable to shareholder interests, but concerns were raised about potential divisiveness and parochial agendas. On August 25, 2010, the SEC adopted modified versions of the proposals, providing proxy access to large investors meeting ownership requirements. Companies would be required to include nominees of large shareholders in their proxy materials who have continuously owned at least 3% of the company for the previous three years. Shareholders can nominate one nominee or a number representing up to 25% of the board. The Business Roundtable and the Chamber filed a petition against the SEC rule for proxy access, claiming it was arbitrary and capricious. The SEC decided to discontinue the rule pending the court's ruling. The SEC's proxy access rule was vacated by the court in Business Roundtable and Chamber of Commerce v. Securities and Exchange Commission. SEC officials decided not to appeal the decision but a part of the rule allowing shareholders to submit proposals for shareholder access regimes would still go into effect. The SEC's proxy access rule, adopted in 2010, faced opposition from Congress and was impacted by a court case, resulting in the SEC tabling a key part of the rule. The rule allowed investors to nominate board members and make proposals related to contested director elections. The SEC's proxy access rule, adopted in 2010, faced opposition from Congress and was impacted by a court case, resulting in the SEC tabling a key part of the rule. The rule allowed investors to nominate board members and make proposals related to contested director elections. Key provisions of the amendment include requirements for shareholders to nominate director candidates meeting certain conditions and owning at least 3% of the company's voting securities for at least three years. The SEC's proxy access rule, adopted in 2010, allows shareholders to nominate board members under certain conditions. Shareholders must own at least 3% of the company's voting securities for three years. The rule also stipulates that a company must include shareholder nominees representing no more than 25% of the board in its proxy materials. Shareholders with the highest percentage of voting securities are prioritized for inclusion. Shareholders must file a new disclosure document (Schedule 14N) with the SEC and the company, disclosing ownership details and intentions. The SEC's proxy access rule, adopted in 2010, allows shareholders to nominate board members under certain conditions. Shareholders must own at least 3% of the company's voting securities for three years. The rule also stipulates that a company must include shareholder nominees representing no more than 25% of the board in its proxy materials. Nominating shareholders would be required to submit their candidates or proposals no later than 120 days before the anniversary date on which the company mailed its proxy statement the year before. Small companies with a public float of less than $75 million in equity would be exempt from the rule for the initial three years after its effective date for larger companies. The SEC's proxy access rulemaking also included an amendment to Rule 14a-8(i)(8), allowing shareholders to propose procedures for the inclusion of shareholder director nominees in company governing documents. The SEC's proxy access rule, adopted in 2010, allows shareholders to nominate board members under certain conditions. Shareholders must own at least 3% of the company's voting securities for three years. The rule also stipulates that a company must include shareholder nominees representing no more than 25% of the board in its proxy materials. Shareholders could seek approval for more permissive corporate bylaws, but a company could not opt out of the proxy access standards. Rule 14a-11's terms would supersede any conflicting state law, foreign law, or company bylaws. The SEC's Rule 14a-11 sets ownership thresholds for shareholders to nominate directors, with a minimum ownership level of 2%. The SEC believes the rule will benefit shareholders by improving corporate suffrage and communication between shareholders. The SEC also amended Rule 14a-8 to complement Rule 14a-11 and facilitate shareholders' ability to nominate directors. The SEC revised Rule 14a-8 to allow shareholders to propose procedures for including nominee directors in proxy materials. SEC chairwoman Mary Schapiro highlighted the challenges and benefits of the rulemaking process, emphasizing the balance of competing interests in the final rules. The SEC's proxy access amendments reflect compromise and balance in weighing competing interests. The rules aim to enhance investor confidence in corporate governance integrity. The SEC will closely monitor the implementation of these new rules, especially for smaller companies, and make prompt changes if necessary. The amendments were set to become effective on November 15, 2010, except for small companies under Rule 14a-11. The SEC's proxy access rules, effective from November 15, 2010, aim to enhance shareholders' ability to nominate directors and reduce costs associated with traditional proxy contests. Shareholders can save on printing costs by utilizing Rule 14a-11 for director nominations instead of engaging in proxy fights. The SEC's proxy access rules, effective from November 15, 2010, aim to enhance shareholders' ability to nominate directors and reduce costs associated with traditional proxy contests. Shareholders can save on printing costs by utilizing Rule 14a-11 for director nominations instead of engaging in proxy fights. The key cost savings for nominating shareholders include reduced printing and postage costs, decreased expenditures for advertising and promotion of nominees, and mitigation of the collective action/free rider problem. The SEC's proxy access rules, effective from November 15, 2010, aim to enhance shareholders' ability to nominate directors and reduce costs associated with traditional proxy contests. The unequal cost sharing in traditional proxy contests may discourage single shareholders from incurring the costs, leading to missed opportunities for qualified director candidates. The SEC argues that replacing traditional proxy fights with nominations through proxy access can help mitigate these concerns. The SEC's proxy access rules, effective from November 15, 2010, aim to enhance shareholders' ability to nominate directors and reduce costs associated with traditional proxy contests. Title IX, Section 971 of the Dodd-Frank Act affirms the SEC's authority to adopt proxy access rules, emphasizing the shift from short-term profits to long-term growth and stability. H.R. 3817 in the 111th Congress contained provisions that confirmed the SEC's right to adopt proxy access. During the House Financial Service Committee's markup of H.R. 3817, the vote on the proxy access amendment split along partisan lines with the majority party in support and the minority party opposed. Some opponents, including Representatives Bachus and Garrett, criticized the provision, arguing it would divert the SEC from its investor protection mission. The SEC's proxy access reform initiative is criticized for diverting from its investor protection mission. States like Delaware and North Dakota are already enhancing shareholder rights through legislation. The amendment is seen as undermining years of effective corporate governance. Labor unions and pension fund groups support the proxy access reform. Labor unions and pension fund groups, including AFL-CIO and Council of Institutional Investors, support proxy access reform as a way to empower long-term investors and improve managerial performance. The SEC proxy access Rule 14-a11 allows certain shareholders with a large, long-term stake in the corporation to include director nominees in the company's proxy materials. Proxy access enhances communication between management and investors, improves management performance, and can increase financial returns. Labor unions and pension fund groups support proxy access reform to empower long-term investors and improve managerial performance. CalSTRS CEO praised the SEC ruling, emphasizing the need for governance accountability to protect members' financial security. Concerns were raised about hedge funds benefiting from proxy access, but some believe it will primarily advantage long-term institutional shareholders like pension funds. The SEC ruling on proxy access is seen to benefit long-term institutional shareholders, such as pension funds, by allowing them to nominate board candidates. Hedge funds and activist investors may not meet the ownership threshold and passive investment test. Concerns about larger shareholders dominating board nominations are considered exaggerated. The SEC's proxy access rule allows long-term institutional shareholders to nominate board candidates, benefiting pension funds. The rule encourages companies to engage with shareholders and could improve shareholder returns. Corporate governance experts support the rule, citing empirical evidence that reducing director insulation boosts shareholder value. Corporate managements have historically opposed proxy access. The SEC adopted a proxy access rule allowing shareholders with more than 3% of shares for over three years to nominate board candidates. This rule is seen as a modest step with substantial limits on its use. Corporate governance experts support the rule, citing evidence that reducing director insulation boosts shareholder value. The authors found that entrenching provisions in corporate charters, such as staggered boards and supermajority board vote requirements, led to lower firm valuation. Proxy access is seen as a solution to managerial entrenchment. A study of 760 independent board directors showed that providing advice to CEOs and engaging with colleagues increased the likelihood of reappointment. Monitoring levels were also linked to reappointment chances. The study found that minimal monitoring of company management increased the likelihood of board reappointment. Proxy access could provide shareholders with a counterweight to CEO-dominated boards. Maintaining the current system where states decide on proxy access rules individually could lead to inconsistent standards across companies and states. Several developed nations, such as the UK, the Netherlands, and Australia, have adopted proxy access to promote independent boards responsive to market sentiment. The SEC's proxy access rulemaking faced criticism, particularly from dissenting Republican commissioners Casey and Paredes, who disagreed with the adopted rules. This has sparked various critical responses, especially from entities associated with the business community. The SEC's proxy access rule faced criticism from dissenting Republican commissioners Casey and Paredes, who believed the rules were flawed and driven by political pressures. They were concerned that the rules would burden SEC staff and give proxy access rights to larger institutional investors, not representing all shareholders. Commissioner Paredes supported an amended rule but strongly opposed Rule 14a-11. Commissioner Paredes strongly opposed the SEC's adoption of Rule 14a-11, arguing that it imposes a minimum right of proxy access even when shareholders may prefer a more limited or no access. He criticized the rule for displacing existing state corporate governance laws and limiting shareholders' ability to shape their preferred proxy access regime through Rule 14a-8. Paredes also criticized the \"one-size-fits-all\" approach to corporate governance imposed by the rule. Commissioner Paredes and industry experts criticized the SEC's proxy access rule, arguing that it imposes a universal governance scheme on all firms without considering individual circumstances. They raised concerns about the rule's impact on different governance structures and predicted frequent use of the rule once implemented, despite potential litigation to clarify certain rules. Steven Shapiro of Taylor Capital Growth and others raised concerns that proxy access reform could disproportionately affect small companies. They argued that smaller companies may struggle to meet the 3% threshold and three-year holding period, and may face challenges in expending resources to fend off shareholder nominees. Mr. Hamot noted that the 3% hurdle is high for large companies due to liquidity issues, while smaller companies tend to have more long-term investors. Shapiro emphasized that small companies are more likely to be impacted by the reform. Mr. Shapiro raised concerns that small companies may struggle with proxy access reform, as they are more likely to be affected by the rules compared to larger companies. He highlighted potential challenges for smaller companies in meeting the 3% ownership threshold and the three-year holding period, as well as the resources needed to respond to shareholder nominees. Additionally, he warned about the impact on board collegiality and the potential unfair challenges faced by dissident shareholder nominated directors. Charles Elson, director of the John L. Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware, raised concerns about the SEC's 3% ownership threshold limiting small investors' ability to nominate board candidates, questioning if this abrogated smaller investors' rights. He also questioned the potential loss of qualified directors if the best ones decided to leave the board due to proxy access reforms. Professor Elson raised concerns about the potential cost savings for investors under the SEC proxy access rules, highlighting that legal costs may offset printing cost savings. The state of Delaware supported the Chamber and Roundtable's lawsuit, arguing that its corporate laws already allow for various proxy access models, making the SEC's Rule 14a-11 contradictory to shareholder rights. The amendment allows corporations to establish proxy access rights for stockholders, giving them more control over the election process for directors. This flexibility aligns with Delaware corporate law principles and contradicts SEC Rule 14a-11. The Investment Company Institute and Independent Directors Council criticized the SEC's rulemaking in support of the Chamber's lawsuit. The SEC's \"one size fits all\" proxy reform was criticized by fund directors for not considering the unique structure of mutual funds. A study by Marcel Kahan and Edward Rock found that the shareholder benefit of proxy access may be overstated, with only a limited number of shareholder nominees likely to result from the rules. The SEC's proxy access reform was criticized for potential undesirable effects on company expenses and shareholder leverage. Critics argued that the overall impact would likely be minimal, with some modest governance changes and little effect on company value. General criticisms of proxy access, including concerns about enabling select large shareholders with specific agendas, were raised by critics such as the Chamber and the Roundtable. The SEC's proxy access reform has faced criticism for potentially allowing large shareholders to use proxy access as a bargaining tool to push for parochial interests. Joseph Grundfest highlighted concerns about proxy access being valued for reasons unrelated to electing directors, such as drawing attention to union and pension fund causes. These \"megaphone externalities\" could be valuable to shareholder proponents, even if they go against the majority's interests. Proxy access advocates are heavily invested in ensuring the SEC's rules make it easy to qualify for the ballot, even if their candidate may not win. They fear that shareholder majority would set stricter qualifications if given the chance, limiting their influence. To maximize their impact, they push for an anti-democratic Mandatory Minimum Access Regime to override shareholder will. Proxy access advocates are concerned about the Access Regime designed to override shareholder will. Arguments against proxy access include doubts about its effectiveness in improving risk management and averting financial crises at firms. Directors have the authority to manage a corporation's affairs and fiduciary duties to fulfill their responsibilities. Proxy access advocates are concerned about mandating shareholder access to the corporation's proxy statement to nominate directors, as it could interfere with the board's authority over the management of the corporation. Outside shareholders may not be well positioned to choose appropriate board candidates due to asymmetric information. A study during the 2008 financial crisis found that CEO turnover rates exceeded normal rates among \"at risk\" financial firms, indicating well-functioning corporate governance systems. Corporate shareholders aim for financial gain from their securities holdings. An event study assesses the impact of events like corporate mergers on share valuation by adjusting for abnormal returns. Studies on proxy access reform's impact on share values found that proposals to facilitate director nominations by shareholders increased the likelihood of eligible shareholders nominating directors. The impact of proxy access reform on shareholder wealth was studied, showing that increasing shareholder rights by allowing director nominations could decrease firm valuation. Events related to adopting proxy access were found to devalue shares of firms with large investors, suggesting that such reforms may benefit large investors at the expense of other shareholders. The studies found that proxy access reform may reduce corporate and shareholder value. Criticisms include questions about the significance of events examined, limited duration of share behavior studied, reliance on rationality of securities markets, and potential influence of market noise on results. A recent study analyzed the market response to SEC's announcement of delaying proxy access rules adoption, showing varying impacts based on institutional investor shareholdings. The study on proxy access rules found that firms with higher institutional investor shareholdings experienced a drop in value, suggesting a positive market view. This is the first empirical study to link proxy access with shareholder value. However, the study only analyzed one day of data and did not consider longer-term share behavior. It also assumes efficient market assessment of events, which is a subject of academic debate. The study on proxy access rules found that firms in Delaware had a lower positive effect on share value compared to firms elsewhere, attributed to Delaware's proxy access enabling laws. Two major business groups, the Chamber and Roundtable, filed suit against the SEC questioning the legality of Rule 14a-11. The Chamber and Roundtable filed a lawsuit against the SEC challenging the legality of Rule 14a-11, claiming it violated various acts and constitutional rights. They also requested a stay on the final rulemaking related to proxy access pending court resolution. On October 4, 2010, the SEC, Chamber, and Roundtable agreed to seek expedited judicial review and stay Rule 14a-11 and related amendment to Rule 14a-8 to avoid unnecessary costs and disruption. The appeals court unanimously vacated Rule 14a-11 on July 22, 2011, citing the SEC's failure to analyze the economic impact and acting arbitrarily. The opinion by Judge Douglas Ginsburg criticized the SEC for acting arbitrarily and failing to assess the economic effects of a new rule. The court vacated Rule 14a-11, part of the SEC's August 2010 proxy access rulemaking, leading to mixed reactions from business interests and investor advocacy groups. Some Republican leaders praised the ruling, while investor advocacy groups criticized it and urged the SEC to appeal, which the agency declined. Plaintiffs, the United States Chamber of Commerce, and the Business Roundtable welcomed the decision, stating it prevents special interest politics in the boardroom. They emphasized the importance of job creation and economic revival, urging regulators to prove the benefits of regulations outweigh the costs. Three Republican leaders also supported the ruling in a letter to the SEC. Three Republican leaders, including Representative Scott Garrett, expressed support for the court ruling to the SEC, questioning the agency's pursuit of proxy access and its rulemaking authority under the Dodd-Frank Act. They criticized the agency for defending a rule that they believe was politically motivated and lacked sound corporate governance principles. The members informed SEC officials about the unanimous court decision, urging caution in concluding that a rule would benefit the economy. They requested information on resources spent on the proxy access rulemaking, including staff hours, money, and funds used for litigation. The Council of Institutional Investors urged the SEC to appeal the court's ruling, arguing that cost-benefit determinations should be left to agencies like the SEC. The panel's decision on the costs and benefits of a policy should be left to agencies like the SEC, not the courts. Cost-benefit analyses are best handled by agency expertise, and the SEC decided not to appeal the court's ruling on Rule 14a-11. The SEC will implement Rule 14a-8 allowing shareholders to propose proxy access procedures. SEC Chairman Schapiro supports shareholder nomination rights for board directors to enhance accountability. The SEC will implement Rule 14a-8 allowing shareholders to propose proxy access procedures. SEC Chairman Schapiro supports shareholder nomination rights for board directors to enhance accountability. The staff will review the Court's objections and comments from interested parties to determine the best path forward."
