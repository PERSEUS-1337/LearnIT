    "content": "The farm bill activities are compared based on federal spending allocation, with Congressional Budget Office estimates being the official measures. Recent farm bills have faced different budget situations, such as spending more under a surplus, cutting spending for deficit reduction, or remaining budget neutral. For example, the 2002 farm bill increased spending by $73 billion over 10 years, with over half for farm commodity programs. The 2008 farm bill was budget neutral but included $10 billion. The 2008 Energy Act and 2014 Agricultural Act were budget neutral with offsets for increased spending on specific titles. The 2018 Agriculture Improvement Act aimed to maintain a budget-neutral position over 10 years, reallocating funds across programs and titles. Farm bills authorize spending in mandatory and discretionary categories, with larger programs assumed to be included. The farm bill authorizes spending in mandatory and discretionary categories. Larger programs are assumed to continue beyond the bill's end, with funding sources varying for different programs. Mandatory programs like SNAP and crop insurance have their own funding sources, while most other mandatory outlays are paid through the USDA's Commodity Credit Corporation. Discretionary spending is authorized throughout the bill for programs like rural development, credit, and research. The farm bill authorizes funding for both mandatory and discretionary programs. Mandatory programs, such as SNAP and crop insurance, have their own funding sources, while discretionary funds are allocated for programs like rural development and research. The majority of the report focuses on mandatory spending, with figures illustrating the distribution of projected mandatory outlays for the 2018 farm bill. The farm bill authorizes funding for both mandatory and discretionary programs. Mandatory spending is authorized throughout the farm bill, with four titles accounting for the majority of spending: Commodities, Nutrition, Crop Insurance, and Conservation. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) baseline is a projection of future federal spending on mandatory programs under current law, serving as a benchmark for proposed changes. The score measures the cost impact of new bills on mandatory spending relative to the baseline. The baseline in the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projects future government spending on mandatory programs under current law. Programs increasing spending have a positive score, while those decreasing have a negative score. Once a new law is passed, projected outlays equal the baseline plus the score, forming the budget foundation. The baseline assumes programs with estimated mandatory spending in the last year continue as if there were no policy change. The baseline in the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projects future government spending on mandatory programs under current law. Some programs may not continue in the baseline beyond the end of a farm bill due to various reasons such as spending thresholds or decisions made by Budget Committees. The 2014 farm bill had 39 programs without baseline beyond FY2018, receiving $2.824 billion in mandatory funding over five years. The CBO baseline for the 2018 farm bill projected $426 billion in costs over the next five years, with 77% allocated to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). The remaining 23% was for agricultural programs such as crop insurance and conservation. The CBO score measures the budget impact of changes made by the 2018 farm bill. The CBO score measures the budgetary impact of changes made by the 2018 farm bill relative to its benchmark\u2014the CBO baseline. Budget enforcement procedures, such as \"PayGo,\" require budgetary offsets to balance new spending and avoid increasing the federal deficit. The farm bill is a five-year authorization, but budget rules require it to be scored over a 10-year budget window. Discussions about the farm bill may focus on its effect over the 10-year budget window rather than the five-year duration of the law. Statements about the total cost of the farm bill may be in terms of its five-year outlays or projected spending over the five-year life of the bill. CBO released several interim scores of the 2018 farm bill. The CBO released interim scores of the 2018 farm bill at different stages of development, including scores for House-introduced bill (H.R. 2), Senate-reported bill (S. 3042), House-passed bill (H.R. 2), and Senate-passed Amendment to H.R. 2. A detailed assessment of farm commodity program payment limit provisions in the House-passed bill was also provided. Figure 3 illustrates the distribution of title-level changes in the 2018 farm bill conference. The 2018 farm bill conference agreement, House- and Senate-passed bills had relatively small or budget-neutral net scores over a 10-year period. The enacted farm bill closely follows the scoring approach of the Senate bill, with most reductions in the Rural Development title. Six titles in the law saw increased outlays, while the House-passed bill aimed to make reductions in Conservation. The House-passed bill aimed to make reductions in Conservation, Nutrition, Energy, and Crop Insurance titles, which the conference agreement did not adopt. The 2018 farm bill shows a similar pattern of changes in projected outlays over five- and 10-year budget windows. The enacted farm bill increases net outlays in the first five years by $1.8 billion, offset by the same amount of reductions in the second five years, resulting in a budget-neutral 10-year net score. Conservation and Nutrition titles have increases in outlays over the first five years but decreases in the second five years, making both titles budget-neutral over the 10-year period. The House-passed bill aimed to make reductions in Conservation, Nutrition, Energy, and Crop Insurance titles, which the conference agreement did not adopt. Both the House-passed bill and the Senate-passed bill showed increases in the Conservation and Nutrition titles in the first five years followed by decreases in the second five years. The budget effects may reflect policy proposals that may not be retained in the final conference agreement. The budget effects of the enacted law, House-passed bill, and Senate-passed bill on the Conservation and Nutrition titles varied, with reductions and increases in spending over 10 years. The Conservation title in the enacted law had a $12.4 billion reduction and $12.4 billion in increased spending, while the Nutrition title in the House-passed bill had a $22.0 billion reduction and $20.6 billion in increased spending. The Senate-passed bill had smaller section-by-section scores compared to the House bill. The Senate-passed bill showed changes in funding for various titles, including Conservation, Nutrition, Commodities, and Miscellaneous. The 2018 farm bill provided continuing funding for 23 programs without baseline from the 2014 farm bill, with some receiving permanent baseline. Some programs received mandatory funding only until the end of the farm bill, while others received permanent baseline. New programs without baseline were also created in the 2018 farm bill. The 2018 farm bill introduced new programs without a baseline, with projected costs at enactment equaling the baseline plus the score. This serves as the foundation of the new law and can be compared to future CBO baselines to track actual costs. The $428 billion projected five-year total for the 2018 farm bill includes 76% for SNAP and 24% for agricultural programs, mainly in crop insurance. The 2018 farm bill projected outlays for agricultural programs, with the majority allocated to crop insurance, farm commodity programs, and conservation. Mandatory spending for key titles like Nutrition, Crop Insurance, Farm Commodity Programs, and Conservation make up 99% of the projected spending. Trends show SNAP outlays increased post-recession but have been decreasing since 2012, while crop insurance outlays have steadily risen. Farm commodity programs outlays fluctuate with commodity markets. The farm bill outlays have generally trended lower under the direct payment program and increased after a return to counter-cyclical programs in the 2014 farm bill. Conservation program outlays have grown steadily but leveled off in recent years. The bill also includes discretionary authorizations for future appropriations, subject to budget enforcement. The CBO scores of the House- and Senate-passed farm bills estimated the cost of implementing provisions with authorizations of appropriations. The House version was projected at $24.5 billion over five years, while the Senate version was slightly lower at $23.7 billion. These projections were for the entire bill, not broken down by title. The CBO estimated the cost of implementing provisions in the House and Senate-passed farm bills. Three titles make up 85% of discretionary authorizations: Trade, Research, and Rural Development. The 2018 farm bill authorizes between $2 billion and $6 billion for appropriation, similar to the 2014 bill. Actual funding in recent Agricultural appropriations exceeds $20 billion. The recent Agricultural appropriations acts have funding totaling over $20 billion, with differences in authorization between the farm bill and appropriations acts. Some funding in the Agriculture appropriations act is not necessarily reauthorized in the farm bill, including expenses for USDA agencies and programs like the Special Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program for Women, Infants, and Children."
