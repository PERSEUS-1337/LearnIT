    "content": "The Federal Prison Industries (FPI) operates 78 factories in 62 federal prisons across five business segments. It functions as a revolving fund, generating revenue from sales to federal departments. The Department of Defense (DOD) was the FPI's largest customer, accounting for 51-68% of sales between FY1993 and FY2013. Between FY1993 and FY2013, the Department of Defense (DOD) accounted for 51-68% of the Federal Prison Industries (FPI) sales to government agencies. The FPI sold products and services in 160 different product and service codes, with seven core products making up 62% of sales on average. Sales of the FPI's core products ranged from 50% to 73% of total sales between FY1993 and FY2006. Federal agencies are required to procure products from the FPI under the mandatory source clause, but the preference for services is not as strong. The controversy lies in the impact of this requirement on private businesses, with Congress scrutinizing the issue in the 1990s. Congress has increased interest in the Federal Prison Industries' (FPI) mandatory source clause due to concerns about monopolizing the federal market and taking jobs from citizens. Changes have been made since 2001, including requiring the Department of Defense to use competitive procedures if the FPI's products are not comparable in price, quality, and delivery time to private sector products. The FY2004 Omnibus and FY2005 Consolidated Appropriations Act require federal agencies to use competitive procedures for procurement if FPI's products are not comparable to private sector products. The FY2008 NDAA mandates DOD to compete any product where FPI's market share exceeds 5%. If FPI's market share is less than 5%, DOD must follow procurement procedures outlined in 10 U.S.C. \u00a72410n. This report analyzes FPI's sales pre and post Congressional changes. The report focuses on the FPI's sales before and after Congress made changes to the mandatory source clause. It analyzes sales to civilian agencies before FY2004 and after, when competitive procurement from FPI was required. For DOD sales, it looks at periods before changes, when competitive procurement was required, and when contracts had to be competed if FPI had over 5% market share. The FPI is a self-sustaining government-owned corporation. The FPI, a self-sustaining government-owned corporation, relies on generating revenue through sales to provide work opportunities for federal inmates. Data shows a significant decrease in both nominal and inflation-adjusted sales since FY2009, with FY2013 nominal sales at $533 million, $352 million below the peak in FY2009. Adjusting for inflation, FY2013 sales were the lowest in the period examined. Sales in FY2013 were the lowest in the period examined, with a significant decrease since FY2009. The FPI's nominal sales were volatile, increasing from FY1993 to FY2009 but decreasing thereafter. The FPI reported losses from FY2008 to FY2013, with a $36 million loss in FY2009. The FPI reported a $36 million loss in FY2009 despite nominal sales peaking at $885 million. Efforts to address losses include pursuing new customers, cost reductions, and revenue opportunities. Sales to DOD fluctuated between FY2002 and FY2007, with a general upward trend overall. The FPI's sales to DOD showed a general upward trend from FY1993 to FY2007, despite some fluctuations and increased competition. Sales to DOD increased by 115% during this period. However, in FY2013, sales to DOD were at their lowest level since FY1998. Sales to civilian agencies remained relatively flat after FY2004, with a slight increase between FY2007 and FY2009. The FPI's sales to civilian agencies increased significantly from FY1993 to FY2009, peaking in FY2009 at $199.1 million. However, sales decreased sharply after FY2009, dropping by 73.4% to $52.9 million by FY2013. This decline was partly due to a decrease in customer vehicle reimbursement sales. The FPI's sales to civilian agencies increased significantly from FY1993 to FY2009, peaking at $199.1 million in FY2009. However, sales sharply declined by 73.4% to $52.9 million by FY2013, partly due to a decrease in customer vehicle reimbursement sales. Civilian agencies were required to use competitive procedures for procuring products from the FPI if its products did not meet their need in terms of price, quality, and timeliness. Sales to DOD started to decline in FY2008, coinciding with the implementation of section 827 of the FY2008 NDAA, which imposed unique procurement requirements on DOD. Competition for select products under section 827 did not uniformly affect the FPI's market share in DOD. The FPI's market share in DOD for selected products did not uniformly change with competition. Market share declined for cable, cord, and wire assemblies, draperies, awnings, and shades, and office furniture before competition. Surprisingly, market share grew for draperies, awnings, and shades during competition. Special purpose clothing's market share remained consistent until competition, where it slightly decreased but significantly increased after being removed from the list. The Federal Prison Industries (FPI) experienced varying market share changes with competition. Market share declined for certain products before competition, but surprisingly grew for others during competition. For two products, competition interrupted a rebound in market share. Questions arise on how FPI recovered after losing market share, and whether it could compete with private businesses for contracts. The Federal Prison Industries (FPI) experienced market share changes due to competition, with declining sales to DOD in core and non-core products and services post-FY2009. FPI officials attribute recent financial difficulties to decreased sales in key product lines. The FPI's sales to DOD fluctuated between FY2002 and FY2009, with a notable decrease in core product sales from FY2004 to FY2006. However, losses were offset by increasing sales of non-core products and services. Core product sales partially recovered by FY2009 but never reached the level of FY2004. The FPI's sales to civilian agencies fluctuated between FY2003 and FY2009, with a notable decline in non-core product sales from FY2003 to FY2004. The decrease in FY2004 was a regression towards the mean after an uncharacteristic increase in sales from FY2001 to FY2003. The decline in sales after FY2009 was mainly due to decreasing customer vehicle reimbursement sales. Sales of core and non-core products to civilian agencies declined after FY2009, with a significant drop in customer vehicle reimbursement sales. The Federal Prison Industries (FPI) has captured a small share of both DOD's and civilian agencies' markets since FY1993, never exceeding 5% of DOD's market and averaging around 5% of civilian agencies' market. Since FY1993, the Federal Prison Industries (FPI) has seen a decline in market share for core products with both DOD and civilian agencies. This trend continued even after modifications to the FPI's mandatory source clause. However, there has been a recent rebound in market share despite increased competition. The FPI's sales decline may also be attributed to reduced federal spending, with total federal purchases decreasing by 15% from FY2008 to FY2013. The Federal Prison Industries (FPI) experienced a decline in market share for core products with both DOD and civilian agencies since FY1993. Despite modifications to the mandatory source clause, there was a recent rebound in market share. The decrease in federal procurement between FY2008 and FY2013 was less than the sales decline experienced by the FPI. DOD's total procurement decreased by 23% during this period due to scaling back war efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan. Total federal spending might not accurately reflect the size of the FPI's market as it includes purchases in PSCs where the FPI did not sell any goods or services. Between FY2008 and FY2013, there was a significant decrease in DOD's purchases in PSCs where the FPI made a sale. The FPI's sales to DOD peaked in FY2007, while DOD's purchases peaked one year later. The FPI's sales to civilian agencies also decreased, despite an increase in the FPI's market share with DOD since FY2008. Sales to civilian agencies decreased 51% between FY2009 and FY2013, while civilian agencies' purchases only decreased 21% over the same period. Excluding customer vehicle reimbursement revenue, the FPI's sales to civilian agencies decreased by 25% during this time. The decline in total sales after FY2009 may be attributed to the federal government spending less on products offered by the FPI. After legislative changes to the FPI's mandatory source clause, sales to DOD and civilian agencies increased despite competition requirements. Sales of core products to DOD declined between FY2004 and FY2006 but partially rebounded. The FPI's federal market share decreased after changes to the mandatory source clause, continuing a pre-existing trend. The changes to the mandatory source clause had negative consequences for some of the FPI's product sales, potentially leading to a decline in revenue despite consistent market share. Increased competition may have impacted the FPI's ability to generate revenue, especially during a time of limited sales opportunities. The changes to the mandatory source clause had varying effects on the FPI's sales. Some contracting officers preferred the FPI's products, while others found them inferior. Giving agencies more discretion in purchasing from the FPI could impact sales. The FPI's declining sales, regardless of the reason, may be of interest to policymakers as it is a self-sustaining government corporation that relies on revenue generation to provide work opportunities for inmates. Private businesses unable to secure federal contracts can sell their products in the private market instead. The Federal Prison Industries (FPI) faces limitations on selling prisoner-made goods in the private market, unlike private businesses. The FPI can participate in the Prison Industry Enhancement Certification Program (PIECP) to manufacture goods for the commercial market, but these authorities have not significantly benefited the FPI's revenue. Congress also restricts the FPI's ability to produce new products for sale to federal agencies. The NDAA requires DOD to competitively procure products where FPI's market share exceeds 5%. DOD issued memoranda specifying PSCs to be competed, with subsequent updates. Products in these PSCs must be procured competitively until superseded. Figure 4 displays FPI's market share for selected products listed in the memoranda. The analysis focuses on DOD memoranda from 2009, selecting products for analysis under section 827 of the FY2008 NDAA. It examines trends in FPI's sales to DOD after competition. Sales fluctuate yearly, so a decrease may not indicate a long-term decline. Products on the competed list for multiple years offer insight into competition's impact on FPI's market share. However, a challenge is that competitive procurement dates do not align with fiscal years. The DOD had to use competitive procedures to procure certain products listed in memoranda from 2009. This made it difficult to assess the effect of competition on sales for FY2008 and FY2009. Focusing on products listed in consecutive memoranda can provide better insight into the impact of competition on FPI's market share."
