    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"ITIN Reform Act of 2012\" and includes requirements for the issuance of ITINs. The \"ITIN Reform Act of 2012\" amends Section 6109 of the Internal Revenue Code to include special rules for issuing individual taxpayer identification numbers (ITINs), requiring in-person application with specific documentation at an IRS taxpayer assistance center or submission for applicants residing outside the United States. The applicant submits the application in person to an employee of the Internal Revenue Service at a United States diplomatic mission or consular post, along with required documentation. Initial on-site verification of documentation is conducted by an IRS employee or designee. Required documentation includes specific items. The applicant must provide required documentation to prove identity and foreign status, with only original documents accepted. Exceptions include military spouses and nonresident aliens claiming treaty benefits. An individual taxpayer identification number issued is valid for a 3-year period, including the taxable year it is issued and the 2 following years. It remains valid for each subsequent 3-year period if a tax return is filed in the previous 3-year period. The individual taxpayer identification number remains valid for a 3-year period, including the year it is issued and the following 2 years. For existing ITINs issued before a specific date, the number will not be valid after the end of the 3-year period from the enactment date if no tax return is filed for the first taxable year after the enactment date. Section 6611 of the Internal Revenue Code is amended to include a special rule regarding Individual Taxpayer Identification Numbers (ITINs). No interest will be allowed on overpayments until 45 days after an ITIN is issued. Additionally, the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration will conduct audits of the IRS program for issuing ITINs every two years. The amendment made by subsection (a) applies to requests for individual taxpayer identification numbers made after the enactment of the Act. The amendment made by subsection (b) applies to returns, claims, and refunds after the enactment of the Act."
