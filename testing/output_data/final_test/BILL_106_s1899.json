    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Firefighter Investment and Response Enhancement (FIRE) Act\". Congress acknowledges the increased demands on firefighting personnel, the high fire death rate in the United States, and the significant number of fire-related injuries each year. On average, 11 people die and 2 of them are children due to fires daily in the US. The statistics show that 2 children under 5 years old are likely to be among the 68 people injured in fires, resulting in over $9 billion in property losses. This highlights the urgent need for federal investment in firefighting personnel. The Federal Emergency Management Agency is redesignated as the \"Federal Fire and Emergency Management Agency\" with corresponding changes in references. Additionally, amendments are made to the Federal Fire Prevention and Control Act of 1974. The Federal Fire Prevention and Control Act of 1974 is amended to include a new section titled \"FIREFIGHTER INVESTMENT AND RESPONSE ENHANCEMENT\" (SEC. 33). The Federal Fire Prevention and Control Act of 1974 is amended to include a new section titled \"FIREFIGHTER INVESTMENT AND RESPONSE ENHANCEMENT\" (SEC. 33). This section defines firefighting personnel as individuals involved in firefighting or emergency medical services. It establishes a grant program for fire departments to protect public health and safety against fire hazards. The Director may make grants on a competitive basis and establish specific criteria for grant recipients. The Director may make grants for training firefighting personnel in various areas such as firefighting, emergency response, arson prevention, and hazardous materials handling. Grant funds must be used effectively, including utilizing the capabilities of the National Institute of Standards and Technology. The National Institute of Standards and Technology, Department of Commerce, Consumer Product Safety Commission, and other entities receive funding for research and development to advance health and safety of firefighters, information technologies for fire management, fire prevention and protection technologies, firefighting technologies, and burn care and rehabilitation. Funding is also allocated for rapid intervention teams, fire inspector certification, and protecting firefighting personnel at fire and emergency scenes. The curr_chunk outlines funding purposes for fire departments, including certifying fire inspectors, establishing wellness programs for firefighting personnel, funding emergency medical services, acquiring firefighting vehicles and equipment, and modifying fire stations. The curr_chunk details grant application requirements for fire departments seeking funding for various purposes such as modifying facilities, enforcing fire codes, funding prevention programs, and educating the public about arson prevention. The Director may only grant funds if the applicant agrees to match 10 percent of the funds received with non-Federal funds. The Director may grant funds to fire departments for specific purposes, with the condition that the applicant maintains their expenditures at or above previous levels and submits a report on fund usage. The Director ensures grants are distributed to a variety of fire departments, including paid, volunteer, and combination departments in communities of varying sizes and locations. Additionally, not more than 25% of the assistance can be used for firefighting vehicles. Authorization of appropriations is provided. The Director is authorized to receive necessary funds for this section, with a limitation of 10% for administrative costs."
