    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Patient Safety and Toxicology Modernization Act of 2016\". Congress acknowledges the importance of preclinical testing in assessing risks and benefits of medicines. Gaps in understanding patient response and potential adverse effects highlight the need for more predictive models mimicking human organs. The FDA's 2011 report on advancing regulatory science emphasizes the need for improved safety and efficacy information for new medicines. The FDA's focus on advancing regulatory science includes prioritizing toxicology testing and developing models of human adverse response. The agency's draft commitment letter for drug fees proposes adding new preclinical models by 2021. Peer-reviewed data supports the benefits of human tissue models. The FDA should validate new human tissue models to enhance regulatory decision-making in drug discovery and testing processes. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will issue guidance by December 31, 2018, on the development and use of three-dimensional human tissue models for toxicology and efficacy testing. This guidance will also cover the use of these models for safety and efficacy testing by product sponsors. The Secretary will provide periodic updates to this guidance. SEC. 4. RULE OF CONSTRUCTION.\n\nThis Act does not limit the use of three-dimensional human tissue models by product sponsors for obtaining approval of drugs or biological products under specific acts or meeting regulatory requirements. In this Act, definitions are provided for key terms such as biological product, combination product, drug, and three-dimensional human tissue model, which is a model approximating human tissue using spatially controlled deposition of cells. Three-dimensional human tissue models can be used to detect toxicity not seen in animal models, test drug efficacy not possible in animals, and predict toxicity in clinical testing."
