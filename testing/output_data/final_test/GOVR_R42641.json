    "content": "In December 2011, Congress enacted a new Global Security Contingency Fund (GSCF) at the request of the Obama Administration. The GSCF, a joint effort between the State Department and Department of Defense, aimed to address urgent security and stabilization needs in countries facing transnational threats. Congress provided GSCF authority for four fiscal years under the FY2012 National Defense Authorization Act. The Global Security Contingency Fund (GSCF) was established by Congress in response to the Obama Administration's request. It aims to address security and stabilization needs in countries facing transnational threats. The GSCF has authority for four fiscal years under the FY2012 National Defense Authorization Act, with transitional authorities for counterterrorism operations in Africa and Yemen expiring at the end of FY2012. The fund is seen as a way to improve interagency coordination and provide more effective responses to emerging threats. The Global Security Contingency Fund (GSCF) was established by Congress to address security and stabilization needs in countries facing transnational threats. The GSCF concept originates from long-standing perceptions of deficiencies in current national security structures, aiming to provide the State Department with a flexible funding account for emerging needs and crises. The State Department repeatedly sought emergency response funds for immediate crisis responses, but Congress denied requests. In 2005, DOD was authorized to transfer up to $100 million to the State Department for this purpose. The \"Section 1207\" authority expired in FY2010. A Complex Crises Fund was established in FY2011, but a similar account is not available to the State Department. Mechanisms are needed for better interagency cooperation in security and stabilization program planning. Greater interagency cooperation is needed to address gaps and avoid duplication in security and stabilization programs. There is a debate on the division of labor between the State Department and DOD for security assistance. Oversight of military assistance programs has historically been under civilian authority. Since World War II, civilian oversight of military assistance programs has been under the Secretary of State. In the 1980s, DOD began contributing manpower and funding to national security efforts. After 9/11, DOD gained new authorities to address critical needs and protect U.S. troops. The goal is to establish an appropriate model for post-9/11 civil-military activities and missions. Analysts have long recommended consolidating budgets for national security activities to promote collaboration among agencies and rationalize resource allocation. The proposal suggests creating a unified budget system based on functions rather than individual agencies, aiming to enhance coordination and decision-making in allocating resources. The Obama Administration introduced the GSCF to combine State Department and DOD funds for security activities, aiming to enhance collaboration and efficiency. Assistance under the GSCF can include equipment, supplies, and training for security and counterterrorism purposes. The GSCF combines State Department and DOD funds for security activities, including training and equipment for security and counterterrorism purposes. Section 1207 authorizes the use of the GSCF to enhance military and security forces' capabilities for various operations, with joint formulation and approval by the Secretary of State and Secretary of Defense. Section 1207 (b)(1)(B) allows GSCF assistance to national military forces and specified security forces for military, stability, or peace support operations in line with US foreign policy. Recipient countries are designated by the Secretary of State and Secretary of Defense, with joint formulation and approval of programs before implementation. Section 1207(b)(2) authorizes GSCF support for the justice sector, rule of law programs, and stabilization efforts, with consultation by the Secretary of State. The Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary of Defense, determines assistance for conflict or instability in a region challenging civilian providers. Recipients are designated by the Secretary of State, with activities implemented in consultation with the Secretary of Defense. State formulates programs with DOD consultation, establishing new transitional authorities for counterterrorism assistance. The FY2012 NDAA established a GSCF account to assist counterterrorism and peacekeeping efforts in Africa, with a limit of $200 million on transfers from DOD. The State Department funding has no set limit, but a proportional limitation ensures DOD contributes no more than 80% of the cost of activities. Despite a $50 million request, no new money was provided for the fund in the FY2012 appropriations act. The FY2012 NDAA established a GSCF account for counterterrorism and peacekeeping in Africa, allowing transfers up to $250 million from DOD and State Department accounts. The GSCF authority expires on September 30, 2015, with funds remaining available for ongoing programs. DOD was granted a transfer authority of up to $200 million per fiscal year to the GSCF from its defense-wide operation and maintenance account. The DOD is authorized to transfer funds from its defense-wide operation and maintenance account to the GSCF, with specific requirements for notification and justification. The State Department can transfer up to $50 million from designated accounts for the GSCF. No new funding was provided in FY2013. The Appropriations Act, 2014 allows the State Department to transfer funds to the GSCF from various accounts, while the Department of Defense can transfer funds from its Operations and Maintenance account. The Obama Administration did not request a GSCF appropriation for FY2015. Congress provided GSCF authority with exceptions related to assistance to governments supporting international terrorism. The legislation authorizes the Global Security Contingency Fund (GSCF) for three years, with provisions to promote human rights and civilian authority. Reporting requirements include notifications before funds transfer and program initiation, as well as annual reports. The FY2014 omnibus appropriations legislation (P.L. 113-76) mandates notifications to appropriations committees before transfers from certain accounts to the Global Security Contingency Fund (GSCF), with detailed justifications and timelines. DOD must also notify defense committees before transfers from the Operations and Maintenance, Defense-Wide account to the GSCF. The FY2014 NDAA amended reporting requirements for State and Defense secretaries to notify specified congressional committees. The legislation mandates notifications to specified congressional committees before initiating program activities, with detailed justifications, budget, execution plan, timeline, and other relevant information. Funds cannot be transferred into the fund until 15 days after Congress is notified. The secretaries of State and Defense must jointly submit a report to the specified committees. The secretaries of State and Defense are required to submit reports to specified committees within 15 days of issuing guidance for program implementation. They must also notify Congress jointly once all necessary guidance is in place. An annual report on programs, activities, and funding is due by October 30 each year. Seven countries were designated as recipients of GSCF assistance under FY2012 funding. The State Department and DOD transferred $44.8 million to the GSCF for countries like Nigeria, Philippines, Bangladesh, and Libya, as well as Hungary, Romania, and Slovakia. Detailed programs are still being developed, with no information on progress or plans for FY2014. Some view the GSCF proposal positively for integrated funding streams, while others have concerns about specific provisions. The House Armed Services Committee expressed concerns over the slow pace of FY2012 program planning and implementation for the Global Security Contingency Fund (GSCF). Delays were attributed to bureaucratic processes, the small size of the GSCF team, and difficulties in aligning planning processes. Congress urged timely execution of GSCF programs. Some observers question the feasibility of establishing an agile interagency mechanism due to definitional differences and bureaucratic delays in identifying feasible projects for the Global Security Contingency Fund (GSCF). While the State Department leads the GSCF, concerns arise about the extent of control the Secretary of State may have if the Department of Defense provides most of the funding. Advocates of greater State Department control prefer Congress to allocate more security assistance and DOD funding directly to the international affairs budget, rather than through the GSCF pooled fund. They fear that pooling DOD and State Department funds may perpetuate the State Department's lack of capacity to resource security assistance. Some are concerned that including all GSCF funding in the international affairs budget could make GSCF activities vulnerable to cuts. The State Department may lack the capacity to plan and direct increased security assistance programs without expanding its staff. Additionally, there are doubts about the State Department's institutional interest and ability to oversee a large security assistance portfolio. However, the creation of new programs under the Security Assistance peacekeeping account shows some interest from the State Department. Some analysts perceive disadvantages in the GSCF program for DOD, including concerns about diverting DOD funds and potential overlap with existing authorities like \"Section 1206.\" There are worries that successful GSCF efforts could lead to the elimination of Section 1206, sacrificing control and flexibility over programs provided through DOD authority. The GSCF legislation expands DOD's authority to train and assist a wider range of foreign security forces, including those responsible for border and maritime security, internal security, and counterterrorism operations. Congress has rejected providing DOD with authority to train police and non-military forces, except for foreign maritime security forces. The GSCF legislation expands DOD's authority to train and assist a wider range of foreign security forces, including those responsible for border and maritime security, internal security, and counterterrorism operations. Proponents argue for the extension without limitations on the agency providing assistance, citing overlap in military and civilian law enforcement functions. Concerns include the need for a strategic framework to prioritize and clarify roles in security assistance. The GSCF legislation aims to clarify department and agency roles in security assistance to enhance interagency collaboration. The Obama Administration initiated a review of security assistance, but it remains ongoing. The GSCF is seen as a platform for exploring new concepts and arrangements. Congressional oversight may focus on the GSCF's effectiveness and potential adjustments. Concerns have been raised about bureaucratic hurdles hindering program implementation. Difficulty in merging State and DOD procedures is identified as a key challenge. The State Department faces coordination challenges due to merging State and DOD procedures and reliance on transfers from multiple accounts. Congress may need to investigate how to overcome planning and implementation obstacles for FY2014-funded programs."
