    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Consumer Products Safe Testing Act\". It includes findings and policy statements. The Congress finds that nonanimal acute toxicity tests have been developed in recent years, showing reliability for reducing or replacing animal tests like the Draize test. Manufacturers have found these tests adequate for safety evaluations, but Federal regulations still favor animal tests, leading to reluctance in using nonanimal tests without government encouragement. Federal departments and agencies are encouraged to promote alternative testing methods that are accurate and humane, without relying on animals, for assessing the health effects of products on humans. Federal departments and agencies are encouraged to promote alternative testing methods that are accurate and humane, without relying on animals, for assessing the health effects of products on humans. SEC. 3. FEDERAL ACTION. Federal departments and agencies are required to review regulations, guidelines, or recommendations related to the use of animal acute toxicity tests, evaluate nonanimal alternatives, and establish regulations for nonanimal acute toxicity tests. Federal departments and agencies must review regulations for animal acute toxicity tests and consider nonanimal alternatives. If nonanimal tests are not as effective as animal tests in predicting human reactions to a product, the agency must justify the use of animal tests in the Federal Register for public comment. Federal departments and agencies must periodically review animal acute toxicity testing regulations every 2 years to determine if continued use of any test is justified based on technological advances. If justified, an explanation and justification must be published in the Federal Register for public comment. This Act excludes regulations, guidelines, or recommendations related to medical research. The Act defines \"animal\" as any vertebrate and \"animal acute toxicity test\" as a test on animals to determine acute toxicity. The term \"Federal department or agency head\" refers to the head of a department or agency with authority over safety testing procedures for various products. The term \"medical research\" refers to research on causes, diagnosis, treatment, or control of physical or mental impairments in humans or animals, excluding toxicity testing for compliance with regulatory guidelines. Nonanimal acute toxicity tests are tests conducted without using animals. Medical research includes tests conducted on animals such as cell culture, computer modeling, protein alteration, and chorioallantoic membrane techniques."
