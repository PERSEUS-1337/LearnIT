    "content": "The U.S. Copyright Office examined issues surrounding orphan works in response to requests by Members of Congress in 2005. Orphan works are copyrighted works with unidentified owners. The Copyright Office issued a Notice of Inquiry for public comments and proposed legislative language to address the issue in 2006. Hearings were held in the 109th and 110th Congresses on orphan works legislation. No similar legislation has been introduced in the 111th Congress yet. The U.S. Copyright Office examined orphan works in response to requests by Members of Congress. Orphan works are copyrighted works with unidentified owners. Legislation has been proposed to address the issue, but no similar legislation has been introduced in the 111th Congress yet. Copyright holders are granted a limited monopoly to promote creative works, and permission is required to use copyrighted works. Orphan works, which have unidentified owners, are considered inaccessible due to the risk of liability for users. The risk of liability for copyright infringement makes works inaccessible, discouraging creators from using existing material. This can harm the public interest when works cannot be shared due to uncertainty over ownership, even if the owner is no longer present or objects to use. Copyright law plays a crucial role in balancing the rights of creators and users, but challenges arise when incorporating protected work into new adaptations. Defining orphan works for infringement purposes is essential to promote access without undermining copyright. Identifying ownership and determining protection status are key responsibilities for both rights holders and prospective users. The identification process for determining copyright status can be complex and costly. Changes in copyright laws have made it challenging to ascertain if a work is copyrighted or in the public domain. While registration with the U.S. Copyright Office is authoritative, there is no universal copyright registry, making it difficult to identify copyright holders. Various databases exist for different industries or mediums to assist in this process. Identification of copyright holders can be challenging as ownership rights may be transferred over time. Under the 1909 Copyright law, specific formalities were required to create a valid copyright, such as posting a notice of copyright and registration with the U.S. Copyright Office. Failure to observe these formalities could void the copyright. Renewal of copyright protection was necessary after the first 28-year term. Under the 1976 Copyright Act, formalities for creating a valid copyright were abandoned, and protection is automatically granted when creative expression is fixed in tangible form. This change aimed to align U.S. copyright law with international standards, eliminating burdensome requirements for creators. However, it also complicated the process of identifying copyright holders, as notice and registration were no longer mandatory. Under current copyright law, registration is important for determining copyright status and owner information. Registration is required before suing for infringement or seeking statutory damages. Infringement can result in injunctions, monetary damages, and statutory damages ranging from $750 to $150,000, which can increase for willful infringement. Statutory damages can be increased for willful infringement or reduced for innocent infringement. Registration is not required to create a copyright but is necessary for enforcement. Court costs and attorneys' fees can also be awarded. The U.S. Copyright Office is studying orphan works and the enforcement of infringement liability. The U.S. Copyright Office's study on orphan works considers situations where permission to use a work was not granted. It discusses provisions in copyright law that allow use of orphan works without an owner's permission, such as the \"idea/expression\" dichotomy. This limitation on copyright protection is beneficial for works like non-fiction and utilitarian works. Fair use, as codified in 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 107, allows limited use of copyright-protected works for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, or research. Other exemptions in the Copyright Act at \u00a7\u00a7 108, 110, and 117 permit specified uses of copyrighted works for preservation, education, and religious activities. The Report identifies obstacles in identifying copyright owners and highlights categories of uses impacted by orphan works, including uses by subsequent creators, large scale access uses by institutions like libraries, enthusiast uses, and private uses. The 1976 Copyright Act worsened the orphan works issue by eliminating formalities like renewal registration. International copyright agreements prevent the re-adoption of formalities and restrict exemptions for copyright holders. Proposed solutions for orphan works are grouped into four categories in the report. Proposed solutions for orphan works include legislative solutions involving limitations on remedies for users, deeming orphaned works to be in the public domain, and changing tax or bankruptcy codes to reduce orphan works creation. Non-legislative solutions, such as improved databases for locating owners, were also mentioned but not seen as sufficient to solve the problem. The Report discusses various solutions for orphan works, including the Canadian Copyright Board's method of reviewing applications for use. It highlights the challenges in using orphan works and recommends statutory language to address the issue. The proposal introduces new statutory requirements for using orphan works, limiting remedies for copyright owners. Users must conduct a diligent search for the copyright holder and provide attribution. If sued for infringement, the owner is entitled to reasonable compensation. No monetary relief is available if infringement is non-commercial and promptly stopped after notice. Injunctive relief may be granted to stop further use. The proposal limits remedies for copyright owners regarding orphan works, allowing injunctive relief only in certain cases where the infringer pays compensation and provides attribution. The provision also considers the harm to the infringer who has complied with orphan works requirements. The goal is to promote the good-faith use of true orphan works by limiting damages available. The proposal aims to promote the use of true orphan works by limiting damages for infringement if the owner appears. It balances interests of content users needing easier access to ownership information without imposing new regulatory burdens on owners or the government. The proposal for orphan works aims to exempt users from copyright infringement liability before usage, potentially impacting various industries like movies, music, books, and photographs. Different industries have varying characteristics, traditions, and standards affecting ownership research and permissions. The proposed orphan work exemption is similar to the \"fair use\" exemption in copyright law, providing a defense to infringement on a case-by-case basis with court discretion. The proposal for orphan works suggests a case-by-case approach where courts can consider the behavior of both the user and claimant. It questions if the user conducted a diligent search with proper attribution and if the claimant refused reasonable compensation, acting as a statutory cap on relief. This approach is akin to fair use, offering flexibility but also posing challenges in assessing defense success and potential costs. Terms like \"reasonably diligent search\" and \"reasonable compensation\" are not clearly defined, leaving room for collaborative efforts and judicial interpretation to establish best practices over time. The notion of reasonable compensation in the orphan works proposal is fluid and viewed differently by parties. Critics fear it may lead to a statutory royalty rate, impacting the value of compensation. Litigation costs were considered in the discussion as a defense to copyright infringement. Users express concerns about statutory damages chilling their use of valuable material like documentary film footage. Critics are concerned that the orphan work proposal may disproportionately affect illustrations and photographs, as visual arts are difficult to source and often lack identifying information. Verbal registries are inadequate for describing visual representations, and visual registries may be costly. The orphan works proposal is feared to interfere with commercial markets for visual work and could \"legalize\" infringement. Critics argue it would burden rights holders and limit recoverable damages, depriving visual artists of copyright protection. No legislation on orphan works has been introduced in the 111th Congress, but analysis of bills from the 109th and 110th Congresses is provided. The Orphan Works Act of 2006, part of the Copyright Modernization Act, detailed standards for \"reasonably diligent search\" but was not passed by the 109th Congress. The Orphan Works Act of 2008 proposed limitations on remedies for orphan works under a new section of the Copyright Act. H.R. 5889 proposed limiting liability for infringing use of orphan works by requiring a \"qualifying search\" to locate the copyright owner and filing a \"Notice of Use\" with the Copyright Office. It also called for the establishment of an archive for these filings and a certification process for electronic databases to facilitate searches for visual works. The heart of H.R. 5889 was the limitation on monetary relief for infringing use of orphan works, requiring \"reasonable compensation\" based on a willing buyer and seller agreement. The bill also allowed courts to consider added value from Copyright Office registration. H.R. 5889 exempted certain infringers of orphan works from paying compensation if they met specific criteria, such as being a nonprofit educational institution or library, and promptly ceasing infringement after receiving notice. The bill H.R. 5889 outlined conditions where infringers of orphan works could avoid paying compensation if they conducted a good faith investigation, negotiated reasonable compensation, and provided attribution to the owner. Failure to comply would result in facing all available remedies for copyright infringement. Additionally, the bill allowed courts to grant injunctive relief to prevent infringement, except when the infringing use was incorporated into a new work and the infringer paid reasonable compensation and provided attribution. H.R. 5889 outlined limitations on monetary and injunctive relief for infringers of useful articles offered for sale. The Copyright Act defines useful articles as those with intrinsic utilitarian function, like clothing with images. Infringers of such articles cannot claim limitations on remedies for infringement. The Orphan Works Act of 2008 would have applied to infringements starting January 1, 2009, excluding uses of pictorial, graphic, and sculptural works. The Orphan Works Act of 2008 outlined limitations on liability for infringing uses of useful articles starting on or after January 1, 2009. It excluded pictorial, graphic, and sculptural works from these limitations. H.R. 5889 directed the Register of Copyrights to report to Congress on the implementation and effects of the limitation of liability for orphan works, as well as remedies for small copyright infringement claims. The Shawn Bentley Orphan Works Act of 2008 aimed to address concerns about the cost of litigating copyright infringement claims. It required public comment, roundtables, and a report to Congress within two years. Unlike H.R. 5889, S. 2913 did not mandate filing a Notice of Use with the Copyright Office for infringers seeking orphan works limitations. S. 2913 did not contain exceptions for infringers of useful articles or require courts to consider registration when determining compensation. It extended the safe harbor exemption to museums and had a different effective date for limitations on remedies for infringers of pictorial, graphic, and sculptural works. The House Subcommittee on Courts, the Internet, and Intellectual Property approved a manager's amendment to H.R. 5889 on May 6, 2008. The amendment added museums to the entities eligible for safe harbor from paying compensation for infringing orphan works. It also required courts to consider harm to infringers before granting injunctive relief and clarified that the limitation on remedies would not apply if payment is not made promptly. The Senate Judiciary Committee approved an amendment to S. 2913, adding a \"useful articles\" exception to prevent infringers from claiming limitations on remedies. The amendment also required courts to consider harm to infringers before granting injunctive relief. The Senate Judiciary Committee approved an amendment to S. 2913, adding a \"useful articles\" exception to prevent infringers from claiming limitations on remedies. The amendment also required courts to consider harm to infringers before granting injunctive relief, changing effective dates and clarifying limitations on remedies for infringement. The Senate passed S. 2913 with an amendment that modified the requirements for qualifying searches, directing infringers to make a diligent effort to locate the copyright owner before infringement. Diligent effort was defined to include searching the Copyright Office. Recent developments in the private sector have increased public interest in orphan works, with questions raised about their fate under a proposed settlement agreement. The House did not take action on S. 2913 and H.R. 5889 before the end of the 110th Congress, despite efforts to define \"diligent effort\" in searching for copyright owners. The proposed settlement agreement regarding Google's digitization of print books raised concerns about the fate of orphan works. Authors and publishers sued Google for copyright infringement, leading to a revised settlement agreement in 2009. Google would compensate rights holders for past and future use of their work. Google would fund the creation of a not-for-profit entity called the Registry to represent rights holders in negotiating future uses of their content. Concerns were raised about orphan works, where the absence of identifiable rights holders could limit further use without the agreement of the Registry or Google. Supporters argue that the settlement will prompt owners to identify themselves or reveal that the works are in the public domain, helping to resolve the orphan works problem. Some argue that orphan works concerns are less for books compared to other copyrightable material. Books usually have identifiable rights owners, unlike photographs which often lack identifying information. Books also have copyright registration records to locate rights owners. Most copyright-protected books in libraries are recent, reducing orphan works issues. The Register of Copyrights expressed concerns about the Google Book Settlement's impact on future orphan works legislation, stating that it would interfere with Congress's efforts to address the issue. The broad scope of the settlement would significantly affect the exclusive rights of authors, publishers, and their successors. The Committee has invested time in evaluating orphan works and possible solutions, and the Google Book Settlement would hinder their progress. It is suggested that Google engage with the Committee and stakeholders to discuss alternative solutions. Google should engage with the Committee and stakeholders to discuss the impact of the Google Book Settlement on orphan works legislation. Congress, not the judiciary, is better equipped to consider important changes to copyright law. The settlement is seen as a resolution of litigation, not a replacement for legislation. The Google Book Settlement does not establish new copyright law but is a means for rightsholders to resolve a lawsuit. The court will review the settlement agreement in the Google Library Project litigation, with a final fairness hearing scheduled for February 18, 2010. This settlement does not replace legislation and should not usurp Congress's role in setting copyright policy."
