    "content": "We address the challenge of modeling sequential visual phenomena without the need for ground-truth aligned sequences. By introducing loop consistency and extending cycle consistency, we generate sequences instead of pairs, showing competitive results in various datasets such as Earth's seasons and aging of human faces. This approach expands on image-to-image translation techniques, which have garnered significant attention in recent years. CycleGAN is a pioneering technique that can generate realistic images in one domain based on paired data from another domain. It utilizes generative adversarial networks and enforces consistency in the transformation process. While CycleGAN has limitations in handling translations between only two domains, it has been widely adopted in various applications beyond computer vision. StarGAN addresses the complexity of modeling multiple domains by enabling translation between any two domains with a single model. However, this flexibility is limited to specific attribute changes like emotions and appearance. Many natural processes are sequential, such as the transition between seasons, which is not effectively captured by current image-to-image models like CycleGAN. Modeling sequential processes like the transition between seasons is challenging for current image-to-image models. To address this, a higher resolution discretization of the process is proposed to better capture the underlying dynamics. Gathering unaligned examples from each time step in the sequence is considered, similar to unpaired image-to-image transformation, to generate an aligned sequence. Loop-Consistent Generative Adversarial Networks (LoopGAN) introduce loop consistency to the cycle consistency concept in image-to-image models. Unlike traditional approaches with short paths, LoopGAN allows for longer paths to ensure faithful image realization at each step. This promotes model flexibility and requires different learning approaches for each domain being modeled. Loop-Consistent Generative Adversarial Networks (LoopGAN) introduce loop consistency to image-to-image models, promoting model flexibility for faithful image realization. The method is applied to various sequential phenomena with favorable results against baseline methods, showcasing the model's flexibility and effectiveness. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) consist of a generator G and a discriminator D that play a minimax game to model a distribution. CycleGAN extends image-to-image translation by learning transformations between two domains without paired training data using two generators. The authors proposed a cycle-consistency loss in addition to the GAN loss for two domain-wise generators. UNIT and StarGAN are other models for multi-domain image translation, with UNIT using a VAE-like structure and StarGAN focusing on facial attributes and expressions. The problem of learning non-deterministic multi-modal transformation between two image domains has seen progress in recent years. Models embed images from both domains into a shared latent space to achieve good performance. These models can learn different transformations for the same input image and avoid one-to-one deterministic mapping. However, they are limited to two-domain transformation and cannot be applied to problems with more than two domains. Style transfer, a task in image-to-image transformation, involves transforming a photo into an artistic style while preserving its content. Style transfer involves transforming a photo into an artistic style while preserving its content using pre-trained CNNs and network architecture innovations like AdaIn. It has shown potential in improving image quality for image generation and image-to-image transformation. Face aging, generating faces in different ages from a single image, has also been widely studied in computer vision. State-of-the-art methods in computer vision use pre-trained age estimator and GAN to transform face images to different ages while preserving facial structure. However, these methods have limited application to general sequential image generation tasks. Video prediction involves predicting future frames based on input frames using a combination of RNN and CNN models. Predictive vision techniques utilize CNN or RNN to generate future videos. Video prediction techniques use CNN or RNN models to generate future videos, requiring aligned video clips in training. A recent approach incorporates a GAN for learning human trajectories. Our method focuses on predicting movement of objects across domains in a sequence, with the ability to translate between domains to account for periodic phenomena. Our method involves translating between domains X_i and X_j using a generator G and discriminators D_i. Each domain X_i consists of N_i examples with data distribution p_data(x_i). The goal is for the translations G||j-i||(x_i, i) to be indistinguishable from true examples drawn from p_data(x_j) under D_j. The adversarial objective for a specific domain involves minimizing the ability for the generator to create fake examples undetectable by the discriminator. A cycle consistency loss ensures the generator transforms images between domains accurately. LoopGAN uses a single generator for multiple domains, creating loop consistency by applying the generator multiple times to reduce possible outcomes. LoopGAN ensures loop consistency by applying the generator multiple times to reduce possible outcomes. The combined loss includes adversarial and loop-consistency losses, with \u03bb weighing the trade-off between them. The generator architecture for style transfer consists of down-sampling, residual blocks, and up-sampling modules. The curr_chunk discusses the specific parameters and layer compositions of the generator architecture for style transfer, including ConvReLU, Conv-ReLU, residual blocks, and upsampling layers. It also mentions the PatchGAN discriminator architecture and the process of translating images between different domains using the generator. The generator architecture for style transfer involves applying Enc and Dec j \u2212 i times, with T applied recurrently. This re-formulation is crucial for learning quality transformations, with T having separate learnable normalization parameters based on i. LoopGAN is applied to sequential image generation tasks like face aging and changing seasons of scenery pictures. The loop-consistency loss coefficient is set to 10, and Adam optimizer is used with specific parameters. The face aging dataset is trained for 50 epochs and the Alps seasons dataset for 70 epochs. LoopGAN is compared to bi-domain models like CycleGAN and UNIT, as well as a multi-domain model StarGAN, to evaluate its sequential transformation capabilities. For each bi-domain model, separate models are trained between sequential domains and all possible pairs of domains. This allows for sequential generation by chaining the models in the correct order. Different versions of CycleGAN or UNIT models can be trained and composed to replicate desired transformations. Chained-CycleGAN and Chained-UNIT are created based on the base translation method used. StarGAN is also mentioned for comparison. LoopGAN, based on StarGAN, is used for face aging tasks with the UTKFace dataset. The dataset is divided into four age groups, A to D, with a 95/5 train/test split. LoopGAN outperforms baseline models by preserving facial structure and enforcing loop consistency loss. LoopGAN outperforms baseline models in face aging tasks by preserving facial structure and enforcing loop consistency loss. It shows more apparent age changes and generates images with age distributions closer to the training data. The dataset used is divided into four age groups, A to D, with a 95/5 train/test split. LoopGAN successfully generates drastic season changes while maintaining the input scenery structure. A user study was conducted using Amazon Mechanical Turk to quantify the generation results. The model was also applied to additional datasets for sequential transformation tasks involving chairs with different azimuth angles and gradual changes in face attributes. The chairs dataset includes ground truth azimuth angles, while linear manifolds for face attributes were obtained using a binary classifier. The study experimented with different network architecture variations to improve image generation quality. Attention mechanisms were added but did not significantly enhance image quality. It was found that using no normalization for down-sampling and layer-normalization for up-sampling improved results. The study compared different network architecture variations to enhance image generation quality. Results are shown in Figure 6, highlighting the importance of the recurrent form of T (h). The final generator network architecture was found to be parameter-efficient compared to baseline models. Failure cases are also included in Figure 7, showing some semantic dissimilarity in generated images. The study proposed an extension to image-to-image translation methods for a sequence of domains, using a shared generator for efficiency gains. Despite some semantic dissimilarity in generated images, the architecture showed favorable results compared to classic CycleGAN algorithms."
