    "content": "Indian tribes originally had sovereign authority over their territory and people, including non-Indians, but lost some of that authority by ceding lands to the United States and declaring dependence on the Federal Government. Tribes are prohibited from exercising powers terminated by Congress or inconsistent with their status. Sovereign authority lost due to their dependent status means tribes cannot determine relations with nonmembers. In Oliphant v. Suquamish, the Supreme Court ruled that Indian tribes do not have inherent sovereign authority to try non-Indian criminal defendants. In Montana v. United States, the Court established the general rule that tribes cannot exercise civil jurisdiction over nonmembers, with exceptions known as the Montana exceptions. These exceptions allow tribes to regulate nonmembers who enter consensual relationships with the tribe through taxation, licensing, or other means. Tribes may retain civil authority over non-Indians on reservation land if their conduct affects the tribe's governance, economic security, or welfare. The Supreme Court recognizes tribes' right to exclude nonmembers from tribal land, supporting tribal taxes on nonmembers' activities. Tribes can also exercise jurisdiction over nonmembers with congressional authorization. Congress has granted tribal authority over nonmembers in various areas such as the sale of alcohol, enforcement of hunting and fishing ordinances, and certain environmental statutes on reservations. Tribal jurisdiction over nonmembers is limited, and challenges must be first addressed in tribal court before seeking relief in federal court. There are exceptions for non-Indians who commit domestic violence against tribal members, with specific ties to the tribes and additional rights provided by the tribes in tribal court criminal cases. Tribal criminal jurisdiction over nonmember Indians depends on factors such as enrollment in a tribe, receipt of federal services, and participation in tribal activities. In Oliphant v. Suquamish Indian Tribe, the Court ruled that tribes lack inherent authority over non-Indian offenders. The history of criminal jurisdiction over non-Indians in Indian country is analyzed through treaty provisions, executive branch activities, and lower court opinions. The Court analyzed the historical presumption against tribal jurisdiction over non-Indians in Indian country, citing the Suquamish Tribe's treaty with the United States. It determined that the Tribe did not retain the authority to try non-Indian offenders, based on two reasons. The Court ruled that Indian tribes are restricted in their sovereignty by Congress, including limitations on land transfer and external political sovereignty. This restriction excludes competitors from their markets and allows them to govern everyone within their boundaries except themselves. Protection of territory within tribal boundaries is crucial to U.S. sovereign interests. The Court determined that Indian tribes must submit to the sovereignty of the United States, giving up their power to try non-Indian citizens except in a manner approved by Congress. This decision was influenced by the Court's precedent in Ex Parte Crow Dog, where federal courts lacked jurisdiction to try an Indian offender on reservation land. The Court concluded that the United States was attempting to extend its law over aliens and strangers on reservation land, judging them by a different standard and code. This also applied to subjecting non-Indian offenders to the laws of Indian tribes, contradicting the idea that tribes retain the power to try non-Indian citizens. The Court recognized that Indian tribes retain the power to try non-Indians according to their customs and procedures, but suggested that Congress should decide whether tribes should be authorized to try non-Indians. In 2013, Congress authorized tribes to exercise criminal jurisdiction over non-Indians who commit domestic or dating violence crimes against Indians within their jurisdictions. Congress amended the Indian Civil Rights Act by adding Section 1304, granting tribes the power to prosecute non-Indians for domestic and dating violence crimes under special domestic violence criminal jurisdiction. Tribes cannot prosecute if both the victim and perpetrator are non-Indians, and must establish the defendant's connection to the offense. The tribes must prove that the defendant has ties to the tribe in order to prosecute non-Indians for domestic violence crimes. Additionally, the tribe must provide defendants with certain rights, including legal representation for indigent defendants and a jury representing a fair cross-section of the community. Congress amended ICRA to recognize and affirm the inherent power of tribes to exercise criminal jurisdiction over all Indians, including nonmember Indians. This re-vested tribes with the authority to try nonmember Indians, but certain criteria must be met, such as proving ties to the tribe and providing defendants with specific rights. The term 'Indian' is not statutorily defined, but courts have judicially explicated its meaning. The generally accepted test for Indian status considers the degree of Indian blood and tribal or government recognition as an Indian. There is no set degree of Indian blood required, but it must trace back to a federally recognized tribe. The second requirement involves membership or affiliation with a federally recognized tribe, which can be proven through tribal enrollment, government recognition, benefits of tribal affiliation, and social recognition. Tribal civil jurisdiction over nonmembers is complex due to various factors, including consensual relationships and threats to the tribe. Courts consider multiple factors, such as Indian blood, tribal recognition, federal benefits, tribal affiliation, and participation in tribal activities, to determine Indian status and potential tribal prosecution. Montana exceptions to consensual relationships and threats to the tribe do not provide clear rules for tribal civil jurisdiction over nonmembers. Courts must decide cases based on unique facts, with two types of civil jurisdiction: legislative and adjudicatory. The extent of tribal adjudicatory jurisdiction is still unclear, but a case in October 2015 may provide clarity. The Supreme Court has not drawn a clear line on tribal adjudicatory jurisdiction. The Supreme Court has not provided clear rules for tribal civil jurisdiction over nonmembers, including the ownership of the land where the conduct takes place. It is uncertain if tribes have civil jurisdiction over nonmember Indians, despite having criminal jurisdiction. Congress did not address civil jurisdiction over nonmember Indians, leaving it ambiguous. The Supreme Court's analysis of tribal jurisdiction over nonmember Indians has been altered by Congress's decision to re-vest tribes with criminal jurisdiction. Litigation on the Montana exceptions mainly focuses on nonmembers in consensual relationships with tribes. The Court has limited the exception for threats to the tribe, allowing tribes to exercise jurisdiction over non-Indians in consensual relationships. Federal courts rarely find tribal jurisdiction based on nonmember's consensual relationships. In First Specialty Insurance v. Confederated Tribes of the Grand Ronde Community of Oregon, the tribal court's jurisdiction over a claim based on a contract between the Tribes and the insured nonmember investment company was upheld. The Supreme Court has stated that a consensual relationship, formal or informal, can establish tribal jurisdiction. The Court's analysis emphasizes the need for a nexus between the tribal tax or regulation and the consensual relationship for tribal civil authority to apply. In Strate v. A-1 Contractors, the tribal court's jurisdiction was challenged when a nonmember contractor was sued for a traffic accident on a state highway within the reservation. The court ruled that the tribal court did not have jurisdiction as the accident was unrelated to the consensual relationship between the contractor and the tribe. The Supreme Court emphasized the need for a nexus between tribal authority and the consensual relationship for tribal jurisdiction to apply. In Smith v. Salish Kootenai College, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit upheld tribal court jurisdiction over a nonmember's claim against a tribal college. The case involved a fatal accident with a tribal college truck, leading to multiple lawsuits between the parties involved. In Smith v. Salish Kootenai College, the Ninth Circuit upheld tribal court jurisdiction over a nonmember's claim against the tribal college. Smith filed a cross-claim against the college, which led to a trial in tribal court where he lost. Despite originally being a defendant, the court ruled that Smith had entered into a consensual relationship with the tribe by filing his claim, thus affirming tribal court jurisdiction. Ford Credit, as plaintiff, obtained a default judgment in tribal court against a tribal member for non-payment on a financed vehicle. The tribal member later sued Ford Credit in tribal court for damages related to the default judgment. Ford Credit challenged the tribal court's jurisdiction in federal court but was unsuccessful, with the court emphasizing that a non-Indian cannot seek relief in tribal court and then try to avoid its jurisdiction. The Montana exception allows tribes to exercise jurisdiction over nonmembers when their conduct threatens the tribe's political integrity, economic security, or health. In a case involving a tribal tax on a nonmember's hotel, the Court rejected the argument that the hotel had direct effects on the tribe's welfare. The Court rejected the Nation's argument that civil authority can be exercised beyond tribal lands unless nonmember conduct imperils the political integrity of the Indian tribe. The limited nature of this exception was reiterated in Plains Commerce Bank v. Long Family Land and Cattle Co., stating that tribal power must be necessary to avert catastrophic consequences. In a recent court case, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit upheld a tribal court's jurisdiction over trespass and trade secrets claims against a nonmember for seizing tribal financial documents. The case involved a tribal leadership dispute where elected leaders refused to honor recall petitions, leading to opposition leaders taking control of the Tribe's facilities. The elected leaders then hired the nonmember to remove the opposition, resulting in a legal battle. The nonmember raided the Tribe's facilities with 30 agents armed with batons, one of whom had a firearm. The tribal court found in favor of the Tribe, leading to a jurisdiction challenge in federal court. The court of appeals upheld the tribal court's jurisdiction, stating that the raid threatened the tribal community, its institutions, political integrity, and economic security. The attack targeted the Tribe's community center and casino, aiming to reinstate rejected leaders, posing a direct threat to tribal sovereignty. The court upheld the tribal court's jurisdiction over the Tribe's claims against the nonmember due to the raid occurring on tribal land, giving the Tribe the power to regulate conduct on their land. The second Montana exception is limited and applies when the tribe's survival is threatened by nonmember conduct. In Merrion v. Jicarilla Apache Tribe, the Supreme Court upheld the Tribe's authority to impose a severance tax on a nonmember extracting oil and gas from tribal property. The Court found jurisdiction to tax nonmembers on tribally owned land derived from the Tribe's power to exclude nonmembers and control economic activity within its jurisdiction. The power to exclude may be independent of the Montana exceptions, and tribal ownership alone could support regulatory jurisdiction. The Atkinson opinion in 2001 raised questions about whether the power to exclude is separate from the Montana exceptions. The Court rejected the Tribe's argument that Merrion's recognition of inherent taxing authority supported an occupancy tax on nonmember hotel guests on non-Indian land. Merrion's ruling only extended taxing power to transactions on trust lands involving the tribe or its members. Despite some broader suggestions in the Merrion opinion, its holding was limited to activities on the reservation, aligning with the Montana - Strate authority deemed controlling. In Water Wheel Camp Recreational Area, Inc. v. LaRance, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit found that the tribal court had jurisdiction over a non-Indian who had leased land from the Colorado River Indian Tribes but stayed after the lease had expired based on the Tribes' power to exclude, independent of the Tribes' inherent authority under the Montana exceptions. Indian tribes may exercise jurisdiction over nonmembers within reservations when Congress authorizes. Congress may relax restrictions on tribes' inherent sovereign authority, allowing them to exercise jurisdiction over nonmembers within reservations. This can be done through laws authorizing federal enforcement of tribal legal standards or laws authorizing tribal enforcement of federal statutes. One example is Section 1161, which exempts certain acts in Indian country from federal criminal statutes if they comply with state laws and tribal ordinances. In United States v. Mazurie, the Supreme Court upheld Section 1161 as a delegation of Congress's authority to regulate alcohol sales by non-Indians on Indian reservations. City of Timber Lake v. Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe affirmed the Tribe's authority to require nonmembers to obtain tribal licenses and enforce them in tribal court. Section 1165 imposes criminal penalties for unauthorized hunting, trapping, or fishing on Indian or tribal trust land. The Clean Air Act allows tribes to regulate nonmember conduct on non-Indian fee land by enforcing their own standards. Tribes can petition the EPA for authority to regulate reservation air quality. Tribal civil jurisdiction over nonmembers is limited, and challenges to tribal court jurisdiction must be made in tribal court first. Federal courts will dismiss challenges to tribal court jurisdiction if not raised in tribal court. The exhaustion requirement for challenging tribal court jurisdiction in federal court is subject to four exceptions: when motivated by harassment or bad faith, patently violative of jurisdictional prohibitions, futile due to lack of opportunity, or plainly lacking jurisdiction. Indian tribes generally lack jurisdiction over nonmembers, but there are exceptions. Indian tribes have exceptions to exercise jurisdiction over nonmembers in cases of criminal jurisdiction, civil jurisdiction in consensual relationships, threats to tribal integrity, and when authorized by Congress. The Supreme Court recognizes tribal rights to exclude nonmembers from tribal land. The Supreme Court has acknowledged tribal jurisdiction over nonmembers on tribal land but it is unclear if this right is separate from the Montana exceptions. Defendants challenging tribal court jurisdiction must exhaust tribal remedies before seeking relief in federal court."
