In 1959, over a third of the elderly were in poverty, but by 2006, only 9% were impoverished. This decline was mainly due to more generous Social Security benefits and strong wage growth. Without Social Security, an estimated 44% of the elderly would be poor today. The poverty rate among the elderly is lower than that for children or working-age adults. The poverty rate among the elderly in the United States has significantly decreased over time, reaching a record low in 2006. By the early 1990s, the elderly poverty rate had fallen below the rate for working-age adults and has remained lower since. Elderly poverty is projected to continue to decrease over time under Social Security's scheduled benefit formula. Most of the elderly receive Social Security benefits, which are expected to help reduce the poverty rate among this demographic group. The elderly poverty rate is projected to decrease to about 5% by 2042 under the scheduled baseline, assuming no changes in the Social Security benefit formula. Lawmakers could restore system solvency by increasing revenue, cutting benefits, or a combination of both. If no changes are made and trust funds become insolvent, scheduled benefits would be reduced, potentially doubling elderly poverty rates. Under the payable baseline, an across-the-board benefit cut is projected to result in an 11% elderly poverty rate, higher than today's rate. If Social Security benefits are cut across the board, the elderly poverty rate could increase significantly. Implementing a price indexing provision could double the elderly poverty rate to 10% by 2042. This is higher than the projected poverty rate under the current benefit formula.\u8bae\u3002 The elderly poverty rate could double to 10% by 2042 if Social Security benefits are cut across the board. Progressive price indexing, endorsed by President George W. Bush, could reduce the solvency gap by about 70% but would not restore solvency to the system. If implemented in 2008, it is estimated that the elderly poverty rate would be 8% by 2042 under this option. The elderly poverty rate could double to 10% by 2042 if Social Security benefits are cut across the board. Workers receive benefits based on contributions, while the Supplemental Security Income program is means-tested. About 92% of the elderly currently receive Social Security, with more people qualifying due to legislative changes. The elderly poverty rate could double to 10% by 2042 if Social Security benefits are cut across the board. About 92% of the elderly currently receive Social Security, with more people qualifying due to legislative changes. In contrast, only about 5% of the elderly currently receive SSI, with many poor elderly individuals not receiving it due to strict eligibility criteria. Social Security beneficiaries qualify for SSI, but the eligibility criteria become stricter over time. While Social Security has reduced elderly poverty, its primary purpose is to replace lost earnings. The benefit formula is progressive, with lower earners receiving a higher proportion of benefits. However, not all elderly receive enough benefits to stay out of poverty, with 7% of beneficiaries living in poverty in 2006. Some long-term low earners receive Social Security benefits below the elderly poverty threshold, especially those with limited working histories. The special minimum primary insurance amount (PIA) was enacted in 1972 to increase benefits for long-term low wage earners and their families. The special minimum PIA was established in 1972 to boost benefits for long-term low wage earners with at least 11 years of Social Security-covered earnings. The amount varies based on years worked, ranging from $34.90 to $721.40 per month in 2008. However, due to slower growth compared to regular benefits, the special minimum PIA is becoming less significant and is now paid to a small and shrinking population. The special minimum PIA, established in 1972, is becoming less significant as it only benefits a small and shrinking population. In 2005, less than 0.25% of Social Security beneficiaries received this special minimum PIA, with an average benefit amount below the poverty threshold for elderly individuals. The Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program, designed for the elderly poor, low-income blind, and disabled, ensures benefits only go to the extremely poor, unlike Social Security. SSI benefits are not based on work history, reaching individuals who do not qualify for Social Security. The Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program targets the elderly poor, low-income blind, and disabled individuals with limited work histories who do not qualify for Social Security. SSI benefits are insufficient to lift recipients out of poverty, with many poor elderly individuals not receiving SSI due to strict eligibility criteria. Policy discussions on addressing elderly poverty should consider projected poverty rates in 2042 under different scenarios. The projected elderly poverty rates in 2042 vary under different scenarios. The payable baseline shows an 11% poverty rate, while the scheduled baseline shows a 5% rate. Certain groups have higher projected poverty rates, such as racial and ethnic minorities, individuals with low education levels, unmarried individuals, and women. In 2042, women are projected to have higher poverty rates than men (13% compared to 9%). Social Security benefits are crucial in reducing elderly poverty, with 70% of the poor elderly projected to receive them. SSI recipients are more likely to be poor, with 22% of the poor elderly projected to receive SSI. In 2042, Social Security benefits play a crucial role in reducing elderly poverty, with 70% of the poor elderly projected to receive them. SSI recipients are more likely to be poor, with 22% of the poor elderly projected to receive SSI benefits. Changes to public policy should consider potential unintended consequences, as a microsimulation model like Dynasim can reveal unexpected interactions between policy options and existing program rules within Social Security and SSI. Changes to Social Security benefits could impact eligibility and benefit levels for various government assistance programs, including SSI, Medicaid, food stamps, and LIHEAP. Adjustments in SSI eligibility could also affect eligibility for other low-income programs. In some cases, an increase in Social Security benefits could result in low-income beneficiaries losing eligibility for other assistance programs. Some low-income beneficiaries may be worse off due to potential loss of eligibility for other programs as a result of changes to Social Security. SSI rules dictate that countable income cannot exceed the federal benefit amount, with the first $20 of unearned income (including Social Security benefits) being excluded from the SSI benefit calculation. Further increases in Social Security benefits could lead to reductions in federal SSI benefits, potentially causing some individuals to lose SSI assistance. An increase in Social Security benefits could impact SSI eligibility and benefits, potentially causing some individuals to lose SSI assistance and affecting eligibility for other programs like Medicaid, food stamps, and LIHEAP. SSI enrollment changes could lead to more people qualifying for means-tested programs. As of 2008, SSI recipients in certain states are automatically eligible for Medicaid, while others must complete a separate application. SSI recipients are also automatically eligible for food stamps if they live alone or in a household where all members receive SSI benefits. Additionally, households with a member receiving SSI are categorically eligible for LIHEAP. Changes to SSI eligibility would impact Medicaid, food stamps, and LIHEAP eligibility. Raising SSI's $20 unearned income exclusion could help increase Social Security benefits while minimizing effects on SSI eligibility and benefit levels. This change would allow more Social Security benefit increases to be passed on to SSI recipients and reduce the number of recipients losing eligibility for means-tested programs. Raising the unearned income exclusion for SSI recipients could increase Social Security benefits while maintaining eligibility for Medicaid, food stamps, and LIHEAP. Legislation could allow SSI recipients to qualify for these programs without receiving SSI benefits, ensuring they do not lose eligibility due to changes in Social Security. The four options modeled by CRS aim to mitigate poverty in a benefit cut scenario for individuals already receiving SSI. These options illustrate different approaches to maintaining benefit levels and eligibility in 2042, without covering transition issues or costs. The first option proposes a new minimum Social Security benefit equal to the elderly poverty line. Individuals insured for Social Security would be guaranteed a primary insurance amount (PIA) at least equal to the single-person elderly poverty threshold. Claiming benefits before full retirement age results in a permanent reduction in monthly benefits. Poverty is a family measure, so receiving a poverty-line benefit may not indicate individual poverty. The proposed option for Social Security benefits would not change eligibility but could result in a 2% increase in benefits for all beneficiaries. However, some individuals receiving benefits based on others' work records may not qualify for a minimum benefit. This could lead to about 12% of individuals losing their entire SSI benefits due to additional income received. The proposed Social Security option could increase benefits by 2% for all beneficiaries, but some may lose their entire SSI benefits. The poverty-line minimum benefit option is projected to reduce elderly poverty by about one percentage point, lifting 7% of elderly poor individuals out of poverty. It would have a greater impact on certain subgroups, such as married elderly individuals. The proposed Social Security option aims to increase benefits by 2% for all beneficiaries, potentially lifting 23% of married poor elderly individuals out of poverty. However, only 1-2% of each non-married group may benefit. This result may seem counterintuitive, but it reflects the potential for married individuals to be lifted out of poverty by a spouse's benefit increase. About 67,000 individuals are projected to fall into poverty under this option, all of whom would lose SSI benefits. Policymakers are considering minimum benefit options for long-term low earners to reward work and strengthen Social Security's ties to earnings. Senator Lindsay Graham's 2003 reform bill includes a sliding-scale minimum benefit provision. The security reform bill proposes a sliding-scale minimum benefit based on years of work. Retired workers with at least 35 years of work would receive a PIA equal to 120% of the single elderly poverty threshold, gradually phasing out for those with 10 years of work. Individuals with 30 or fewer years of work would receive a minimum benefit below the poverty line. Overall, there is projected to be no change in the mean amount of Social Security benefits under this option. Eligibility for Social Security benefits would remain unchanged. The sliding-scale minimum benefit option in the security reform bill would not change the mean amount of Social Security benefits. However, it would disqualify about 2% of individuals from receiving SSI benefits, with a projected 6% of beneficiaries receiving lower SSI benefits. The option is not expected to significantly impact the elderly poverty rate or the number of elderly poor in 2042. In 2042, a proposed option in the security reform bill may lead to 1% of poor elderly individuals coming out of poverty, with 58,000 projected to benefit. However, a similar number of elderly individuals (53,000) are projected to fall into poverty due to potential loss of SSI benefits under the option. The proposal involves increasing SSI federal benefit rates to poverty thresholds for the elderly, while asset thresholds and income exclusions would remain unchanged. Increasing the federal benefit rate for SSI would liberalize eligibility, potentially lifting 1% of elderly individuals out of poverty. However, some may still receive less than the poverty line due to income thresholds. This change is projected to increase SSI participation by over a third. The poverty-line SSI option is projected to increase SSI participation by more than a third and raise benefits for all recipients, almost doubling on average. It is estimated to reduce the elderly poverty rate by about two percentage points, lifting about 395,000 elderly individuals out of poverty in 2042. This option would not affect Social Security eligibility or benefits. The final option modeled would increase SSI participation by over a third, raise benefits for all recipients, and reduce elderly poverty by about 2%. It would particularly benefit the oldest old, with 7% projected to be lifted out of poverty. This option retains poverty-line SSI federal benefit rates and includes provisions to increase asset limits, income exclusions, and index them to inflation. The current asset and income exclusions for SSI are very strict and have not been adjusted for inflation since 1981 and 1989, respectively. A proposed bill in 2005 aimed to double income exclusions and increase asset thresholds by 50%, while also indexing them to inflation. This would potentially increase SSI participation by 3% among the elderly, nearly doubling the number of elderly individuals receiving SSI benefits. The option to create a poverty-line SSI benefit and liberalize eligibility is projected to reduce the elderly poverty rate by about three percentage points, compared to the payable baseline, reducing the number of elderly poor by about 1.9 million individuals in 2042. The option to create a poverty-line SSI benefit and liberalize eligibility is projected to reduce the number of elderly poor by about 24% (1.9 million) compared to the current law payable baseline. This option would have varying effects on different subgroups of the elderly poor, with some groups experiencing a larger poverty-reduction effect than others. For example, the option is estimated to bring 36% of never-married individuals, 31% of black elderly poor, and 29% of the oldest elderly poor (age 85+) out of poverty. Conversely, the option is projected to have a smaller poverty-reduction effect on married elderly poor (10%), Asian or Native American elderly poor (15%), and college graduates (17%). No one is expected to be pushed into poverty by this option. In 2042, projected effects of options on Social Security and SSI eligibility, benefit levels, and poverty rates were analyzed. Options #1 and #2 would change the benefit formula for Social Security, with Option #1 increasing the average benefit by 2%. Options #3 and #4 are projected to increase both eligibility and benefit levels for SSI, with Option #4 expected to increase the number of SSI beneficiaries by 80%. Under Option #3 and Option #4, SSI benefit payments are projected to double, reducing elderly poverty rates compared to current law. Option #4, the poverty-line SSI benefit with liberalized eligibility, shows the most significant reduction in poverty. The demographic breakdown of individuals projected to come out of poverty varies under different options for reducing elderly poverty rates. Option #1 is projected to bring 7% of elderly poor individuals out of poverty, with a greater proportion of married individuals benefiting. Option #2 has a small overall impact on poverty reduction. Both SSI options (Options #3 and #4) are projected to bring a greater proportion of non-married individuals and the oldest elderly out of poverty. The Social Security and SSI options have different interactions with other programs. SSI options increase benefits without affecting Social Security, but may impact eligibility for other low-income programs. Reforming Social Security to help the elderly poor may require targeting spending effectively. The report focuses on analyzing the targeting of policy options to mitigate benefit reductions on the elderly poor. Figure 7 illustrates the projected income changes for the elderly poor under different options, including winners, losers, and no change categories. Under Option #1, creating a new minimum Social Security benefit at the poverty line, about two-thirds of the poor elderly are projected to be unaffected. 27% of the poor elderly would benefit, but most won't gain enough income to lift them out of poverty. 5% of the elderly poor are projected to lose income due to increased Social Security benefits resulting in reduced SSI benefits or loss of SSI. Increased Social Security benefits may lead to reduced SSI benefits or loss of SSI eligibility. Among the non-poor elderly, 84% are projected not to be affected. About 11% may gain income, while 5% may lose income. For the poor elderly, 89% are projected to be unaffected under Option #2, with 8% projected to gain income but not enough to lift them out of poverty. 3% of the elderly poor may lose income, mainly due to reduced SSI benefits or loss of SSI eligibility. Under Option #3, 63% of the poor elderly are unaffected, while 37% are winners with no income loss. Among non-poor elderly, 96% are not affected, with 4% gaining income. None of the elderly poor are projected to lose income. Under Option #4, SSI federal benefit rates would be raised to the poverty line, benefiting 59% of the poor elderly with no income loss. Among the non-poor elderly, 96% are not affected, with 4% gaining income. SSI options are better targeted towards the elderly poor, creating more winners and no losers compared to Social Security options. The potential effects of Social Security reform on the elderly poor would likely consider criteria such as benefit levels, poverty rates, and targeting. Policymakers would also examine other factors when discussing policy changes to either Social Security or SSI. The Dynasim model does not provide cost estimates for policy changes to Social Security or SSI. One potential discussion point is the original purpose of the programs, with SSI targeting the elderly poor and Social Security aiming to replace lost earnings for workers of all income levels. Changing the Social Security benefit formula to help the elderly poor may be considered. Changing the Social Security benefit formula to assist the elderly poor may not efficiently target additional dollars and could complicate the balance between adequacy and equity in the program. Policy changes to SSI would likely impact fewer elderly poor individuals compared to changes in Social Security due to lower participation rates and strict eligibility criteria. Some individuals may not qualify for SSI even with liberalized programs, especially those with retirement savings in defined contribution plans. The prevailing political and fiscal environment poses challenges for Social Security and SSI, with limited changes in recent years. Social Security faces long-term solvency issues, while SSI's income disregards and asset tests have not been adjusted for inflation since the 1980s. Policymakers' decisions on addressing these solvency problems will impact future elderly poverty rates. This paper examines four policy options to reduce elderly poverty using the Dynasim microsimulation model. Projections are imprecise, especially further into the future. The analysis focuses on individuals aged 65 or older in 2042, including those not receiving Social Security or SSI benefits. The paper compares various options to reduce elderly poverty by analyzing the effects of policy changes in 2042, the year of projected trust fund insolvency for Social Security. The options are compared to a baseline scenario where benefits are cut to balance income and spending. Different solvency options could lead to different results in poverty rates. A 25% cut to Social Security benefits is projected for 2042 to balance the system's cash flow. The analysis focuses on this single year, with benefits rising with wages over time. Options in the report are assumed to be implemented in 2008. The analysis for 2042 focuses on a 25% cut to Social Security benefits, with options assumed to be implemented in 2008. Income calculations include Social Security benefits, SSI benefits, pension payments, earnings, and financial assets. The poverty thresholds in the U.S. are based on the Census Bureau's estimates of the amount of money needed to purchase essential goods and services. The thresholds are adjusted for inflation and vary based on family size and type. If a family's income falls below the poverty threshold for their family type, they are considered poor. This report uses official poverty thresholds based on family type and size, projected using assumptions about future inflation. Policy changes are assumed not to affect individuals' work patterns or benefit take-up age, but behavioral changes could occur. The model assumes two-thirds of SSI-eligible individuals take up benefits, with liberalized eligibility criteria potentially leading to increased uptake. The analysis assumes no changes in state policy due to federal policy changes in SSI, potentially impacting state supplements."
