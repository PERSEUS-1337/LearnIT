    "content": "In the Federalist Papers, James Madison emphasized the need for virtuous citizens in government. The Constitution grants each house of Congress the authority to set rules, judge membership qualifications, and discipline or expel Members. Article I, Section 5, clause 1 gives each house the power to judge its own Members' qualifications, while clause 2 allows them to establish rules, punish disorderly behavior, and expel Members with agreement. Congress has the authority to establish ethics rules, punish disorderly behavior, and expel Members with a two-thirds majority. In the past, ethics issues were handled informally based on prevailing norms of decency. However, events in the 1960s led to more formal investigations, such as the case of Representative Adam Clayton Powell's alleged misuse of committee funds. The report examines the history and evolution of the House Committee on Ethics, including its jurisdiction and investigative procedure. Prior to the creation of the House Committee on Standards of Official Conduct, no uniform mechanism existed for self-discipline in the House of Representatives. Congress had previously attempted to establish an ethical framework for House Members and employees with the first Code of Ethics for Government Service in 1958. The Code of Ethics for Government Service was proposed in 1951 after an investigation into Sherman Adams. It is recognized as ethical guidance in Congress but is not legally binding. Before the creation of the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct in 1967, investigations into wrongdoing were handled ad-hoc. Efforts were made to establish a more uniform system for investigating and disciplining Members and staff. In 1965, testimony on ethical conduct of Members led to calls for House and Senate codes of conduct, financial disclosure regulations, and a House Ethics Committee. Following allegations against Adam Clayton Powell, a Select Committee on Standards and Conduct was created in the House in 1966. The 12-member panel, appointed by the Speaker of the House, had two duties: recommending additional rules for proper conduct by Members and reporting violations to authorities. The report at the end of the 89th Congress included ethics-related recommendations, but the committee only existed from October to December 1966. The committee in the 89th Congress could not recommend changes in existing laws or new ones. Instead, they suggested continuing the committee in the 90th Congress, referring legislation on standards and conduct to the committee, and asking House members for input on statute changes. Over 100 resolutions were introduced in the 90th Congress to create a Committee on Standards of Official Conduct, with H.Res. 18 proposed by Representative Charles Bennett. During hearings in February and March 1967, the Committee on Rules considered creating a standards committee to address issues of impropriety by Members of Congress. Representative Bennett argued for the necessity of such a committee to improve the public image of Congress. A Gallup poll showed that 60% of respondents believed misuse of Government funds by Congressmen was common, highlighting the lack of faith in congressional integrity. A bipartisan 12-member standing committee, the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct, was established by the House through H.Res. 418 on April 13, 1967, to address the lack of faith in congressional integrity and make recommendations for enforcing standards of official conduct. The Committee on Standards of Official Conduct was established by the House through H.Res. 418 on April 13, 1967. The committee held its first hearings in the summer and fall of 1967 to establish standards of official conduct for Members, officers, and employees of the House. In March 1968, the committee recommended the creation of a Code of Official Conduct and financial disclosure rules. The Committee on Standards of Official Conduct established rules for Members, officers, and employees of the House, including disclosure rules and controls over committees using counterpart funds. Representative Melvin Price introduced a resolution to make the committee a permanent standing committee. Following the adoption of H.Res. 1119, debate on H.Res. 1099 proceeded. Representative Price discussed amending H.Res. 418 to make the Committee on Standards a permanent House committee. The resolution was amended and passed by a vote of 406 to 1, establishing the committee's jurisdiction, creating the House Code of Official Conduct, and implementing financial disclosure requirements for Members and officers. In the 112th Congress, the House renamed the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct to the Committee on Ethics and formalized its jurisdiction. The Ethics Committee has been authorized since 1968 to recommend actions for enforcing standards of conduct and investigate violations of the Code of Official Conduct. The Committee on Ethics enforces standards of conduct, investigates violations, recommends actions, reports violations to authorities, and issues advisory opinions. It has jurisdiction over the Code of Official Conduct and financial disclosure. Constraints imposed by H.Res. 1099 and subsequent amendments are still in effect. The Committee on Ethics enforces standards of conduct and investigates violations. House Rule XI, clause 3(a) outlines the procedures for issuing reports and conducting investigations related to official conduct. Members of the committee cannot participate in proceedings related to their own conduct. The Committee on Ethics enforces standards of conduct and investigates violations, with members not allowed to participate in proceedings related to their own conduct. H.Res. 1099 empowered the committee to hold hearings, receive testimony, and issue subpoenas for investigations. The House Parliamentarian is the definitive authority on committee jurisdiction, which has been amended multiple times to reflect changes in ethics enforcement. H.Res. 1031 was introduced to amend Rule XI regarding lobbying practices. H.Res. 1031 amends Rule XI of the House regarding lobbying practices and campaign contributions. The resolution gives the Committee on Ethics jurisdiction over lobbying activities and campaign funds, removing authority from other committees. In previous Congresses, jurisdiction over campaign contributions was transferred to the Committee on House Administration, lobbying to the Committee on the Judiciary, and financial disclosure to another committee. The House adopted H.Res. 287 on March 2, 1977, transferring jurisdiction over financial disclosure to the Committee on Rules. This resolution included new rules on public financial disclosure, limits on income and gifts, and restrictions on franking privileges and foreign travel. The Committee on Ethics was authorized to oversee these areas and maintain public financial disclosure reports. Additionally, a Select Committee on Ethics was established to assist with implementing the new rules. On July 14, 1977, the House established the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence and authorized the Committee on Ethics to investigate unauthorized disclosures of intelligence information. The Committee on Ethics was designated as the \"employing agency\" for the House and was authorized to issue regulations on gifts from foreign governments. The Ethics in Government Act introduced public financial disclosure requirements, and the House rules for the 96th Congress further solidified these regulations. The House rules for the 96th Congress replaced the House financial disclosure rule with the Ethics Act, delegating review responsibilities to the Committee on Ethics. The STOCK Act was passed in 2012 to prevent insider trading by Members of Congress and congressional employees. The House Committee on Ethics is required to provide interpretive guidance on rules regarding conflicts of interest and gifts. The STOCK Act prohibits Members of Congress and congressional employees from using nonpublic information for personal gain. The Ethics Reform Act of 1989 expanded ethics regulations for government branches. The committee issued guidelines on reporting requirements, penalties for noncompliance, and assistance available. The Committee on Ethics was given expanded jurisdiction by the Ethics Reform Act of 1989, enforcing bans on honoraria, limits on outside income, and gift restrictions. Procedures for the committee are outlined in House Rule XI, clause 3, with changes made over different time periods. The Committee on Ethics underwent changes in various Congresses, including the creation of the Office of Congressional Ethics in 2008. Significant adjustments were made to procedural operations during the early years of the committee. Three key changes from the 1970s remain in effect, including amendments to House Rules allowing majority vote approval of committee reports and the ability for a member to disqualify themselves from investigations. In the 96th Congress, House rules were amended to prohibit the public disclosure of information or testimony without full committee authorization. The Ethics Reform Act of 1989 mandated changes to the House Committee on Ethics, establishing the Office of Advice and Education to provide guidance on laws and standards of conduct. The Office of Advice and Education in the House provides guidance on laws, rules, regulations, and standards of conduct for Members, officers, and employees. It offers training, recommendations, and educational briefings on these matters. The House Ethics Committee provides recommendations on standards of conduct for Members, officers, and employees. Changes from the 1989 act, such as bifurcation of investigative and adjudicative functions, reporting to the House on cases, and limitations on investigations, are still in effect. Members under investigation can have one counsel present on the House floor, and there is a time limit for committee actions. The House Ethics Committee underwent changes in 1989, including the addition of one counsel for Members under investigation and a time limit on committee service. The committee's membership size fluctuated, with amendments in 1997 reducing it from 14 to 10 members. In 1997, an Ethics Reform Task Force was established to review the ethics process, chaired by Representatives Bob Livingston and Ben Cardin. The Ethics Reform Task Force, chaired by Representatives Bob Livingston and Ben Cardin, was established in 1997 to review and recommend reforms to the House ethics process. After seven months of study, the Task Force made several recommendations to ensure non-partisan operation of the Committee on Standards, confidentiality of its workings, an improved system for filing complaints, an efficient administrative structure, and due process for Members, officers, and employees of the House. The House debated and agreed to H.Res. 230, a rule for the consideration of H.Res. 168, implementing the Ethics Reform Task Force's recommendations. Changes included requiring non-Members to have a Member certify complaints, reducing the Ethics Committee size, and establishing a pool of potential appointees. The House agreed to H.Res. 230, implementing the Ethics Reform Task Force's recommendations. Changes included reducing the Ethics Committee size, establishing a pool of potential appointees, and setting guidelines for investigating complaints. The House made changes to the Committee on Ethics rules for the 109th Congress, including procedures for handling allegations and due process for respondents and witnesses. These changes were later reversed in April 2005 and reinstated to the form of the 108th Congress. On June 5, 2007, the House agreed to H.Res. 451 directing the Committee on Ethics to review allegations against Members of the House of Representatives within 30 days of indictment or charges being filed. This resolution was adopted after a Member was indicted in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia. The rules packages for the 111th and 112th Congresses continued the requirements of H.Res. 451. In the 113th Congress, the House amended the Code of Conduct to replace references to \"spouses\" with \"relative\" in Rule XXIII, clause 8(c). In the 113th Congress, the House amended the Code of Conduct to replace references to \"spouses\" with \"relative\" in Rule XXIII, clause 8(c). Additionally, H.Res. 5 required that copies of executed oaths made by an officer or employee of the House be retained by the Sergeant at Arms, while oaths made by Members, Delegates, or the Resident Commissioner continue to be retained by the Clerk of the House. The House amended Rule XI, clause 3 to ensure the House Ethics Committee cannot deny any rights under the Constitution. New officers, employees, Members, Delegates, and the Resident Commissioner must undergo ethics training within 60 days. Rule II, clause 3 was amended to allow fines for using electronic devices to record floor proceedings. The House amended Rule XI to require all Members, Delegates, and the Resident Commissioner to attend annual ethics training and certify completion. Fines can be imposed for using electronic devices to record floor proceedings, with a 30-day appeal process to the Committee on Ethics. The 116th Congress authorized the Committee on Ethics to consider trial transcripts and exhibits for members convicted of crimes. They also directed the Committee to empanel an investigative subcommittee for allegations of criminal conduct. The Office of Congressional Ethics (OCE) was created in 2008 to review information and refer findings to the House Committee on Ethics. The OCE can accept information on alleged wrongdoing from the public, but only the OCE board can initiate a review. The Office of Congressional Ethics (OCE) was reauthorized by the House as part of the rules package adopted by the 116th Congress on January 3, 2019. Since its inception in the 90th Congress, the Committee on Ethics has had a total of 303 members."
