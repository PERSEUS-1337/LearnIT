The findings by Congress highlight the high rates of serious mental illness, suicide, homelessness, incarceration, alcohol and drug abuse, stress, and trauma among American Indians and Alaska Natives. These groups face disparities in healthcare compared to Whites. American Indians and Alaska Natives face disparities in healthcare compared to Whites, with worse care in 28 measures of health quality and access. Per capita spending on personal health care for these groups was $2,741 in 2012, significantly below the national average. A shortage of psychiatrists at Indian Health Service and tribal health facilities limits mental health access for American Indians and Alaska Natives. Only 20 psychiatrists currently practice in Indian country out of approximately 60,000 nationwide. According to the American Psychiatric Association, psychiatrists in Indian country face cultural competency challenges, professional isolation, high demand for services, low compensation, and high burnout rates. A legislative initiative is needed to create a workforce model for recruiting, training, and supporting Native American and non-Native American psychiatrists in these communities.

The Program aims to integrate American and non-Native American psychiatric physicians into Indian health programs, recruit those interested in providing specialty and primary care services to Native Americans, provide them with cultural competency training, and support their deployment. The Program aims to deploy trained psychiatric physicians to practice specialty or primary care in Indian health programs for at least 2 years and provide professional support during this period. Additionally, a report must be submitted to Congress within 1 year after the grant period ends, detailing the workforce model created and strategies for disseminating it to other entities.
