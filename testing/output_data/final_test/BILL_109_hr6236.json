    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Medicare Long-Term Care Hospital Improvement Act of 2006\". It includes findings related to long-term care hospitals. Congress finds that long-term care hospitals (LTCHs) play a valuable role in post-acute care by providing care to medically complex patients requiring long hospital stays. The Medicare program should ensure patients receive post-acute care in the most appropriate setting, with additional certification criteria for LTCHs to promote appropriate patient placement. Certain long-term care diagnosis related groups (LTC-DRGs) are associated with higher severity of illness levels, guiding appropriate patient placement. The curr_chunk discusses the importance of measuring and reporting on quality of care in LTCHs, proposing a national quality initiative similar to short-term acute care hospitals. It also suggests aligning the prospective payment system for LTCHs with that of short-term hospitals to promote payment stability. This includes annual market basket updates, LTC-DRG reweighting, and wage level adjustments in a budget-neutral manner. The curr_chunk discusses adjustments in a budget neutral manner each year, avoiding one-time budget neutrality adjustments and not extending the 25 percent limitation on reimbursement for co-located hospital patient admissions to freestanding LTCHs. The curr_chunk introduces a new definition of a Long-Term Care Hospital with specific facility and patient criteria. The curr_chunk defines a long-term care hospital as an institution primarily providing inpatient care to medically complex patients with long hospital stays, meeting specific criteria including patient review processes and facility requirements. The institution must regularly evaluate patients, assess discharge options, and use a standard patient assessment tool to measure severity of illness and service requirements for making medical necessity determinations. The institution must have active physician involvement with patients, interdisciplinary team treatment, and maintain minimum staffing levels as required by sections 1814(a)(3) and 1835(a)(2)(B). The institution must maintain minimum staffing levels of licensed health care professionals to ensure intensive care for medically complex patients in long-term care hospitals. Patient criteria for prospective payment to long-term care hospitals are based on patient mix and severity appropriate for medically complex cases. To be eligible for prospective payment as a long-term care hospital, hospitals must discharge a certain percentage of patients entitled to benefits under part A with specified medical conditions. The Secretary determines LTC-DRGs associated with high severity of illness for circulatory, digestive, endocrine, metabolic, and infectious diseases. The Secretary determines high severity medical conditions for long-term care hospitals, including infectious, neurological, renal, respiratory, and skin conditions. If the patient classification system changes, new categories must maintain the same proportion of Medicare discharges. The Secretary determines high severity medical conditions for long-term care hospitals, including infectious, neurological, renal, respiratory, and skin conditions. Medicare discharges from LTC-DRGs must be 50-75% in a cost reporting year, with a three-year transition period. The transition period for long-term care hospitals certified before October 1, 2007, requires a minimum of 50 percent of cases in the first year. Noncompliance results in a demonstration period to meet the required proportion of cases. The Secretary will develop regulations for LTCH facility and patient criteria through a negotiated rulemaking process. The amendments will be effective for discharges on or after October 1, 2007. LTCH Quality Improvement Initiative. The Secretary will conduct a study to establish quality measures for Medicare patients in LTCHs, choose 3 measures to be reported by LTCHs, and require data submission. Failure to submit data may result in a reduction in reimbursement. The Secretary may expand quality indicators for LTCHs, with consensus among affected parties. Data submitted under this section will be made available to the public. The LTCH PPS updates will be aligned with the Inpatient PPS. The LTCH PPS updates will align with the Inpatient PPS, requiring annual updates of base rates, wage indices, and reweighting of LTC-DRGs in a budget-neutral manner. The Secretary will provide annual updates to the LTCH base rate as specified for the IPPS. The Secretary will annually update and reweight the LTC-DRGs and wage levels for LTCHs in a budget-neutral manner, consistent with the Social Security Act. One-time budget neutrality adjustments to LTCH PPS rates will be eliminated. The Secretary will not apply the 25 percent patient threshold payment adjustment to freestanding LTCHs during the transition period from cost-based payment to the prospective payment system."
