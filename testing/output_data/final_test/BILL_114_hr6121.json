    "content": "The Act titled \"Climate Resiliency, Security, and Source Water Protection Act\" amends Section 1433 of the Safe Drinking Water Act to focus on climate resiliency, security, and source water protection. Each community water system must submit source water and distribution system vulnerability assessments within 24 months of the Climate Resiliency, Security, and Source Water Protection Act's enactment. The assessments should identify threats from industrial activity, pipelines, storage tanks, contaminated sites, agricultural activity, oil and gas exploration, climate change, extreme weather, drought, and temperature. The assessments submitted by community water systems must include a comparison of disinfection methods used and available alternatives to reduce vulnerability to identified threats, including intentional acts of contamination, sabotage, and theft of designated chemicals. The Climate Resiliency, Security, and Source Water Protection Act requires community water systems to periodically review and resubmit vulnerability assessments every 5 years. The Administrator will provide guidance for preparing these assessments. Additionally, each system must submit source water and distribution system protection plans within 4 years of the Act's enactment. Each community water system must submit source water and distribution system protection plans, including strategies to mitigate identified threats and specific emergency response plans. Plans must be reviewed, revised, and resubmitted every 5 years. Guidance will be provided by the Administrator within one year of the Act's enactment. The Administrator will provide guidance to community water systems for preparing plans under the Climate Resiliency, Security, and Source Water Protection Act. Additionally, the Drinking Water Infrastructure Resiliency and Sustainability Program will offer grants to increase the resiliency of community water systems to identified threats. The grant funds provided to community water systems must be used exclusively for planning, designing, constructing, implementing, operating, or maintaining programs or projects in line with a developed plan. Priority will be given to systems facing the greatest and most immediate risks of significant negative impacts from threats outlined in the Act. The Administrator will prioritize innovative approaches that promote efficient water use, conservation, and recycling, as well as decentralized technologies that mimic natural hydrological cycles or protect natural flows. The Administrator prioritizes innovative approaches for efficient water use, conservation, and recycling. This includes reducing stormwater runoff, enhancing ecosystem functions, upgrading water system infrastructure, improving water quality for agricultural and municipal uses, and providing multiple benefits like water supply enhancement and flood protection. The Administrator awards grants to community water systems for activities like improvement, flood protection, and ecosystem enhancement. The federal share of the cost for these activities cannot exceed 50%, and in-kind services can be included in the non-federal share calculation. The Climate Resiliency, Security, and Source Water Protection Act requires the Administrator to award grants to community water systems for various activities, with the federal share not exceeding 50%. In-kind services can be included in the non-federal share calculation. The Administrator must report to Congress every 3 years on the progress of implementing this subsection, and $50,000,000 is authorized for appropriations to carry out these activities. Authorized appropriations of $50,000,000 for fiscal years 2017 through 2021."
