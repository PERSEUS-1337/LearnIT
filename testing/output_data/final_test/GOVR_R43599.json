    "content": "The number of unaccompanied alien children (UAC) apprehended at the Southwest border peaked at 68,541 in FY2014, leading to concerns of a humanitarian crisis. Reasons for their migration include economic conditions, violence, and U.S. immigration policies. The increase in UAC flows is attributed to a perception of relaxed immigration policies towards children. Critics attribute the increase in unaccompanied alien children (UAC) apprehensions in recent years to perceived relaxed U.S. immigration policies under the Obama Administration. They also point to a 2008 law that treats UAC from contiguous countries differently. UAC are defined as children under 18 without lawful immigration status and lacking a parent or legal guardian in the U.S. Most arrive at ports of entry or are apprehended along the southwestern border. Apprehensions of UAC under 13 have increased, with most being 14 or older. The report discusses the increase in apprehensions of unaccompanied alien children (UAC) under age 13. UAC apprehensions have risen each year through FY2014, with a peak of 68,541 in that year. Apprehensions dropped to 39,970 in FY2015 and increased to 59,692 in FY2016. During the first two months of FY2017, USBP apprehended 14,128 unaccompanied alien children, with majority coming from Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, and Mexico. Flows of UAC from Mexico have fluctuated between 11,000 and 17,000 since FY2009, while UAC from Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador increased notably starting in FY2011. In FY2016, Mexican UAC accounted for 23% of apprehensions, while UAC from Central American countries made up 75%. The majority of UAC apprehensions occurred in the Rio Grande and Tucson border sectors. The proportion of female UAC and those under 13 years old increased in recent years. Family unit apprehensions increased from 14,855 in FY2013 to 77,674 in FY2016, with 95% originating from Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras. In FY2016 and FY2017, 95% of family units originated from Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras. The Flores Settlement Agreement of 1997, the Homeland Security Act of 2002, and the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008 directly impact U.S. policy for UAC. Allegations of mistreatment by the former INS in the 1980s led to lawsuits and the Flores Agreement in 1997, which established guidelines for the detention and treatment of UAC. The Flores Agreement of 1997 established guidelines for the detention and treatment of unaccompanied minors, including provisions for food, medical assistance, supervision, and separation from unrelated adults. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 divided responsibilities for UAC between the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Health and Human Services' Office of Refugee Resettlement. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 divided responsibilities for unaccompanied minors between DHS and HHS. The Act established a definition for unaccompanied minors and required the publication of legal services available to them. Despite criticism of the Flores Agreement, the TVPRA of 2008 directed DHS to develop policies for the safe repatriation of unaccompanied minors. The TVPRA of 2008 mandated the safe repatriation of unaccompanied alien children to their country of nationality or last habitual residence. Special rules were set for UAC from contiguous countries like Mexico and Canada, allowing them to return without penalties. Children from other countries are transferred to HHS for removal proceedings. DHS agencies handle apprehension, processing, and repatriation of UAC. Several DHS agencies handle the apprehension, processing, and repatriation of UAC, while HHS is responsible for their care and custody. CBP apprehends and detains most UAC along U.S. borders, with ICE transporting them to ORR custody. ORR detains and shelters UAC from noncontiguous countries and victims of trafficking or asylum claimants from contiguous countries. USCIS adjudicates asylum applications, while EOIR conducts immigration proceedings to determine UAC's status in the U.S. ICE may deport UAC if necessary. UAC may be allowed to stay in the US or deported to their home countries. ICE handles the deportation of UAC ordered to leave. Border Patrol and Field Operations are responsible for apprehending and processing UAC at ports of entry or near the border. CBP confirms UAC status, notifies consulates, and detains them. Border Patrol apprehends most UAC at the border. The Border Patrol detains UAC and turns them over to ICE for transport to ORR within 72 hours. Mexican UAC were previously returned to Mexico within 24 hours. The TVPRA required policies for safe repatriation of UAC. The TVPRA mandates CBP to screen UAC from contiguous countries within 48 hours to ensure they are not trafficking victims, have no credible risk upon return, do not qualify for asylum, and can voluntarily return. If deemed inadmissible, minors can withdraw their admission application and return voluntarily. The TVPRA mandates specific safeguards for the treatment of UAC in CBP custody and requires agreements with contiguous countries for repatriation. These agreements aim to protect children from trafficking and include provisions for handoff to government officials, restrictions on return times, and training for border personnel. UAC apprehended by Border Patrol are processed at Border Patrol facilities according to guidelines outlined in a 2008 memorandum. NGOs criticize Border Patrol for not fully upholding provisions in current law and the Flores Agreement. DHS OIG report in 2010 found CBP in general compliance with Flores Agreement but needing improvement in handling UAC. TVPRA requires CBP to screen UAC for trafficking and persecution fears, but NGOs report CBP does not adequately do this or provide related training for agents. ICE is responsible for transferring unaccompanied alien children (UAC) from CBP to ORR custody and may apprehend UAC in the U.S. interior during immigration enforcement actions. They represent the government in removal procedures before EOIR. UAC not subject to TVPRA's special repatriation procedures may be placed in standard removal proceedings. ICE is also responsible for physically removing all foreign nationals, including UAC with final removal orders or voluntary departure. ICE has established policies for repatriating UAC to safeguard their welfare. ICE has policies for repatriating UAC, ensuring their welfare by returning them during daylight hours, recording transfers, providing communication with consular officials, and preserving family unity during removal. The U.S. notifies the home country of every foreign national being removed, but the process depends on securing travel documents and the willingness of foreign governments to accept their nationals. Each country sets its own requirements for repatriation. ICE has policies for repatriating UAC, ensuring their welfare by returning them during daylight hours, recording transfers, providing communication with consular officials, and preserving family unity during removal. The process of obtaining travel documents for repatriation can be problematic due to changing requirements by foreign countries. ICE arranges transport for UAC, with Mexican UAC repatriated according to Local Repatriation Agreements. The Unaccompanied Alien Children Program in ORR/HHS provides for custody. The Unaccompanied Alien Children Program in ORR/HHS provides custody and care for minors apprehended by ICE or CBP. The program ensures placement in the least restrictive setting in the child's best interest, appoints legal counsel, screens for trafficking, and oversees residential facilities. The Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) provides care for unaccompanied children based on their nationality, possible asylum claims, and reunification with family. ORR-funded care providers offer education, health services, and shelter options including nonsecure, secure, and transitional foster care facilities. Secure facilities are only used for children involved in criminal activities or safety concerns. The Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) provides care for unaccompanied children based on their nationality, possible asylum claims, and reunification with family. ORR-funded care providers facilitate the release of UAC to family members or sponsors. The Flores Agreement outlines preference ranking for sponsor types, and ORR conducts background investigations to ensure the safety of the child. The Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) conducts background checks on sponsors to ensure child safety and may require a home study if abuse or trafficking is suspected. Parents must complete a reunification packet to take responsibility for the child. Data shows a correlation between UAC apprehensions and referrals to ORR, with an increase in referrals as children from non-contiguous countries dominate apprehensions. In FY2016, 80% of all UAC apprehensions were from certain countries, with 99% of them referred to ORR. The average stay in ORR care was 61 days between FY2008 and FY2010, with some children spending up to 710 days in custody. ORR aims to reunify most children with family members, but removal proceedings continue even after placement. The increase in UAC referrals since FY2008 has strained ORR's capacity to meet demand while upholding child welfare standards. In January 2016, a Senate investigation revealed serious deficiencies in the safe placement of Unaccompanied Alien Children (UAC) with distant relatives and unrelated adults, leading to some children being forced to work in oppressive conditions on an Ohio farm. HHS officials acknowledged limitations in their screening and post-placement follow-up procedures for sponsors during a Senate Homeland Security Committee hearing. USCIS is responsible for the initial placement of UAC. USCIS is responsible for adjudicating asylum applications filed by Unaccompanied Alien Children (UAC), even if the child is transferred to ORR custody or has pending claims in immigration court. UAC must attend immigration court hearings, as EOIR handles immigration cases and removal proceedings. The Department of Justice oversees immigration cases and removal proceedings. The TVPRA mandates legal counsel for Unaccompanied Alien Children (UAC) and allows for the appointment of child advocates. EOIR has specific policies to ensure UAC understand proceedings and receive appropriate assistance. The policy guidelines prioritize unaccompanied children in immigration proceedings, recommending special dockets, child-friendly courtroom modifications, courtroom orientations, preparation for testimony, child-sensitive questioning, and encouraging pro bono legal representation. EOIR issued new guidelines in response to the UAC surge on July 9, 2014. The EOIR issued new guidelines prioritizing unaccompanied children and non-detained families in immigration courts. A new case recording system was implemented to track legal outcomes of UAC more accurately. From July 2014 to June 2016, out of 69,540 UAC given Notices to Appear, 55,793 had hearings scheduled. Of the completed cases, 12,977 resulted in removal orders, with 89% issued in absentia. Out of the completed cases for unaccompanied children, outcomes varied based on legal representation. 88.2% without representation were ordered removed, while only 13.4% with representation faced removal. Cases without removal orders were often administratively closed or terminated, with a small percentage receiving immigration relief such as asylum or special immigrant juvenile status. The Obama Administration and Congress responded to the surge of unaccompanied children by developing a working group, opening additional shelters, addressing root causes of child migration, and requesting funding from Congress. In June 2014, a Unified Coordination Group was announced to coordinate efforts among key agencies. The Obama Administration and Congress responded to the surge of unaccompanied children by forming a Unified Coordination Group led by the FEMA Administrator, Craig Fugate. The group coordinated federal response efforts to provide humanitarian relief, including housing, care, medical treatment, and transportation for affected children. CBP maintained border security operations, while DHS worked with ICE to care for unaccompanied children in temporary custody. DHS also collaborated with other agencies to ensure a prompt and coordinated response in the short term and to address root causes of child migration in the longer term. In response to the surge of unaccompanied children, the Obama Administration and Congress formed a Unified Coordination Group to provide humanitarian relief. DHS initiated a program with Central American countries to dissuade children from migrating illegally. ORR used group homes operated by nonprofit organizations to manage the influx of children. HHS coordinated with DOD for temporary housing facilities. CNCS partnered with EOIR to address the legal needs of children in the immigration court system. The Obama Administration and Congress formed a Unified Coordination Group to provide humanitarian relief for unaccompanied children. CNCS partnered with EOIR to create \"Justice AmeriCorps,\" enrolling lawyers and paralegals to provide legal representation during removal proceedings. DOJ's Office of Legal Access Programs established the Legal Orientation Program for Custodians of Unaccompanied Children (LOPC) to improve appearance rates at immigration court hearings and protect children from mistreatment. The Obama Administration collaborated with Central American governments to address gang violence, citizen security, economic development, and migrant reintegration. Congressional focus shifted from funding for agencies responding to the UAC crisis to preventing future surges. Initially, no funding increases were requested in the FY2015 budget, but updated cost projections were later provided by the Office of Management and Budget. The Office of Management and Budget updated cost projections for addressing the UAC population, requesting $2.28 billion for ORR's UAC program and $166 million for DHS for CBP overtime, contract services, and transportation costs. The Administration requested a $3.7 billion supplemental appropriation, with significant funding allocated to CBP, ICE, HHS, DOJ, and DOS. Senator Mikulski introduced the Emergency Supplemental Act, 2014 (S. 2648) to provide additional funding for HHS, CBP, and CBP's air and marine operations. In December 2014, the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015 (P.L. 113-235) provided nearly $1.6 billion for ORR's Refugee and Entrant Assistance Programs for FY2015, with most funds directed towards the UAC program. Additionally, the Act allowed HHS to augment appropriations for the Refugee and Entrant Assistance account by up to 10% through transfers from other discretionary HHS funds. In March 2015, the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2015 (P.L. 114-4) provided $3.4 billion to ICE for detection, enforcement, and removal operations, including $23.7 million for the transport of unaccompanied children for CBP. The act required DHS to estimate FY2015 UAC apprehensions and necessary agent hours/costs, with budgetary flexibility through fund reprogramming. The Obama Administration's FY2016 budget requested $948 million for base funding and $19 million for contingency funding for ORR's Unaccompanied Children Program. Congress approved base funding but no contingency funds. For FY2016 DHS funding, the Administration requested $203.2 million in base funding and $24.4 million in contingency funding for CBP for costs associated with the apprehension and care of unaccompanied children. Congress provided CBP with $204.9 million in base funding but not the contingency funding requested. For ICE, the Administration requested $2.6 million in contingency funding for transportation costs associated with UAC apprehensions, which Congress partially funded with $24.3 million for UAC transportation. For FY2017, the Administration requested $1,321 million for unaccompanied children within the Refugee and Entrant Assistance budget. This included $1,226 million in base funding and contingency funding of up to $400 million for larger caseloads. Congress passed two continuing resolutions to fund ORR for FY2017. The Administration requested higher funding for the Refugee and Entrant Assistance account in FY2017 due to increased caseloads of unaccompanied children from Central American countries. HHS had the authority to transfer $167 million into the account to address the surge in UAC caseloads. The Administration requested increased funding for the Refugee and Entrant Assistance account in FY2017 to address the rise in caseloads of unaccompanied children from Central American countries. Congress passed a second FY2017 CR, which generally maintains funding for ORR programs at the same level as FY2016, with a slight reduction. Additional transfer authority was granted to HHS to address higher than anticipated costs. The CR authorizes HHS to transfer $300 million to fund ORR programs for unaccompanied children as of February 1, 2017. If the UAC caseload for FY2017 exceeds by 40% or more the caseload for the same period in FY2016, an additional $200 million in new funding would be appropriated. In response to the UAC surge in 2014, initiatives were announced to unify federal agency efforts and address the situation with programs for unaccompanied children from Central American countries. Congress increased funding for HHS programs for unaccompanied children and allowed the Secretary of DHS to transfer funds from specific CBP and ICE accounts. Since FY2014, the Administration has requested additional funding for programs for unaccompanied children, with Congress appropriating for some but not all requests. Apprehensions of unaccompanied children rose between FY2011 and FY2014 before declining in FY2015. However, apprehensions increased in FY2016 and early FY2017, indicating a continued flow of unaccompanied children to the United States. The ultimate number of unaccompanied children qualifying for asylum or other relief in the U.S. remains uncertain, with many having family members in the country. Many unaccompanied children in the United States have family members who may not be legally present, posing policy challenges regarding the \"best interests of the child\" versus immigration laws."
