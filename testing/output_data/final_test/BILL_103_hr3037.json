    "content": "The \"Law Enforcement Officers Death Penalty Act of 1993\" establishes the death penalty for killing federal law enforcement officers. It amends Section 1114 of title 18, United States Code, to include the penalty of death for first-degree murder of a federal law enforcement officer. Additionally, it states that killing a state or local law enforcement officer while assisting a federal officer will result in the same punishment. SEC. 3. DEATH PENALTY PROCEDURES. Title 18 of the United States Code is amended to include CHAPTER 228--DEATH PENALTY PROCEDURES. Title 18 of the United States Code is amended to include CHAPTER 228--DEATH PENALTY PROCEDURES. A defendant who commits an offense for which the death penalty may be imposed shall be sentenced to death if it is determined that imposition of a sentence of death is justified after considering specific factors. No person under 18 years of age at the time of the offense may be sentenced to death. Sec. 3592 outlines factors to be considered in determining if a death sentence is justified, including mental capacity, duress, and minor participation in the offense. The jury or court must assess these mitigating factors before imposing a death sentence on a defendant. The jury or court must consider mitigating factors such as mental capacity, duress, and minor participation in the offense. Aggravating factors for justifying a death sentence include previous convictions for offenses resulting in death or serious offenses punishable by imprisonment. The aggravating factors for justifying a death sentence include offenses involving controlled substances, serious bodily injury, grave risk of death to additional persons, heinous manner of commission, procurement of the offense by payment, and commission of the offense for payment. The aggravating factors for justifying a death sentence include substantial planning and premeditation, vulnerability of the victim, and consideration for receiving pecuniary value. A special hearing is held to determine if a sentence of death is justified in cases involving certain offenses. The Government must provide a notice to the court and defendant stating the belief that a death sentence is justified for the offense, along with the aggravating factors to prove this. The court may allow amendments to the notice with good cause shown. A hearing before a court or jury is held based on this notice. After the Government files a notice for a death penalty, a separate sentencing hearing is conducted by the judge who presided over the trial or another judge. No presentence report is prepared before the hearing, which can be held before the jury that determined guilt or a new jury if the defendant pleaded guilty or was convicted without a jury. The sentencing hearing can be conducted before the court without a jury, with a discharged jury for good cause, or upon motion of the defendant with the approval of the Government. A jury of 12 members may be impaneled unless parties agree on a lesser number. Mitigating and aggravating factors relevant to the sentence can be presented at the hearing. Information relevant to mitigating or aggravating factors can be presented at the sentencing hearing, including trial transcripts and exhibits. Both the Government's attorney and the defendant's attorney can present relevant information, regardless of its admissibility, with the opportunity to rebut any information presented. The attorney for both sides can also argue the adequacy of the information to establish the existence of any mitigating or aggravating factors. At the sentencing hearing, the Government's attorney opens the argument, followed by the defendant's reply. The Government then has a chance to reply in rebuttal. The burden of proof for aggravating factors lies with the Government, requiring proof beyond a reasonable doubt. The burden of proof for mitigating factors lies with the defendant, requiring proof by a preponderance of the information. The jury or court must consider all information presented and return special findings on mitigating and aggravating factors. At the sentencing hearing, the jury or court must consider mitigating and aggravating factors based on the information presented. The jury must unanimously agree on the existence of mitigating or aggravating factors, while a specific factor can be determined by a majority of at least nine members. If an aggravating factor is found to exist, the jury or court will then consider whether a sentence of death is warranted. The jury or court must weigh aggravating factors against mitigating factors to determine if a death sentence is justified. The decision must be unanimous, and the jury is not required to impose a death sentence. Special instructions are given to the jury to prevent discrimination in their decision-making process. Upon a finding that a death sentence is justified, the court shall impose the sentence. The jury must certify that race, color, national origin, creed, or sex did not influence their decision. Review of the death sentence is also conducted. The process of reviewing a death sentence involves an appeal to the court of appeals by the defendant, where the entire case record is examined, including trial evidence, sentencing information, and procedural details. The court of appeals must determine the validity of the sentence based on these factors. The court of appeals will affirm a death sentence if not influenced by arbitrary factors and supported by aggravating factors, otherwise, the case will be remanded for reconsideration or imposition of another sentence. The court must provide written reasons for its decision. \"A person sentenced to death will be under the custody of the Attorney General until all appeals and reviews are exhausted. The implementation of the sentence will be supervised by a U.S. marshal according to the laws of the State where the sentence was imposed. If that State does not allow for the death penalty, another State will be designated for implementation. Death penalty cannot be carried out on individuals lacking mental capacity or pregnant women.\" \"A U.S. marshal overseeing a death sentence can utilize State facilities and officials, paying approved costs. Title 18, United States Code, is amended to include this provision.\" \"Title 18, United States Code, is amended to allow U.S. marshals to use State facilities and officials for death penalty procedures, covering approved costs.\""
