    "content": "On July 30, 2014, the House of Representatives passed H.Res. 676 authorizing a civil lawsuit against the President and executive branch officials for not fulfilling their duties under the Constitution. Speaker John Boehner aimed to compel the President to uphold his oath of office and enforce laws like the ACA. The lawsuit was filed against the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of the Treasury on November 21, 2014. Disputes between Congress and the executive branch regarding federal law implementation are common, with rare civil litigation. The House of Representatives has filed lawsuits against the executive branch at least four times in the past 41 years, seeking judicial enforcement of congressional subpoenas. The fifth lawsuit, House of Representatives v. Burwell, aims to halt a Census Bureau plan to use statistical sampling in the 2000 census. House of Representatives v. Burwell is the fifth lawsuit between Congress and the executive branch over federal law implementation, with disputes usually resolved outside of court. Commentators debate whether federal courts should intervene to prevent executive overreach and allow Congress to challenge actions that may not cause traditional injuries. The House of Representatives lawsuit questions whether Congress has standing to sue the executive branch over law execution. H.Res. 676 authorizes the Speaker to file civil actions seeking relief for executive branch failures to act. Concerns arise about the judiciary's role in resolving disputes between political branches. The House of Representatives authorized civil actions to challenge executive branch failures to implement provisions of the Affordable Care Act. The House hired outside counsel Jonathan Turley for this lawsuit filed in November 2014. The House of Representatives hired Jonathan Turley as outside counsel for a lawsuit filed in November 2014, titled U.S. House of Representatives v. Burwell. The lawsuit challenged the appropriation of funds for cost-sharing subsidies and the delay in enforcing the employer mandate under the Affordable Care Act. The complaint alleged that funds were expended without congressional appropriation, in violation of constitutional and statutory provisions related to premium credits and cost-sharing subsidies. The House of Representatives filed a lawsuit challenging the appropriation of funds for cost-sharing subsidies under the Affordable Care Act. The complaint alleged that funds were spent without congressional approval, in violation of constitutional and statutory provisions. Treasury Department began making payments for cost-sharing subsidies from a permanent appropriation in January 2014. Payments were estimated to be $3.978 billion for Fiscal Year 2014. The House of Representatives challenged the appropriation of funds for cost-sharing subsidies under the Affordable Care Act, arguing that the Treasury Department made payments without congressional approval, violating constitutional provisions. The House maintained that the permanent appropriation for premium credits could not be used for cost-sharing subsidies, leading to a lawsuit alleging violations of the U.S. Constitution. The House challenged the appropriation of funds for cost-sharing subsidies under the Affordable Care Act, arguing that payments were made without congressional approval. The House also raised concerns about the implementation of the employer mandate, which imposes penalties on certain employers for not offering health coverage to full-time employees. The IRS announced a delay in enforcing these penalties until 2015. The House contested the IRS's delay in enforcing penalties for the employer mandate under the Affordable Care Act, arguing that it was equivalent to rewriting the statute without authority. The House alleged that this action violated constitutional provisions by granting the agency legislative powers not explicitly provided in the ACA. The issue of standing in legal cases revolves around whether a plaintiff has the right to bring a case before the court, based on constitutional requirements and prudential considerations. Article III of the Constitution limits federal judicial power to \"cases\" and \"controversies,\" emphasizing the separation of powers. The standing inquiry is particularly strict to uphold this principle. The Supreme Court imposes three required elements to satisfy constitutional standing requirements in Article III: alleging a personal injury-in-fact, tracing the injury to the defendant's conduct, and showing likelihood of redress. Prudential principles also play a role in standing inquiries, reflecting concerns about the proper role of the courts. Prudential standing requirements are judicially created and can be modified by Congress. They mandate that the plaintiff assert their own legal rights, fall within the protected zone of interests, and not raise abstract public grievances. Standing for congressional plaintiffs typically focuses on challenging executive or legislative actions and centers on the injury prong. The case law on congressional plaintiffs focuses on the injury prong of standing. It can be categorized into individual Member suits and suits by congressional institutions. Raines v. Byrd settled individual Member suits, but suits by congressional institutions are rare. Burwell is the first suit to examine congressional institutional plaintiff standing unrelated to information access. In 1997, Raines v. Byrd challenged the Line Item Veto Act of 1996. In Raines v. Byrd, the Supreme Court addressed the constitutionality of the Line Item Veto Act of 1996 and whether individual Members of Congress have standing to sue the executive branch for injuries to Congress's legislative power. The Court established criteria for individual Members to have standing in such suits, based on personal injury allegations. This guidance is relevant for understanding judicial involvement in disputes between the legislative and executive branches. The Supreme Court in Raines v. Byrd established criteria for individual Members of Congress to have standing to sue the executive branch for injuries to Congress's legislative power. Standing can be based on personal injury or institutional injury, which is not abstract and amounts to vote nullification. The Court described institutional injury as a claim brought solely because the plaintiffs are Members of Congress. The Raines Court established criteria for Members of Congress to have standing to sue the executive branch for injuries to legislative power. Institutional injury must not be abstract and should amount to vote nullification, as seen in Coleman v. Miller where legislators' votes were nullified due to a tie-breaking vote by the lieutenant governor. The Court determined that legislators have standing to sue if their votes are nullified, as seen in Coleman v. Miller. Their votes must have a direct interest in maintaining effectiveness, as in the case of Raines where the plaintiffs' votes were not given effect. The Raines plaintiffs did not allege that their votes were completely nullified by the Line Item Veto Act. They simply lost the vote, and could potentially repeal the Act in the future. The D.C. Circuit has grappled with determining if a vote has been completely nullified, as seen in Campbell v. Clinton where Member plaintiffs argued against President Clinton's military actions violating the War Powers Clause. The court rejected the Member plaintiffs' argument that their votes were nullified by military participation in airstrikes, stating that legislators do not have standing whenever the government acts against their votes. The court characterized the Coleman exception in Raines as narrow, only applying in situations where legislators have no legislative remedy to reverse the harm alleged. The court concluded that the Campbell plaintiffs could not allege an institutional injury amounting to vote nullification, as the Member plaintiffs had ample legislative power to prevent prosecution of the war. Impeachment was also mentioned as a possible recourse for a President disregarding Congress' authority. The Supreme Court recently discussed legislative standing in Arizona State Legislature v. Arizona Independent Redistricting Commission, a case involving the Elections Clause of the U.S. Constitution. The Arizona State Legislature had standing to sue over a voter-approved proposition that removed redistricting authority from the Legislature and vested it in an independent commission. The proposition and a state constitutional provision would nullify any vote by the Legislature on redistricting plans. The Court reaffirmed its narrow interpretation of Coleman in the context of a redistricting plan adoption case. Arizona State Legislature's standing to sue over redistricting authority was discussed, highlighting the separation of powers concerns present in Raines. State cases may have limited value in analyzing federal legislative standing disputes between coordinate branches. In Raines and its progeny, institutional injuries are interpreted to confer standing, potentially preventing a Member from challenging an act of Congress. However, standing may still be possible in suits against executive actions. Before Burwell, congressional institutions had established standing in cases related to information access. Most information access cases involve enforcing congressional subpoenas against executive branch officials. Standing as an institutional plaintiff requires congressional authorization to sue. Recent cases like Committee on Judiciary, U.S. House of Representatives v. Miers and Committee on Oversight and Government Reform v. Lynch address standing to sue in enforcing subpoenas post-Raines. The Department of Justice argued in Miers that Raines conflicted with D.C. Circuit's precedent. The D.C. Circuit's precedent on standing and enforcement of congressional subpoenas by civil suit was discussed in the case of United States v. American Telephone and Telegraph Co. (AT&T). The court stated that the House as a whole has standing to assert its investigatory power and can designate a member to act on its behalf. The district court in Miers distinguished AT&T from Raines and concluded that Raines and subsequent cases have not undercut either. The Judiciary Committee was authorized by the House to bring a suit, preserving its Article III standing. The district court in Lynch also found the case fell under the AT&T precedent, distinguishing it from Raines and other individual Member suits. The House Judiciary Committee was authorized to sue, maintaining its standing under AT&T precedent. The case addressed alleged constitutional and statutory violations related to subsidy payments and employer mandate enforcement. The House Judiciary Committee maintained standing to sue over subsidy payments and employer mandate enforcement. HHS and Treasury filed a motion to dismiss, arguing the House lacked standing. The agencies made three arguments against granting standing, including that the House's claims were too generalized and not legally cognizable. The House Judiciary Committee maintained standing to sue over subsidy payments and employer mandate enforcement. HHS and Treasury argued that legislative plaintiffs have no distinct interest in the proper application of the law. They also contended that Congress has no power to manage the implementation of federal law. The agencies argued that Congress has no legally cognizable injury if a law is improperly administered, as legislative power is shared equally by the House and Senate. They also stated that the reasoning in Raines dictates the outcome of the suit, as historical conflicts were resolved without litigation. The House's theory in this case was deemed inconsistent with the historical discussion in Raines. The House's claims in this case were rejected as they did not fit within the narrow Coleman exception established in Raines. The D.C. Circuit stated that Raines did not suggest a vote is nullified when the government acts against Congress's wishes. The Coleman exception only applies where the claim concerns the proper recording of a legislative action. The House's dispute with the agencies pertained to the interpretation and implementation of duly enacted laws, not the nullification of votes. Separation of powers concerns were raised, different from the Coleman case involving state legislators. The House emphasized its constitutional role in approving legislation, including appropriations measures. The House argued that the executive branch spending funds without approval weakens Congress's power of the purse and oversight authority, citing standing to bring suit for information requests. This undermines constitutional functions and causes concrete injury. The House argued that the executive branch's actions nullified their votes on appropriations and the ACA, citing the Coleman precedent. They rejected agencies' criticisms and warned of a lack of limiting principle if the executive's logic on standing was adopted. The House disputed the executive branch's actions, arguing it was about encroachment and aggrandizement, not just statutory interpretation. They maintained that the House had suffered an institutional injury and could establish standing, despite the lack of existing case law on the matter. The House argued that it had standing to sue the executive branch for institutional injury, distinct from statutory interpretation. The court granted standing on the appropriations claim but only for constitutional violations, not statutory ones. The court granted the House standing to sue the executive branch for a constitutional violation related to the appropriations process, not statutory interpretation. The House's claim alleged a specific violation of the Appropriations Clause, giving it standing as empowered by the Constitution. The court granted the House standing to sue the executive branch for violating the Appropriations Clause, stating that the House has the right to challenge any circumvention of the appropriations process that undermines its constitutional role. The court emphasized that the House, as an institution, has the standing to bring such a suit, distinguishing it from individual members and highlighting the importance of protecting institutional legislative power. The court granted the House standing to sue the executive branch for violating the Appropriations Clause, emphasizing the House's unique role in the appropriations process prescribed by the Constitution. The court concluded that the House's interest was not a generalized concern and that a perversion of the appropriations process inflicted a particular injury on the House. Additionally, the court determined that the House could not take legislative action to remedy a constitutional violation by the agencies. The court granted the House standing to sue the executive branch for violating the Appropriations Clause, emphasizing the House's unique role in the appropriations process. It concluded that the House had standing to pursue its appropriations claims but not the employer mandate claim, dismissing those counts. The court determined that the employer mandate claim was fundamentally a statutory argument, not a constitutional violation. The court granted the House standing to sue the executive branch for violating the Appropriations Clause, emphasizing its unique role in the appropriations process. However, the court dismissed the employer mandate claim, stating it was a statutory argument, not a constitutional violation. The court rejected the House's argument that the delay of the employer mandate constituted a constitutional violation, as it was too general to establish a concrete harm. The court granted the House standing to sue the executive branch for violating the Appropriations Clause, emphasizing its unique role in the appropriations process. To establish standing, a congressional institutional plaintiff must allege a specific constitutional violation that inflicts a concrete \"institutional injury,\" with the Appropriations Clause being the only provision identified so far. Alleged violations of general Article I legislative powers are not sufficient. The court's ruling granted the House standing to sue the executive branch for violating the Appropriations Clause, emphasizing its unique role in the appropriations process. The court's opinion was narrow to avoid opening the \"floodgates\" to new congressional lawsuits, with the court viewing its decision as limited by the extraordinary facts of the case. The opinion is the first to address whether a congressional institutional plaintiff has standing for an institutional injury unrelated to information access, providing insight for potential future litigation between Congress and the executive branch. The court's opinion on the House's standing to sue the executive branch has raised concerns about potential new congressional lawsuits. Questions arise about recasting statutory claims as violations of the Appropriations Clause and extending this reasoning to other constitutional provisions. The district court's decision on the cost-sharing subsidy claim was a key point of contention. The House's standing to sue the executive branch has sparked concerns about potential new congressional lawsuits, with questions about recasting statutory claims as violations of the Appropriations Clause. Disputes between Congress and the executive branch often revolve around the interpretation of an agency's statutory authority, with the executive branch framing it as a matter of statutory interpretation while congressional plaintiffs may argue it as a violation of the Appropriations Clause. The House's standing to sue the executive branch has raised concerns about potential new congressional lawsuits, with questions about recasting statutory claims as violations of the Appropriations Clause. Congress appropriates funds for agencies to conduct activities permitted under federal law, and if the House believes an agency is acting beyond its statutory authority, it could argue that funds were not appropriated for that activity. This could also apply if the House believes an agency is acting in contravention of an appropriations rider. These hypothetical scenarios suggest that the Burwell court's reasoning could grant standing to congressional institutional plaintiffs. The Burwell court's reasoning could potentially grant standing to congressional institutional plaintiffs by recasting statutory claims as violations of the Appropriations Clause. The blurred lines between \"constitutional\" and \"statutory\" claims may lead to routine allegations unless future courts establish limiting principles. Future courts may need to establish limiting principles to prevent routine allegations of agencies exceeding statutory authority from being repackaged as violations of the Appropriations Clause. The Burwell court described the Clause as a specific safeguard for the House's role in the appropriations process, contrasting it with other constitutional provisions that were deemed too general to establish a cognizable injury if violated. The provisions closely align with the characteristics of the Appropriations Clause identified by the court as creating a cognizable injury. For instance, the Appointments Clause limits the executive's ability to appoint certain officers, requiring Senate \"advice and consent.\" This clause serves as a structural protection of the separation of powers, balancing power between Congress and the executive branch. Similarly, the Senate's role in providing advice and consent on treaties also balances power between the branches. This suggests that the Burwell court's arguments are valid. The Burwell court's reasoning could potentially extend to violations of the Appointments or Treaty Clauses, where the Senate could suffer a cognizable injury. There is debate on whether alleged violations of the Take Care Clause could also be considered under the Burwell reasoning, as it pertains to the President's duty to faithfully execute the laws. The Take Care Clause requires the President to faithfully execute the laws, without specific reference to Congress. This distinction is crucial in determining if a violation of the Clause constitutes a legal injury. After the court granted standing to the House on one claim, agencies sought an interlocutory appeal based on the standards set in Burwell. The agencies sought an interlocutory appeal to end the case, arguing it would prevent courts from supervising government operations. The district court denied the motion, stating that a dispositive motion could be decided before an appeal. The court issued its opinion on the merits in May 2016. The court issued its opinion on the merits in May 2016, where the House prevailed on its cost sharing subsidy claim. The agencies appealed to the D.C. Circuit in July 2016, challenging both the standing and merits decisions. Justice Scalia's dissent in United States v. Windsor was cited by the agencies to argue against the House's injury. Scalia's opposition to legislative standing was evident in Arizona State Legislature, where he ruled against legislative standing. In Windsor, the Court examined whether BLAG had standing to defend a federal law DOJ refused to defend. Justice Scalia, joined by Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Thomas, referenced Raines to argue against legislative standing, stating that impairing a branch's power does not confer standing to sue. Congress has other ways to compel executive action without a lawsuit. In Windsor, Justice Alito was open to legislative standing, stating that in certain instances, Congress has standing to defend a statute when the executive branch refuses to do so. This concept was not addressed by the remaining Justices in the majority. The remaining Justices in the Windsor majority did not address the question of congressional institutional plaintiff standing or how Raines might impact institutional plaintiff suits and the House's alleged injury in the case."
