Despite previous failed attempts in FY2010 and FY2011, the current high deficits and gas prices may lead to increased support for these tax changes. The Administration views these deductions as costly subsidies that benefit major oil companies at the expense of U.S. taxpayers. The Obama Administration's FY2012 budget proposal aims to eliminate tax preferences for the oil and gas industries, with estimated revenue gains of $43.6 billion over the next decade. The Administration views these deductions as costly subsidies that do little to incentivize production or reduce prices for consumers. The American Petroleum Institute (API) argues that these tax provisions are similar to cost-recovery methods for other taxpayers. The proposed changes aim to shift the nation towards clean, renewable energy resources and control the federal deficit. The Obama Administration's FY2012 budget proposal aims to eliminate tax preferences for the oil and gas industries, with estimated revenue gains of $43.6 billion over the next decade. The proposed tax changes would equalize the tax treatment of independent oil producers with major oil companies by eliminating preferential tax treatment. This would result in raising almost $3.5 billion in 2012, with 96% of revenues from the proposed tax preference repeal from 2012-2021 coming from three main proposals. The repeal of percentage depletion and manufacturing tax deduction for the oil industry would increase tax payments by $41.9 billion through 2021. The enhanced oil recovery tax credit provides a 15% credit for costs related to oil recovery technologies during low oil price periods. Elimination of this credit would not impact current oil production. The marginal well tax credit was implemented in 2004 to keep low-production oil and natural gas wells in production during periods of low prices. It aims to maximize U.S. production levels even when world energy market balances result in low prices. Up to 20% of U.S. oil production and 12% of natural gas production comes from wells eligible for this credit. Since its enactment, market prices have been high enough to justify production on economic grounds, making the credit unnecessary. The expensing of intangible drilling costs has been part of the federal tax code since 1913, covering a wide range of necessary activities and items for drilling or well development. High-cost wells in the marginal well category may be eliminated if petroleum demand decreases, with the credit becoming less important if prices remain high or if the U.S. transitions to alternative energy sources. The full expensing of intangible drilling costs attracts capital to risky investments in oil exploration by allowing for quicker returns through reduced tax payments. Advanced technology has reduced the risk of finding oil, making expensive \"dry holes\" less likely and expanding exploration possibilities. Independent oil producers benefit from full expensing, while major integrated oil companies have to capitalize 30% of intangible drilling costs. Since 1986, major integrated oil companies have had to capitalize 30% of intangible drilling expenses over a 60-month period. Repealing the provision would yield $8.883 billion by 2016. The Independent Petroleum Association of America estimated a $3 billion reduction in U.S. oil development investment due to the tax change, suggesting a direct relationship between higher taxes and reduced investment. Little empirical evidence was provided for this estimate. The elimination of intangible drilling cost expensing would result in an immediate one-third reduction in drilling budgets according to the IPAA. The combination of low oil prices and additional taxes could reduce drilling activity, especially in high-cost resources like deep waters. However, with oil prices near $100 per barrel, political unrest in the Middle East supports continued oil development activity. Tertiary injection expenses can be fully deducted in the current tax year, benefiting older well output. The repeal of tax deductions for tertiary recovery methods, including carbon dioxide injection, may impact oil output from older wells during low-price periods. The passive loss exception for working interests in oil and gas properties, worth $117 million from 2012 to 2016, allows deductions against other active income. The percentage depletion allowance allows for the deduction of losses in oil and gas projects against other income, serving as an incentive for investors. It deducts 15% of an oil company's gross income to account for the value of extracted oil deposits. This practice dates back to 1926 and aims to provide a tax treatment similar to depreciation for the oil industry, equating oil deposits to capital equipment in traditional manufacturing industries. The percentage depletion allowance in the oil industry allows for deductions against income, similar to depreciation for capital equipment. It is limited to domestic U.S. production by independent producers and was eliminated for major oil companies in 1975. Despite this change, production of oil within the United States remains attractive due to ownership rights. The repeal of tax deductions in the oil industry, including the percentage depletion allowance and manufacturing tax deduction, is projected to generate significant revenue for the government. Ownership of oil resources is typically held by national oil companies in many countries, leading to lower revenues for companies operating outside the United States. The proposed budget estimates that repealing these deductions could result in over $18 billion in revenue by 2021. The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 included a tax deduction for the oil industry to encourage domestic employment in manufacturing. The deduction phased in from 3% in 2005 to a maximum of 9% in 2010, with a 6% limit for the oil and gas industries. This deduction aimed to reduce labor costs, increase employment, output, and lower prices domestically. The tax deduction for the oil industry aimed to boost domestic manufacturing employment, output, and competitiveness. However, the oil and gas industries differ from traditional manufacturing in terms of employment impact due to their capital-intensive nature. Despite the tax deduction, increased employment in these industries would have minimal effect on national employment levels. In 2009, the oil and natural gas extraction industries employed around 165,000 workers, with fewer than 100,000 classified as production workers. Since 2004, the oil industry has seen record profits due to high oil prices, leading to increased oil exploration. Expected oil and natural gas prices play a crucial role in determining capital investment budgets for exploration and production development. Geological and geophysical expenses are incurred during the resource development process. The tax treatment of geological and geophysical costs in gas resource development is crucial. Currently, major integrated oil companies amortize these costs over seven years, while independent producers may have their amortization period extended to seven years. This change is estimated to yield $1.1 billion in revenue from 2012 to 2016. The Independent Petroleum Association of America estimated that altering the tax provision for geological and geophysical expenses could reduce exploration and development activities on a dollar-for-dollar basis. However, oil producers may not significantly decrease investment if market prices remain high compared to exploration costs. In times of low prices near production costs, tax changes could impact investment and production activities. The American Petroleum Institute (API) responds to President Obama's FY2012 budget proposal, highlighting tax changes affecting the oil industry like repealing LIFO accounting method, reinstating Superfund taxes, and modifying the Dual Capacity Rule. LIFO is an established accounting method to reduce taxes by deducting the cost of recent goods during inflation. The American Petroleum Institute (API) opposes President Obama's FY2012 budget proposal, particularly the repeal of the LIFO accounting method and reinstatement of Superfund taxes for the oil industry. API argues that keeping LIFO is beneficial due to the rising oil prices and potential tax advantages, estimating an additional $22.5 billion in tax liabilities if LIFO is repealed. API also believes that reinstating Superfund taxes unfairly targets the oil industry, potentially leading to financial strain and bankruptcies. The API opposes President Obama's FY2012 budget proposal, specifically the repeal of the LIFO accounting method and reinstatement of Superfund taxes for the oil industry. The proposed tax increases are likely a response to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. The budget also suggests raising the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund tax on domestic and imported oil. The Dual Capacity Rule, based on a credit for foreign income tax dating back to 1918, allows corporations to deduct tax payments made to foreign governments from their U.S. income taxes. In the period after World War II, a new tax rule interpretation regarding the oil industry emerged, particularly with Saudi Arabia. Initially, royalties paid by oil companies were considered business costs for U.S. tax purposes. However, negotiations in 1950 led to these royalties being transformed into income taxes, allowing companies to increase after-tax earnings and transfer funds from the U.S. Treasury to the Saudi government. Proposed changes to the dual capacity rules would limit the amount of foreign income taxes that can be credited against U.S. taxes. Proposed changes to dual capacity rules would limit foreign income tax credits against U.S. taxes, affecting after-tax revenues from overseas investments. The Department of the Interior's budget proposal includes fee changes for oil and gas industries to transfer inspection and permit costs to companies, establish fees for non-producing leases, and adjust royalty rates. The Department of the Interior's budget proposal includes fee changes for oil and gas industries, such as adjusting royalty rates and ending the royalty-in-kind program. These changes may increase costs for companies but are argued to be necessary for environmentally sound resource management. The proposed tax changes could lead to higher tax collections from the industry, potentially impacting exploration, development, and production while increasing prices and foreign oil dependence. The proposed tax changes aim to eliminate tax preferences favoring oil and gas industries, potentially increasing consumer costs to reflect the true environmental and energy dependence costs. However, the impact on oil and gas production, consumption, and imports is expected to be minimal compared to the federal deficit and industry revenues."
