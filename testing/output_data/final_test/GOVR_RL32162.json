    "content": "Government activity affects the economy through production of goods and services, income transfers, tax collection, and regulation for various reasons. Taxes alter economic behavior by changing incentives to work and consume certain goods. The largest beneficiaries of government transfers are the elderly, particularly through programs like Social Security. The government regulates economic activity for reasons like environmental protection, workplace safety, and consumer protection. Measuring the economic impact of regulation is challenging. The size of government can be measured in various ways, such as dollars, per capita, total employees, or percentage of GDP. Adjusting for inflation is important when measuring in dollars to gauge the government's resources. Inflation affects the measurement of government resources, with a dollar of tax revenue in 1946 equivalent to $11 in 2009. Measuring government size by employee numbers is imprecise due to technological advancements. The federal government can use private and state workers to deliver programs, making comparisons over time challenging without considering demographic changes. Government spending per capita is more meaningful than total government spending. In 1944, federal spending was about one-third of today's federal budget in constant dollars, but accounted for 43.7% of GDP, whereas in 2008, it accounted for 24.7% of GDP. Expressing government spending as a fraction of GDP is crucial to understanding its significance over time. Increases in government spending in the short term are highlighted, with varying perspectives on the extent of the increase in 2000. The size of the government can be measured by expenditures or revenues as a percentage of GDP. Discrepancies between receipts and outlays are significant during large budget deficits. Government size peaked in different years based on receipts and outlays, with growth in government since 2000 in terms of outlays but a decrease in receipts. The size of government has grown since 2000 in terms of outlays but shrunk in terms of receipts. Outlays are considered a better measure of government size than receipts due to their stability and direct control by legislators. Cutting taxes without corresponding spending cuts does not permanently reduce the size of government. The burden of high taxes cannot be avoided in the long run. Deficits impose a burden as real as taxes in the long run. Deferring payments through deficits increases future outlays for government services. Interest payments on the national debt result from past spending, impacting the size of government over time. Excluding net interest payments from government comparisons reveals a different budget picture. The size of government, measured by spending, followed an upward trend until 1983, then a downward trend until 2000. Outlays rose from 14.7% of GDP in 1947 to 23.5% in 1983, then fell to 18.4% in 2000 before increasing again. Government spending as a percentage of GDP fluctuated over the years, with peaks above 20% in the 1970s and again since 2006. Defense spending decreased from 9.5% of GDP in 1968 to 4.7% in 1978, then rose to 6.2% in 1986 before declining to 3.0% in 2001 and increasing to 4.6% in 2009. Mandatory spending, excluding net interest, increased from 4.9% of GDP in 1962 to 14.7% in 2009, with a focus on programs benefiting the elderly. Non-defense discretionary spending also grew over time. Government spending as a percentage of GDP fluctuated over the years, with peaks above 20% in the 1970s and again since 2006. Defense spending decreased from 9.5% of GDP in 1968 to 4.7% in 1978, then rose to 6.2% in 1986 before declining to 3.0% in 2001 and increasing to 4.6% in 2009. Mandatory spending, excluding net interest, increased from 4.9% of GDP in 1962 to 14.7% in 2009, with a focus on programs benefiting the elderly. Federal spending is mainly allocated to defense, Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, which accounted for nearly two-thirds of all federal outlays in 2009. Government transfers and government purchases of goods and services have different effects on the economy. Government spending is divided between transfers to individuals and purchases of goods and services. Transfers do not directly employ capital and labor like government production does. Instead, transfers shift private sector spending between different groups of individuals. Government transfers shift private sector spending between individuals, altering work and saving incentives. They can result in vertical or horizontal redistribution, with most transfers focusing on the latter. Transfers are not evaluated solely on economic efficiency but also on social goals. Government transfers involve redistributing funds, with a focus on horizontal redistribution. The largest portion of transfers goes to the elderly through programs like Social Security. Other transfers include interest on the national debt and subsidies to government corporations. Government production is mainly directed towards national defense. Total federal outlays have remained around 20% post-war, but the composition of spending has changed significantly since the 1950s. Since the 1950s, federal outlays have seen a shift in composition, with government production decreasing while transfers have increased. Tax expenditures, defined as revenue losses from special provisions in tax laws, totaled $1.2 trillion in FY2008, surpassing discretionary spending. Tax expenditures in FY2008 totaled $1.2 trillion, exceeding discretionary spending. These expenditures, not reflected in the budget directly, are comparable to government spending. For instance, the mortgage interest deduction tax expenditure surpasses the entire FY2008 appropriation for the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). Economists debate whether tax expenditures or direct government spending are more effective in achieving specific goals. For example, a $1,000 child tax credit is akin to the government providing a $1,000 check to eligible parents. Similarly, a tax deduction for mortgage interest for a taxpayer in the 33% marginal income tax bracket is equivalent to government assistance. Tax expenditures in the 33% marginal income tax bracket are equivalent to the government sending the taxpayer a check for 33 cents for every dollar of mortgage interest paid. Revenue loss from specific expenditures may rise over time automatically without congressional action, unlike appropriated spending. Measures of the size of government that omit tax expenditures drastically underestimate its size. The outlay and revenue totals discussed in the federal budget do not include offsetting receipts and collections. The government's budget does not include offsetting receipts and collections, which are income primarily from business-like activities. These receipts fund specific activities like health care premiums, national park fees, and the sale of government resources. They are excluded from revenues and subtracted from total outlays. The budget does not include offsetting receipts and collections, which fund specific activities like health care premiums and national park fees. Some argue that excluding them from the budget keeps financed activities outside oversight. Including them may be sensible as they are not an insignificant sum. In 2009, offsetting collections and receipts totaled $424 billion, about 12% as large as outlays included in the budget. Including state and local government spending in the budget shows a smaller decline in the size of government since 1983 due to the growth at that level. State and local government outlays have increased to 11.4% of GDP in 2009. The growth in state and local government is larger if federal grants are included, reaching 11.4% of GDP in 2009. Government corporations like the Postal Service operate outside the budget, generating revenue to cover expenses. Government corporations like the Postal Service operate independently of the federal budget, raising capital through various means such as issuing bonds. They function more like private businesses in terms of decision-making and providing goods and services for sale in the market. Government corporations, like the Postal Service, operate independently of the federal budget and compete with private corporations. They provide goods and services for sale in the market, accounting for about 1% of national income. Additionally, there are \"quasi-government\" organizations with ties to the government, such as RAND and government sponsored enterprises like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. These entities have legal characteristics linking them to the government, such as special borrowing privileges. In 2008, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were taken into conservatorship by the federal government and began to receive direct financial support. Critics argue that quasi-governmental organizations should be considered fundamentally governmental. Policy decisions made today can have long-term consequences not reflected in the annual cash flow budget. Many recent tax cuts and spending programs are being phased in over several years. The estate tax, signed into law in 2001, will not be eliminated until 2010. Spending on multi-year projects can lead to implicit future spending commitments. Defense spending is assumed to grow at the rate of inflation. Mandatory spending can increase with no change in law, especially in entitlement spending on the aged. Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid spending is projected to increase from 7.4% of GDP in 2000. The government's future unfunded liabilities are estimated at $44.2 trillion in present value terms. Some analysts suggest using accrual accounting to reflect current liabilities in the budget. Different accounting methods could show varying trends in government size over time. The size of government can be affected by changes in economic conditions, leading to automatic adjustments in spending and revenue levels. For example, during a recession, mandatory spending on programs like unemployment insurance increases while revenues decrease. This phenomenon, known as \"automatic stabilizers,\" can temporarily alter the size of government. In 2009, economic conditions led to policy changes that increased spending by $575 billion and decreased revenues by $212 billion over 10 years. The 2008 financial crisis resulted in government actions like the Troubled Assets Relief Program (TARP) and government conservatorship of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, with ongoing budgetary costs largely recorded in 2009. Some argue that temporary government programs can lead to permanent increases in spending. Government regulation, like laws and mandates, has a significant economic impact similar to government spending and taxation. Recent policy debates on healthcare, financial reform, and oil drilling show how regulation influences economic activity. Ignoring regulation when discussing government size can be misleading. For example, a government proposal to reduce product consumption can involve paying people not to use it or to use an alternative. Government regulation, like laws and mandates, has a significant economic impact similar to government spending and taxation. Recent policy debates on healthcare, financial reform, and oil drilling show how regulation influences economic activity. Policymakers must determine the appropriate role of the government in the economy based on economic efficiency. Economic theory suggests that government intervention can improve efficiency when market failures exist. Government intervention can improve efficiency in cases of market failures, but may reduce efficiency in already \"perfect\" markets. Some government policies raise economic efficiency while others lower it. Eliminating actions that lower efficiency could potentially improve economic welfare by reducing the size of government. Identifying areas where government intervention can correct market failures could lead to a larger government improving economic efficiency. Economic efficiency is different from popular understanding and is important to consider before discussing market failures. Economic efficiency is defined as the balance between the marginal cost and marginal benefit of producing and consuming goods. In perfect markets, government intervention can reduce efficiency, but in cases of market failures, it can improve efficiency. The market can lead to economically inefficient outcomes. Efficiency-enhancing measures often come with efficiency-reducing side effects, such as taxes to finance essential services like the criminal justice system. While a tax-financed system is generally seen as improving efficiency, there may be disagreements on the balance between benefits and costs. The democratic process often involves compromises that mix efficiency-enhancing and efficiency-reducing measures. The democratic process involves compromises with a mix of efficiency-enhancing and efficiency-reducing measures. Economic theory can describe the benefits and costs of policies but cannot predict how legislative compromises will differ from the original policy. Measuring efficiency gains and losses becomes challenging when other policies distort the market. Personal differences in opinion contribute to the wide ideological diversity in the economics profession. Market failures, as defined by economic theory, do not include fraud, discrimination, bankruptcy, layoffs, or high prices. These issues are not economic inefficiencies but may be targets for public policy. Economic theory identifies market failures as the lack of provision of non-excludable and non-rival goods, known as public goods, which are often supplied by the government. An example of a public good is national defense. Public goods, such as national defense, basic knowledge, and the justice system, are not transacted through the marketplace due to the free rider problem. Government, with the power of taxation, is needed to finance these goods. It is challenging to determine the appropriate level of government spending on public goods as their value varies among individuals. The political process, rather than the marketplace, determines the provision of public goods. The political process, not the marketplace, determines the provision of public goods like national defense. Common resources, unlike public goods, are rival and not excludable, requiring government intervention for sustainable use. Common resources like ocean fishing and the environment are at risk of depletion due to the lack of a single governing authority. Government intervention, such as subsidies to the fishing industry, may not always lead to efficient resource use. Estimating the appropriate level of intervention is challenging as common resources cannot be valued through the marketplace. Monopoly occurs when a single producer has enough market power to push prices above marginal cost, earning excess profits. This can lead to inefficiently low production levels. Monopolies can be caused by barriers to entry, economies of scale, or natural monopolies where marginal cost is continually declining. Natural monopolies often occur in non-rival consumption markets like utilities (electricity, water, etc.). In monopolistic competition, companies produce distinct but substitutable products, leading to some market power. Production is inefficiently low but closer to efficiency than in a pure monopoly. Economic theory suggests that governments can increase efficiency by regulating or owning monopolies to reach their efficient production point. Government intervention in monopolistic competition and natural monopolies has been debated for decades. Some argue that competition can deter producers from maximizing monopoly rents, while others question the effectiveness of government regulation in improving efficiency. Instances of economic regulation in industries like airlines and trucking have often been seen as failures. Government intervention in monopolistic competition and natural monopolies has been debated for decades. Monopolies are sometimes fostered by the government, such as through patents and copyrights. Externalities, both positive and negative, can also impact the market. It is challenging to determine the extent of government intervention needed to address externalities. Negative externalities, like pollution, result in societal costs not accounted for by consumers or producers, leading to overproduction and overconsumption. To maximize social welfare, consumption of goods with negative externalities should be reduced to reflect their social costs. On the other hand, positive externalities, such as vaccines, benefit society as a whole by preventing the spread of diseases. Vaccines are an example of goods that are underproduced from a societal perspective. Vaccines are underproduced and underconsumed without government intervention due to positive externalities. Social goals like home ownership and education are debated for generating positive externalities. Competitive markets require well-informed buyers and sellers for efficiency. In some markets, asymmetric information between buyers and sellers leads to inefficiencies. For example, in insurance markets, buyers know more about their riskiness than sellers, causing only high-risk buyers to purchase insurance. Government intervention, such as mandatory insurance or direct provision, can help correct these market inefficiencies caused by asymmetric information and moral hazard. The concept of moral hazard in insurance can lead to reckless behavior by the insured, driving up insurance costs. Asymmetric information, known as the principal-agent problem, can result in managers making decisions that do not align with the interests of shareholders or depositors. Government interventions may be necessary to address the assumption in economic theory that individuals always make rational decisions. The failure of individuals to optimize underlies arguments for Social Security, mandatory education, financial bubble prevention, and drug laws. Economic analysis often relies on theoretical models of optimizing individuals, which may not always reflect reality due to mis-specification. Robust models where individuals do not optimize have not gained widespread use in economic theory. Taxes reduce economic efficiency by distorting behavior, moving it away from efficient market allocation. Sales tax on specific goods changes choices between taxed and non-taxed goods, while wage tax shifts worker's time allocation. Taxes can also inefficiently shift behavior from taxable to non-taxable compensation. Taxes can reduce economic efficiency by distorting behavior, shifting it from taxable to non-taxable compensation. The impact of taxation on economic efficiency depends on whether the benefits of government interventions outweigh the efficiency cost of taxes. As government size increases and tax rates rise, the efficiency loss from taxes also increases geometrically. It is challenging to estimate efficiency losses accurately, especially in the presence of other policies affecting market outcomes. High taxes can lead to efficiency losses, but not all taxes distort behavior. For example, a capitation tax results in no efficiency loss as it is unavoidable. Economists suggest that efficiency losses from taxation could be lower if the tax base is broadened to raise revenue with lower marginal tax rates, reducing the need for exemptions and deductions. The efficiency case against taxes is more a case for tax reform than tax reduction. Broadening the tax base can lead to lower marginal tax rates and reduce the need for exemptions and deductions, increasing economic efficiency. Tax expenditures can create distortions in economic behavior and are economically equivalent to spending unless they correct for an externality. Tax expenditures can create distortions in economic behavior similar to spending policies. They are only efficient if they correct market failures, otherwise, they can divert resources to inefficient pursuits. Reducing marginal tax rates is key to increasing economic efficiency. Tax expenditures, like tax shelters and child tax credits, can lead to higher marginal rates without significant behavioral changes. Simplifying the tax code aims to reduce administrative costs and evasion. Economic efficiency is not the only consideration in public policy, as equity and fairness also play a role. Economists cannot quantitatively judge certain social goals, such as justice and equity, as they go beyond economic efficiency. While a progressive income tax system may be less efficient, it serves social purposes that cannot be measured purely in economic terms. Economists can assess how to achieve social goals in a cost-effective manner, but cannot determine if the economic costs of a proposal outweigh its social benefits. Economists support government intervention in social goals like worker retraining programs and unemployment benefits to address worker displacement from free trade agreements like NAFTA. They argue that public sector provision may be more economically efficient than private sector solutions, such as unemployment insurance. Income redistribution is also seen as a way to achieve social goals, even if it may be less economically efficient. Some economists argue that income redistribution is best done by the state due to the free-rider problem. The size of government and its impact on economic growth are debated, with growth seen as just one factor to consider, not the ultimate goal. Evaluating policies based solely on growth may overlook non-economic benefits like quality of life. The debate over the size of government and its impact on economic growth is ongoing. While a mandatory 80-hour work week may boost economic growth, it would have negative societal effects. Economic efficiency is often measured by growth, but other factors like quality of life should also be considered. Arguments for or against larger government should not solely focus on short-term effects like increasing the budget deficit to stimulate spending. Long-term sustainable growth is key, regardless of government size. Long-term economic growth is driven by increases in labor supply, physical capital stock, and productivity. Government size can impact growth through spending, transfers, taxes, and regulation. Government purchases inputs from the private sector to produce goods and services. The government purchases inputs from the private sector to produce goods and services, such as national defense. Unlike private production, government production is valued by measuring inputs rather than output, making it difficult to measure its effect on the economy empirically. Government spending may affect productivity gains over time, but it is unlikely to have a direct effect on increasing the labor force. Government GDP is difficult to measure for productivity gains over time due to the way it is recorded. The lack of competition and profit incentive in the government sector may lead to lower innovation and productivity gains. It is challenging to compare public and private sector productivity growth rates to determine their impact on economic growth. Government output, including state and local, accounted for 20% of GDP in 2008. If private sector productivity grows at 2% and government productivity at half that rate, total output growth would only be 0.2 percentage points lower annually. Reducing government production by half would increase productivity growth by 0.1 percentage points. Some government output is produced by private sector contractors with similar productivity growth rates. Government goods and services may impact private sector productivity growth. Government spending on capital investment, such as roads and ports, increases output by boosting the nation's capital stock similar to private investment. This type of spending can impact private sector productivity growth, potentially lowering it. Government spending on capital investment, like roads and ports, boosts the nation's capital stock, similar to private investment. Non-defense capital investment spending has remained low, while defense investment has decreased in peacetime. The impact of defense investment on GDP growth is debated due to its intangible nature. Some argue that R&D and education spending should also be considered investment. Federal spending on R&D has decreased from 2% of GDP in the 1960s to 1% today, split evenly between defense and non-defense. The impact of government spending on economic growth depends on what it replaces, with capital spending potentially increasing growth and consumption spending potentially decreasing it. Both government and private investment can have diminishing returns as spending increases. Government spending on transfers to individuals has no direct effect on aggregate private output, only affecting the distribution of private output. The impact on economic growth comes from the distortion in incentives caused by transfers, particularly for retirees who may reduce private saving rates. Social Security payments and other government pensions can replace private saving for retirement, leading to potential decreases in private saving rates. Transfers to the elderly, such as Social Security payments, can reduce private saving rates and impact economic growth by potentially leading to earlier retirement and decreasing national saving. These transfers serve as insurance against risks like disability and outliving assets, which may lessen the need for private precautionary saving. Efficiency, rather than growth, should be the primary criterion for evaluating such programs. Government intervention in transfers can impact private saving and economic growth by addressing market failures in the insurance market. Means-tested transfers can potentially reduce growth by creating incentives for recipients to keep income or wealth below certain thresholds. Phasing out transfers more slowly as income increases can help mitigate this effect on economic growth. Means-tested transfers can impact economic growth by creating incentives for recipients to keep income or wealth below certain thresholds. Economists are critical of economically inefficient transfers that do not serve broad social goals, such as subsidies to specific industries that may reduce economic efficiency. Industrial subsidies could lead to a one-time reduction in GDP as resources are reallocated to less efficient outcomes. The benefits of subsidies are concentrated and do not accrue to broad groups on a non-discriminatory basis. Taxes can impact economic growth by changing behavior, such as saving rates and labor supply. Income tax reduction can either increase or decrease economic growth by affecting saving and labor. A tax cut can increase rewards for work or saving (substitution effect) and also increase after-tax income, leading to less work or saving (income effect). The income effect gives an incentive to work or save less. It is uncertain whether the substitution or income effect dominates for any tax. Empirical evidence is divided on the effects of tax cuts on saving and labor, with some studies showing an increase in labor supply while others show a decrease. Most studies find the response to be small, with certain demographic groups showing greater responses. Female employment rates are lower, and there is evidence of a larger labor supply response to tax cuts among females in high-income households. The labor supply response to tax cuts among females in high-income households is examined. The overall effect on labor is small, with the average work week remaining relatively constant despite changes in tax rates. The male labor force participation rate has decreased since the 1960s, while the female participation rate has been stable since the 1990s. Changes in taxes are expected to have a one-time effect on growth through the labor supply channel. The household saving rate has been declining despite changes in tax rates and tax-favored savings accounts since the 1980s. Saving behavior is complex and influenced by various factors, including the structure of the tax code. Theoretical models used by economists to explain saving behavior are complex due to the multifaceted motives for saving. Tax cuts can impact economic growth, but their effects cannot be evaluated in isolation. Financing tax cuts through lower spending or raising other taxes can have varying effects on long-run growth. If tax cuts are financed through borrowing, it is likely to have a negative impact on long-run growth due to reduced national saving. Estimating the effect of regulation on growth is challenging and must be done on a case-by-case basis. Some regulations divert resources to non-economic compliance costs, reducing output. However, regulations like the rule of law can enhance growth. Environmental regulations may reduce a firm's output but could be offset by positive economic effects, such as improved public health. It is crucial to differentiate between a regulation's one-time impact on output and its permanent effect on growth, with most one-time effects being overshadowed by long-term growth compounding. The government influences economic activity through various channels such as production of goods, transfer payments, taxation, and regulation. Measuring the size of government is complex due to various factors not being included in annual federal outlays. Estimating the economic impact of regulation is challenging and not consistently done. Government intervention can improve economic efficiency by addressing market failures. Government intervention can increase economic efficiency by rectifying market failures and decrease efficiency by distorting perfectly competitive markets. Political choices can lead to second-best outcomes, leading some to argue that accepting market failures may be preferable to government intervention in certain cases. For government spending to enhance efficiency, it must provide greater benefits than efficiency-reducing taxes that fund it. Tax cuts can boost overall efficiency if financed by reductions in less efficient spending or increases in less efficient taxes. Marginal tax reductions typically increase efficiency, while many tax expenditures decrease efficiency. Deficit-financed tax cuts do not enhance efficiency if they lead to larger tax increases in the future. Not all government spending is equal, with economists agreeing that some government spending is more beneficial than others. Government spending varies in its impact on economic efficiency. While some spending, like investments in a legal system, can boost growth, subsidies to industries can hinder efficiency. The overall effect of government size on the economy is complex, as policies can have mixed effects. It is possible for both large and small governments to prioritize either efficiency-enhancing or -reducing policies. Some policies may sacrifice efficiency for social goals like equity. Currently, government transfers to individuals are significant. Government transfers to individuals are nearly twice as large as government spending on goods and services. The primary goal of most transfers is not economic efficiency. Government intervention can either foster or hinder long-term growth by influencing work effort, capital accumulation, and technological innovation. Economic growth is not a clear normative goal like economic efficiency. Market forces tend to be stronger than policy changes in influencing economic growth over time. The size of government is not as important as how it utilizes its spending, transfer, tax, and regulatory policies to impact economic efficiency and growth. The financial crisis of 2008 resulted in a temporary increase in government outlays as a share of GDP. Fiscal stimulus legislation led to a significant spending increase from 2009 to 2011, with minimal effects after 2011. Assuming these programs expire as scheduled, spending will decrease from its recent peak. However, overall spending will not return to pre-crisis levels due to growth in other spending, such as net interest and entitlement spending. The government's influence on the economy through regulatory changes is harder to quantify."
