    "content": "The FCC has long promoted diversity in broadcasting, aiming for diversity of viewpoints, programming, outlet ownership, and minority/female ownership. They also restrict the number of media outlets a single entity can own to promote localism and competition. The FCC reviews media ownership rules every four years to ensure competition and promote diversity of media voices. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 directs the FCC to consider localism and commercial incentives for diverse news programming. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit has directed the FCC in 2004, 2011, and 2016 regarding media ownership regulations. In 2016, the FCC completed the 2014 Quadrennial Review of its media ownership rules and diversity policies, resulting in new rules related to media ownership and diversity. The National Association of Broadcasters and other media companies filed petitions with the FCC to reconsider the decision. In response to petitions, the FCC repealed and relaxed media ownership rules in 2017, creating an incubator program for ownership diversity. Changes took effect in February and March 2018, with additional rules issued in August. Legal challenges to these orders are pending in the U.S. Court of Appeals. The FCC initiated a rulemaking proceeding in December 2017 to eliminate or modify the national audience reach cap of 39% for a single company's television stations. Congress exempted this cap from the FCC's quadrennial media ownership review, and the FCC sought comments on its authority to make changes. Legal challenges to recent media ownership rule changes are pending in the U.S. Court of Appeals. The debate over media ownership rules is influenced by changes in news consumption patterns. Surveys show a decline in adults citing local broadcast television as a news source, while online sources have seen significant growth. Print newspapers and broadcast radio have also declined in importance. These trends raise concerns about the impact of common ownership of multiple media outlets on diversity of viewpoints. The consolidation of media outlets, such as Sinclair Broadcast Group's failed attempt to acquire Tribune Media Company, Entercom Communications merging with CBS Radio Inc., and Gray Television purchasing Raycom Media Inc., has raised concerns about the diversity of viewpoints in the market. This comes as news consumption patterns shift away from traditional sources like local broadcast television towards online platforms. Gray Television's acquisition of Raycom Media Inc. would allow them to reach a quarter of U.S. households, subject to FCC media ownership rules based on signal range and market limits. The FCC uses Designated Market Areas (DMAs) and digital television service contours to determine ownership rules within these regions. The FCC uses digital television service contours to define signal strength requirements for television stations. This includes the digital \"principal community contour\" (digital PCC) for serving a station's community of license and the digital \"noise limited service contour\" (digital NLSC) to ensure coverage for at least 50% of residents. Nielsen's Designated Market Areas (DMAs) are used to define local television markets. Nielsen has established 210 DMAs based on TV viewing preferences in the US. FCC defines service areas for AM radio stations as primary, secondary, and intermittent. Primary service area for AM stations is where groundwave is not subject to interference. Signal strength needed for a population of 2,500 or more to receive primary service is specified. The FCC sets signal strength requirements for AM radio stations based on population size. Communities with 2,500 or more people need 2 mv/m, while those with fewer than 2,500 need 0.5 mv/m. Nielsen defines local radio markets called \"Metros,\" which generally align with metropolitan statistical areas but may have exceptions. Radio markets do not cover every U.S. county, and the FCC determines the number of radio stations within each market. The FCC uses a database from BIA Kelsey to determine the number of radio stations in each market. FCC rules prohibit unauthorized transfers of control of licenses, and attribution rules help enforce media ownership rules by identifying relationships that confer influence over station operations and finances. The FCC's media ownership rules are triggered by control over station operations and finances, even if the entity is not the official licensee. Joint sales agreements (JSAs) allow one station to sell advertising time on another station in the same market. Television JSAs selling over 15% of advertising time on a competing station are considered ownership or control. The deadline to comply with ownership rules for multiple television stations within a DMA has been extended to September 30, 2025. The FCC's media ownership rules include the Television Duopoly Rule, which has been extended to September 30, 2025. In 2017, the FCC eliminated the television JSA attribution rule, stating that JSAs can benefit local broadcasters. Broadcast television stations are no longer required to file copies of their JSAs with the FCC, but must still make them available in public inspection files. The FCC requires disclosure of joint operating agreements (JOAs) and shared services agreements (SSAs) among broadcast stations. SSAs involve one station providing services to another station not under common control. The FCC upheld the SSA disclosure rule in 2017, effective since March 2018. Shared services agreements (SSAs) involve stations collaborating to provide station-related services under FCC regulations. Each station in an SSA must file a copy in its online public inspection file and report oral agreements to the FCC. Noncommercial stations are exempt from SSA disclosure requirements. The FCC does not require noncommercial television stations, radio stations, and newspapers to comply with SSA disclosure requirements. The FCC emphasized that SSAs are not attributable and stated that any future regulation of these agreements would require significant study. Broadcast stations that outsource management are known as sidecars. The FCC's Media Bureau announced in March 2014 that it would closely scrutinize transactions involving sidecar agreements in the same market. In February 2017, the FCC's Media Bureau rescinded guidance on joint acquisitions and programming agreements. Nielsen ranks DMAs by estimated TV households, with New York being the largest DMA and Glendive, MT, the smallest. FCC uses Nielsen's estimates for national ownership cap purposes. In 1985, the FCC adopted a rule discounting UHF stations for national ownership cap purposes due to signal limitations. By December 2009, 73% of commercial stations operated in the UHF band. In 2013, the FCC proposed eliminating the UHF discount under Acting Chairwoman Mignon Clyburn. In 2013, the FCC proposed eliminating the UHF discount under Acting Chairwoman Mignon Clyburn. In September 2016, the UHF discount was eliminated, but later reinstated in April 2017 by Chairman Ajit Pai. The discount allowed a single entity owning UHF stations to reach 78% of U.S. television households, double the national ownership cap. In December 2017, the FCC began a rulemaking proceeding to review the UHF discount and national ownership cap. The FCC has not issued formal rules regarding sharing, sales, operating, and financial agreements for national media ownership. Instead, it has addressed these issues on an ad hoc basis or remained silent. For example, in 2013, Local TV LLC applied to transfer control of its broadcast television station licenses. Local TV LLC applied to transfer control of its broadcast television station licenses to Tribune Media Company and Dreamcatcher Broadcasting LLC. Tribune proposed that Dreamcatcher would be the new licensee of Local TV's stations in specific television markets. The FCC's media bureau disagreed with opponents of the proposed arrangement, stating that Tribune will not be operating the Dreamcatcher Stations as though it owned them outright. Dreamcatcher will be run independently by an experienced broadcaster. The FCC's Media Bureau staff addressed concerns regarding Tribune's transfer of broadcast licenses to Sinclair Broadcast Group, raising issues about the proposed sale of Tribune's Chicago station WGN-TV to a buyer with no broadcasting experience and ties to Sinclair's executive chairman. This led to the FCC designating the transaction for a hearing before an administrative law judge in July 2018. The FCC commissioners raised concerns about Sinclair's potential control over WGN-TV, including a below-market sale price, an option to buy back the station, and operational responsibilities. They questioned if Sinclair was the real party in interest and if they were trying to bypass broadcast ownership rules. The FCC did not address how Sinclair's operation of multiple stations in the Wilkes-Barre-Scranton-Hazleton market could breach national ownership caps. The FCC is addressing concerns about Sinclair's control over WGN-TV and potential breaches of national ownership caps in the Wilkes Barre-Scranton-Hazleton market. The FCC's approach to addressing attribution on a case-by-case basis raises uncertainty about enforcing ownership limits in the future. This issue may resurface when reviewing Gray Television's acquisition of stations from Raycom, particularly in the Ottumwa, IA-Kirksville, MO television market. Gray Television's potential merger with Raycom in Ottumwa is raising concerns about ownership limits, similar to the issues faced by Sinclair in its failed merger with Tribune. The FCC has rules governing ownership of multiple media outlets in a single market, which could impact Gray's control over the station and its reach to 39% of U.S. television households. The FCC has distinct rules for ownership of multiple media outlets in a single market, including local television ownership rules, local radio ownership rules, radio/television cross-ownership rules, newspaper/broadcast cross-ownership rules, and the dual network rule. The television duopoly rule limits common ownership of TV stations in the same region, with exceptions made on a case-by-case basis by the FCC. The FCC implemented the duopoly rule in 1941 to prevent a single entity from owning multiple broadcast television stations serving the same area. Over the years, the rule evolved to limit ownership to a maximum of two stations in most states and to curb regional concentrations of ownership. In 1999, the FCC adopted the \"top four ranked/eight voice\" test for approving mergers among top stations, ensuring a minimum number of independently owned stations in the market. The rule primarily applies to the local affiliates of major English-language broadcast networks. The FCC retained the television duopoly rules in 2016, making some technical modifications. In 2017, the \"eight voices\" component of the test was eliminated, and case-by-case evaluations are now conducted for ownership of top-four-ranked stations in the same market. The modification to the television duopoly rule was found not likely to harm minority and female ownership of broadcast stations. The \"failed station/failing station\" waiver test was also retained in 2016. The FCC has criteria for obtaining a waiver of the local television (duopoly) rule, including demonstrating that one station is failed or failing, the buyer is the only available candidate, and selling to an out-of-market buyer would lower the price. The FCC declined to relax its criteria for determining failing stations due to potential data manipulation. The local radio ownership rule limits ownership of radio stations in the same area, with a presumptive waiver adopted in limited cases in 2017. Unlike the television rule, there are no failed/failing station waiver criteria for the local radio ownership rule. The FCC has rules limiting ownership of radio stations in the same area, with criteria for obtaining a waiver of the local television rule. In 1992, the FCC relaxed the radio ownership rule to establish numerical limits based on the total number of commercial stations within a market. The FCC has rules limiting ownership of radio stations in the same area, with criteria for obtaining a waiver of the local television rule. In 1992, the FCC relaxed the radio ownership rule to establish numerical limits based on the total number of commercial stations within a market. Congress directed the FCC to set new caps on radio ownership, which remain in place today. In 2016, the FCC retained the local radio ownership rule to promote diversity and competition in the market. The FCC clarified certain aspects of the rule, including its application in cases of changes to radio market boundaries. In Puerto Rico, the FCC will use radio station signal contour overlaps for determining ownership. The FCC eliminated the radio/television cross-ownership rule in 2017, citing diminished contributions to viewpoint diversity and the presence of other media outlets. The rule prohibited owning more than two TV stations and one radio station in the same DMA. The FCC found the rule unnecessary for promoting competition or localism and determined its repeal would not negatively impact minority and female ownership. The FCC also repealed the newspaper/broadcast cross-ownership rule. The FCC repealed the newspaper/broadcast cross-ownership (NBCO) rule in 2017, citing the multiplicity of news sources and diminished role of print newspapers. The rule prohibited owning a daily print newspaper and a full-power broadcast station if their service contours overlapped. The FCC found that the rule was no longer necessary for promoting viewpoint diversity and could potentially promote localism. The FCC repealed the NBCO rule in 2017 to promote localism by allowing local news outlets to combine resources. The dual network rule prohibits common ownership of two of the \"top four\" networks but permits ownership of multiple broadcast networks. This rule remains in effect and was originally adopted in 1941 for radio. In 1941, the FCC implemented the dual network rule targeting NBC for having two radio networks, which gave them excessive control and a competitive advantage. The rule was extended to television networks in 1946. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 led to modifications allowing common ownership of two networks, excluding the top four networks. In 2001, the rule was revised to permit major networks to jointly own emerging networks like the CW network. CBS Corporation now has partial ownership of the CW network. In 2016, the FCC retained the dual network rule. The FCC has a history of implementing rules to encourage diverse broadcast station ownership, including ownership by women and minority groups. Examples of these attempts include the Failed Station Solicitation Rule and the establishment of \"eligible entities\" for relaxed ownership rules. The Third Circuit Court of Appeals is overseeing the FCC's efforts in this area. The FCC, under the oversight of the Third Circuit Court of Appeals, adopted the 2016 Diversity Order to increase broadcast ownership diversity. The order reinstated the revenue-based eligible entity standard, defining small businesses as entities with annual revenue of $38.5 million or less. Six measures were adopted to assist eligible entities in complying with the rules. The 2016 Diversity Order includes six measures to enable eligible entities to follow less restrictive media ownership rules. The FCC believes that promoting small business participation in the broadcast industry will encourage innovation and competition. Interested parties have appealed the order to the Third Circuit. The FCC established a new incubator program in 2017 as part of the reconsideration of the Quadrennial Media Ownership order. The program provides a waiver for broadcast radio ownership rules to help facilitate station ownership for a certain class of owners. Rules governing the program were issued in August 2018, with most becoming effective on September 27, 2018. The program involves an established radio broadcaster providing support to a new or small broadcaster, including training and mentoring. The FCC's incubator program, established in 2017, aims to assist new or small broadcasters in owning and operating stations independently. Successful completion of the program allows for a waiver of the FCC's Local Radio Ownership Rule. The FCC may consider expanding the program to include television stations after the 2018 Quadrennial Review. Congress could potentially introduce legislation for tax certificates or credits in the program.

If Congress provides an alternative benefit for incubating broadcasters, the program may be expanded to include television stations."
