    "title": "AB 1066",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 554 of the Labor Code in California is amended. Section 554 of the Labor Code in California is amended to exempt cases of emergency or work in protection of life or property from certain labor regulations. It also allows for an accumulation of rest days if necessary for the nature of the work, with the requirement of one day of rest in seven days. This requirement applies even with collective bargaining agreements, unless expressly stated otherwise. The Chief of the Division of Labor Standards Enforcement may exempt employers or employees from certain labor provisions if hardship is foreseen. Chapter 6, known as the Phase-In Overtime for Agricultural Workers Act of 2016, highlights the physically demanding nature of agricultural work and the historical exclusion of agricultural workers from wage protections and overtime compensation. The Phase-In Overtime for Agricultural Workers Act of 2016 aims to provide overtime compensation for agricultural workers in California, as defined by Order No. 14-2001 of the Industrial Welfare Commission. This includes exempting them from certain labor provisions to address the physically demanding nature of their work and historical lack of wage protections. Starting January 1, 2019, agricultural workers in California are limited to working nine and a half hours per day or 55 hours per week, with overtime pay required for additional hours. Employers with 25 or fewer employees must comply with these regulations by January 1, 2022. Starting January 1, 2020, agricultural workers in California are limited to working nine hours per day or 50 hours per week, with overtime pay required for additional hours. Employers with 25 or fewer employees must comply with these regulations by January 1, 2023. Additionally, starting January 1, 2021, the daily limit will be reduced to eight and a half hours and the weekly limit to 45 hours. Starting January 1, 2020, agricultural workers in California are limited to working nine hours per day or 50 hours per week, with overtime pay required for additional hours. Employers with 25 or fewer employees must comply with these regulations by January 1, 2023. From January 1, 2022, workers in agricultural occupations cannot work more than eight hours in a day or 40 hours in a week, with overtime pay mandated. This rule applies to employers with 25 or fewer employees from January 1, 2024. All other overtime compensation rules for agricultural workers will be in effect from January 1, 2017, except as specified in Section 860 and Section 862(a). Starting January 1, 2022, agricultural workers in California must be compensated at twice their regular rate for work exceeding 12 hours in a day. The overtime rules will apply to employers with 25 or fewer employees starting January 1, 2025. The Governor has the authority to temporarily suspend overtime requirements under certain conditions. If the Governor decides to temporarily suspend the overtime requirements set for the following year, all implementation dates will be postponed by an additional year, but the full implementation must be completed by January 1, 2022. The suspension will be done by proclamation. The Governor's authority to suspend scheduled overtime requirements will end upon the phase-in of new requirements or by January 1, 2025. The Department of Industrial Relations will update Wage Order No. 14-2001 to align with this chapter, with existing provisions for agricultural employees remaining in effect. No reimbursement is required by this act pursuant to Section 6 of Article XIII\u2009B of the California Constitution as it only incurs costs for local agencies or school districts related to creating, eliminating, or changing penalties for crimes or infractions."
