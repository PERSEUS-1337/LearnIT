    "content": "On September 11, 2009, the White House announced additional tariffs on Chinese tires for three years under Section 421 of the Trade Act of 1974, citing market disruption to domestic tire producers. The tariffs took effect on September 26, 2009, marking the first time a President granted import relief under this statute. President Obama chose to maintain the tariffs as originally imposed, despite the option to review and modify them after six months. Section 421 of the Trade Act of 1974 allows the President to impose temporary measures on Chinese products if market disruption in the US is found. This provision was enacted as part of a statute addressing China's accession to the WTO. The President chose to maintain the tariffs on Chinese tires, despite the option to review or modify them after six months. China's WTO Accession Protocol allows safeguards until December 2013 to address market disruption caused by Chinese imports. China requested consultations with the United States under the WTO Understanding on Rules and Procedures Governing the Settlement of Disputes in 2009, claiming that additional tariffs on Chinese tires are inconsistent with U.S. GATT obligations. The dispute panel was requested by China, arguing that Section 421 and its application are inconsistent with U.S. obligations under the Protocol. The WTO dispute panel rejected China's claims regarding U.S. actions under the Protocol. The WTO Appellate Body upheld the panel's determinations, leading to the termination of the dispute on October 5, 2011. The report discusses WTO safeguards provisions, the China-specific safeguard, Section 421 of the Trade Act of 1974, the ITC determination, and the President's decision on providing relief in 2009. The WTO dispute panel rejected China's claims regarding U.S. actions under the Protocol, leading to the termination of the dispute on October 5, 2011. Safeguard measures are authorized under U.S. law in Title II of the Trade Act of 1974, permitting WTO members to apply safeguards to remedy serious injury to domestic industries caused by surges of imported products. The Trade Act of 1974 and Article XIX of the GATT 1994 provide a legal foundation for safeguards to address surges of imported products causing serious injury to domestic industries. The Trade Act of 1974 and Article XIX of the GATT 1994 provide a legal foundation for safeguards to address surges of imported products causing serious injury to domestic industries. Safeguards may include tariff surcharges, import quotas, and tariff-rate quotas as exceptional measures under Article XIX. Article XIX of the GATT 1994 allows for emergency actions on imports of specific products when there is a threat of serious harm to domestic producers. These safeguard measures are meant to be extraordinary and urgent, to be invoked only in unforeseen situations that were not expected when the obligation was incurred. Article XIX of the GATT 1994 allows for emergency actions on imports of specific products when there is a threat of serious harm to domestic producers. The remedy it provides is to temporarily suspend, withdraw, or modify the obligation in whole or in part. The Agreement on Safeguards further specifies that safeguards can only be imposed after an investigation to determine if the conditions have been met, and that increased imports leading to serious injury can be absolute or relative to domestic production. The Agreement on Safeguards outlines requirements for domestic safeguards investigations and determinations of serious injury. WTO members imposing safeguards must notify the WTO Committee on Safeguards and consult with affected members. The WTO Appellate Body has ruled that safeguards must comply with both Article XIX of the GATT and the Safeguards Agreement. The Safeguards Agreement provisions apply cumulatively, with no conflict in this situation. \"Unforeseen developments\" are required to impose a safeguard measure. The \"serious injury\" standard in the Agreement is defined as a significant overall impairment in a domestic industry's position, which is considered very high by the WTO Appellate Body. This standard is stricter than the \"material injury\" standard in other trade agreements. The Safeguards Agreement allows for safeguards to be applied based on increased import volume, not unfair trade actions like dumping or subsidization. It must be applied on a nondiscriminatory basis and has a time limit of four years, extendable up to eight years. While quantitative restrictions are allowed, voluntary export restraints or similar measures are prohibited under the Agreement. The WTO Safeguards Agreement allows for safeguards to be imposed on imports based on increased volume, not unfair trade practices like dumping or subsidization. The member intending to impose the safeguard must notify the WTO in advance and consult with members with a substantial export interest. Provisional safeguards can be applied in critical circumstances to prevent damage that would be difficult to repair. The WTO Safeguards Agreement allows for safeguards to be imposed on imports based on increased volume, not unfair trade practices like dumping or subsidization. Members must notify the WTO in advance and consult with those with a substantial export interest. If there is clear evidence of serious injury, safeguards can be applied to prevent damage that would be difficult to repair. Trade compensation may be agreed upon to maintain a substantially equivalent level of concessions. If no agreement is reached, the importing member is free to impose the safeguard measure. The Safeguards Agreement allows for safeguards to be imposed on imports based on increased volume, not unfair trade practices like dumping or subsidization. If no agreement is reached within 30 days of WTO consultations, affected exporting members have the right to suspend concessions owed the importing member. The affected member must inform the WTO Council on Trade in Goods of its proposed measure and may suspend concessions no later than 90 days after the safeguard is applied, provided certain conditions are met. Article 8.3 of the Agreement prohibits members from exercising their \"right of suspension\" for the first three years of a safeguard measure, if it is due to an absolute increase in imports and consistent with the Safeguards Agreement. WTO members have challenged U.S. safeguards successfully, with findings of inconsistency with GATT Article XIX. The United States was found to have acted inconsistently with GATT Article XIX or the Safeguards Agreement due to inadequate analysis of unforeseen developments, increased imports, serious injury, and causation. When a country accedes to the WTO, it negotiates terms both multilaterally and bilaterally, with bilateral negotiations involving market access concessions and commitments in goods and services. The United States and China agreed to a temporary China-specific safeguard in their bilateral negotiations during China's accession to the WTO. This safeguard, included in China's Accession Protocol, allows for protection against import surges causing harm to domestic producers. The provision will expire 12 years after China's accession on December 10, 2013. The China-specific safeguard in the WTO Accession Protocol allows for protection against import surges causing market disruption to domestic producers of similar products. Market disruption is defined by rapid increases in imports causing material injury or threat to the domestic industry, based on objective factors like import volume and impact on prices. The China-specific safeguard in the WTO Accession Protocol allows for protection against import surges causing market disruption to domestic producers of similar products. If consultations do not lead to an agreement within 60 days, China must take action to prevent or remedy the market disruption. The China-specific safeguard in the WTO Accession Protocol allows for protection against import surges causing market disruption to domestic producers of similar products. If consultations do not lead to an agreement within 60 days, the importing member can withdraw concessions or limit imports to prevent or remedy market disruption. This safeguard applies only to goods of Chinese origin and does not restrict the type of safeguard measures that may be applied. Paragraph 16.6 of the Accession Protocol allows safeguards to prevent market disruption without a limit on duration. China can suspend GATT concessions if safeguards last over two or three years. The China-specific safeguard permits provisional measures in critical circumstances. The China-specific safeguard allows provisional measures in critical circumstances for up to 200 days. WTO members can request bilateral consultations with China if significant trade diversion occurs due to another member's safeguard measure. The safeguard differs from traditional safeguards by allowing China to address imports causing material injury. The China-specific safeguard allows measures to address imports causing material injury, including voluntary export restraints. The safeguard, implemented in U.S. law under Section 421 of the Trade Act of 1974, permits actions based on a lower showing of injury and specifically targets imports from China. The China-specific safeguard under Section 421 of the Trade Act of 1974 allows the President to grant most-favored-nation tariff treatment to Chinese goods upon China's WTO accession. Section 421 is a temporary trade remedy designed to address concerns about increased import competition from China. It will expire 12 years after China's WTO Accession Protocol enters into force. Section 201 of the Trade Act of 1974 allows the President to impose import restrictions if the U.S. International Trade Commission finds a surge in imports causing serious injury to a domestic industry. Section 421 provides legal authority to respond to injurious import surges, specifically from the People's Republic of China. The Trade Act of 1974 allows the President to impose import restrictions in case of a surge in imports causing serious injury to a domestic industry. Section 421 specifically addresses injurious import surges from China, allowing for increased duties or import restrictions to prevent market disruption. The process involves initiation through petition or governmental action. The Trade Act of 1974 allows the President to impose import restrictions in case of a surge in imports causing serious injury to a domestic industry, specifically addressing injurious import surges from China. The process involves initiation through petition or governmental action, followed by an investigation, ITC vote, recommendations to the President, negotiations with China, public hearing on remedies, USTR recommendation to the President, presidential determination on action, and application of a remedy through tariffs or import restrictions. The Trade Act of 1974 allows the President to impose import restrictions in case of a surge in imports causing serious injury to a domestic industry, specifically addressing injurious import surges from China. The Section 421 investigation process involves initiation through petition, presidential request, congressional resolution, or ITC's own motion, with no industry support requirement for investigations initiated by petition. The ITC must promptly investigate to determine if Chinese products are causing market disruption. The ITC must determine market disruption by analyzing factors such as import volume, price effects, and impact on domestic industry. The determination must be made within 60 days and can be decided by a majority vote if commissioners are evenly divided. The ITC must propose remedies within 20 days of an affirmative determination to prevent market disruption. Only commissioners who agreed to the determination can vote on the proposed action. The report must be submitted to the President and USTR, including the determination, recommendations for remedies, and reasons for them. Members who did not agree can submit separate reviews on actions to prevent market disruption. The ITC must propose remedies within 20 days of an affirmative determination to prevent market disruption. The report must be submitted to the President and USTR, including recommendations for remedies and reasons for them. Members who did not agree can submit separate reviews on actions to prevent market disruption. The USTR must make a recommendation to the President within 55 days after receiving the ITC report on actions to prevent or remedy market disruption. The USTR is authorized to negotiate agreements with China to address market disruption, with negotiations starting within five days of an affirmative ITC determination. The President can prescribe regulations to implement any agreements reached. The President is authorized to prescribe regulations for goods covered by agreements with China. If no agreement is reached or if the President deems it ineffective, import relief can be provided. Relief must be given within 15 days of a USTR recommendation, unless it is against national economic interest or national security. The President has the authority to impose increased duties or import restrictions on products if it is determined that the action would negatively impact the US economy more than the benefits. Import relief must be implemented within 15 days of the decision and regulations must be established for its administration. After six months, the President can request a report from the ITC on the potential effects of modifying or reducing the safeguard. The ITC must investigate the effects of modifying, reducing, or terminating a safeguard on the relevant industry. The President can take necessary action based on the report within 60 days. The President can also extend the safeguard under certain conditions. If a petition is filed between six to nine months before the safeguard expires, the ITC must conduct an investigation and provide a determination within 60 days. If the determination is affirmative, the President may extend the safeguard. The ITC can investigate the effects of modifying, reducing, or terminating a safeguard on the industry. The President may extend the safeguard if an affirmative determination is made and it is deemed necessary to prevent market disruption. Previous ITC investigations covered various products, with affirmative determinations for some imports and negative determinations for others. President George W. Bush declined to provide relief in cases where affirmative determinations were made. The President's decision not to provide relief under Section 421 has been deemed discretionary and not reviewable by a court. In Motion Systems Corp. v. Bush, the industry plaintiff argued that the President had exceeded his statutory authority following an ITC recommendation for import quotas to remedy market disruption affecting the domestic pedestal actuator industry. The plaintiff also alleged procedural violations by the United States Trade Representative. The CAFC stated that the plaintiff had limited options to seek relief after procedural violations in the public hearing following the ITC's import relief determination. The plaintiff could only pursue relief through judicial review provisions of the APA or some form of nonstatutory review, as suing the President and Trade Representative in the Court of International Trade was not an option. The court discussed the plaintiff's limited options for seeking relief after procedural violations in a public hearing following the ITC's import relief determination. It mentioned the possibility of challenging the President's discretionary actions under 19 U.S.C. \u00a72451 as outside the scope of authority delegated by Congress, citing the Dalton v. Specter case. The court emphasized that judicial review of presidential action may not be available if a statute commits a decision to the President's discretion. The court concluded that Section 421 gives the President broad discretion to determine national economic interest and national security harm, similar to cases where Presidential action is not subject to judicial review. The USTR's actions under Section 421 were deemed as recommendations to the President and not final actions under the APA, thus not reviewable by the court. The ITC initiated an investigation (TA-421-7) on certain passenger vehicle and light truck tires from China. In June 2009, the ITC voted 4-2 that imports of the tires were causing market disruption to domestic producers. They recommended imposing an additional duty on the imported tires for three years, starting with a 55% ad valorem duty in the first year. The ITC also suggested expedited consideration of trade adjustment assistance for affected firms or workers. The report was submitted to the President and U.S. Trade Representative on July 9. The agency submitted a report to the President and U.S. Trade Representative on July 9, 2009, regarding import relief for rubber tires used on passenger vehicles and light trucks. The President proclaimed increased tariffs effective September 26, 2009, at lower rates than recommended by the ITC. Additionally, the President directed assistance for affected workers, firms, and communities. The ITC found that truck tire imports from China increased rapidly between 2004-2008, with a significant rise in both quantity and value. The ITC found a significant increase in truck tire imports from China between 2004 and 2008, with substantial rises in both quantity and value. The ratio of subject imports to U.S. production and apparent consumption also increased during this period, reaching their highest levels in 2008. The increases in subject imports were not gradual or small, as claimed by respondents, but rather substantial and ongoing. The subject imports of passenger vehicle and light truck tires increased significantly throughout the period, reaching their highest levels in 2008. The domestic industry consists of 10 U.S. producers with varying levels of operations. In 2008, U.S. producers had 28 manufacturing plants for these tires. In 2008, U.S. producers manufactured tires in 28 plants, with most plants dedicated to producing tires for replacement market. Approximately 82% of domestic shipments went to replacement market, while the rest went to OEMs. Domestic producers made a full range of passenger vehicle and light truck tires in various price ranges. The ITC found that the domestic industry was materially injured in 2008, with all industry indicators declining. In 2008, U.S. tire producers' performance hit lowest levels, with capacity utilization nearly equaling 2006 lows. Several plants closed, with plans for more closures in 2009. R&D expenses and capital expenditures increased, but overall industry indicators declined. The ITC analyzed the impact of rapidly increasing tire imports on the domestic industry. The ITC found that the rapid increase in tire imports from China has led to a significant displacement of U.S. producers in the lower-priced segment of the market, causing a decline in the domestic tire industry's financial performance, capacity, production, shipments, and employment. This trend is attributed to the close substitutability of domestic and imported tires, as well as underselling by Chinese producers. The ITC found that Chinese tire imports significantly eroded the domestic industry's market share, leading to a substantial reduction in capacity, production, shipments, and employment. U.S. producers were forced to focus on profitable areas due to underselling by Chinese producers, resulting in plant closures and capacity reductions. The ITC proposed a three-year duty increase on Chinese tires, starting at 55% ad valorem and decreasing to 35% ad valorem in the final year. This was in response to concerns about Chinese government policies undermining the effect of a duty and the domestic industry's strategy of moving away from the economy segment of the market. The ITC recommended a three-year duty increase on Chinese tires, starting at 55% ad valorem and decreasing to 35% ad valorem in the final year. This tariff hike aims to boost the domestic industry by reducing imports, raising prices, and increasing production, sales, and employment. The recommended duty increase on Chinese tires aims to boost the domestic industry by increasing production, sales, and employment. The phasedown of duties over three years is designed to give breathing space for adjustment to import competition and limit non-subject suppliers' export response. Tariff protection is expected to decrease as new investments and adjustments are made. The recommended duty increase on Chinese tires aims to address market disruption caused by the subject tires. The remedy is not intended to restore the domestic industry to pre-recession levels but to give firms time to make necessary adjustments. The relief is expected to have minimal impact on the U.S. automobile industry as tires account for a small part of manufacturing costs. The remedy is recommended to remain in place for three years to allow for industry adjustments. The dissenting commissioners believe that trade restrictions will not effectively help the tire industry workers and may disrupt the U.S. market. They suggest focusing on providing economic adjustment assistance to displaced tire workers instead. The dissenting commissioners believe that trade restrictions may not effectively help the tire industry workers and suggest focusing on providing economic adjustment assistance to displaced workers. They proposed a tariff-rate quota for tires to avoid a large increase in costs for customers and provide pricing stability in the U.S. market. The President decided to implement increased tariffs for three years, starting on September 26, 2009, with lower annual rates than recommended by the agency. Under the President's proclamation in 2009, Chinese passenger and light truck tires face additional tariffs of 35%, 30%, and 25% ad valorem over three years. The President directed economic assistance for domestic vehicle producers and workers. After six months, the President could request the ITC to assess the impact of modifying or terminating the tariffs. The President imposed additional tariffs on Chinese tires in 2009, with provisions for the ITC to assess the impact and recommend modifications. China requested WTO consultations over the tariffs, leading to a dispute settlement panel being established in 2010. China requested the WTO Director-General to appoint panelists in a dispute over higher tariffs imposed by the US on Chinese tires. This was the first panel to review a special safeguard action against Chinese goods. China claimed the tariffs were inconsistent with WTO rules. The US imposed higher tariffs on Chinese tires, which China challenged at the WTO. China argued that the tariffs violated GATT rules, specifically the most-favored-nation obligation and restrictions on imposing tariffs above negotiated rates. China also questioned the US justification for the restrictions under the China-specific safeguard, rather than as a safeguard action under GATT Article XIX and the Agreement on Safeguards. China challenged the US tariffs on Chinese tires at the WTO, arguing that they violated GATT rules and the China-specific safeguard provisions. China claimed that the tariffs weakened the standard of 'significant cause' and were not justified as imports from China were not increasing rapidly or causing material injury. China challenged US tariffs on Chinese tires at the WTO, arguing they violated GATT rules and China-specific safeguard provisions. China claimed the tariffs were not a 'significant cause' of injury, blaming other market factors instead. The restrictions were deemed unnecessary and imposed for longer than needed, exceeding what was required to prevent market disruption. China highlighted the absence of a safeguard requirement under GATT Article I:1 in its legal argument. The WTO Agreement on Safeguards allows members to impose safeguard tariffs on injurious imports, temporarily escaping tariff concessions owed to other members if requirements are met. The China-specific provision, agreed upon by all WTO members, does not require global application and does not provide a legal basis for complaint. China's challenge focused on the consistency of US statute and its application to Chinese tires with GATT rules. The WTO panel rejected all of China's claims regarding the consistency of the U.S. statute and its application to Chinese tires with paragraph 16 of China's Accession Protocol. The panel highlighted the unique aspects of the case, including the relationship of the China-specific safeguard to global mechanisms, the ITC causation determination, and the impact of the global economic downturn on the investigation. The WTO panel rejected China's claims on the U.S. safeguard measures for Chinese tires, highlighting the global economic downturn's impact on the investigation. The panel emphasized its role in interpreting the China-specific safeguard, not recalibrating WTO agreements based on changing economic circumstances. The panel in a trade remedy case agreed that they should not conduct a de novo review or grant total deference to an investigation authority. They would evaluate whether the ITC had considered objective factors and provided a reasoned explanation of its determination. The panel would also interpret phrases like \"increasing rapidly\" and \"significant cause\" in the context of the case. The panel in a trade remedy case considered the provisions of GATT Article XIX and the Safeguards Agreement. They rejected China's argument that imports must show a quick progression in the rate of increase. The Protocol does not require a rapid increase in the rate of imports, only a rapid increase in imports on an absolute or relative basis. The panel dismissed China's argument about a \"low base\" at the beginning of the investigation, stating that gaining market share and becoming the largest import source showed significant presence in the market. They also found that the causation standard in the U.S. statute required a \"contributes significantly\" standard. The panel found that Section 421(c)(2) does not require the United States to establish causation inconsistently with Paragraph 16. They also discussed the nature of the causation analysis required under Paragraph 16, including the consideration of conditions of competition and correlation. The panel stated that Paragraph 16.4 does not obligate the importing member to apply any particular methodology for establishing market disruption, requiring only the consideration of \"objective factors.\" The panel found that Paragraph 16.4 does not require strict \"non-attribution\" analysis under the WTO Safeguards Agreement, but it does require some form of analysis of the injurious effects of other factors. The panel upheld the ITC's analysis of the conditions of competition between Chinese and domestic tires, as well as the ITC's approach to correlation, noting that correlation is an investigative tool that may be used to demonstrate causation. The panel upheld the ITC's analysis of the conditions of competition between Chinese and domestic tires, noting that correlation is an investigative tool that may be used to demonstrate causation. It stated that causation does not have to be based solely on correlation, and that a finding of \"significant cause\" is not excluded even if based on an overall coincidence between import increases and injury indicators. The panel noted that the ITC did not fully assess factors other than increased imports that could have caused injury to the domestic industry. The majority and dissenting ITC Commissioners had conflicting views on whether the industry's relocation strategy was a response to increased imports or an independent business strategy. The panel refrained from choosing between these views. The panel found it difficult to separate the business strategy from increasing imports. They could not determine if the relocation to China was a response to imports or an independent strategy. The decision to close plants may have been linked to competition from imports. China failed to make a prima facie case that the ITC's analysis was in error. The panel rejected China's non-attribution arguments. The panel rejected China's arguments on non-attribution and the scope and duration of the U.S. remedy for tires. China failed to show that the safeguard measure was excessive. The panel found that a measure seeking to improve the domestic industry's condition is not necessarily excessive. It can be justified if aimed at reducing subject imports and raising their prices in the U.S. market. However, the remedy may allow for the expansion of non-subject imports instead of improving the domestic industry. China failed to make a prima facie case against a three-year safeguard. China failed to prove that a three-year safeguard was excessive, as the United States was not obligated to justify the length of the measure or quantify the injury from increasing imports. The panel also rejected China's GATT claims, which were dependent on Paragraph 16 of the Protocol. China appealed the panel's decision, focusing on misinterpretation of phrases in the Accession Protocol. The WTO Appellate Body upheld all panel findings appealed by China regarding tire imports increasing rapidly. The AB determined that investigating agencies must examine import trends over a recent period to determine if imports are significantly increasing within a short time frame. The WTO Appellate Body upheld panel findings that tire imports were increasing rapidly, emphasizing the need to assess import trends over a recent period. The AB rejected China's claim that the USITC erred in its analysis of import rates, stating that subject imports continued to increase significantly at the end of the investigation period. The AB considered the meaning of \"significant cause\" in the context of the case, stating that rapidly increasing imports from China must play an important role in causing injury to the domestic industry. China argued for a stronger causal link between imports and injury, calling for a more detailed analysis of competition conditions and injury indicators. The AB emphasized the importance of analyzing competition conditions and correlation to establish a causal link between imports and injury to the domestic industry. China's call for a stronger causal link was rejected in favor of a more flexible approach by the investigating authorities. The AB emphasized the need for a careful analysis of competitive conditions and correlation to determine causation in cases of injury to the domestic industry. Investigating authorities were advised to calibrate their analysis based on the specific circumstances of each case. Non-attribution analysis was deemed necessary to assess the significance of rapidly increasing imports as a cause of material injury. The AB emphasized the need for a careful analysis of competitive conditions and correlation to determine causation in cases of injury to the domestic industry. Non-attribution analysis was deemed necessary to assess the significance of rapidly increasing imports as a cause of material injury, ensuring effects of other known causes are not improperly attributed. The AB found that the investigating agency must consider the impact of other relevant causes and assess the significance of the effects of rapidly increasing imports in the context of other known causal factors. The AB upheld the panel's determination that competition between imported and domestic tires in the replacement market was significant. China argued that the panel should have focused on competition in the OEM market, but the USITC's reliance on China's growing presence in the OEM market was deemed reasonable. China further contended that the combined effect of attenuated competition in both markets was not properly considered in the assessment of competition in the overall US market. The AB upheld the Panel's determination that competition between imported and domestic tires in the replacement market was significant, despite the Panel's limited analysis of the OEM market. The significant presence of Chinese tires in the replacement market, along with their growing presence in the OEM market, supported the conclusion of significant competition in the overall US market. The AB also upheld the Panel's finding of correlation between an upward movement in subject imports and domestic tires in the US market. The AB upheld the Panel's findings on the correlation between an increase in subject imports and a decrease in injury factors, rejecting China's argument for stricter correlation. The USITC's causation determination was deemed reasonable, and the reports were adopted by the WTO Dispute Settlement Body, effectively ending the dispute with no further recourse for China under WTO rules. The WTO member affected by increased imports of Chinese products can request consultations with China to address market disruption. If necessary, China must take action to prevent or remedy the disruption, notifying the Committee on Safeguards. If consultations between China and the affected WTO member do not result in an agreement within 60 days, the affected member can limit imports to prevent market disruption. Market disruption occurs when imports of similar products are rapidly increasing, causing significant harm to the domestic industry. Factors such as import volume and impact on prices are considered in determining market disruption. Prior to applying a measure to prevent market disruption, a WTO member must consider factors like import volume, impact on prices, and effects on the domestic industry. The member must provide public notice, allow for input from interested parties, and only apply the measure for as long as necessary to address the disruption. China has the right to suspend concessions or obligations under the GATT 1994 if a measure is taken due to an increase in imports, lasting more than two years for relative increase and more than three years for absolute increase. Immediate notification to the Committee on Safeguards is required. In critical circumstances, a WTO member can take provisional safeguard measures if delay would cause irreparable damage. In cases of market disruption caused by imports, provisional safeguard measures can be taken for up to 200 days. If significant trade diversions occur, consultations with China and/or WTO members can be requested within 30 days. If no agreement is reached within 60 days, further actions can be taken. If no agreement is reached between China and WTO members within 60 days after notification, the requesting WTO member can withdraw concessions or limit imports from China to prevent diversions. Application of this Section will end 12 years after accession."
