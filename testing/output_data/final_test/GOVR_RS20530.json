    "content": "The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) is an agency of the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) that insures private mortgage lenders against borrower defaults on certain mortgage loans. FHA insurance protects lenders, not borrowers, in the event of default. To be eligible for FHA insurance, the mortgage must meet certain criteria and be originated by an approved lender. FHA is one of three government agencies that provide insurance on home mortgages, along with the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and the United States. The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) provides insurance to private lenders for certain mortgage loans, unlike VA and USDA programs, FHA-insured mortgages are more broadly available. Factors like maximum mortgage amount, insurance fees, and eligibility standards can limit the attractiveness of FHA-insured mortgages. This report gives an overview of FHA's history, market role, eligibility criteria, and data on insured mortgages. It does not delve into FHA's financial status. The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) was established in 1934 during the Great Depression to promote lending for housing and stimulate the construction industry. Before FHA, mortgages were limited to 50% of property value and had short terms with balloon payments. Lenders were reluctant to refinance loans during the Depression. FHA's financial status is detailed in CRS Report R42875. During the Great Depression, lenders were hesitant to refinance loans, leading to foreclosures and losses. The FHA introduced 20-year mortgages with full repayment at the end, insuring lenders against defaults. This standardized mortgages and boosted confidence in the market, eventually leading to the widespread use of 15- and 30-year mortgages. FHA later became part of HUD in 1965. The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) was created in 1934 to provide affordable mortgages, later becoming part of the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) in 1965. FHA plays a countercyclical role in the mortgage market by insuring mortgages during economic downturns, making it easier for households with limited funds or credit issues to access mortgage credit. FHA mortgage insurance aims to help borrowers with small down payments or weaker credit histories access affordable mortgages by insuring lenders against borrower default. FHA-insured loans have lower down payment requirements than conventional mortgages, making homeownership more accessible for first-time and lower-income homebuyers. The smaller down payment requirement for FHA-insured loans allows some households to obtain a mortgage earlier. FHA-insured mortgages have less stringent credit history requirements, making them attractive to borrowers without traditional credit histories. FHA-insured mortgages are popular among first-time homebuyers, low- and moderate-income households, and minorities. In FY2018, over one-third of all FHA loans were obtained by minority households and accounted for 57% of mortgages to low- or moderate-income borrowers. FHA-insured mortgages, popular among first-time homebuyers, have similarities to subprime mortgages but with restrictions on features like negative amortization. FHA-insured mortgages have restrictions on features like negative amortization and can include adjustable interest rates. Some believe these mortgages are risky due to factors like low down payments and lower credit scores. FHA plays a countercyclical role in the mortgage market by insuring more mortgages during tight credit markets. FHA-insured mortgages are important during economic turmoil when lenders tighten credit standards. They offer favorable terms and are available to owner-occupants of single-family homes. FHA-insured loans must be underwritten prudently. FHA-insured loans require prudent underwriting, considering factors like credit, financial status, income, and debts. Applicants with previous mortgage foreclosures are ineligible for at least three years. Mortgage payment should not exceed 31% of income, total obligations should not exceed 43%. Borrowers can qualify with compensating factors like cash reserves. Minimum credit score of 500 has been required since October 4, 2010. FHA-insured loans require a minimum credit score of 500 since October 4, 2010. Borrowers must intend to occupy the property as a principal residence. These loans can be used for various purposes such as purchasing homes, building homes, refinancing, and making energy efficiency improvements. Loan terms can be up to 30 years. FHA-insured mortgages offer loan terms up to 30 years with negotiated interest rates. Borrowers can choose between fixed or adjustable rates. A minimum down payment of 3.5% in cash is required, as per the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008. Prohibited funding sources include the home seller and entities benefiting from the transaction. Since October 4, 2010, FHA requires a 10% down payment for borrowers with credit scores between 500 and 579, while those with scores of 580 or above must make a 3.5% down payment. FHA no longer insures loans for borrowers with credit scores below 500. There is no income limit for FHA-insured loans, but the maximum mortgage amount is capped by law and varies by area. Different limits apply for properties with one to four units. Since 2008, Congress temporarily increased FHA's maximum mortgage amounts to help more households qualify for loans during tighter credit conditions. The Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 later established new permanent maximum mortgage amounts, which were higher than previous limits but lower than the temporary ones. The higher temporary limits were extended until the end of 2013, and since January 1, 2014, the maximum mortgage amounts have been set at the permanent HERA levels. Since January 1, 2014, FHA's maximum mortgage amounts have been set at the permanent HERA levels. For a one-unit home, the maximum mortgage amounts are 115% of area median home prices, with a floor of $314,827 and a ceiling of $726,525. Borrowers pay upfront and annual mortgage insurance premiums. Since April 9, 2012, HUD has set the maximum upfront premium for FHA insurance at 1.75% of the loan amount, regardless of whether the borrower is a first-time homebuyer or not. The annual premium amount varies based on the initial loan-to-value ratio. FHA sets maximum upfront premium at 1.75% of loan amount since April 9, 2012. Annual premiums vary based on loan-to-value ratio. In January 2015, FHA decreased annual premiums for most single-family loans to 0.85% for ratios above 95% and 0.80% for ratios at or below 95%. This was a decrease from previous rates of 1.35% and 1.30% charged until January 26, 2015. The FHA charges different annual premiums for single-family mortgages based on certain circumstances. Borrowers may have been eligible for refunds of up-front insurance premiums in the past, but a law amendment in 2005 restricted refunds except for refinancing FHA-insured loans. After three years, the up-front insurance premium paid by borrowers refinancing existing FHA-insured loans is considered \"earned\" by FHA, making them ineligible for refunds. Annual mortgage insurance premiums are non-refundable. FHA previously automatically canceled annual mortgage insurance premiums when the loan balance reached 78% of the initial property value, but for loans after June 3, 2013, the premium is charged for the life of the loan for most mortgages due to financial concerns. The FHA insurance fund may have to pay insurance claims on defaulted mortgages where borrowers stopped paying premiums. An FHA-insured mortgage is delinquent if a payment is missed, and foreclosure can be initiated after three unpaid monthly installments. Loss mitigation strategies were authorized by Congress in 1996 to reduce FHA loan defaults. Loss mitigation strategies for FHA loans were authorized by Congress in 1996 to minimize foreclosures. Mortgage servicers must contact borrowers to evaluate eligibility for various options, which are categorized as home retention or home disposition. Specific criteria apply to each option, and they must be considered in a specific order. Additional options are available for certain borrower populations. Additional loss mitigation options are available for certain populations of borrowers, such as defaulted borrowers in military service who may be eligible to suspend principal payments and only pay interest during their service period. FHA's single-family mortgage insurance program is funded through the MMI Fund, with cash flows primarily from insurance premiums and proceeds from foreclosed home sales. The MMI Fund pays claims to lenders for defaulted mortgages. The Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 governs how FHA-insured mortgages are accounted for in the federal budget. It requires the estimated lifetime costs of guaranteed loans to be recorded in the year they are insured. This ensures that the program's financial status is accurately reflected. The Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 governs the accounting of FHA-insured mortgages in the federal budget. The program generates negative credit subsidy when the cash flows result in less money coming in than going out, requiring no appropriations. MMI Fund historically generates negative credit subsidy and receives appropriations for salaries and administrative expenses. Each year, credit subsidy rates for FHA-insured loans are re-estimated based on actual performance and economic projections. Funds are held in the Financing Account for expected future costs and the Capital Reserve Account for unexpected costs. Transfers between accounts are made to ensure enough funds are available. At the end of FY2013, FHA received $1.7 billion from Treasury to transfer funds between accounts. The funds were held in the Financing Account for insurance claims, if needed, maintaining a capital ratio of at least 2%. No additional funds from Treasury have been required since then. The capital ratio measures the funds on hand and future cash flows of the MMI Fund, expressed as a percentage of total insured mortgages. It ensures the fund can handle loan cost increases. The ratio fell below 2% in FY2009 but exceeded it in FY2015. The capital ratio for the MMI Fund exceeded the 2% threshold in FY2015, improving from previous years. It has remained above 2% since then, reaching 2.76% in FY2018. A low or negative ratio raises concerns about FHA needing assistance to cover future losses. FHA has taken steps to strengthen the insurance fund post-housing market turmoil in 2007. The FHA has implemented measures to strengthen its insurance fund, such as increasing down payment requirements for low credit score borrowers and enhancing oversight of approved lenders. The number of new mortgages insured by FHA peaked at 1.8 million in FY2009 during the housing market turmoil, decreasing slightly in subsequent years. In FY2018, FHA insured over 1 million new mortgages with a total loan balance of $209 billion, primarily for home purchases. In FY2018, FHA insured a total of over 8 million single-family loans with an outstanding balance of nearly $1.2 trillion. Since 1934, FHA has insured over 47.5 million home loans, with a market share compared to the total amount of mortgages originated or outstanding. FHA's market share can be measured in various ways, such as the number of FHA-insured mortgages divided by the total number of mortgages or the dollar volume of FHA-insured mortgages divided by the total dollar volume of mortgages. It can be reported as a share of all mortgages or only as a share of home purchase mortgages. The market share can be based on mortgages originated within a specific time period or all mortgages outstanding at a point in time. Between 1996 and 2002, FHA's market share averaged around 14% of the home purchase mortgage market and 11% of the overall mortgage market. However, by 2005, FHA's market share had dropped to less than 5% of home-purchase mortgages and about 3% of the overall mortgage market due to economic conditions and tightening mortgage credit. During the housing market turmoil starting in 2007, FHA's market share increased significantly, peaking at over 30% of home-purchase mortgages in 2009 and 2010. In 2017, FHA insured 19.5% of new home purchase mortgages and about 16.7% of new mortgages overall, a slight decrease from 2016. FHA's market share can be measured in various ways, with the highest share seen in home purchase mortgages. The increase in FHA's market share after 2007 was influenced by factors such as the housing market turmoil, economic instability, and changes in lending practices. Congress also raised the maximum mortgage amounts that FHA can insure in 2008, making FHA-insured mortgages a more viable option for some borrowers. FHA's market share has decreased somewhat from its peak during the housing market turmoil, but it remains higher than in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Factors contributing to this decrease include lower loan limits in high-cost areas, higher mortgage insurance premiums, and increased availability of non-FHA-insured mortgages. The appropriate market share for FHA is a subject of ongoing debate among policymakers, likely to continue in discussions about the future of the U.S. housing finance system."
