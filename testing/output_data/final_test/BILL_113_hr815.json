The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 introduces a new exemption for small businesses regarding increased wage distributions. This exemption allows corporations designated as small business concerns to exclude increased-wage exempt-dividends from gross income when distributed to individuals. The corporation can designate dividends as increased-wage exempt-dividends as long as the total amount designated does not exceed the wage increase amount for the taxable year. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 introduces a new exemption for small businesses regarding increased wage distributions from partnerships. No gain shall be recognized on any increased-wage partnership distribution to individuals, and no reduction shall be made to the adjusted basis of the partner's interest in the partnership. An increased-wage partnership distribution refers to any cash distribution. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 allows small businesses to designate cash distributions as increased-wage partnership distributions, limited by the wage increase amount for the taxable year. The wage increase amount is the sum of any excess wages for the corporation or partnership for that year. The term 'qualified wages' for a corporation or partnership is the excess of aggregate qualified wages paid for the current year over the previous year, plus any increased-wage exempt-dividends or partnership distributions received during the current year. The text discusses the aggregation rule for treating certain persons as a single employer and includes provisions for the treatment of predecessors. It also defines a small business concern and makes conforming amendments to the tax code. The text introduces a new subclause related to increased-wage exempt-dividend and amends the table of sections in the tax code. The amendments made by this section apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2012."
