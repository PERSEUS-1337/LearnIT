The bald eagle, designated as the national emblem of the United States in 1782, symbolizes freedom, democracy, and American values. It is unique to North America and is prominently featured in the Great Seal of the United States and various government seals. The bald eagle, symbolizing freedom and American values, has influenced various aspects of American culture since the nation's founding. It was once endangered but is now gradually recovering in the US. The bald eagle was listed as an endangered species in 1973 under the Endangered Species Act, later upgraded to threatened status in 1995. Efforts from various agencies and organizations led to the initial recovery of the bald eagle population in the US. The administration is expected to delist the bald eagle from both endangered and threatened species lists by 2008, emphasizing the need for continued care and protection of the species and its habitat for full recovery and survival. The bald eagle nests in 49 States will require continual monitoring after being removed from the Endangered Species Act in 2008, necessitating substantial funding due to budget cuts. Congress wishes to offer the opportunity for voluntary fundraising for bald eagle recovery efforts through a special American Eagle Fund endowment managed by the American Eagle Foundation. Authorization for coins celebrating the bald eagle's recovery and restoration as a symbol of freedom is deemed appropriate. The bald eagle, symbol of freedom in the US, is commemorated for being removed from the endangered species list under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, marking the 35th anniversary of the Act.
