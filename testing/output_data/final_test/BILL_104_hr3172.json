    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Clean Power Production Act\". The Congress acknowledges that electric power utilities are a source of air pollutant emissions and that the industry is undergoing restructuring and deregulation. This restructuring poses risks of increased emissions and environmental damages, despite the potential economic benefits of increased competition. Studies have raised concerns about the environmental impacts of this restructuring. The impacts of electric utility restructuring on the environment are being considered, with proposed actions by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. States have proposed measures to mitigate these impacts, but there are no regional or national strategies in place. It is deemed necessary to further examine the environmental impacts and develop comprehensive strategies and policies. Cooperation between Federal and State regulators, environmental authorities, and other stakeholders is seen as crucial. The formulation of new policies and procedures is needed to prevent a decrease in environmental quality due to electric utility restructuring. Cooperation among regulators, environmental authorities, and stakeholders is crucial. SEC. 3. ASSESSMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS. The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency will assess environmental impacts of electric utility restructuring, considering changes in regulatory laws and their effects on emissions of air pollutants, carbon dioxide, greenhouse gases, and land/water impacts. Collaboration with relevant authorities is required for the assessment. The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency will assess environmental impacts of electric utility restructuring, collaborating with relevant authorities. A report will be submitted to Congress within 6 months, with an authorization of appropriations not exceeding $1,000,000 for the assessment in fiscal year 1997. The Commission will be established as part of the electric utility restructuring assessment, with a budget not exceeding $1,000,000 for the fiscal year 1997. The Commission for Environmental Mitigation of Electric Utility Restructuring will be established by the Administrator and the Secretary of Energy. Its purpose is to develop strategies and policies to mitigate environmental impacts without reducing the benefits of restructuring or compromising competition. The Commission for Environmental Mitigation of Electric Utility Restructuring will consider impacts on companies, rely on voluntary measures, be flexible, mitigate environmental impacts, comply with environmental laws, and help achieve environmental and energy policy goals. Within 12 months of the Act's enactment, a report will be submitted. Within 12 months of the Act's enactment, the Commission will submit a report to Congress with recommendations for altering federal environmental statutes, rules for power systems, regional mechanisms, and policies to mitigate environmental impacts. $1,000,000 is authorized for appropriations in fiscal years 1997 and 1998. The Commission will receive $1,000,000 each for the fiscal years 1997 and 1998, allocated to the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Energy for carrying out their duties. SEC. 5. EXISTING AUTHORITIES OF FERC AND STATES.\n\nThis Act does not limit the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's authority to address environmental impacts in electric utility industry restructuring, wholesale energy markets, or transmission access. States retain authority to address related environmental concerns within their jurisdiction."
