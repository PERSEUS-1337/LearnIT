    "content": "One recent breakthrough in reinforcement learning involves using deep neural networks as function approximators to solve RL problems. Methods like Deep Q-learning networks (DQN) and Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) have shown impressive results, especially in continuous state and action spaces, such as autonomous robots and vehicles. In this paper, novel approaches combining DQN and DDPG are used to improve results for continuous state and action space problems in reinforcement learning. These results contribute to the growing body of research in RL, particularly for tasks requiring smooth continuous actions in response to real-valued sensory input. The formulation of reinforcement learning with continuous state and action space is valuable for solving real-world problems. Deep learning has enabled RL to scale to previously intractable problems by automatically finding low-dimensional representations of high-dimensional data. Deep learning has allowed reinforcement learning to tackle problems with high-dimensional state and action spaces. Current state-of-the-art methods in Deep RL include Deep Q-learning Networks (DQN), Prioritized Experience Replay (PER), and Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients (DDPG). A new algorithm, Prioritized DDPG, combines ideas from DQN and PER to outperform DDPG in continuous state and action spaces. Prioritized DDPG combines ideas from DQN and PER to outperform DDPG in continuous state and action spaces. Parameter space noise for exploration further improves rewards achieved. Critic methods aim at learning a good approximation of the value function. DQN method tries to find the optimal function for each state. Min et al. BID12 use a non-linear function approximator efficiently in continuous state spaces. The authors propose novel ideas to efficiently use a non-linear function approximator for reinforcement learning. These ideas include Experience Replay Buffer and Periodic Target Network Updates. The authors propose using two sets of parameters for neural networks, one for computing targets and the other for loss computation. This reduces correlation and improves learning speed. They also introduce the prioritized experience replay algorithm to select observations based on their contribution to learning, using the error of each observation as a criterion. The authors introduce a stochastic sampling method to address the issue of greedy prioritization in selecting observations for learning. This method interpolates between pure greedy and uniform random prioritization by using probabilities based on the priority of each transition. Importance Sampling weights are used to compensate for the change in distribution of expectations. The authors introduce a deterministic policy gradient method for parameterized actor functions, which is more efficient than stochastic policy gradient methods. The DPG algorithm updates actor parameters in the direction of performance improvement. The DPG algorithm by BID12 maintains a parameterized actor function that maps state to action. It uses the normal Bellman equation to update the critic Q(s, a) and proves the derivative of expected return with respect to actor parameters is the policy's performance gradient. Actor critic models separate policy and value approximation processes, updating the actor based on the critic in different ways. DDPG algorithm aims to solve reinforcement learning in continuous action and state spaces. The authors extend the deterministic policy gradients approach by using a non-linear function approximator. This allows for learning off-policy in continuous action spaces, utilizing novel concepts from DQN for function approximation. The proposed algorithm is an adaptation of DQN and DDPG with ideas from BID10 on continuous control with deep reinforcement learning. It improves on DDPG significantly by using soft updates for target networks instead of direct copying. The goal is to enhance DDPG by incorporating improvements from DQN, but not all DQN improvements can be applied to DDPG. The proposed algorithm integrates ideas from DQN and DDPG, enhancing DDPG by using soft updates for target networks. Prioritized experience replay is considered due to its compatibility with DDPG. This method can be easily integrated into the DDPG algorithm by selecting observations using stochastic sampling. The pseudo-code for prioritized action replay is provided, with key changes in observation selection and transition probability updates. The proposed prioritized DDPG algorithm integrates ideas from DQN and enhances DDPG with soft updates for target networks. It ensures better observation selection for faster learning and prevents over-fitting by updating transition probabilities. Tested on standard RL simulation environments in Mujoco platform, it aims to facilitate research in robotics and similar fields. The prioritized DDPG algorithm integrates ideas from DQN and enhances DDPG with soft updates for target networks. It selects actions based on the current policy, updates the critic and actor policies using policy gradients, and updates target networks. The environments provide challenges with continuous action and state spaces, involving stick figures performing tasks by moving joints or applying force. The prioritized DDPG algorithm, based on DDPG in baselines, shows faster learning compared to DDPG in Lillicrap et al. (2015). Results indicate quicker reward attainment in less than 300 epochs for the HalfCheetah environment. The prioritized DDPG algorithm shows faster learning compared to DDPG in various environments, achieving higher and more stable rewards in less training time. It can also help achieve results that DDPG may not achieve even after many epochs, as seen in the Ant environment. The exploration strategy in RL varies, but the key is for the agent to explore enough and learn the best policy. Adding noise is explored as a potential strategy in BID9's paper. In BID9's paper, the concept of adding noise to the agent's parameters is explored for exploration in RL. They compare different types of noises and show that parameter noise outperforms existing algorithms in DDPG and other popular algorithms. The PDDPG algorithm with parameter noise was tested on Mujoco environments, showing significant improvements in rewards. The study compares prioritized DDPG with different types of noise in reinforcement learning. Prioritized DDPG performs better with adaptive-param and correlated noise compared to uncorrelated noise. It explores faster than DDPG and shows improved learning. PDDPG outperforms DDPG in most environments and shows promising results overall. The paper discusses advancements in RL algorithms for continuous state and action spaces. The proposed algorithm combines prioritized action replay with deep deterministic policy gradients, outperforming DDPG in mujoco environments in terms of overall and average rewards. It learns faster and is unlikely for DDPG to surpass its results. Different noises further improve PDDPG for higher rewards. The presented algorithm, PDDPG, outperforms DDPG in mujoco environments by combining prioritized action replay with deep deterministic policy gradients. Different noises can enhance PDDPG for higher rewards, showing that various noises work better for different environments. The algorithm can be extended by incorporating more concepts in value-based methods for policy-based methods. Improvements in continuous space and action state space can make reinforcement learning more applicable in real-world scenarios. Extending these methods to safety-critical systems is a challenge due to the unrestricted exploration process of typical RL algorithms."
