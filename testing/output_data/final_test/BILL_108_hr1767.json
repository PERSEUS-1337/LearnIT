    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Freeing Alternatives for Speedy Transportation (FAST) Act\" and pertains to the Interstate System. The \"FAST Act\" establishes an Interstate System FAST Lanes program allowing states to collect fees for highway expansion to reduce traffic congestion. States must submit an application identifying lanes to be constructed for eligibility. The FAST Act establishes a program for states to collect fees for highway expansion to reduce traffic congestion. States must consult with the metropolitan planning organization and submit a facility management plan for approval by the Secretary. The Secretary will only approve a State's application if it meets the requirements. Before participating in the program, the State must agree to collect fees using non-cash electronic technology and use the revenues only for specific purposes related to FAST lanes. The operation and maintenance of FAST lanes and existing lanes must integrate existing lanes with FAST lanes, collect fees only for FAST lanes, ensure voluntary use of FAST lanes, prohibit the use of fees for other projects, stop collecting fees once costs are met, and conduct annual audits. Annual audits shall be conducted to ensure compliance with the operation and maintenance of FAST lanes, with results transmitted to the Secretary. Revenues from FAST lanes will not affect state apportionments. The Secretary will conduct a study for projects with a cost of $50,000,000 or more to determine toll feasibility and privatization options. Section 301 of title 23 is amended to allow toll collection."
