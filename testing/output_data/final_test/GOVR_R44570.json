    "content": "Between 1989 and 2008, Congress passed laws imposing sanctions on Burma's military junta to promote democracy and human rights. The Obama Administration lifted most sanctions after positive developments in Burma, but events since 2016 have led to calls for reinstating sanctions. Events since 2016 have prompted calls for the reinstatement of sanctions on Burma due to serious human rights abuses, including genocide, committed by security forces. Congressional reconsideration of U.S. policy in Burma has also been influenced by ongoing conflicts with ethnic armed organizations and lack of progress in peace efforts. The lack of progress in peace talks between Aung San Suu Kyi's government, the Burmese military, and the EAOs, along with the arrest and conviction of \"political prisoners,\" including two Burmese reporters, has led to congressional reconsideration of U.S. policy in Burma. The Trump Administration has imposed limited targeted sanctions on military officers and units responsible for human rights abuses in Kachin, Rakhine, and Shan State. Some Members of Congress find this response insufficient and have introduced bills like the BURMA Act of 2018. The BURMA Act of 2018 and the Burma Human Rights and Freedom Act of 2018 aim to redefine U.S. policy in Burma and impose greater restrictions on bilateral relations. The Union of Burma was ruled by a democratically elected civilian government from 1948 to 1966, based on the Panglong Agreement signed by General Aung San and representatives of ethnic minorities. From 1962 to 2011, Burma was under military rule, denying people their rights. A civil war ensued between the military and ethnic armed groups. Despite this, the United States maintained diplomatic relations with the junta. Between 1989 and 2008, Congress imposed sanctions on Burma's military junta for suppressing democratic protests. In 2008, the junta initiated a transition to a \"disciplined democracy\" through a controversial referendum on a new constitution. In 2010, the SPDC held parliamentary elections boycotted by many parties, with the USDP winning 80% of seats. The new government under the 2008 constitution saw Lieutenant General Thein Sein become President in 2011. The Obama Administration adopted a policy of greater engagement with Burma while maintaining sanctions. President Obama used waiver provisions in sanctions laws to ease enforcement in response to political reforms in Burma. The NLD won 80% of parliamentary seats in the 2015 elections. Htin Kyaw, an NLD member, became President, with Aung San Suu Kyi as State Counselor and Foreign Minister. Obama reinstated Burma in the GSP program and revoked executive orders enforcing sanctions during Aung San Suu Kyi's visit in 2016. Obama fulfilled his pledge to revoke executive orders with E.O. 13472 on October 7, 2016. Restrictions on U.S. assistance to Burma were lifted by Presidential Determination 2017-04 on December 2, 2016. However, some restrictions remain in effect, including visa issuance limitations for certain Burmese officials, restrictions on U.S. assistance types, and an arms sales embargo. Congress also imposed restrictions on bilateral relations in appropriations legislation. The Consolidated Appropriations Acts from 2012 to 2017 included restrictions on U.S. assistance to Burma. Pending legislation for FY2019 also contains possible restrictions. Congress imposed sanctions on Burma to achieve goals such as establishing a democratic government and protecting human rights. Progress has been made on some goals related to Burma, but none have been fully achieved. Questions for Congress include whether restrictions on relations should be reinstated due to human rights violations, the impact of the NLD-led government, and the effectiveness of sanctions on Burma. The goals of U.S. policy towards Burma are being questioned, especially regarding the effectiveness of sanctions and restrictions on relations. President Obama's release of E.O. 13472 and Presidential Determination 2017-04 have maintained restrictions on visas for certain Burmese nationals and limits on U.S. assistance to Burma. Congress is considering whether these restrictions align with U.S. goals in Burma and if they should be revised. The Trump Administration has imposed sanctions on Burmese military officers and units using the Global Magnitsky Act. Various laws restrict U.S. relations with Burma's military, including limitations on granting entry visas to Burmese government officials. The discretionary authority to deny entry visas to the leadership of the SPDC and USDA has not been utilized by the President or the State Department. The JADE Act of 2008 prohibits certain Burmese officials and their family members from obtaining visas to the United States, with the President having the authority to waive the ban. The JADE Act allows the President to waive the visa ban for individuals if it is in the national interest of the United States. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 includes restrictions on U.S. programs in Burma, such as prohibiting funds for military training involving child soldiers and crowd control items for security forces using excessive force. Assistance to Burma is also restricted under Section 7043(a). Section 7043(a) of the JADE Act imposes restrictions on assistance to Burma, including limitations on bilateral economic assistance and international security assistance. Bilateral economic assistance may not be provided to individuals or organizations involved in human rights violations or advocating violence, and can only support programs for the voluntary return of refugees. International Security Assistance prohibits funding for military training and financing. The JADE Act imposes restrictions on assistance to Burma, including limitations on bilateral economic assistance and international security assistance. Bilateral economic assistance is prohibited for individuals or organizations involved in human rights violations or advocating violence, and can only support programs for the voluntary return of refugees. International Security Assistance prohibits funding for military training and financing. Funding for IMET and FMF Program in Burma is restricted, and Department of State consultations with the armed forces of Burma are limited to human rights and disaster response. Multilateral Assistance is restricted to projects meeting specific requirements for accountability, transparency, environmental conservation, cultural protection, and empowerment of local populations. The United States has restrictions on relations with Burma's military, including a ban on the sale of U.S. military equipment and provision of visas to military leaders. These restrictions are in addition to those imposed by the JADE Act, which limits bilateral economic assistance and international security assistance to Burma. Funding for military training and financing is also prohibited, with consultations limited to human rights and disaster response. The United States has restrictions on relations with Burma's military, including a ban on the sale of U.S. military equipment and provision of visas to military leaders involved in human rights abuses. Additionally, Burma has been designated as a country recruiting child soldiers, leading to prohibitions on certain security assistance and commercial licensing of military equipment. The United States has restrictions on relations with Burma's military, including a ban on the sale of U.S. military equipment and provision of visas to military leaders involved in human rights abuses. Section 7034(b)(1) of P.L. 115-141 prohibits the use of funds for military training or operations involving child soldiers in Burma. The Tatmadaw's actions in northern Rakhine State in 2017, which may have included genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes, led to the exodus of over 700,000 Rohingya into Bangladesh. The Trump Administration condemned the Tatmadaw's \"clearance operations\" in northern Rakhine State as \"ethnic cleansing.\" Major General Maung Maung Soe was placed on the SDN List for human rights abuses. The Trump Administration condemned the Tatmadaw's actions in Rakhine State as \"ethnic cleansing.\" General Maung Maung Soe was sanctioned for human rights abuses, along with four other military officers and two military units under the Global Magnitsky Act. The sanctions include visa denial, asset freeze, and denial of financial services by any U.S. entity or person. The President has the authority to waive or terminate these sanctions under certain conditions. President Obama waived restrictions on bilateral assistance to Burma, but stated they could be reimposed if conditions warrant. He terminated restrictions on bilateral assistance contained in a specific act. Congress allowed certain trade restrictions to lapse by not renewing them annually. Past economic restrictions on relations with Burma have been terminated, waived, or suspended. The US imposed various restrictions on imports from Burma, including bans on jadeite, rubies, and goods from certain companies. These restrictions were subject to annual renewal by Congress, but have not been renewed since 2012. In 2012, Congress passed the annual renewal resolution for restrictions on imports from Burma, including bans on jadeite, rubies, and goods from certain companies. However, these restrictions have not been renewed since. President Obama reinstated the ban on jadeite and rubies from Burma in 2013 through Executive Order 13651, which was later revoked in 2016 by Executive Order 13742. Section 5(b)(1) of the JADE Act blocked certain transactions involving property of individuals described in the act. President Obama waived sanctions in Section 5(b) of the JADE Act in 2016, freezing assets and prohibiting transactions involving property of individuals described in the act. President Obama waived sanctions in 2016 under the JADE Act, freezing assets and prohibiting transactions involving individuals described in the act. This was determined to be in the national interest of the United States. The Department of State, delegated authority by President Obama, waived investment restrictions on Section 570(b) effective July 11, 2012, citing national security interests. Section 570(a) of the Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related Programs Appropriations Act of 1997 limited bilateral assistance to Burma to humanitarian and counter-narcotics aid, subject to certification by the Secretary of State. President Obama waived investment restrictions on Section 570(b) in 2012 for national security reasons. Section 570(a) of the Foreign Operations Act limited bilateral aid to Burma for humanitarian and counter-narcotics purposes. The act required the President to certify measurable progress in human rights and democracy for aid restrictions to be lifted. In 2016, President Obama certified progress, ending restrictions on bilateral assistance. Section 307(a) of the Foreign Assistance Act withholds US funding for certain international programs in Burma. Section 307(a) of the Foreign Assistance Act restricts US funding for certain international programs in Burma, exempting some organizations like the Atomic Energy Agency and UNICEF. The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2016 waived the requirement to withhold funds for programs in Burma, extending into FY2017 and FY2018. The 2003 BFDA required the US executive director of international financial institutions to vote against extending assistance to Burma. In September 2012, Congress passed P.L. 112-192, granting the President the authority to waive U.S. opposition to IFI assistance to Burma. President Obama delegated this authority to Secretary of State Clinton, who determined that supporting assistance for Burma is in the national interest of the United States. The NLD-led government and Aung San Suu Kyi have given mixed statements on U.S. restrictions on relations with Burma. In March 2016, Han Thar Myint of the NLD stated they won't push for lifting U.S. sanctions due to military power. Aung San Suu Kyi expressed readiness for scrutiny and believed sanctions should be lifted if on the right path. The NLD-led government's stance on U.S. restrictions remains ambiguous. During Aung San Suu Kyi's visit to Washington, DC in September 2016, she called for the removal of sanctions on Burma to boost economic growth. However, she also expressed a desire to maintain restrictions on high-level military officers and military-owned businesses, which was not feasible according to U.S. officials. Aung San Suu Kyi and Senior General Min Aung Hlaing denied allegations of human rights abuses by Burma's security forces. Kyi and Senior General Min Aung Hlaing deny human rights abuses by Burma's security forces and oppose sanctions. Congress may reassess U.S. policy goals towards Burma and evaluate political and economic reforms. Restrictions on relations with Burma may impact developments consistent with U.S. policy. The U.S. policy towards Burma aims for a democratically elected civilian government that respects human rights and promotes peace and prosperity. The current U.S. ambassador reiterated this goal, emphasizing a peaceful, prosperous, democratic Myanmar. Congress will decide on maintaining, imposing, or removing restrictions based on the objectives of U.S. policy towards Burma. The objectives of U.S. policy towards Burma include supporting peace and national reconciliation, addressing the Rohingya crisis in Rakhine State, investigating alleged crimes by security forces, providing humanitarian assistance to IDPs, promoting democratic reforms, and addressing human rights violations in Kachin and Shan States. The U.S. policy towards Burma aims to support peace, national reconciliation, address the Rohingya crisis, investigate alleged crimes, provide humanitarian assistance, promote democratic reforms, and address human rights violations in Kachin and Shan States. Efforts to promote economic prosperity in Burma may conflict with establishing a democratically elected civilian government due to the military's control over the economy. Efforts to promote economic prosperity in Burma by allowing U.S. trade and investment in sectors controlled by the military could hinder further political and economic reforms. The military's willingness to relinquish political power and control over key ministries may determine the pace of reform. Permitting economic relations with military-owned companies could potentially encourage the military to consider political concessions. Congress may need to explore these dynamics further. Aung San Suu Kyi plays a significant role in the political landscape. Aung San Suu Kyi holds significant political power in Burma as State Counselor and Foreign Minister, leading the NLD-led government. Understanding the dynamics between her and other influential figures, such as the military leaders, is crucial for assessing U.S. policy alignment and advancing efforts in the country. Military leaders have historically shaped Burmese political conditions, including writing the constitution and governing from 2011 to 2015. Congress may need to further explore these dynamics to promote political and economic reforms in Burma. The political and economic reforms in Burma since 2008 have been influenced by the military leaders who governed from 2011 to 2015. The military leaders have shown little willingness to negotiate in discussions about ending the civil war, indicating resistance to proposed reforms by the NLD-led government. The opinions of various EAOs are crucial in achieving U.S. goals in Burma, where ending the civil war may require major changes in the constitution and economy. Defeating EAOs militarily may be challenging for the Burmese military without international assistance. Aung San Suu Kyi and the NLD-led government do not seem to support a military solution, but the success of Suu Kyi's peace process remains uncertain. The emergence of civil society organizations (CSOs) in Burma is seen as a potentially important force in the country's political dynamics. While some CSOs align with U.S. policy goals, relations with the NLD-led government are strained, with calls for a more active role in the peace process. CSOs may play a vital role in political reform discussions and the peace process, according to observers. The NLD-led government in Burma is facing scrutiny over its ability to secure an end to the civil war and promote political reform. Concerns have been raised about the potential establishment of a \"crony states\" federation controlled by military leaders, hindering the establishment of a democratic civilian government. Aung San Suu Kyi has prioritized ending the civil war, but challenges persist in achieving national reconciliation and protecting human rights. The \"21st Century Panglong Conferences\" have shown differing visions for a democratic federated state of Burma among various groups in attendance. Escalating fighting between the Tatmadaw and several EAOs raises doubts about peace prospects and Tatmadaw's support for a nationwide cease-fire agreement. Over 700,000 Rohingya refugees remain in camps in Bangladesh, with harsh conditions faced by the 600,000 Rohingya still in Burma. The provision of humanitarian assistance in Bangladesh is adequate, but funding is a growing concern. Access to northern Rakhine State is strictly controlled by the Tatmadaw, leading to shortages of food, water, and medical care for the Rohingya community. The prospects for the dignified, safe, voluntary, and sustainable return of Rohingya displaced into Bangladesh are currently poor. The United Nations has stated that conditions in northern Rakhine State are not safe or sustainable for the return of the Rohingya. Two major barriers to the voluntary return of the Rohingya are the demand for reinstatement of Burmese citizenship and the desire for accountability for crimes committed during the \"clearance operations.\" The Burmese government has offered to consider citizenship applications under the 1982 law, but many Rohingya find this unacceptable. Additionally, the Rohingya seek accountability for the atrocities committed against them, with a UN fact-finding mission recommending referral to the International Criminal Court. The U.N. Security Council may refer the Rohingya case to the International Criminal Court (ICC) or an ad hoc tribunal. The ICC has jurisdiction over Rohingya displacement into Bangladesh. Calls for U.N. sanctions and bilateral restrictions on Burma have been made. International response to accountability in Burma is limited. Progress on human rights issues is slow. Aung San Suu Kyi released political detainees in 2016. President Htin Kyaw granted amnesty to political prisoners. President Htin Kyaw granted amnesty to 70 political prisoners on April 17, 2016, and by mid-August, the NLD-led government had released a total of 457 individuals facing trial for political activities. The Assistance Association for Political Prisoners reported 276 political prisoners in Burma as of September 2018, highlighting the ongoing issue of political imprisonment in the country due to restrictive laws dating back to British colonial rule. Human Rights Watch's report in June 2016 detailed how these laws criminalize peaceful expression in Burma. Congress may address restrictions on U.S. relations with Burma by passing specific legislation or including provisions in appropriations legislation. This can involve imposing restrictions on bilateral or multilateral relations, placing conditions on certain forms of relations, or permitting the President to determine restrictions. Congress may have the opportunity to take action on U.S. policy towards Burma by considering appropriations legislation or revisiting existing laws imposing restrictions on relations with Burma. President Obama had to revoke Executive Orders and use authority in the JADE Act to lift economic restrictions on Burma. Congress may have the opportunity to take action on U.S. policy towards Burma by considering appropriations legislation or revisiting existing laws imposing restrictions on relations with Burma. Some suggest new legislation should state U.S. policy goals, address the current situation in Burma, specify remaining restrictions, and provide conditions for their removal. Bills like the Burma Unified through Rigorous Military Accountability Act of 2018 and the Burma Human Rights and Freedom Act of 2018 were introduced during the 115th Congress. Sanctions on Burma's ruling military junta were imposed from 1989 to 2008, with subsequent actions focused on waiving or eliminating some sanctions. The table lists congressional and presidential sanctions in chronological order."
