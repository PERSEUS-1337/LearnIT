    "content": "During the Cold War, the United States maintained nuclear forces to deter and defeat the Soviet Union. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, reviews were conducted to redefine the role and size of the U.S. nuclear arsenal in the post-Cold War era. These analyses also addressed new threats and regional challenges to U.S. security. The U.S. Department of Defense conducted reviews in the 1990s that led to changes in U.S. nuclear forces and policy. Critics argued that despite reductions in deployed nuclear weapons, the U.S. nuclear posture remained largely unchanged by the end of the decade. Despite the diminished threat of global nuclear war, the United States continued to focus on deterring a potential Russian attack by structuring its nuclear forces. Governor George W. Bush criticized the Clinton Administration's nuclear policy, calling for a reevaluation of nuclear deterrence requirements and a reduction in the size of the nuclear arsenal. If elected, he pledged to conduct an assessment of the nuclear force posture. President Bush pledged to conduct an assessment of the nuclear force posture and reduce U.S. nuclear forces to the lowest possible number consistent with national security. The Senate passed a provision calling for a new nuclear posture review during the first year of the next President's term. The Clinton Administration had faced challenges in reducing U.S. strategic nuclear forces due to restrictions imposed by Congress. The Senate retained the prohibition on reducing U.S. forces in the FY2001 Bill, requiring a new nuclear posture review before any reductions could be made. The Bush Administration completed the review and provided a summary of the results in early January 2002, sparking debate. The Bush Administration's nuclear posture review in January and March sparked debate when a classified report leaked. Analysts focused on proposed changes to U.S. nuclear policy, while some areas remained unchanged. The report outlines past, present, and potential future U.S. nuclear policy, including international security threats, strategy, doctrine, force posture, and infrastructure for nuclear weapons. The report summarizes U.S. nuclear policy during the Cold War, changes post-Soviet Union, and the Bush Administration's plans for nuclear weapons. It addresses issues like the role of nuclear weapons in national security, credibility of the U.S. nuclear deterrent, and future plans for strategic and non-strategic nuclear weapons. During the Cold War, the Soviet Union was seen as the most significant threat to U.S. national security due to its nuclear arsenal and global challenge to U.S. allies and interests. Other nations, like those in Soviet-dominated Eastern Europe, were included in U.S. nuclear war plans based on their relationship with the Soviet Union. China was also considered a potential threat to U.S. interests. The collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 eliminated the threat of global nuclear war between superpowers, shifting the security environment. The Clinton Administration acknowledged the potential threat from Russia in the future. The Clinton Administration recognized the potential threat from Russia due to its nuclear arsenal, while also acknowledging emerging threats from other adversaries armed with weapons of mass destruction in 1998. The Clinton Administration highlighted the threat posed by states actively improving their offensive capabilities, including obtaining weapons of mass destruction. China was not seen as a direct threat, but was noted to have a formidable nuclear force. The Bush Administration acknowledges China's efforts to modernize its nuclear forces, stating that nuclear weapons are necessary to deter China in the future. They emphasize the critical role of nuclear forces in defending the US and its allies against various threats, including weapons of mass destruction. Despite Russia's large nuclear arsenal, the Administration believes that Russia and the US are no longer enemies and hopes for increased cooperation between the two nations. The Bush Administration aims for a new strategic framework with Russia, moving away from Cold War dynamics. They no longer view Russia as a smaller version of the former Soviet Union threat but acknowledge the potential for a hostile peer competitor in the future. The Administration also anticipates challenges from adversaries with diverse capabilities, including asymmetric warfare and weapons of mass destruction. The United States faces threats from multiple potential opponents, including non-state actors, terrorists, and nations like China, Iran, and North Korea. The country maintains its nuclear arsenal to deter attacks from adversaries and has a range of capabilities to counter asymmetric warfare and weapons of mass destruction. The United States maintains a nuclear force structure to deter attacks from adversaries. The challenge is to make this threat credible despite the overwhelming destructive power of nuclear weapons. The U.S. has modified its forces and targeting over the past 50 years to ensure its own survival. The United States has adjusted its nuclear forces and targeting strategy over the past 50 years to deter potential adversaries by threatening retaliation with nuclear weapons. This included adding more limited attack options and seeking flexibility in the timing and size of potential nuclear attacks. The United States adopted a strategy of \"flexible response\" and a \"countervailing strategy\" in the 1970s to retaliate against Soviet military forces and war-making capabilities. These policies allowed for limited, focused attacks on specific targets to provide the President with more flexibility in timing, scale, and targets of the attack. The goal was to deter nuclear, chemical, or conventional attacks on U.S. allies in Europe and Asia through an \"extended deterrent\" approach. The United States maintained the capability to respond to aggression with nuclear weapons due to the Soviet Union's numerical superiority in conventional forces. In the late 1970s, a \"negative security assurance\" was issued stating that non-nuclear weapons states party to the NPT would not be threatened with nuclear weapons unless allied with a nuclear nation. The United States maintained nuclear weapons capability to deter aggression from the Soviet Union. A \"negative security assurance\" was issued in the late 1970s, stating that non-nuclear weapons states party to the NPT would not be threatened with nuclear weapons unless allied with a nuclear nation. This commitment was believed to encourage other nations to forswear their own nuclear weapons. Throughout the 1990s, the importance of nuclear weapons for deterrence was emphasized by the Clinton Administration and Secretary of Defense Perry. The U.S. nuclear posture emphasizes deterrence through threats of retaliation, including nuclear retaliation, to prevent aggression against the U.S., its forces, and allies. The Clinton Administration maintained a robust triad of strategic forces to deter hostile foreign leadership with access to nuclear weapons. Nuclear weapons are seen as a hedge against uncertainty, a guarantee of security commitments to allies, and a deterrent to those seeking nuclear weapons. The policy on \"first use\" was retained, not forswearing the first use of nuclear weapons. The Clinton Administration maintained the policy of not forswearing the first use of nuclear weapons, indicating that nations other than Russia could face nuclear retaliation for attacking the U.S. with nuclear, chemical, or biological weapons. The U.S. reserved the right to use nuclear weapons first against states not in good standing under the NPT or equivalent conventions, and a nation could lose protections under the negative security assurance if it attacked the U.S. with WMD. The U.S. did not directly threaten to use nuclear weapons in retaliation for non-nuclear attacks, opting for a policy of \"studied ambiguity.\" Former Secretary of Defense William Perry emphasized the potential devastating response from the U.S. to any nation using chemical weapons, without ruling out the use of nuclear weapons. Assistant Secretary of Defense Edward Warner highlighted the deterrent effect of U.S. nuclear and conventional forces against rogue leaders considering WMD attacks. During the 1990s, the NATO alliance adjusted its nuclear strategy post-Cold War but did not adopt a \"no-first use\" policy. Nuclear weapons play a smaller role in Alliance strategy now, but they are still deemed important for deterrence. The \"New Strategic Concept\" signed in April 1999 emphasized the role of nuclear weapons in preventing war and maintaining peace. The \"New Strategic Concept\" signed in April 1999 highlighted the importance of nuclear weapons in deterring aggression and maintaining peace. The Bush Administration also emphasized the essential role of nuclear weapons in ensuring security for the U.S. and its allies. Nuclear weapons are seen as crucial for holding a wide range of targets at risk and continue to play a key role in U.S. deterrent strategy. The Bush Administration has outlined a more integrated role for nuclear weapons, emphasizing their ability to deter adversaries, assure allies, dissuade potential threats, and defeat enemies by holding targets at risk. The Bush Administration has expanded the role of nuclear weapons beyond deterrence, recognizing their key missions in peacetime and crisis. It has also altered the role of deterrence in U.S. national security strategy, stating the need to preempt threats by launching strikes against adversaries before they attack. The Bush Administration has expanded the role of nuclear weapons to include preemptive strikes against adversaries, even those without nuclear weapons. This marks a significant shift in U.S. national security policy, potentially allowing for the early use of nuclear weapons in a conflict. Despite arguments that the U.S.'s conventional superiority makes preemptive nuclear strikes unnecessary, the possibility has not been ruled out. The Bush Administration has expanded the role of nuclear weapons to include preemptive strikes against adversaries, even those without nuclear weapons. This represents a significant shift in U.S. national security policy, allowing for the early use of nuclear weapons in a conflict. The idea that nuclear weapons can serve as a guarantee of security commitments to allies and deter others from developing nuclear weapons has been emphasized by past administrations. The reduced risk of global nuclear war may lead to a greater focus on other objectives for U.S. national security strategy. The Bush Administration has shifted U.S. national security policy to include preemptive nuclear strikes against adversaries without nuclear weapons. This change aims to provide the President with more options and flexibility in responding to threats, including the use of precision conventional weapons and ballistic missile defenses. The Bush Administration has implemented a new national security concept called \"tailored deterrence,\" which aims to provide the President with a wider range of military options to respond to threats from emerging adversaries. This approach combines nuclear and conventional capabilities to reduce the likelihood of resorting to nuclear weapons and ensure U.S. security. The expanded options in U.S. military planning aim to enhance the credibility of the U.S. deterrent by providing a wider range of responses to potential adversaries. Despite the presentation of a \"new triad,\" conventional options have historically been preferred over nuclear ones in response to aggression. The United States has never ruled out the first use of nuclear weapons. The Bush Administration maintained a policy of \"studied ambiguity\" on the circumstances for nuclear retaliation but acknowledged the possibility of using nuclear weapons in response to attacks by nations with WMD. The U.S. did not change its policy on the first use of nuclear weapons but emphasized the need to develop and deploy nuclear capabilities in response to emerging threats. The United States will develop and deploy nuclear capabilities to defeat potential adversaries, regardless of their possession of nuclear weapons. The focus is on maintaining capabilities for unexpected risks, with an emphasis on how to fight rather than who to fight. General Myers stated that the extent of destruction, not the type of weapon used, would influence the decision to respond with nuclear weapons. The Bush Administration considered using nuclear weapons in contingencies with non-nuclear nations like Iran, Iraq, Syria, and Libya to deter them from acquiring or using weapons of mass destruction. This was meant to send a strong signal against any potential use of such weapons against the United States. President Bush endorsed a policy of more explicit nuclear threats, emphasizing that the US will not tolerate threats or use of weapons of mass destruction. The US is perceived to be planning for potential first use of nuclear weapons in conflicts with non-nuclear nations. The Joint Staff updated its Joint Doctrine for Nuclear Operations in 2004 and 2005. The last available draft of the Nuclear Operations document, dated March 15, 2005, outlines circumstances for potential first use of nuclear weapons by the United States, including preemptive strikes to deter adversary use of weapons of mass destruction. Some analysts argue this may contradict the U.S. negative security assurance to non-nuclear nations under the NPT. Neither the President nor Secretary of State Powell have addressed this issue. John Bolton, the Undersecretary of State for Arms Control and International Security in February 2002, expressed doubts about the effectiveness of the U.S. negative security assurance to non-nuclear nations. He suggested that the approach may not be productive and stated that the Bush Administration would review U.S. security assurances in preparation for the 2005 Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty review conference. During the Cold War, the U.S. aimed to deter the Soviet Union by threatening to destroy military and industrial targets. The U.S. plan for targeting a wide range of military and industrial targets was outlined in the highly classified SIOP document. The SIOP evolved over the years in response to changes in U.S. nuclear forces and deterrence theories. General John Chain testified in 1990 about the strategy to deter any nuclear attack on the U.S. by having a variety of attack options available. The U.S. plan for targeting various military and industrial sites was outlined in the classified SIOP document. Target categories included Soviet strategic nuclear forces, military leadership, and industrial facilities. The goal was to have a retaliatory force capable of destroying key enemy assets, not cities. The U.S. sought the ability to strike thousands of sites, even after a Soviet first strike. The focus was on counterforce and industrial targets, with weapons designed to survive and retaliate. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, the U.S. reviewed its nuclear targeting strategy and reduced the target list. The primary nuclear war plan still targets Russia for a counterattack within 30 minutes of enemy launch. The Clinton Administration shifted the strategy to deter nuclear war instead of seeking to win a protracted nuclear war. The Reagan Administration's strategy aimed to deter nuclear war by reducing the scope of potential targets for the United States. This led to a decreased need for a large nuclear arsenal compared to the Cold War era. However, the core objectives of U.S. nuclear policy remained unchanged, focusing on the survivability of nuclear systems and infrastructure to withstand preemptive attacks and respond with overwhelming force. The Clinton Administration continued to prepare various attack options against Russia, ranging from limited to major attacks targeting military, nuclear, and civilian leadership sites. The Clinton Administration maintained various attack options against Russia, including military, nuclear, and civilian leadership sites. This flexibility was seen as enhancing deterrence by providing credible responses to crises and attack scenarios. Critics argue that this policy could lead to inadvertent launches by Russia due to high alert levels, but officials stated the U.S. would not rely solely on prompt launches. During the Cold War, U.S. war plans included options for launching forces before or after detonations, with the decision left to the national command authority. The \"mutual assured destruction\" relationship with the Soviet Union was no longer considered when determining the size of the U.S. nuclear arsenal. The Bush Administration has shifted the U.S. nuclear targeting strategy from a threat-based approach to a capabilities-based one. This new strategy focuses on a broad range of capabilities and contingencies, moving away from the previous focus on deterring the Soviet threat during the Cold War. The U.S. now plans to tailor its military capabilities to address a wide spectrum of possible future conflicts. The United States has shifted its nuclear targeting strategy to focus on potential future conflicts and the capabilities of adversaries. This new approach involves developing a force posture and nuclear weapons employment strategy to target specific capabilities. The Cold War SIOP has been replaced with a new war plan called OPLAN 8044, which includes major strike options and contingency plans. Additionally, a companion contingency plan, CONPLAN 8022-22, has been developed for prompt U.S. response to contingencies with nations other than Russia. The Pentagon eliminated a plan that allowed for the use of nuclear weapons early in a conflict, incorporating its options into OPLAN 8044. The Bush Administration has not publicly discussed how it will identify targets or allocate weapons in its \"capabilities-based\" targeting strategy, but has identified three types of contingencies for nuclear employment plans. Immediate contingencies involve current dangers like a WMD attack, while potential contingencies are plausible future threats such as new adversarial military coalitions. The United States can anticipate and plan for sudden and unpredicted security challenges, such as sudden regime changes or adversary's acquisition of WMD, by modifying its nuclear posture. This allows for advance planning to address these contingencies, similar to how it prepared for the Soviet threat during the Cold War. The United States can plan in advance for potential contingencies, including the use of nuclear weapons, similar to the Cold War. The war-planning process will involve a wider range of possible plans to address targets in multiple countries. Alternative employment plans will be prepared to provide options for the President in case of conflict, focusing on destroying key facilities to defeat the enemy and limit damage. The United States focuses on adaptive planning for unexpected contingencies in its strategic nuclear weapons operations, with STRATCOM developing flexible war plans since 1992. This approach aims to address a wide range of potential targets, including weapons of mass destruction, military and leadership facilities, and economic targets, to defeat the enemy and limit damage during conflicts. The current focus is on developing a more flexible and adaptive war planning process that utilizes modern computing techniques and streamlined processes for rapid crisis response. This includes improvements in sensors and technologies to gather detailed information about adversaries' plans and vulnerabilities, along with additional funding for advanced sensors, imagery, intelligence, communications, and targeting modernization. The Bush Administration emphasizes adaptive planning and modernization of communications and targeting capabilities for evolving strike concepts. The focus is on addressing emerging threats rather than Cold War scenarios, with potential contingencies including the \"re-emergence of a peer competitor.\" Despite plans to reduce deployed nuclear warheads, predetermined war plans against Russian targets may still be retained. The Bush Administration's emphasis on adaptive planning and modernization of strike capabilities for emerging threats may lead to retaining predetermined war plans against Russian targets, while also considering attacks on other potential adversaries. This approach mirrors the nuclear weapons employment policy during the Clinton Administration, which included options for attacks against Russia, contingency plans for other countries, and adaptive planning for unexpected threats. Reports indicate that STRATCOM maintained intelligence on WMD facilities in countries like Iran, Iraq, and North Korea, passing this information to target planners for contingency plans with U.S. nuclear weapons. Despite initial considerations to reduce alert rates, the Administration did not propose any changes, keeping the force on alert for morale and readiness. The Doctrine for Joint Nuclear Operations in 2005 mentioned that increased readiness levels may be necessary. The Doctrine for Joint Nuclear Operations emphasizes the need for increased readiness levels to deter aggression and highlights the importance of alert posturing of nuclear weapons to demonstrate national will. The Bush Administration is unlikely to adopt a \"no first use\" policy, especially with the growing emphasis on the possible use of nuclear weapons in response to chemical or biological attacks. During the Cold War, the U.S. nuclear arsenal included various delivery vehicles for nuclear weapons. During the Cold War, the United States deployed strategic and non-strategic nuclear weapons, including long-range missiles and heavy bombers for targeting Soviet territories. Shorter-range nuclear weapons were also placed in Europe, Japan, South Korea, and on ships worldwide to extend nuclear deterrence to allies. Reduction of these forces began in the late 1970s, with modernization programs continuing through the 1980s. This included the deployment of ground-launched cruise missiles and intermediate-range ballistic missiles. During the Cold War, the United States deployed strategic and non-strategic nuclear weapons, including long-range missiles and heavy bombers for targeting Soviet territories. Reduction of these forces began in the late 1970s, with modernization programs continuing through the 1980s, including the deployment of ground-launched cruise missiles and intermediate-range ballistic missiles in Europe. However, by the end of that decade, the United States canceled or scaled back all planned modernization programs and signed the INF Treaty in 1987, eliminating all U.S. and Soviet ground-launched shorter and intermediate-range ballistic and cruise missiles. The United States has maintained a \"triad\" of strategic nuclear delivery vehicles since the early 1960s, consisting of land-based ICBMs, submarine-launched SLBMs, and long-range heavy bombers. During the 1960s and 1970s, analysts developed a rationale for the nuclear \"triad\" to enhance deterrence against a Soviet first strike. Different basing modes complicated Soviet attack planning and ensured the survivability of a significant portion of the U.S. force. ICBMs had accuracy to attack hardened targets, SLBMs had survivability to complicate Soviet efforts, and heavy bombers could be dispersed quickly for enhanced survivability. Modernization programs continued to improve these systems. The United States enhanced its strategic nuclear weapons capabilities throughout the Cold War era, deploying Peacekeeper (MX) ICBMs, Trident submarines, Trident II (D-5) SLBMs, and the B-2 (Stealth) bomber. Strategic nuclear weapons numbers increased until the 1980s, then declined in the mid-1990s with the implementation of the START treaty. Research on anti-ballistic missile systems began in the 1950s, leading to the development of the Sentinel system in the mid-1960s. In the late 1960s, the Nixon Administration renamed the anti-ballistic missile system to \"Safeguard\" and focused on protecting ICBM fields from Soviet attacks. Despite initial opposition in Congress, Safeguard continued with Vice President Spiro Agnew breaking a tie vote. The United States and Soviet Union signed the ABM Treaty in 1972, limiting each nation to two ABM sites. The U.S. completed its ABM site near Grand Forks, North Dakota, but it was shut down in 1975 due to high costs. The ABM system was shut down in 1975 due to high costs, but research and development into ABM systems continued at lower budget levels. The Reagan Administration increased funding for the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) to develop non-nuclear ballistic missile defenses on land, at sea, and in space to protect against Soviet attacks. The Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) aimed to deploy a defensive system to protect against small-scale missile attacks. In the 1990s, the US reduced its nuclear arsenal and withdrew tactical nuclear weapons from overseas bases and sea-based platforms. In the 1990s, the US reduced its nuclear arsenal by withdrawing sea-based tactical nuclear weapons from surface ships, submarines, and naval aircraft. NATO also decreased the number of nuclear-capable aircraft in Europe, leading to the removal of 700 US air-delivered nuclear weapons. The US maintained around 1,000 nonstrategic nuclear weapons, including air-delivered weapons stored in Europe and sea-launched cruise missiles in the US. The United States has reduced its nuclear arsenal over the past 10 years, deploying warheads on various delivery systems including submarines, ICBMs, and bombers. The number of warheads has decreased from around 12,000 to fewer than 7,500. The remaining warheads are deployed on Trident submarines, Minuteman III ICBMs, Peacekeeper missiles, B-52H bombers, and B-2 bombers. The United States reduced its nuclear arsenal by deploying warheads on submarines, ICBMs, and bombers. The force structure included 500 Minuteman III ICBMs, 14 Trident submarines, 76 B-52 bombers, and 21 B-2 bombers. The plan to reduce strategic offensive nuclear weapons under the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty was never implemented. The United States reduced its nuclear arsenal by deploying warheads on submarines, ICBMs, and bombers. The force structure included 500 Minuteman III ICBMs, 14 Trident submarines, 76 B-52 bombers, and 21 B-2 bombers. The Clinton Administration restructured BMD programs post-1991 Persian Gulf War, focusing on theater missile defense and NMD technology development for defense against long-range ballistic missiles. The Administration adopted a policy in 1996 for NMD technology development with a deployment decision in 2000 if feasible and warranted by threats. The Clinton Administration added funding for NMD development within ABM Treaty limits, aiming for possible deployment in 2005 instead of 2003 to reduce risk and maximize success. A deployment decision was still pending until June 2000, with plans to approach Russia for ABM Treaty amendments. The Bush Administration has described a \"new triad\" of weapons systems and capabilities that will contribute to nuclear deterrence and U.S. national security in the coming years. This includes a combination of nuclear and conventional weapons for offensive strikes, along with missile defenses as part of the triad. The Administration believes that this approach will reduce reliance on nuclear weapons and provide more options for responding to attacks. The Bush Administration has outlined a \"new triad\" of weapons systems for nuclear deterrence and national security. This includes offensive strikes with nuclear and conventional weapons, missile defenses for deterrence, and a \"responsive infrastructure\" to maintain and expand the nuclear arsenal in response to emerging threats. These capabilities are supported by command and control, intelligence, and planning capabilities for quick response to unexpected threats. The Bush Administration has outlined a \"new triad\" of weapons systems for nuclear deterrence and national security, including offensive strikes with nuclear and conventional weapons, missile defenses, and a \"responsive infrastructure\" to maintain and expand the nuclear arsenal in response to emerging threats. The Administration argues that the new triad will provide flexibility in planning necessary to address a range of contingencies, including unexpected and undeterrable threats. The report does not cover precision-guided conventional weapons or details on intelligence and command and control systems, as these are classified. No changes to current deployments of non-strategic nuclear weapons were outlined, with further adjustments in NATO's nuclear posture to be addressed by the alliance. The Bush Administration plans to retain the capability to launch non-strategic air-delivered nuclear weapons and nuclear-armed Tomahawk sea-launched cruise missiles. The Navy sought to retire this capability but was overruled. The Administration has consolidated some nonstrategic weapons in Europe, reducing the number of bases. The details on U.S. non-strategic nuclear weapons were not discussed in the reports on the NPR. The Bush Administration's strategy includes the continued deployment of non-strategic nuclear weapons for quick response to emerging targets. These weapons, deployed overseas, can respond more quickly than strategic weapons based in the U.S. The Administration announced a reduction in strategic nuclear forces to 1,700-2,200 warheads over the next decade, codified in the Moscow Treaty signed with Russia in 2002. The Moscow Treaty, signed by the United States and Russia in May 2002, defines operationally deployed warheads as those ready for immediate use in response to unexpected contingencies. While not aimed at countering a Russian threat, the U.S. nuclear force posture does consider Russia's capabilities as a potential contingency. The responsive force, separate from the operationally deployed force of 2,200 warheads, is designed to address potential conflicts, including with Russia. The Bush Administration plans to retain a triad of ICBMs, SLBMs, and heavy bombers with around 2,200 operationally deployed warheads. They have eliminated 50 Peacekeeper ICBMs and are converting four Trident submarines to non-nuclear missions. The Pentagon recommended eliminating 50 Minuteman III ICBMs. The United States plans to reduce its Minuteman III ICBMs by 50 and the B-52 fleet to 56 aircraft. The Administration also intends to retire the fleet of 460 Advanced Cruise Missiles and reduce the Air-Launched Cruise Missiles from over 1,100 to 528 missiles. Additionally, warheads deployed on weapons systems in overhaul will not be counted towards the total of 2,200 warheads. The Administration plans to deactivate approximately 3,800 warheads, storing them as a \"responsive force\" for potential contingencies. Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld highlights the need to retain retired warheads due to the lack of production capacity. Ambassador Linton Brooks also discussed nuclear security in June 2004. In June 2004, Ambassador Linton Brooks announced a significant reduction in the U.S. nuclear stockpile, with warheads declining by over half in the next eight years. Estimates suggest around 4,300 warheads could be retired, leaving about 6,000 warheads by 2012. In December 2007, President Bush approved a further reduction of 10% to 15% in the U.S. nuclear weapons stockpile, criticized for undermining efforts to reduce offensive nuclear forces. The Bush Administration's plans for reducing U.S. offensive nuclear forces include the ability to reconstitute forces if necessary, with a focus on meeting goals of dissuading adversaries, assuring allies, deterring aggression, and defeating enemies. The U.S. ICBM force initially had 500 Peacekeeper missiles and 500 Minuteman III missiles, but has since reduced warheads and missiles to meet START force levels. The Bush Administration deactivated and retired all 50 Peacekeeper ICBMs, reducing the number of warheads on Minuteman III missiles. The deactivation process began in 1994, with Congress lifting restrictions in FY2002 to fund the retirement of the missiles. The Bush Administration deactivated and retired all 50 Peacekeeper ICBMs, reducing warheads on Minuteman III missiles. The Air Force plans to retain empty silos for possible future use, along with missile stages and warheads for deployment on Minuteman III missiles. The Administration is also reducing the Minuteman III force from 500 to 450 missiles, pending a report submission to Congress. The Air Force plans to modernize Minuteman III missiles to carry 1 warhead, with some potentially carrying 2 or 3 warheads, totaling 500-600 warheads. The modernization program costs $5.5 billion, including $55 million for command console upgrades and a $1.9 billion guidance system replacement to increase accuracy and extend service life. The Air Force plans to modernize Minuteman III missiles by improving accuracy and extending service life. This includes repouring fuel, remanufacturing stages, and replacing warheads with W87 warheads from Peacekeeper missiles. Additionally, there are plans to extend or replace Minuteman III missiles by 2018. The Air Force plans to modernize Minuteman III missiles by improving accuracy and extending service life. General Frank Klotz recommended continuing to upgrade existing missiles rather than designing new ones. Some suggest deploying ICBMs with conventional warheads for prompt global strike, but critics warn of potential destabilization. The U.S. SLBM force consists of Trident submarines carrying Trident I (C-4) and Trident II (D-5) missiles. Each missile can carry up to 8 warheads, but some have been reduced to 6 warheads to comply with the START I Treaty. The Navy may also be reducing warheads on other submarines. The Bush Administration plans to retain 14 Trident submarines with D-5 missiles, each carrying no more than 6 warheads. The four oldest Trident submarines are being converted to carry conventional cruise missiles or perform special missions, costing up to $1 billion each. These submarines will still count under the strategic force due to their ballistic missile launch tubes. The retirement of four Trident submarines will eliminate 576 operationally deployed warheads. The Navy may remove additional warheads from Trident missiles to further reduce the number of \"operationally deployed\" warheads. Each missile could carry as few as 3 warheads in the future. Additionally, two Trident submarines will be in overhaul at any given time, with warheads that could be carried on these submarines counting under START but not under the Administration's total of 2,200 \"operationally deployed warheads.\" The Navy retired four submarines and moved 5 submarines from Kings Bay to Bangor between FY2003 and FY2006. This was done to increase the ability to cover potential targets in China and East Asia. The Navy plans to continue producing D-5 missiles, with a total of 561 missiles expected, including 58 for the British Trident program. The Trident submarines can remain in service for 44 years. Trident submarines can remain in service for 44 years, with retirements starting in 2029. The Navy is studying options for a replacement, including a new ballistic missile submarine or a variant of the Virginia class attack submarine. The Trident II missiles will begin to retire in 2019, but a modification program will extend their service life. The Navy plans to purchase 300 missiles for 10 Trident submarines and refurbish W76 warheads for service until 2040. The Navy plans to deploy Trident missiles with conventional warheads for prompt global strike missions, aiming to improve missile accuracy. Despite initial funding rejections, the Navy requested and received funding in subsequent years to pursue this effort, including a request for $175 million in FY2008. The Navy requested $175 million in FY2008 to deploy conventionally-armed ballistic missiles for the Global Strike mission. Congress rejected funding to alter missiles and submarines but allowed research on reentry vehicles. Concerns were raised about adversaries mistaking conventional missiles for nuclear ones. The 110th Congress created a $100 million fund for research into global strike options. The Air Force currently has 94 B-52 and 21 B-2 bombers equipped for nuclear weapons. The Air Force has 94 B-52 bombers and 21 B-2 bombers capable of carrying nuclear weapons. The B-1 bombers were previously used for nuclear missions but were reoriented for conventional missions in the late 1990s. The Bush Administration has expressed a desire to reduce the B-1 force and initially planned to retire 33 bombers, but Congress mandated the restoration of 23 aircraft in FY2004. The Air Force initially planned to retire 33 B-1 bombers, but Congress mandated the restoration of 23 aircraft in FY2004. In FY2007, the budget requested the elimination of 38 B-52 bombers, but Congress rejected this and allowed the retirement of only 18. In FY2008, Congress mandated that the Air Force maintain a fleet of 74 B-52 bombers. The Air Force was mandated to maintain a fleet of 74 B-52 bombers, with 63 in the Primary Aircraft inventory and 11 as backup aircraft. Two additional aircraft would be designated as \"attrition reserve.\" The B-52 bomber, in service since 1961, can carry nuclear or conventional air-launched cruise missiles and a wide range of conventional arms. Upgrades are expected to keep the ALCMs in service until 2030 and the aircraft until around 2044. The B-2 \"Stealth\" bomber, in service since 1993, can carry nuclear gravity bombs and conventional bombs. The Bush Administration plans to maintain nuclear capability on all B-52 and B-2 bombers until 2040. They will not count the weapons that could be carried on bombers under their total of 2,200 \"operationally deployed\" warheads, only counting those stored at bomber bases. No bombers will be altered to prevent carrying nuclear weapons. President Bush plans to maintain nuclear capability on all B-52 and B-2 bombers, except for those at Barksdale Air Force Base. He aims to enhance missile defense technologies to address new threats and safeguard national security. The President planned a missile defense system to protect the US and its allies from rogue nations' ballistic missile attacks. Despite seeking Russia's withdrawal from the ABM Treaty, the US withdrew on June 13, 2002. The Administration outlined its missile defense plans in July 2001, proposing increased funding for theater and national missile defense programs. The Bush Administration proposed significant increases in funding for missile defense in FY2002, eliminating the distinction between theater and national missile defense programs. They have not yet identified a specific architecture for the ballistic missile system but are focusing on a robust research and development program to explore promising technologies. The administration may begin deploying technologies in the next few years and upgrade them over time through spiral development. The Bush Administration's proposed increase in missile defense funding in FY2002 aims to field technologies quickly through spiral development, without established performance criteria or cost estimates. This approach is justified by the growing threat of ballistic missiles and weapons of mass destruction. The Bush Administration's new \"triad\" of capabilities includes missile defenses to enhance deterrence, dissuade adversaries, assure allies, and limit damage. Interceptor missiles were deployed in Alaska and California from 2004 to 2006, with hopes of declaring the system operational before the 2004 election. The missile defense system was delayed in becoming operational before the 2004 election due to program delays and effectiveness concerns. However, it was placed on alert in July 2006 after North Korea's missile test. Plans for a missile defense site in Eastern Europe are being reviewed, with the 110th Congress potentially addressing funding for the site in the FY2008 Defense Authorization Bill. The DOE's nuclear weapons complex provides warheads for the Department of Defense's nuclear weapons. The U.S. nuclear weapons complex consists of facilities for research, development, production, maintenance, testing, and dismantling of nuclear weapons. The complex has evolved over the years, with a focus on enhancing capabilities and restoring lost capabilities. The complex includes major facilities like Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Los Alamos National Laboratory, and Sandia. The U.S. nuclear weapons complex includes research and development facilities in Livermore, CA; Los Alamos, NM; and Sandia in Albuquerque, NM. It also has production facilities in Hanford, WA; Savannah River, SC; Idaho Falls, ID; and Fernald, OH. Major production facilities are located in Rocky Flats, CO; Kansas City, MO; Mound, OH; Pinellas, FL; and Pantex, TX. These facilities are operated by industrial contractors. The nuclear weapons complex included facilities in Pantex, TX, and the Nevada Test Site near Las Vegas for explosive tests. Many facilities were deteriorating in the 1980s, leading to closures at Hanford, Savannah River, and Rocky Flats due to safety and environmental concerns. Plans were made to modernize and replace these facilities. In the late 1980s, plans were made to modernize and replace deteriorating facilities in the U.S. nuclear weapons complex. However, the end of the Cold War shifted focus to maintaining the existing stockpile and ensuring safety without underground testing. The DOE reduced infrastructure from 14 to 8 facilities, modernizing the remaining ones. Hanford, Pinellas, Mound, and Rocky Flats ceased work on nuclear weapons. The nuclear weapons complex in the U.S. underwent significant changes in the 1990s, with facilities like Hanford, Pinellas, Mound, and Rocky Flats ceasing work. The remaining facilities included three nuclear weapons laboratories and four production facilities, with a significant decrease in the number of employees. Operations at the remaining facilities adapted to changing demands and focused on tasks like purifying existing tritium and shifting workload towards assembly of nuclear weapons. The U.S. nuclear weapons complex shifted from assembly to dismantlement of retired weapons. A new facility at Los Alamos Laboratory will produce pits for nuclear weapons. The U.S. stopped nuclear testing in 1992 and signed the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty in 1996. The Stockpile Stewardship Program was developed to maintain U.S. nuclear weapons. The Stockpile Stewardship Program was created by the DOE to maintain U.S. nuclear weapons through surveillance, assessment, certification, design, and manufacturing efforts. This program, authorized by Congress in 1993, utilizes existing computing capabilities and new experimental facilities at nuclear weapons laboratories. The Bush Administration considers the nuclear weapons infrastructure as one of the three pillars of its \"new triad,\" emphasizing the importance of maintaining the credibility and assurance of the U.S. nuclear arsenal. The United States' nuclear weapons infrastructure, focused on sustainment and innovation, provides credibility and assurance to allies. It allows for the adaptation to meet emerging threats and reduces nondeployed warheads. Maintaining this infrastructure enables a timely response to new, unexpected challenges. The Bush Administration's commitment to modernize and expand the nuclear weapons infrastructure includes observing a moratorium on nuclear testing, pursuing stockpile stewardship programs for safety and reliability, and strengthening weapons assessment processes. The Department of Energy will seek improvements in understanding nuclear explosions through new simulation capabilities. The Bush Administration is planning to refurbish existing warheads and improve surveillance to anticipate stockpile issues. They are concerned about the aging nuclear stockpile and limited capacity to fabricate components for nuclear weapons. A comprehensive program is outlined to rebuild the nuclear weapons complex and workforce to address emerging problems or threats. The Administration plans to enhance the nuclear weapons infrastructure to address emerging threats and stockpile issues. This includes capabilities to respond to surprises, anticipate adversary innovations, maintain readiness, and have a sufficient reserve capacity for research and production. The NPR recommends enhancing the nuclear weapons infrastructure to maintain readiness and have the capacity for refurbishment and production of new warheads within specific timeframes. The Administration has outlined tasks for the next decade, including refurbishing existing warheads at the Pantex Plant and being able to produce new warheads if needed. The NPR recommends expanding capacity at Pantex and Y-12 Plant to meet the demand for refurbishing and producing new warheads. DOE plans to schedule warhead dismantlement at Pantex between refurbishment and production efforts. Funding is sought for a study on a modified nuclear warhead, the \"robust earth penetrator.\" The United States is considering developing a new \"robust earth penetrator\" warhead to target hardened and deeply buried military assets. The research project focuses on modifying existing B-61 and B-83 bombs, with a potential cost of $10 million in FY2003 and $40-$50 million over three years. Congress authorized $15 million for this project. The Administration requested $27.5 million in FY2005 for \"developmental ground tests\" on \"candidate weapons designs,\" with plans for increased funding in subsequent years. However, Congress denied funding for the program in FY2005 and FY2006. DOE has since abandoned its efforts, with DOD taking on some aspects of the study to determine the feasibility of a new weapon penetrating hardened and buried targets. In FY2005, Congress provided funding for the Reliable Replacement Warhead (RRW) program, aiming to maintain and modify warheads without nuclear testing. Design teams at U.S. nuclear weapons labs developed designs meeting military requirements by February 2006. The National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) announced in March 2007 that the program was progressing. The National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) selected the design from Lawrence Livermore Lab for a new warhead. Questions have arisen about the need for this design amid debates on the role of nuclear weapons. Congress eliminated funding for the program in FY2008. The Administration aims to reduce the time needed for nuclear testing readiness at the Nevada Test Site. It would take 24-36 months for the Department of Energy (DOE) to prepare for an underground nuclear test in case of safety or reliability issues. The Administration allocated funds in the FY2003 and FY2004 DOE budgets to reduce the time needed for nuclear testing preparation. This includes augmenting personnel, conducting subcritical tests, modernizing test capabilities, and constructing a new facility for producing nuclear weapon components. The interim pit facility at Los Alamos National Laboratory can only produce 20-50 pits per year. The Administration plans to bring a new facility online by 2020 with the capacity to maintain and replace existing pits, address surprise requirements, and potentially produce new warheads. Congress provided funding for the modern pit facility in 2005 but specified that the funds could not be used to select a construction site. In 2006, DOE announced a plan to consolidate and reduce the size of its nuclear weapons complex, which would eliminate some facilities. The National Nuclear Security Administration announced plans to transform the nuclear weapons complex in mid-December 2007, known as \"Complex 2030.\" The plan aims to reduce the size and cost of the complex by eliminating some facilities and combining others at fewer locations. This would result in a 30% reduction in square footage and a 20%-30% decrease in the workforce over a decade. The Clinton Administration acknowledged that nuclear weapons played a smaller role in U.S. defense strategy post-Cold War, primarily serving as a deterrent against adversaries with nuclear capabilities. The Clinton Administration acknowledged the reduced role of nuclear weapons in U.S. defense strategy post-Cold War, primarily as a deterrent against adversaries with nuclear capabilities. The administration also developed targeting options for nuclear weapons in response to chemical or biological attacks from non-Russian nations, not ruling out first use in such circumstances. Participants in the nuclear weapons policy debate argued for a sharp alteration in the U.S. nuclear weapons strategy and force posture. The debate on U.S. nuclear weapons strategy post-Cold War focused on the need for a significant reduction in the number of nuclear weapons, with some proposing levels as low as 1,000 warheads. Advocates suggested that the U.S. could rely on its conventional weapons superiority to deter adversaries without the need for nuclear threats. They also discussed the possibility of nuclear abolition as a long-term goal, advocating for the U.S. to only use nuclear weapons as a last resort for deterrence. The Bush Administration's nuclear weapons strategy differs from previous views, planning to maintain them for the next 50 years. They recommend developing new systems by 2020-2040, expanding the role of nuclear weapons beyond deterrence of nuclear attacks to include deterring chemical, biological, and conventional threats. The Bush Administration's nuclear weapons strategy aims to expand the role of nuclear weapons beyond deterrence to include deterring chemical, biological, and conventional threats. They believe these weapons can also assure allies, dissuade adversaries from acquiring weapons of mass destruction, and defeat adversaries by destroying critical targets if deterrence fails. Critics question the logic behind this expanded role, arguing that it may increase reliance on nuclear weapons despite the Administration's claims that it will actually reduce the likelihood of nuclear use. Critics question the Bush Administration's nuclear weapons strategy, arguing that it may blur the distinction between nuclear and conventional weapons, increase reliance on nuclear weapons, and expand options for nuclear attacks. Former officials have expressed concerns about the Administration's emphasis on war-fighting over deterrence and the development of new nuclear weapons variants. Critics question the Bush Administration's nuclear weapons strategy, expressing concerns about the emphasis on war-fighting, development of new nuclear weapons variants, and increased reliance on nuclear forces. Some argue for a limited role for nuclear weapons in U.S. defense policy, suggesting that maintaining nuclear weapons solely for deterring nuclear attacks would be more effective given the power of U.S. conventional forces. Some argue that the United States should reduce the role of nuclear weapons in international affairs to enhance its standing in the global community. The debate over nuclear weapons in U.S. defense policy stems from the need to make deterrence credible, especially during the Cold War. Concerns about the credibility of U.S. threats to launch a retaliatory strike against a Soviet attack were raised. During the Cold War, the U.S. sought to enhance deterrence by developing smaller, more accurate nuclear weapons and war plans. The goal was to make U.S. threats more credible to the Soviet Union, potentially deterring aggression. Some argued that a minimum deterrent of as few as 100 warheads could be sufficient to deter any rational leader from challenging the U.S. During the Cold War, the U.S. aimed to enhance deterrence by developing smaller, more accurate nuclear weapons and war plans to make threats more credible to the Soviet Union. A minimum deterrent of as few as 100 warheads could deter any rational leader from challenging the U.S. Debates post-Cold War focused on the credibility of nuclear deterrence against chemical or biological weapons, with arguments on the appropriateness and credibility of nuclear threats in response to such attacks. The Bush Administration's new nuclear strategy focuses on developing penetrating nuclear weapons to destroy hardened targets and threatening capabilities of potential adversaries. Critics argue that these changes increase the likelihood of the U.S. using nuclear weapons in a future crisis, while the administration maintains that these capabilities are for deterrence. The Bush Administration's new nuclear strategy involves developing penetrating nuclear weapons to target potential adversaries' capabilities. Analysts argue that having the capability to use smaller nuclear weapons would strengthen deterrence. Additionally, the administration has been more explicit in threatening nuclear retaliation for chemical or biological attacks, departing from past policy of ambiguity. The Bush Administration's nuclear strategy involves developing smaller nuclear weapons to target adversaries' capabilities. President Bush has stated that the US nuclear arsenal is a deterrent against those who threaten the country with weapons of mass destruction. The administration has departed from past ambiguity by explicitly threatening nuclear retaliation for chemical or biological attacks. The Bush Administration's nuclear strategy aims to deter and defend against nuclear, biological, and chemical threats. The US will strengthen nonproliferation efforts to prevent rogue states and terrorists from acquiring weapons of mass destruction. The development of new nuclear weapons and the potential use of nuclear retaliation are part of the US effort to dissuade other nations from acquiring and using WMDs. Critics argue that this approach may undermine US security. Many critics argue that the Administration's nuclear policy could undermine U.S. diplomatic efforts to discourage nuclear proliferation by emphasizing the importance of nuclear weapons. Senator John Kerry expressed concerns that the policy would reduce U.S. credibility in convincing other nations to forgo nuclear weapons. Critics specifically point to the implications of the U.S. negative security assurance on nonproliferation efforts. The negative security assurance policy of the United States may not deter other countries from acquiring nuclear weapons, as they might see it as necessary for their own security against a potential U.S. attack. Critics argue that this policy has not been effective in preventing nuclear proliferation or enhancing U.S. security. Some nations may still seek nuclear weapons to counter their neighbors or offset the U.S. advantage in conventional weapons. Some analysts criticize the negative security assurance policy, stating it gives non-nuclear countries a safe haven for developing chemical and biological weapons. Critics argue that the U.S. should marginalize the role of nuclear weapons in defense and foreign policy to maintain conventional superiority. The Bush Administration's plans for the U.S. arsenal of strategic nuclear weapons include reducing the number of deployed warheads, retaining delivery vehicles, storing removed warheads, and having the capability to restore them to deployment quickly. This is to maintain the firewall between nuclear and conventional weapons, as nations can only challenge U.S. conventional superiority with nuclear weapons. The United States plans to reduce deployed forces while maintaining flexibility for future contingencies. Questions have been raised about the need for 2,200 warheads, with analysts suggesting it implies war plans against Russia. The Administration disputes claims of developing war plans targeting Russian targets, citing potential adversaries with expanding nuclear, chemical, and biological capabilities. Analysts question deep reductions in nuclear weapons as thousands are planned for storage as a \"responsive force,\" potentially leading to a deployed force of nearly 4,000 warheads. Concerns arise over the threat of nuclear terrorism if Russia follows a similar posture, with stored warheads possibly vulnerable to theft or sale. The Bush Administration plans to retain warheads for spares and testing purposes, not destroying silos or submarines from the strategic force. Despite deploying only 2,200 warheads daily, the US could rapidly expand its forces to 3,500 warheads under the START II Treaty. The Bush Administration's critics believe the US should maintain a credible deterrent with fewer nuclear weapons, while the Administration argues for a broader role for nuclear weapons in national security strategy. The United States may need different numbers and types of nuclear weapons for future threats. The flexibility to restore warheads, expand deployment, and develop new weapons allows for reducing deployed weapons without compromising security. Concerns about nonstrategic nuclear weapons focus on their relevance to NATO's strategy post-Soviet Union. Concerns about Russia's nonstrategic nuclear weapons focus on the potential for loss or theft of up to 8,000 weapons. Former Member of Congress Curt Weldon described the issue as \"severe\" and \"critical.\" Suggestions include proposing reductions in these forces, but some argue negotiations may not be effective due to limited leverage. The focus should be on improving security measures. The United States should focus on improving security at Russia's nuclear weapons storage facilities and enhancing transparency to ensure the safety of Russia's stockpile. Efforts in these areas are funded by DOD's Cooperative Threat Reduction Program and DOE's nonproliferation programs in Russia. The Bush Administration began to recognize the importance of discussing nonstrategic nuclear weapons with Russia after signing the Strategic Offensive Reductions Treaty in May 2002. During the May summit, Presidents Bush and Putin signed the Treaty, but the issue of nonstrategic nuclear weapons was not addressed. Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld and Secretary of State Powell acknowledged the need to discuss this issue during hearings before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in July 2002. A new Consultative Group for Strategic Stability, chaired by U.S. and Russian defense and foreign affairs officials, was established to address nonstrategic nuclear weapons, with its first meeting held in September 2002. Many analysts believe the group should prioritize addressing the risks posed by Russia's nonstrategic nuclear weapons, but this has not happened yet."
