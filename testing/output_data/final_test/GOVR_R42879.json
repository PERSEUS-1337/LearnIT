    "content": "The benefits of thousands of chemicals to American consumers and the economy come with risks, such as exposure to lead, pesticides, or asbestos. Congress has enacted laws to manage chemical risks in industrial processes, agriculture, and consumer products. The U.S. EPA regulates chemicals, prompting ongoing congressional consideration of legislative issues related to chemical production and use. The EPA implements chemical laws targeting different sets of chemicals based on their use and potential exposure. Laws like TSCA regulate industrial processes, FIFRA controls pesticides, and EPCRA addresses hazardous chemical storage and release. These laws vary in their impact on regulated entities and the level of protection for human health and the environment. Congress oversees EPA's implementation of these statutes. The Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) authorizes EPA to regulate potentially hazardous chemicals in U.S. commerce to prevent risks to human health. Key issues for Congress include expanding information disclosure requirements, safeguarding scientific advice, controlling pesticides in surface water, implementing international treaties, and regulating contractors in older homes with lead-based paint. The Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) grants EPA authority to regulate chemicals to prevent risks to human health and the environment. However, EPA has rarely utilized this authority, leading to calls for statutory bans or amendments to give EPA more specific regulatory power. Some critics suggest aligning TSCA with Europe's stricter chemical laws. The recently adopted law aims to phase out dangerous chemicals for safer alternatives and requires manufacturers to prove product safety. Senator Lautenberg introduced the Chemical Safety Improvement Act to rewrite TSCA, giving EPA more authority to regulate chemical risks. The bill has bipartisan support and may supersede the Safe Chemicals Act. Public disclosure of chemical information is another concern for the 113th Congress. Federal laws and legislative proposals require information sharing between product manufacturers and customers to reduce human exposure to harmful chemicals. This includes public announcements, product labels listing ingredients, and reporting emissions of hazardous chemicals to the EPA under laws like the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA). The intent is to inform communities about chemicals released into the environment through the Toxic Release Inventory (TRI). The Toxic Release Inventory (TRI) provides reports to the public as required by laws like the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA). Information disclosure is viewed as a way to empower consumers to make informed choices about products containing hazardous chemicals. However, the regulated community argues that this can create unnecessary fear and hinder commerce, while industries may object due to concerns about giving an advantage to competitors. Under the Obama Administration, the EPA expanded public access to information about chemicals in commerce, including requiring disclosure of chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing. The Bureau of Land Management proposed revisions to oil and gas development rules to tighten requirements and manage water used in operations. In response to a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (SNPR) and Request for Comment, the EPA is seeking feedback on proposed changes related to hydraulic fracturing chemicals. The EPA plans to require submission of data on environmental or health effects and exposures to these chemicals, aiming to provide an aggregate picture of substances used in hydraulic fracturing. Additionally, further information disclosure under EPCRA may be forthcoming in response to a citizen petition. Seventeen environmental advocacy groups petitioned EPA for additional public reporting of chemical releases by oil and gas producers, especially with the growth of hydraulic fracturing. Legislation like the FRAC Act and S. 332 aim to require disclosure of chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing operations to the state or EPA Administrator for public availability. S. 1009 aims to reform TSCA by narrowing conditions for confidential chemical data and increasing public disclosure requirements for chemical hazards. EPA relies on external scientists for input through expert panels, like the Science Advisory Board, to ensure regulatory decisions are based on sound science. The Science Advisory Board (SAB) and other advisory panels provide scientific advice to the EPA, with implications for policy decisions. Panel members must adhere to ethical standards and FACA requirements for balanced viewpoints and objective advice. Critics may question the impartiality of advice given by panel members. H.R. 1422 in the 113th Congress aimed to ensure balanced representation on the Science Advisory Board (SAB) by revising the nominating process and composition. This included increasing representation of state, local, and tribal governments, as well as disclosing potential financial conflicts of interest among scientists benefiting from EPA funding. EPA solicits scientific input through workshops, hearings, and stakeholder meetings to explore topics and gather input from experts with differing perspectives. Input is received at various points during processes like developing hazard assessments for chemicals in the Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS). Critics argue that IRIS is outdated and incomplete, despite its widespread use in regulations at federal, state, and local levels. Critics believe the IRIS process for toxicity assessments of chemicals is slow and needs streamlining. The NRDC and Science and Environmental Health Network call for incorporating human variability, science-based assumptions, and consideration of multiple chemical exposures in risk assessments. The House Subcommittee on Oversight held a hearing on the issue. The EPA's IRIS program is managed internally, with a focus on rigorous peer review and transparency. Changes made during the review process are documented for transparency. The EPA is revising its process in response to criticisms from the National Academy of Sciences regarding the assessment of formaldehyde. The National Research Council recommended that EPA improve its assessment documents by providing clear links to a conceptual framework, documenting methods used to identify evidence, and developing concise criteria for selecting and evaluating studies. The 112th Congress directed EPA to incorporate these recommendations into the IRIS risk assessment process. The 112th Congress directed EPA to improve its assessment documents by providing clear links to a conceptual framework, documenting methods used to identify evidence, and developing concise criteria for selecting and evaluating studies. EPA was required to include documentation on how recommendations were addressed in draft assessments released in FY2012 and to contract with the National Academies for up to three reviews of IRIS assessments. The National Academies Committee on Inorganic Arsenic discussed EPA's draft assessment in May 2013. Congress may oversee EPA's implementation of these requirements in the 113th Congress. The 113th Congress may address the overlapping jurisdiction between FIFRA and the Clean Water Act regarding pesticide regulation in the United States. EPA regulates pesticides through registration and labeling to prevent adverse effects on people and the environment. It is illegal to use pesticides in a manner inconsistent with label instructions. The Clean Water Act governs pollution in surface waters. In recent years, federal courts have ruled that aerial application of pesticides into U.S. waters requires authorization under the Clean Water Act's NPDES permit program. This has raised concerns for pesticide applicators, including public health entities like mosquito control districts. In 2006, EPA finalized a rule to clarify when a CWA permit is needed for pesticide use under FIFRA. However, in 2009, a federal court rejected EPA's argument regarding residual and excess pesticides. In 2009, a federal court rejected EPA's argument that residual and excess pesticides do not require a CWA permit. EPA developed a general CWA permit for pesticide applications, issued on October 31, 2011. The permit covers various use patterns and is estimated to affect 5.6 million applications annually. The EPA issued a general CWA permit for pesticide applications in response to a 2009 court ruling. Pesticide discharges before January 12, 2012, are automatically covered, but those after that date must apply for coverage. Congress has considered legislation to affirm that a CWA permit is not required for FIFRA-approved pesticides. The 2013 farm bill legislation includes a proposal similar to H.R. 872, with older pesticides being persistent organic pollutants of global concern. The United States has signed international agreements to regulate POPs, pending Senate action for ratification. President Obama supports ratification, but inconsistencies with TSCA and other U.S. statutes remain. Congress has considered proposals to amend statutes inconsistent with international agreements on chemical regulation. An issue before Congress is lead-based paint contamination in older homes, posing hazards to young children. Despite efforts to reduce hazards, Congress annually appropriates over $100 million for a grant program administered by the Department of Housing and Urban Development. In the 113th Congress, a bill (H.R. 1282) was introduced to expand eligible grant recipients to include families in all types of housing and simplify paperwork requirements for grant applications administered by the Department of Housing and Urban Development."
