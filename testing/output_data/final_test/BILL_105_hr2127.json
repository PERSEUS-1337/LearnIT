    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Forest Service Cost Reduction and Efficiency Demonstration Act of 1997\". Congress finds that budgetary reductions and project delays due to litigation have hindered the Forest Service's accomplishments and resource outputs. Staffing levels have been reduced, leading to a loss of expertise in technical and scientific disciplines. Rising per unit costs and overhead are also a concern. The private sector offers technical expertise that the Forest Service needs. Hiring contractors for certain tasks would be more cost-effective, allowing agency personnel to focus on essential tasks. This approach would also ensure a skilled workforce is available to meet changing demands on public lands. The Act aims to reform the Government, reduce costs, and increase efficiency in the Forest Service by implementing contractor performance for certain tasks. This is to demonstrate that outsourcing can lower costs, improve efficiency, and achieve the targets set by forest management plans. The National Forest System Efficiency Fund is established to provide funding for the Forest Service budget for three fiscal years. The Fund can be used for contractor performance by units of the National Forest System. The National Forest System Efficiency Fund allows units of the National Forest System to pay for contractor performance related to programs and projects. The Secretary of Agriculture oversees the application and approval process for fund usage. Small contracts under $50,000 are exempt from certain contracting requirements. Contracts under $50,000 from the National Forest System Efficiency Fund are exempt from certain contracting regulations, including the Competition in Contracting Act and notice requirements. Administrative expenses for contracts under this section are permitted. Contracts under this section allow for up to 20 percent of the contract price to be used for unit administration and overhead. Regional offices of the Forest Service can use up to five percent annually from the Fund for contracts, while the national office cannot use any funds. Tasks involving public input can be contracted out, with final consideration still under the Secretary of Agriculture's control. The Secretary of Agriculture shall ensure that public input is considered before decision-making by an appropriate Forest Service officer. A report to Congress must be submitted annually on tasks completed under contracts, including cost savings and recommendations for expanding contracting authority. This section does not replace other contracting authorities held by the Secretary of Agriculture. The Secretary of Agriculture can contract out tasks of the Forest Service and utilize other available contracting authority, including expedited fire contracting procedures."
