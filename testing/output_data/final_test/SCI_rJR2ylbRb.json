    "content": "GraphWave is a method that represents nodes in a graph by leveraging spectral graph wavelet diffusion patterns to create low-dimensional embeddings of their local network neighborhoods. This approach allows for the identification of nodes with similar structural roles within the network, without the need for manual specification of topological features. The method scales linearly with the number of edges and has been evaluated on both synthetic and real-world datasets. Structural role discovery in graphs involves identifying nodes with topologically similar local neighborhoods, even if they are in distant areas of the network. This information can be used for various tasks, such as machine learning or identifying key nodes in a system. The method improves performance by up to 71% over existing baselines on synthetic and real-world datasets. Identifying structural roles in graphs involves finding nodes with similar local network neighborhoods, regardless of their location in the network. This is done by learning continuous vector-valued structural signatures for each node in an unsupervised manner, allowing for a more robust method of determining structural similarity. This approach defines structural similarity based on the closeness of topological signatures, using an appropriate signature and distance metric. Various methods have been proposed for structural role discovery in graphs, aiming to improve performance on different datasets. GRAPHWAVE is a new approach for structure learning on graphs that addresses the limitations of existing methods. It uses techniques from graph signal processing to learn a structural embedding for each node based on the diffusion of a spectral graph wavelet. This allows for a more robust and scalable way to identify structural roles in graphs. The wavelet coefficients act as probability distributions and contain information related to graph topological properties, allowing for the recovery of structurally similar nodes without manual labeling. However, comparing structural signatures for distant nodes requires a specific node mapping due to the localized nature of wavelets on the graph. The wavelet coefficients act as probability distributions over the graph, capturing structural information in how diffusion spreads. Embedding these distributions using the empirical characteristic function BID18 provides vector-valued signatures for machine learning algorithms. GRAPHWAVE is computationally efficient, linear in edge number, and robust to perturbations, scaling to large networks. The paper introduces GRAPHWAVE, a method for learning node embeddings based on structural similarity in graphs using spectral graph wavelets treated as probability distributions. It outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by up to 71% on real and synthetic datasets, showcasing its utility in characterizing structural signatures in graphs. The curr_chunk discusses various methods for generating node similarities based on local topological properties without relying on heuristics or manual feature engineering. It contrasts with approaches like RolX and struc2vec, and mentions graph diffusion kernels used for graph modeling purposes. Our paper is the first to apply graph diffusion kernels for determining structural roles in graphs, capturing geometrical properties efficiently. Unlike traditional wavelet methods, GRAPHWAVE treats wavelets as distributions over real-world irregular graphs, characterizing diffusion shapes instead of specific nodes. GRAPHWAVE introduces a novel approach called GRAPHWAVE that utilizes spectral graph wavelets for learning structural signatures in graphs. This method captures diffusion shapes rather than specific nodes, providing mathematical guarantees on the optimality of learned structural signatures. The decomposition of the unnormalized graph Laplacian L = D \u2212 A is discussed, along with the use of a filter kernel g s for spectral graph wavelets. The spectral graph wavelet \u03a8 a is defined as the signal resulting from modulation in the spectral domain of a Dirac signal centered around node a. Spectral graph wavelets use a kernel to modulate the eigenspectrum, localizing signals on the graph. The low-pass filter kernel enforces smoothness in signal variation by discounting higher eigenvalues. The GRAPHWAVE algorithm returns a structural signature for each node, promoting similarity among geographically close nodes. The GRAPHWAVE algorithm generates structural signatures for nodes based on their local network neighborhoods. It uses spectral graph wavelets to capture diffusion patterns, representing nodes with similar neighborhoods with similar signatures. The algorithm focuses on how wavelet coefficients vary across the network neighborhood around each node, rather than just scaling parameters. GRAPHWAVE uses spectral graph wavelets to learn nodes' structural signatures by treating wavelet coefficients as probability distributions and characterizing them via empirical characteristic functions. This allows for embedding the distributions into 2d-dimensional space and resolving the node mapping problem. The characteristic function fully characterizes the distribution of the wavelet coefficients. X is defined as BID18. The function \u03c6 X (t) fully characterizes the distribution of X by capturing information about all the moments of probability distribution X BID18. The empirical characteristic function of \u03a8 a for a given node a and scale s is obtained by sampling a 2-dimensional parametric function at evenly spaced points and concatenating the values. This creates a structural signature of size 2d, allowing nodes from different graphs to be compared in the same space. The final output of GRAPHWAVE is a structural signature \u03c7 a for each node a. The final output of GRAPHWAVE is a structural signature \u03c7 a for each node in the graph, which can be compared through distances using the 2 distance on \u03c7 a. The scaling parameter s determines the radius of the network neighborhood around each node, influencing the node signatures based on the similarity of nodes' immediate neighborhoods or spreading the diffusion process farther for signatures based on neighborhoods with greater radii. GRAPHWAVE integrates information across different radii by considering various values of s. The multiscale version of GRAPHWAVE integrates information across different radii of neighborhoods by concatenating representations associated with different scales. The final aggregated structural signature for each node is a vector. Chebyshev polynomials are used to compute the algorithm, with a linear complexity in the number of edges allowing scalability to large sparse networks. Theoretical motivation for the spectral graph wavelet-based model is provided. The spectral graph wavelet-based model BID26 characterizes the topological structure of local network neighborhoods. It shows that similar nodes have near-identical signatures, guaranteeing the optimality of GRAPHWAVE. Wavelet coefficients measure network connectivity between nodes, utilizing the discrete spectrum of the graph Laplacian. The Stone-Weierstrass theorem allows for polynomial approximation of the kernel on a compact set. The polynomial approximation P for spectral graph wavelets is tight with uniformly bounded error. The spectral graph wavelet for node a can be expressed in terms of this approximation, containing terms related to graph theory. The second term in the equation can be bounded using Cauchy-Schwartz's inequality, unitary matrix U, and the bounded residual r(\u03bb). The spectral graph wavelets can be approximated by a K-th order polynomial capturing information about the K-hop neighborhood of nodes. The wavelets are governed by topological features and contain necessary information for generating structural signatures of nodes. Nodes with identical K-hop neighborhoods are structurally equivalent and have similar signatures in GRAPHWAVE. The Taylor expansion is used to obtain a K-th order polynomial approximation of g s for each eigenvalue \u03bb. The K-th order polynomial approximation of g s for each eigenvalue \u03bb ensures the existence of c \u03bb \u2208 [0, s]. By specifying a parameter, we can control the closeness of signatures of structurally equivalent nodes. A one-to-one mapping \u03c0 is established between the K-hop neighborhoods of structurally equivalent nodes a and b in the graph G. The difference between mapped coefficients is expressed in terms of the K-th order approximation. The K-th order approximation of the graph Laplacian allows for the analysis of coefficients in terms of structurally equivalent nodes. By utilizing the localization properties and spectral graph wavelet bounds, it is shown that wavelet coefficients in \u03a8 a are within 2 of their corresponding coefficients in \u03a8 b. This similarity in distributions leads to similarity in characteristic functions, highlighting the structural equivalence of nodes. Structurally similar nodes with identical K-hop neighborhoods show similar GRAPHWAVE signatures even with small perturbations in the edges. The perturbation of a node's neighborhood results in small changes in wavelet coefficients, expressed through a K-th order Taylor expansion. This analysis relates perturbations in the graph structure to changes in wavelet coefficients. The Weyl's theorem BID3 is used to relate perturbations in the graph structure to changes in the eigenvalues of the graph Laplacian. Small perturbations of the graph result in small perturbations of the eigenvalues, indicating that structurally similar nodes have similar signatures in GRAPHWAVE. Comparison with state-of-the-art baselines like struc2vec BID22 and RolX BID12 is done, with RolX requiring the number of structural classes as input. Homophily-based methods are unable to recover structural similarities. GRAPHWAVE correctly learns representations for structurally equivalent nodes in a barbell graph, providing empirical evidence for theoretical results. RolX and struc2vec fail to recover exact structural equivalences. GRAPHWAVE differentiates between nodes connecting dense cliques, showcasing its effectiveness. In experiments, GRAPHWAVE represents nodes in a gradient-like pattern capturing structural roles. Synthetic graphs with known structural roles are used to evaluate performance, including varied setups with mixed shapes placed along a cycle. Additional graphs are generated by irregularly placing shapes along the cycle and adding random edges. This setup assesses the methods' robustness to data. Experimental setup involved running RolX, struc2vec, and GRAPHWAVE on graphs to learn signatures using a multiscale version of GRAPHWAVE. K-means was used to cluster signatures, and three metrics were used to evaluate clustering quality: cluster homogeneity, cluster completeness, and silhouette score. GRAPHWAVE consistently outperformed struc2vec in the results. GRAPHWAVE consistently outperforms struc2vec and RolX in various settings, showing improvements in homogeneity and completeness. It is robust to noise in the edge structure and produces denser, better-separated clusters. The signatures generated by GRAPHWAVE accurately distinguish between nodes. The signatures generated by GRAPHWAVE accurately distinguish between nodes based on their structural roles in the graph. Characteristic functions of nodes in the periphery have smaller wavelets, while nodes in the core have farther projections on the x and y axis. Different shapes of characteristic functions represent different structural roles. The GRAPHWAVE algorithm accurately distinguishes between Enron employees based on their structural roles in the email communication network. CEOs and presidents are structurally distant from other job titles, indicating their unique position in the graph, while traders exhibit different connectivity patterns. The GRAPHWAVE algorithm distinguishes between Enron employees based on their structural roles in the email communication network. Traders have unique local graph connectivity patterns, while CEOs and presidents are structurally distant from other job titles. Struc2vec is less successful at revealing intricate relationships between job titles. GRAPHWAVE achieves better homogeneity and completeness than RolX. Variability within each cluster of struc2vec is higher than the average distance between clusters. The airline graphs from European airports are analyzed using GRAPHWAVE to learn structural signatures of airports and create visualizations. Air France's hub and spoke structure is highlighted, with CDG standing out in the 2D projection. In contrast, Ryanair's graph is different. Ryanair, a low-cost airline, has a network with a diverse range of structural roles, from regional French airports to major hubs like London Stansted and Dublin. A new method called GRAPHWAVE uses spectral graph wavelets to generate structural embeddings for each node, capturing structural similarity in graphs. This approach provides mathematical guarantees on the analysis of airline networks. Our method, GRAPHWAVE, uses spectral graph theory to show that structurally similar nodes have similar signatures. Experiments on real and synthetic networks confirm our results, showing significant performance improvements over existing methods. These signatures could be applied to transfer learning, using knowledge from one part of the graph to infer about others. In the appendix, we maintain the dependency of the heat kernel wavelet on the scaling parameter for studying their relationship. The relationship between heat kernel wavelets and the scaling parameter is explored in this section. Five key properties of heat kernel wavelets are listed, which are later used to develop a method for automatic scaling parameter selection. The properties include the symmetry of the heat kernel wavelet matrix, the first eigenvector of the graph Laplacian, and a scaling inequality derived using the Cauchy Schwartz inequality. Additionally, three propositions about distributions generated by heat kernel wavelets are proven, showing their independence from the scaling parameter and node values. The heat kernel wavelet coefficient at the initial source node is a monotonically decreasing function of the scaling parameter. It is non-negative and bounded, with a value that decreases as the scaling parameter increases. The method developed finds an appropriate range of values for the scaling parameter in heat kernel wavelets for structural signature learning. Small values of the parameter yield trivial diffusion distributions, while larger values lead to all nodes having an identical temperature. The method finds the optimal scaling parameter for heat kernel wavelets in structural signature learning. Small values yield trivial diffusion distributions, while larger values result in all nodes having the same temperature. Variance and convergence rate insights are provided for heat kernel wavelets, helping to select appropriate scaling parameters. The wavelet coefficient \u03a8 (s) am is bounded by a smooth increasing function of s. By selecting s max, wavelet coefficients are localized in the network. The bound ensures that a shrinks to at most \u03b7 * 100 % of its initial value at s = 0, with a convergence scenario of s \u2264 \u2212 log(\u03b7)/\u03bb.\u03bb is chosen as the geometric mean of \u03bb 2 and \u03bb N for balanced convergence. The geometric mean maintains equal weighting across the range [\u03bb 2 , \u03bb N ]. We select s max = \u2212 log(\u03b7)/ \u221a \u03bb 2 \u03bb N and s min = \u2212 log(\u03b3)/ \u221a \u03bb 2 \u03bb N to ensure adequate diffusion resolution. Setting \u03b7 = 0.90 and \u03b3 = 0.99, we study characteristic functions in GRAPHWAVE to understand nodes' local topology. Definition 1 defines the empirical characteristic function BID18 of wavelet \u03a8. The empirical characteristic function BID18 of wavelet \u03a8 is defined as the characteristic function in the phase plot, yielding a set of coordinates by varying t. The curve is directed counterclockwise due to non-negative wavelet coefficients."
