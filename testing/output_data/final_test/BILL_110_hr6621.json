    "content": "The \"Reinstatement of Enrollment for Medicaid Eligibility of Disadvantaged Youth (REMEDY) Act\" allows certain youth to regain Medicaid and SCHIP benefits upon release from public institutions. The REMEDY Act amends Section 1902(a) of the Social Security Act to provide that youth inmates retain Medicaid enrollment upon release from public institutions. The REMEDY Act ensures that individuals retain Medicaid enrollment upon release from institutions, reinstating eligibility and duration without interruption. The REMEDY Act mandates that State child health plans must suspend enrollment for children who become inmates in public institutions, ensuring reinstatement upon release. The REMEDY Act requires State child health plans to suspend enrollment for children who become inmates in public institutions, with reinstatement upon release, effective for individuals becoming inmates on or after January 1, 2009. The REMEDY Act mandates that State child health plans must halt enrollment for children entering public institutions after January 1, 2009, with reinstatement upon release. The REMEDY Act requires State child health plans to stop enrolling children in public institutions after January 1, 2009, with reinstatement upon release. The effective date is the first day of the first calendar quarter following the close of the first regular session of the State legislature after the enactment of the Act. If a State has a 2-year legislative session, each year is considered a separate regular session."
