    "content": "The \"Security Measures Feasibility Act\" may require studies on state-issued driver's licenses and identification cards. The Comptroller General of the United States will conduct a study to evaluate the feasibility, cost, and time required for states to implement security measures for driver's licenses and identification cards. The study will focus on the incorporation of physical security features. The study will evaluate the feasibility, cost, and time required for states to implement security measures for driver's licenses and identification cards, including physical security features, machine-readable technology, digital image capture of source documents, and retention standards for paper and digital copies. The study will assess the feasibility and cost of implementing security measures for driver's licenses and identification cards, including facial image capture, verification procedures for renewing applicants, validation of social security numbers, and physical security of production locations. The production of driver's licenses and identification cards involves security measures such as security clearance for manufacturers, training in fraudulent document recognition for employees, participation in the Driver's License Agreement for data sharing, and establishment of State motor vehicle databases. The establishment of State motor vehicle databases with all data fields from driver's licenses, driver's histories, and two category systems for licenses - one for citizens and permanent residents, and another for nonimmigrant aliens with expiration tied to authorized stay in the US. Effective procedures for implementation are also required. Implementation of a procedure to verify document validity for driver's licenses, routine use of the \"Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements\" system, and ensuring non-compliant licenses are clearly marked for Federal agencies. The Comptroller General of the United States will conduct a study on the consequences of denying driver's licenses to undocumented aliens, considering the likelihood of them driving without a license. A report to Congress is due within 270 days of the enactment of the Act. The United States will submit a report to Congress and the Secretary of Homeland Security containing findings and recommendations from studies on driver's license security. The report will include the Comptroller General's assessment, recommendations for administrative and legislative actions to enhance security. The Comptroller General will submit a report to Congress and the Secretary of Homeland Security with findings and recommendations on driver's license security. The report may include a classified version if necessary. The term \"appropriate committees of the Congress\" refers to specific committees in the Senate and House of Representatives."
