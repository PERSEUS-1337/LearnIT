The Congress finds that children are our Nation's future and greatest treasure, emphasizing the importance of high-quality education for every child to reach their full potential. The No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 is highlighted as a significant revision in education policy. However, funding issues in the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2006 caused 3,100,000 students to miss out on promised Title I help. Additionally, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act ensures that all children with disabilities receive a quality education. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act committed Congress to providing 40 percent of the national average per pupil expenditure for special education students. The 2006 Appropriations Act funded Part B state grants at $10.7 billion, only 18 percent of the national average. A promise made must be a promise kept. SEC. 3.

Funding is appropriated from the Treasury for programs under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, as amended by the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001, for fiscal years 2007 and 2008. The amount is determined by the difference between the appropriated amount and $23,504,000,000 or the full authorized amount for each fiscal year. For fiscal years 2009 and 2010, funding is determined by the difference between the appropriated amount for programs under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, as amended by the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001, and $28,315,000,000 for 2009 and $33,126,000,000 for 2010, or the full authorized amount for each fiscal year. For fiscal years 2009 and 2010, funding is determined by the difference between the appropriated amount for programs under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, as amended by the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001, and specified amounts. For fiscal year 2011, the difference is calculated based on $37,938,000,000 or the full authorized amount.

For fiscal year 2012, the funding amount is determined by the difference between the appropriated amount for programs under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, as amended by the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001, and either $47,560,000,000 or the full authorized amount.

Funds appropriated must be used for the mentioned programs. The funding for programs under the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 for fiscal year 2014 will be allocated among the programs in the same ratio as funds appropriated for them. SEC. 4. MANDATORY FUNDING OF THE INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES EDUCATION ACT. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act mandates specific funding amounts for fiscal years 2007 to 2015, with increasing allocations each year.
