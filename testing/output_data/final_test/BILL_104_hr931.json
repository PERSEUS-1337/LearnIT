The Act establishes a 15-year recovery period for residential rental properties in qualified low-income housing projects. The term 'qualified low-income housing project' refers to residential rental properties assisted under a specified HUD program where 50% or more of the units are occupied by individuals with incomes below 80% of the area median gross income. The term 'qualified low-income housing project' refers to residential rental properties assisted under a specified HUD program where 50% or more of the units are occupied by individuals with incomes below 80% of the area median gross income. Projects must meet specific criteria such as being in service for at least 10 years before acquisition, substantial rehabilitation, and acquisition by purchase. The taxpayer cannot claim benefits under the low-income housing credit or rehabilitation credit for a project that has not been previously placed in service and was acquired by purchase. This prevents a double benefit for the same project. The curr_chunk discusses projects assisted under specified HUD programs, including those financed by loans insured or held by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. The curr_chunk discusses loans insured or held by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development under various sections of the National Housing Act. The curr_chunk explains the criteria for a project to be considered substantially rehabilitated, requiring rehabilitation expenditures to equal or exceed 10 percent of the property's adjusted bases within a 24-month period. The term 'rehabilitation expenditures' refers to amounts incurred for property improvements subject to depreciation, excluding building acquisition costs. Expenditures must benefit low-income individuals to be considered. The term 'purchase' in subparagraph (A) refers to the meaning given to such term. Income determinations for low-income units are based on individual income and area median gross income as per section 142(d)(2)(B). The term 'purchase' is defined in section 179(d)(2) and excludes acquisitions where the basis is determined by reference to other property held by the buyer. Low-income units remain classified as such even if occupants' incomes exceed the limit, except under certain conditions. Low-income units are still classified as such even if occupants' incomes exceed the limit, but if income rises above 140 percent of the limit, the unit must be rented to a low-income tenant. In the case of a project described in section 142(d)(4)(B), income limitation is increased to 170 percent and new residents with income exceeding 40 percent of area median gross income must occupy low-income units. Recapture rules apply for substantially rehabilitation requirements. If the requirements of subparagraph (D) are not met for a project, it will not be considered a qualified low-income housing project and any deficiency assessment period will not expire before the prescribed date by section 6501. The deficiency assessment period will not expire before the prescribed date by section 6501 for the taxable year in which the 24-month period ends. \"For subsequent failure to meet requirements after initial qualification, refer to paragraph (5) of this subsection.\" Section 469 of the Internal Revenue Code is amended to include a $50,000 offset for certain low-income housing activities, limiting passive activity losses for residential rental properties in qualified low-income housing projects.
