    "content": "The growth in North American crude oil and natural gas production has led to efforts to expand the domestic pipeline network. Pipelines are a cost-effective and safe way to transport hydrocarbons, but they can also be controversial. Some proposed pipelines have faced challenges in obtaining federal authorizations and have been subject to litigation. Congress is interested in pipeline development due to their critical role in domestic energy markets. Failure to construct pipelines could lead to increased reliance on road or rail transport and constraints on getting resources to refineries and power plants. The growth in North American crude oil and natural gas production has led to efforts to expand the domestic pipeline network. Local interests along proposed pipeline routes raise concerns about environmental impacts and risks during pipeline operations. Stakeholders interested in reducing U.S. reliance on fossil fuels have brought greater public attention to oil and natural gas pipelines. Pipeline opponents argue that pipelines may indirectly contribute to human health, welfare, and environmental effects of oil and natural gas production and use. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers administers responsibilities related to certain pipeline segments that require authorizations. Federal agencies, including the Corps, play a role in overseeing oil and natural gas pipelines. Congressional debate centers on the federal role in protecting the environment, public health, economy, and energy security in relation to private energy development activities. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has limited authority in authorizing oil and natural gas pipelines, focusing on activities affecting regulated water bodies and wetlands. The Corps must authorize pipeline crossings before construction can begin, with analyses scoped to specific pipeline segments. The controversy surrounding the Dakota Access Pipeline highlights these regulatory limitations. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has limited authority in authorizing oil and natural gas pipelines, focusing on activities affecting regulated water bodies and wetlands. The Corps must authorize pipeline crossings before construction can begin, with analyses scoped to specific pipeline segments. Controversy surrounding the Dakota Access Pipeline has brought attention to the Corps' role in pipeline approvals, which may continue with other proposed pipelines and related litigation. This report provides an overview of the agency's involvement in oil and natural gas pipelines, discussing regulatory responsibilities and potential issues raised. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers authorizes oil and natural gas pipelines that may impact water bodies and wetlands. The agency complies with federal statutes like NEPA and NHPA for pipeline decisions. Interstate natural gas pipelines require authorization from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Local, state, tribal, and federal requirements apply to pipeline siting, construction, and operation. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) authorizes interstate natural gas pipelines, while domestic oil pipelines and intrastate natural gas pipelines do not require federal authorization for their routes. Pipeline safety standards, regulated by the Department of Transportation's Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), impact pipeline siting, construction, operation, and maintenance. PHMSA oversees the safe movement of natural gas and hazardous liquids, including crude oil, and is responsible for regulating interstate pipeline safety aspects such as design, construction, operation, maintenance, and spill response planning. The Department of Transportation's Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) oversees the safe movement of natural gas and hazardous liquids, including crude oil, and regulates interstate pipeline safety aspects such as design, construction, operation, maintenance, and spill response planning. Federal agency approval may be required for pipelines crossing federal land or affecting protected resources under federal law. The Corps' involvement in pipelines is limited to segments crossing Corps-managed federal land or flood easements. The Corps is responsible for authorizing pipeline activities that may affect or cross waters and wetlands regulated by the agency. Pipeline developers must have authorization from the Corps for any pipeline segment affecting or crossing Corps jurisdictional water, in accordance with the Clean Water Act. Pipeline developers are required to obtain authorization from the Corps under Section 404 of the Clean Water Act and/or Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act for activities that may affect U.S. waters. The Corps regulates all activities related to pipelines, whether interstate or intrastate, and whether transporting oil or natural gas. Approval from the civil works program of the Corps may be needed if the proposed pipeline could impact a Corps water resource. The Corps' civil works program may be involved in granting permission for pipelines to cross Corps land or non-Corps land with a Corps real estate interest. This includes obtaining a Corps permission to alter a civil works project and a Corps easement or consent for the pipeline. Figure 1 shows pipeline segments that may require the Corps' involvement, such as crossing Section 404 Corps-regulated waters and wetlands or Section 10 Corps-regulated waters. The Corps' civil works program may be involved in granting permission for pipelines to cross Corps land or non-Corps land with a Corps real estate interest. This includes obtaining a Corps permission to alter a civil works project and a Corps easement or consent for the pipeline. FERC is involved in authorizing the siting and construction of interstate natural gas pipelines, while the Corps plays a key role in approving domestic pipelines transporting crude oil, like the DAPL. Stakeholders often focus on the Corps' role in pipeline approvals due to its authority in approving entire pipelines that cross Corps-regulated waters and land. The Corps authorizes activities affecting waters under its jurisdiction, including utility line crossings like oil and gas pipelines. Its regulatory authority is limited to regulated waters and wetlands, not the entire pipeline route. The Corps does not regulate the largest components of pipeline projects. The Corps authorizes pipeline projects through two categories of permits - individual permits and general permits. General permits accounted for 94% of the Corps' regulatory actions in FY2016. Activities with significant adverse impacts require individual permits, which can be processed as standard permits or through a Letter of Permission procedure. Standard individual permits undergo public review, environmental documentation, and case-by-case evaluation. General permits issued by the Corps preauthorize similar activities with minimal adverse effects on waters and wetlands, reducing processing time and burden for both the Corps and applicants. Individual permits, on the other hand, require public notification, environmental documentation, and case-by-case evaluation, taking more time before authorization. General permits issued by the Corps, such as Nationwide permits (NWPs), cover a variety of activities like aids to navigation, minor dredging, and bank stabilization. There are 52 NWPs in force, and regional conditions can be applied to them. Other general permits apply at a state or regional level, while programmatic permits aim to avoid duplication with existing programs. Regional permits are a type of general permit. Regional permits, including Nationwide permits (NWPs), are general permits issued by the Corps for activities with minimal environmental impacts. NWPs are issued for five-year terms and automatically expire if not modified or reissued within five years. Pipeline activities requiring Corps authorization may qualify for a general permit, typically NWP 12. Proposals must meet general conditions to qualify for NWP authorization. Many activities covered by NWPs can proceed without advance notification to the Corps, while others require a pre-construction notification (PCN) and verification by the Corps. A PCN is a request to confirm if an activity is authorized by general permits. The Corps reviews activities with a PCN but not all activities authorized by an NWP. If a pipeline crossing does not meet general permit conditions, it may not qualify for NWP authorization. The Corps district may require an individual permit for pipeline crossings that do not meet general permit conditions. The Atlantic Sunrise natural gas pipeline underwent review for a standard individual permit due to exceeding wetland loss thresholds. NWP 12 authorizes utility-line activities in waters of the United States. NWP 12 permits utility-line activities in waters of the United States, with restrictions on the loss of acreage. Certain activities require a pre-construction notification (PCN) based on specific criteria, such as the need for a Section 10 permit or potential water discharge impacts. PCNs for NWP 12 must include information on other water crossings for the project that do not need PCNs. The Corps estimates that NWP 12 is used approximately 11,500 times per year nationally, affecting 1,700 acres of U.S. waters, including wetlands. About 9,000 uses require a PCN, while 2,500 do not. NWP 12 verifications do not need NEPA documentation or public comment. Data on NWP 12 use for oil and gas pipelines is not nationally aggregated. NWP 12 authorizations, including utility-line activities, may not cover all pipeline activities and individual permits may be required. There is no publicly available database tracking individual permits for oil and gas pipelines related to NWP 12 activities. Activities with significant adverse effects on the aquatic environment cannot be authorized by NWPs. Each NWP rulemaking ensures activities do not exceed minimal impact levels. The NWPs reissued in 2017 include 32 general conditions (GCs) that must be followed for activities authorized by an NWP. These conditions cover aspects such as navigation, water supply intakes, management of water flows, and proper maintenance of structures. Compliance with these GCs is necessary to ensure minimal adverse effects and proper maintenance of authorized activities. The NWPs reissued in 2017 include 32 general conditions (GCs) that must be followed for activities authorized by an NWP, covering aspects such as navigation, water supply intakes, water flow management, and structure maintenance. Compliance with these GCs is essential for minimal adverse effects and proper maintenance of authorized activities, including ensuring public safety and compliance with applicable NWP GCs, as well as specific conditions added by the district engineer. Additionally, activities must not cause more than minimal adverse effects on tribal rights, endangered species, or historic properties. The district engineer must consider specific factors for mitigation measures to minimize adverse effects on the aquatic environment, including avoiding and minimizing adverse effects on waters of the United States. Permittees must obtain water quality certification for discharges authorized by the NWP. The permittee must obtain water quality certification for discharges authorized by the NWP. Unlike individual permits, activities under NWPs do not require an evaluation of alternatives. GC 18 and GC 20 may require NWP use review for activities that may impact endangered species or historic properties. Compliance with the Endangered Species Act and historic properties is essential for NWP verification. The Corps Procedures for Protecting Historic Properties under GC 32 require permittees to submit a PCN for review within 30 days. The Corps district engineer has 45 days to review the PCN under most NWPs, unless ESA or NHPA consultations are needed. If no decision is made within 45 days, the permittee can assume NWP qualification. Compliance with the Endangered Species Act and historic properties is crucial for NWP verification. The Corps requires permittees to submit a PCN for review within 30 days, with a 45-day review period by the district engineer. If ESA or NHPA consultation is needed, work cannot start without written NWP verification. Public awareness of PCNs submitted to the Corps is limited. NWP 12 is often used for oil and gas pipeline activities, criticized for lack of separate environmental reviews. The Corps defends NWP 12, stating minimal environmental impacts if general conditions are met. The Corps has established general conditions for NWP 12 to ensure compliance with federal laws regarding species, historic properties, and environmental impacts. Critics argue that permittees not required to submit PCNs can determine project-specific conditions without Corps review. NWP 12 is limited to a \"single and complete project\" with minimal adverse environmental effects, defined as all crossings of a water body at a specific location. Multiple uses of NWP 12 are allowed for a single pipeline with multiple water crossings as long as each crossing does not exceed 0.5 acres. The Corps authorizes discrete pipeline segments crossing waters subject to its jurisdiction, not the entire pipeline. Legal challenges to this segmentation have been largely unsuccessful. Developers of nonfederal pipelines crossing federal lands must obtain real estate interests from the relevant federal agency. The Corps manages 4.1 million acres of land through federal flowage easements on nonfederal, often private, land as part of its civil works projects, which include dams, reservoirs, and levees. Pipeline developers need the Corps' permission to alter its projects when crossing Corps or non-Corps land with a Corps real estate interest, granted under Section 14 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899. The Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899, Section 408, allows the Secretary of the Army to grant permission for alterations to public works if it does not harm the public interest or impair the work's usefulness. This permission is required for all alterations to Corps projects, including pipelines over 24 inches in diameter. The Corps conducts a technical review before granting permission under Engineer Circular 1165-2-216. The Corps complies with Section 408 by following established processes for smaller pipelines and routine encroachments. Federal agencies, including the Corps, may grant easements for pipelines to cross federal land. The Corps can also consent to pipeline crossings on non-Corps lands with a real estate interest. The MLA requires congressional notification for oil or gas pipelines crossing federal land with a diameter of 24\" or larger. The Corps must provide detailed findings for easement applications and notify the House Natural Resources Committee and Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. The Corps released a policy guidance memorandum in 2008 for pipelines of 24\" or larger. The policy direction for congressional notification and granting of rights-of-way states that the Corps will wait 14 days for Committee response before executing an easement. The Corps follows specific guidelines for deciding on easements and consents, including ensuring they align with the authorized purposes of the Federal installation or project. Special requirements for safe operation may also be imposed. The Corps imposes 36 conditions for safe pipeline operation at Lake Oahe, including corrosion prevention measures, oil spill response plans, and leak detection. The Secretary of the Interior can grant easements for pipelines crossing federal lands after consultation with relevant agencies. The Corps imposes 36 conditions for safe pipeline operation at Lake Oahe, including corrosion prevention measures, oil spill response plans, and leak detection. Each agency head is responsible for administering and enforcing easements on lands under their jurisdiction. The Section 408 permission process, granting or denying easements, and MLA congressional notification requirements for pipelines are illustrated in Figure 2. Compliance with federal statutes, including NEPA documentation, is required for granting easements. The Corps produces a NEPA document as part of the technical review for Section 408 permission, gathering information from the pipeline developer to determine federal requirements. They assess potential impacts on resources and compliance with federal laws like NHPA and ESA. Regulatory and civil works actions may also be subject to other federal statutes such as NEPA, NHPA, and ESA, requiring consultation with other entities. Selected federal laws are listed for compliance. Federal laws may require consultation with state, tribal, or federal agencies for Corps pipeline-related actions. Compliance with Clean Water Act and Coastal Zone Management Act is necessary for federal licenses and approvals. Compliance with Section 401 of the Clean Water Act for NWPs is achieved through GC 25. Compliance with Section 401 of the Clean Water Act for NWPs is achieved through GC 25. States or tribes can certify activities authorized by NWPs and may require water quality certification for certain activities. Denial of water quality certification can impact Corps' regulatory authorizations for pipelines, as seen in the case of the Northern Access Pipeline project in New York. The Corps requires compliance with Section 401 of the Clean Water Act for pipeline permits in New York. The pipeline developer must address concerns for state water quality certification to proceed. The Corps also follows NEPA and historic properties procedures in its regulatory program. The Corps regulations for pipeline permits in New York require compliance with Section 401 of the Clean Water Act and address concerns for state water quality certification. The agency's procedures for NEPA and historic properties reflect its interpretation of jurisdiction limits, with regulations from the Council on Environmental Quality identifying federal actions subject to NEPA. Each federal agency must adopt these regulations and supplement them as needed. The Corps supplements CEQ regulations for NEPA procedures in its decision-making process. It provides guidance for preparing NEPA documents, such as EIS and EA, for regulatory actions like permit issuance. Regulatory actions typically require an EA but not necessarily an EIS. The Corps does not require NEPA review for individual NWP verifications. NEPA compliance for NWP 12 involves preparation of an EA resulting in a final decision document. The decision document identifies conditions to ensure minimal adverse environmental effects for projects. Understanding Corps NEPA reviews helps recognize the extent of their regulatory actions. The Corps evaluates the impacts of actions it controls under NEPA. The agency's interpretation of its control dictates the geographic area for environmental impact evaluation. The Corps established procedures for historic property protection in its regulations. The Corps follows regulations in Appendix C for historic property protection, consulting with state or tribal preservation officers if historic properties may be affected. The Advisory Council on Historical Preservation may also be involved. The Advisory Council on Historical Preservation (ACHP) was established under NHPA to advise on historic preservation and may be involved in consultations. There have been disagreements with the Corps regarding NHPA Section 106 compliance procedures, with ACHP not accepting the Corps procedures as consistent with ACHP regulations. Some federal district courts have declined to apply the Corps procedures, citing inconsistency with NHPA or non-approval by ACHP. ACHP has objected to the Corps reviewing each water crossing by a linear project as a separate undertaking. The ACHP disagrees with the Corps' interpretation of what constitutes an \"undertaking\" under NHPA Section 106 regulations, arguing that it should be broader than a single water crossing. The Corps maintains that its procedures for historic properties in Appendix C meet the requirements of NHPA Section 106, particularly in relation to pipelines. The Corps' regulatory authorities require authorization for activities involving crossings of jurisdictional waters and wetlands, utility line substations, foundations for overhead utility lines, and access roads that impact waters of the United States. Oil pipeline segments in upland areas outside the Corps' jurisdiction do not require authorization. The Corps does not regulate oil pipelines directly but only components involving specific activities. The Corps only regulates components of oil pipelines or utility lines that involve activities under its authority, such as those related to the Clean Water Act and Rivers and Harbors Act. The agency does not have jurisdiction over the entire pipeline or areas upland of regulated waters. This interpretation was supported by a district court in Standing Rock Sioux Tribe v. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Stakeholders have raised concerns about the Corps' procedures for identifying historic sites. The Corps requires the permit applicant to identify historic properties that may be affected by pipeline activities under NWP. The Corps must initiate Section 106 review and consultation when historic properties are identified in a PCN for activities under NWP 12. The project cannot proceed until the Corps completes a site-specific analysis to determine the impact on historic sites. The Corps only regulates components of pipelines under its authority, not the entire pipeline or upland areas. Stakeholders have concerns about the Corps' procedures for identifying historic sites. The Corps district engineer is responsible for identifying historic properties that may be affected by pipeline activities that require individual permits. The growth in North American crude oil and natural gas production has led to efforts to expand the domestic pipeline network, raising concerns about the environmental and health impacts. The Corps' regulatory authorities and civil works processes are under scrutiny regarding the development and approval of pipelines and their routes. The Corps is authorized to regulate certain pipeline activities that may affect waters and wetlands. The Corps is authorized to regulate pipeline activities affecting waters and wetlands, granting permissions for pipeline segments. Controversies arise regarding impacts on the environment, historic properties, and safety concerns. Policy questions include evaluating impacts, agency authority limits, and addressing pipeline safety risks. The Corps is authorized to regulate pipeline activities, including addressing safety risks and considering public interest in decision-making processes. The use of general permits for pipeline segments raises questions about compliance with NHPA requirements and stakeholder involvement. The Corps is authorized to regulate pipeline activities, including safety risks and public interest. Questions about compliance with NHPA requirements and stakeholder involvement arise in the use of general permits for pipeline segments. These questions reflect debates about federal actions associated with private infrastructure."
