    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Stop Militarizing Law Enforcement Act\". Congress finds that the Department of Defense provides excess military equipment to local law enforcement agencies through the Law Enforcement Support Office program, including mine-resistant ambush-protected vehicles and weapons. This equipment, originally purchased for wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, is now being used by police and sheriff's departments in their regular operations. Approximately $4 billion worth of excess military equipment, including firearms, computers, helicopters, and clothing, has been transferred to police organizations in all 50 states and four territories. In May 2012, a moratorium was placed on weapons transfers due to reports of missing equipment and inappropriate transfers. The moratorium on weapons transfers was lifted in October 2013 without adequate safeguards, allowing law enforcement departments to acquire free \"military-grade\" equipment that could be misused. Property obtained through the program must be used within one year, potentially incentivizing unnecessary and dangerous use of such equipment. The Department of Defense categorizes equipment eligible for transfer under the 1033 program as \"controlled\" and \"un-controlled\" equipment, including weapons, explosives, mine resistant ambush protected vehicles, aircraft capable of being modified to carry armament, and silencers. SEC. 3. LIMITATION ON DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE TRANSFER OF PERSONAL PROPERTY TO LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES. Section 2576a of title 10, United States Code is amended to focus on counterterrorism efforts. Recipients must certify their capacity to operate the property. The amended Section 2576a of title 10, United States Code requires recipients of property to certify their ability to operate it and submit a description of its intended use. Recipients must also certify that they will return the property if it becomes surplus to their needs, and non-Federal recipients must notify the local community of their request for property through various means. The amended Section 2576a of title 10, United States Code requires recipients to certify their ability to operate transferred property and provide documentation accounting for all controlled property, including arms and ammunition. The Secretary must provide certification before transferring property to agencies, including arms and ammunition. If certification cannot be provided for a Federal or State agency, no additional property can be transferred. An annual report on excess property must be submitted to Congress before any transfer, along with a certification that the transfer complies with the law. Limitations on transfers are also outlined. The Secretary is restricted from transferring certain personal property of the Department of Defense, including controlled firearms, ammunition, explosives, vehicles, drones, aircraft, silencers, and banned items. These limitations are in place to regulate the transfer process. The Secretary may waive restrictions on transferring certain vehicles for disaster or rescue purposes if deemed necessary for public safety. Congress must be notified of any waivers issued. The Secretary may waive restrictions on transferring vehicles for disaster or rescue purposes, requiring public notice of the waiver and transfer details. An exemption may be provided for aircraft parts transferred as part of regular maintenance. The Secretary may waive restrictions on transferring vehicles for disaster or rescue purposes, with conditions for return if civil liberties violations occur. Certification to Congress is required for funds to be used for the program. The controlled property transferred under this section must demonstrate 100 percent accountability, verified through in-person inventory by the State coordinator for non-Federal agencies. Federal agencies receiving controlled property are also subject to accountability measures. The Secretary of Defense or an agent must conduct in-person inventory of controlled property transferred to Federal agencies to ensure 100% accountability. Agencies not meeting this requirement are suspended from receiving further property. State coordinators must certify accountability for non-Federal agencies in their state. The coordinator ensures agency compliance with requirements for receiving property under this section. The Secretary of Defense certifies agency compliance or suspends eligibility. Federal or State agencies receiving controlled property cannot take ownership of it. The Secretary must notify Congress before downgrading or cannibalizing property, and submit quarterly reports on property use. The Secretary must notify Congress before downgrading or cannibalizing property and submit quarterly reports on property use. Additionally, the Secretary shall submit an annual report to Congress detailing the percentage of equipment lost by recipients, the transfer of new property, and specific information about the type and monetary value of the property transferred. The amendments made by this Act apply to property transfers made after the enactment date."
