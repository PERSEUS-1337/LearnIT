    "content": "The report analyzes DOD's efforts to obtain cloud computing services through the JEDI Cloud acquisition program. DOD aims to acquire a cloud solution for Unclassified, Secret, and Top Secret requirements in two phases. The first phase focuses on commercially available cloud services, while the second phase involves transitioning existing data and applications. The military departments and agencies are transitioning existing data and applications to the cloud, which involves remotely storing and accessing information and software programs through the internet. Cloud computing relies on a cloud infrastructure that can be deployed privately, publicly, or through hybrid deployments. End users access cloud computing capabilities through service models like Software as a Service (SaaS). Cloud computing offers three main service models: Software as a Service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS). Major cloud vendors like Microsoft and Amazon are combining aspects of these models in their products and services. Since the establishment of the Federal Cloud Computing Initiative (FCCI) in 2009, the federal government, including DOD, has actively worked to shift portions of its IT needs to cloud-based services through strategies like \"Cloud First.\" This move aimed to prioritize secure, reliable, and cost-effective cloud solutions. Cost, efficiency, accessibility, agility, security, and reliability are all key considerations in public and private sector decisions regarding cloud service adoption. For more details on cloud computing characteristics, deployment models, and service models, refer to CRS Report R42887. The Department of Defense (DOD) has been working to acquire cloud services to reduce total investment in physical IT infrastructure. DOD's current cloud services use is described as \"decentralized\" and \"disparate,\" with over 500 public and private cloud infrastructures supporting Unclassified and Secret requirements. DOD acknowledges the need for clear guidance on cloud computing adoption and migration. The DOD's migration to cloud services has been disjointed due to lack of clear guidance, leading to limited capability and inefficient acquisitions. The Cloud Strategy aims to establish a multi-cloud ecosystem with a General Purpose and Fit For Purpose clouds. The JEDI Cloud program will provide a foundational enterprise-wide cloud for most DOD systems, while Fit For Purpose clouds will be task-specific. The DOD's Cloud Strategy includes General Purpose and Fit For Purpose clouds. Fit For Purpose clouds are task-specific commercial or on-premises solutions, like the DEOS SaaS acquisition program and DISA's milCloud 2.0. Acquisition guidance for cloud services may be found in FAR Part 39 or FAR Part 12, depending on the contract strategy. Government-wide acquisition policies for cloud services, including FedRAMP, apply. DOD-specific policies are outlined in DFARS Subpart 239.76, requiring DOD to acquire cloud services using commercial terms. Contracts can only be awarded to providers with provisional DISA authorization. Legal jurisdiction over data accessed via cloud services must be maintained. All data stored and processed by or for DOD must reside in a facility under the exclusive legal jurisdiction of the United States. Cloud computing service providers are required to store government data within the United States or outlying areas. Cloud services must have an Authorization to Operate (ATO) based on agreed-upon security controls. The 2014 DOD Memorandum authorized the direct acquisition of cloud services by DOD components. The Department of Defense emphasizes the need for significant investment in key technology capabilities like cyber defense, autonomy, artificial intelligence, and machine learning to maintain military superiority against near-peer adversaries. The cloud computing and data storage capabilities acquired through the JEDI Cloud procurement are seen as foundational technologies for these investments. The Joint Chiefs of Staff stress the importance of accelerating cloud adoption to create a global, resilient, and secure information environment for warfighting. DOD Chief Information Officer Dana Deasy emphasizes the need for an enterprise-wide cloud to enable data-driven decision making and support worldwide DOD operations. Delays in the JEDI Cloud procurement could impact ongoing Department activities, such as the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center's efforts to deliver AI-enabled capabilities to DOD. The Cloud Executive Steering Group (CESG) oversaw DOD's cloud adoption initiative, reporting directly to the Deputy Secretary of Defense. Initially chaired by Ellen Lord, it included key members like the Director of the Strategic Capabilities Office and the Managing Partner of the Defense Innovation Unit. The CESG was responsible for leading phase one of DOD's cloud adoption initiative, specifically the JEDI Cloud program. In January 2018, changes were announced to the membership and leadership of the CESG. In January 2018, the DSD announced changes to the CESG leadership, with the DCMO chairing the group and the DOD CIO added as a member. The DOD CIO would oversee DOD's cloud adoption initiative, including the JEDI Cloud program. The CCPO was transitioned to the Office of the CIO, and an RFI for the JEDI Cloud program was issued in October 2017. The Department issued a draft Request for Proposal (RFP) for the JEDI Cloud program in early 2018, with the final RFP released in July 2018. In April 2019, DOD announced a downselect from four proposals, with Amazon Web Services and Microsoft remaining in contention. The contract award decision was initially expected in August 2019 but may be delayed as Secretary of Defense Dr. Mark T. Esper reviews the program. DOD requested $61.9 million for the JEDI Cloud acquisition program in FY 2020. DOD plans to award a single contract for the JEDI Cloud program, requiring worldwide cloud computing services, including in austere environments. Offerors must comply with the JEDI Cloud Cyber Security Plan and provide dedicated infrastructure for classified services. The minimum guaranteed award is $1 million, with rapid deployment of new cloud-related services and ongoing parity with public commercial prices expected. The DOD plans to award the JEDI Cloud contract with a minimum guaranteed award of $1 million and a maximum ceiling of $10 billion over a potential 10-year period. The contract includes a two-year base ordering period with three additional option periods. The contract will be awarded based on a two-step evaluation process against seven performance-based criteria. The evaluation process for the JEDI Cloud contract involves assessing proposals based on individual sub-factors, with an \"unacceptable\" judgement immediately disqualifying a proposal. For example, one sub-factor requires offerors to demonstrate that additional traffic from the JEDI Cloud does not overwhelm their network capacity. If a proposal is deemed \"acceptable\" for each sub-factor, it moves to the next phase of evaluation. The Department of Defense (DOD) evaluated proposals for the JEDI Cloud contract against technical factors and price proposals to determine a competitive range of offerors. Qualifying offerors were then assessed on their approach to meeting small business goals and the proposed solution's capabilities. DOD's acquisition strategy faced resistance from companies like Amazon Web Services, Google, IBM, and Microsoft, as well as industry associations concerned about awarding the contract to a single company. The IT Alliance for Public Sector raised concerns about the Department of Defense's plan to award a single cloud contract, stating it goes against industry best practices and could limit competition. Google decided not to bid for the contract due to potential conflicts with its principles. Oracle America and IBM filed protests with the Government Accountability Office. Oracle America and IBM filed bid protests with the Government Accountability Office against the JEDI Cloud solicitation. GAO denied Oracle America's protests and dismissed IBM's protests. Oracle America then filed a bid protest lawsuit with the U.S. Court of Federal Claims, alleging restrictive criteria and favoritism towards Amazon Web Services due to conflicts of interest. The DOD investigations found no unmitigated conflicts of interest by Amazon Web Services, but identified individual ethical violations. The U.S. Court of Federal Claims ruled against Oracle America in a bid protest lawsuit regarding the JEDI Cloud solicitation. The U.S. Court of Federal Claims ruled against Oracle America in a bid protest lawsuit regarding the JEDI Cloud solicitation, stating that Oracle did not meet certain performance-based criteria. DOD officials view JEDI Cloud as a test model for transitioning legacy IT systems to the cloud, emphasizing it is not a final solution due to the Department's lack of experience in deploying enterprise-wide cloud solutions. The JEDI Cloud contract aims to maximize DOD's flexibilities and validate operational capabilities within a 2-year base ordering period. Option periods will be exercised based on market conditions. Offerors had to provide detailed transition and data portability plans in their proposals. The JEDI Cloud contract involves extracting relevant data and migrating it to another cloud environment. Section 2304a of Title 10, U.S. Code allows for multiple awards for contracts, with a limit of $112 million for single-source contracts unless specific circumstances apply. DOD justified using a single-award contract for JEDI Cloud procurement based on legal requirements and FAR regulations. The JEDI Cloud contracting officer decided against using a multiple award approach due to various reasons, including expected higher costs, security risks, and technical complexity. The Department released its determination that a single-award contract would be more beneficial in this instance. The JEDI Cloud contract, awarded under 10 U.S.C. 2304a(d)(3), allows for firm-fixed price task orders and delivery orders. Pricing clauses aim to benefit from future marketplace competition and provide access to new cloud services. The contract automatically adjusts DOD's prices based on the contractor's public commercial prices. The contract allows for adding new or improved cloud services at fixed unit prices, ensuring they are not higher than publicly available prices. If a service is eliminated, replacement services must be offered at the same price. Once added to the catalog, prices cannot be changed without approval. The U.S. Court of Federal Claims questioned DOD's use of the exception for firm fixed-price orders. The DOD CIO was required by Section 1064 of P.L. 115-232 to support the cloud adoption initiative by acquiring advanced network capabilities and analyzing systems for migration to the JEDI Cloud environment. The U.S. Court of Federal Claims raised concerns about DOD's use of the exception for firm fixed-price orders. The DOD CIO submitted a report on the status of DOD's cloud adoption initiative as required by Section 1064 of P.L. 115-232. The report was submitted in January 2019. Section 1064 also mandated an assessment to determine cloud-hosted systems before approving new developments. Additionally, it requires the Deputy Secretary of Defense to ensure competition in the JEDI Cloud procurement process. The importance of modernizing networks with commercial capabilities for DOD's cloud transition was emphasized in the FY2019 NDAA conference report. The conferees urge the Department of Defense to enhance cloud technologies for efficiency and security, improve communication with Congress on the Cloud Initiative, and consider additional legislation if transparency does not improve. Section 8137 of P.L. 115-245 prevented the use of FY2019 funds for cloud adoption. The FY2019 DOD appropriations bill prevented the use of funds for migrating data to cloud services until certain reports were submitted. The House Armed Services Committee commended DOD's cloud strategy, emphasizing the benefits of cloud infrastructure like JEDI for accessing information remotely. The committee endorses the Department's strategy for a flexible enterprise cloud architecture that allows for both general purpose and fit-for-purpose cloud solutions through a multi-cloud, multi-vendor approach. Section 1035 of S. 1790 would require the DOD to develop policy for transitioning data and applications to the cloud, aiming to improve support. The Senate Armed Services Committee report for the FY2020 NDAA highlights the importance of cybersecurity testing for commercial cloud products and services to assess the Department of Defense's data security and cyber defense response. The report directs the Secretary of Defense to provide a briefing on this matter to the House and Senate Armed Services Committees. The House Appropriations Committee recommends including independent cyber assessments for commercially provided infrastructure in annual reports. They express skepticism towards DOD's \"single vendor contract strategy\" for the JEDI Cloud procurement, urging a multiple vendor cloud strategy instead. The House Appropriations Committee recommends a multi-cloud, multi-vendor approach for DOD's cloud strategy, expressing concerns about deviating from established OMB policy and industry best practices. They require a report from the DOD CIO before any funds can be used to migrate data to the JEDI Cloud, outlining plans for transitioning to a multi-cloud environment and listing anticipated contracting opportunities for commercial cloud services over the next two years. The DOD CIO is directed to provide details on upcoming cloud procurement, contract value, and performance period. Quarterly reports on cloud adoption must be submitted to Congress. Some Members of Congress have suggested delaying the JEDI Cloud contract award for alternate acquisition strategies or pending investigations. Some Members of Congress have supported DOD's acquisition strategy for the JEDI Cloud contract, while others have raised concerns about awarding the contract to a single company. Observers debate whether a single award aligns with federal cloud computing guidance, with some experts suggesting the JEDI Cloud could be part of a broader multi-cloud system. Critics argue that the JEDI Cloud requirements do not align with DOD's Cloud Strategy and have called for the RFP to be rescinded and revised. The Department plans to rescind and revise the JEDI Cloud RFP. Concerns have been raised about the single-award contract potentially limiting future competition for DOD cloud services. Supporters believe the program's platform-agnostic requirements will facilitate migration to other environments. Congress may need to consider issues related to the ongoing JEDI Cloud acquisition process. The Department plans to rescind and revise the JEDI Cloud RFP. Congress may consider directing the Department to report on lessons learned in the execution of the contract. The U.S. Court of Federal Claims decision supported the Department's findings regarding ethical violations in the bid protest lawsuit. The Department of Defense identified ethical violations in the acquisition process for the JEDI Cloud procurement, causing delays. Congress may need to review the emphasis on ethical conduct and training for acquisition positions and consider extending training to non-acquisition personnel providing support for procurement. The Department of Defense is reviewing the defense acquisition workforce to determine necessary changes in curriculum and certification requirements."
