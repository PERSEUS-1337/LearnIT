    "content": "The Senate approved two resolutions on January 25, 2013, affecting the process for considering legislation and nominations in the 113th Congress. S.Res. 15 established orders to expedite bill consideration and nomination approvals. S.Res. 16 made changes to Senate rules to speed up bill proceedings and alter procedures for sending measures to conference committees. These changes aim to streamline processes while upholding the principle of majority decision-making. The Senate allows for majority decision-making, but individual or minority groups can influence decisions through filibustering. The cloture process, requiring three-fifths of the Senate, can be used to end debate and proceed to a vote. The Senate cloture process requires three-fifths of the Senate to end debate on a bill, allowing for a vote to proceed. After invoking cloture, consideration of the bill can continue for up to 30 additional hours. The new rules do not eliminate filibustering but require unanimity to swiftly reach a vote on passage of a bill. The new Senate rules do not eliminate filibustering but aim to reduce the time it takes to reach a final vote on certain matters by altering the cloture process. This gives individual Senators influence over the Senate agenda. The report explains the impact of each new standing order and rule. The Senate operates under unanimous consent agreements that reflect Senators' rights under the rules, allowing for efficient business conduct. For example, after cloture is invoked, Senators can agree by unanimous consent to allow overnight hours to count against post-cloture time, benefiting both those who wish to delay a vote and those who want to vote as soon as possible. The unanimous consent agreement in the Senate reflects Senators' rights under the rules, allowing for efficient business conduct. Senators can decide to waive their right to delay proceedings based on what they could achieve using regular rules. Recent procedural changes may impact unanimous consent negotiations by altering expectations about how legislation and nominations are processed. Consent practices in the Senate are standard and influence Senators' decisions on whether to object to unanimous consent agreements. Senators consider the potential costs of objecting, with higher costs for actions that deviate from normal business procedures. The Senate agreement in January could signal changes in Senate processes. A report describes four changes and their impact on Senate operations. It clarifies procedural options and mechanisms established by new rules and orders. The report aims to explain new procedures and their potential impact. The Senate interprets its rules through precedent, rulings of the chair, and consultation with the Senate Parliamentarian. Procedural changes and potential consequences are the focus of the report. The Senate made two procedural changes through the approval of S.Res. 15, which will expire at the end of the Congress. These changes are considered \"standing orders\" and will have the same force for the 113th Congress. The Senate made procedural changes through S.Res. 15 for the 113th Congress. Standing orders have the same force as rules and require smaller approval coalitions than standing rule changes. Cloture for rule amendments needs a two-thirds vote, while cloture for procedural changes like S.Res. 15 needs three-fifths of the Senate. Consideration of legislation in the Senate starts with unanimous consent or a motion to proceed. S.Res. 15 in the Senate creates a special motion to proceed that allows for a majority vote after four hours of debate. This new process encourages consideration of at least four priority amendments, two from each party, which are protected from further amendment. The Senate's special motion to proceed under S.Res. 15 allows for a majority vote after four hours of debate, encouraging consideration of four priority amendments, two from each party, which are protected from further amendment. Cloture process guarantees the opportunity to offer all four amendments with progressively later deadlines for submission. Non-germane priority amendments post-cloture require 60 votes for approval, and even after the 30 hours of post-cloture consideration, a priority amendment could still be offered with up to an hour of debate. Without cloture, priority amendments are not subject to debate limitations. The Senate's special motion to proceed under S.Res. 15 allows for a majority vote after four hours of debate, encouraging consideration of four priority amendments, two from each party. The standing order seeks to alter Senate practices that have become frustrating to many Senators, including the cloture process and the majority leader's ability to \"fill the amendment tree.\" The expedited motion to proceed is expected to only be used when amendment opportunities will be allowed. The standing order under S.Res. 15 aims to streamline the Senate's amendment process, allowing for quick consideration of bills with minority amendment opportunities. This formal process could replace ad hoc unanimous consent arrangements, promoting a more orderly and predictable legislative workflow. The standing order under S.Res. 15 aims to streamline the Senate's amendment process, allowing for quick consideration of bills with minority amendment opportunities. This could lead to Senators negotiating unanimous consent agreements reflecting the new standing order, altering Senate proceedings by changing expectations. The standing order seeks to address lengthy bill consideration and amendment tree filling practices that emerged to accommodate individual Senators' procedural powers. The discussion explains each provision of the standing order for three stages of the legislative process. The standing order under S.Res. 15 aims to streamline the Senate's amendment process, allowing for quick consideration of bills with minority amendment opportunities. In the 113th Congress, a Senator can move to proceed to a bill pursuant to Section 1 of S.Res. 15, with decisions regarding the specific implementation of the standing order yet to be made. This description should be viewed as preliminary, illustrating the options Senators have for interpreting and applying the standing order. The Senate's special motion to proceed allows for four hours of debate, with time divided between majority and minority floor managers. A majority vote is needed to approve the motion, and no cloture process is required. If approved, four specified amendments must be addressed before any other amendments can be offered. The Senate's special motion to proceed allows for four hours of debate, with time divided between majority and minority floor managers. A majority vote is needed to approve the motion, and no cloture process is required. If approved, four specified amendments must be addressed before any other amendments can be offered. The priority amendments are to be offered sequentially, alternating by party, beginning with a minority party amendment and ending with a majority party amendment. The first minority party member recognized by the presiding officer after the bill is called up would have the opportunity to offer the first amendment. The Senator who offers the first amendment would likely be the minority leader or the ranking minority Member of the committee of jurisdiction. The standing order in the Senate gives the minority party the first opportunity to offer a priority amendment, with only one pending at a time. The timing of subsequent amendments is not specified, but likely negotiated by floor leaders. It is unclear how committee-reported amendments will be treated under this order. The Senate standing order allows the minority party to offer priority amendments first, with only one pending at a time. The treatment of committee-reported amendments under this order is unclear. Amendments to complete substitute amendments are considered first-degree amendments under Senate rules. The Senate standing order allows the minority party to offer priority amendments first, with only one pending at a time. Committee-reported amendments may be treated on a case-by-case basis by unanimous consent. If a committee-reported substitute is a bipartisan alternative, Senators may prioritize amendments to it. The Senate may establish a practice for handling committee amendments under the standing order. The Senate has options for considering committee-recommended text for amendment under the standing order. Debate on priority amendments is not limited, and a vote on an amendment can be disposed of through various means such as a vote on approving the amendment, tabling the amendment with a simple majority vote, or a successful point of order. The standing order in the Senate dictates that priority amendments cannot be amended while pending, ensuring they are voted on as proposed by the sponsor. If an amendment violates a rule, it falls, and the sponsor can withdraw it. The order also limits the opportunity to offer multiple priority amendments due to potential extended debate. The Senate cannot amend priority amendments while pending, ensuring they are voted on as proposed. Amendments are commonly first-degree and cannot be divided for separate consideration. The presiding officer decides on dividing amendments with multiple propositions. The presiding officer determines if each part of a divided amendment is independent, and if so, each portion is voted on separately. Senators typically do not request division of amendments. Priority amendments are voted on as a single proposal, even if they contain unrelated provisions. If a priority amendment is approved, the amended text can still be further amended. This prevents restrictions on what text can be changed by subsequent amendments. The Senate can approve a priority amendment and then approve a subsequent amendment that replaces it. The majority leader stated that the minority's added language will not be removed by the last amendment. A motion to commit or recommit the bill is not allowed while a priority amendment is pending to ensure the opportunity for offering a priority amendment is not hindered. The standing order in the Senate allows for the quick consideration of a bill and the start of the amending process. However, amendments and the bill are still subject to unlimited debate, so proponents may need to invoke cloture to reach a passage vote. The standing order also sets deadlines for submitting priority amendments after cloture is filed. Under Rule XXII, when cloture is invoked on a measure in the Senate, amendments must be submitted by specific deadlines. The first priority amendment (minority) deadline is 1 p.m. the day after cloture, the second priority amendment (majority) is due by 3 p.m., the third priority amendment (minority) by 5 p.m., and the final priority amendment (majority) by 7 p.m. These deadlines are strict and missed submissions cannot be offered after cloture. After cloture is invoked, filing deadlines affect amendments. Priority amendments may be offered and disposed of before a cloture vote. Non-germane standard amendments are not considered post-cloture under Rule XXII. A point of order against a non-germane standard amendment results in its dismissal. However, a point of order against a non-germane priority amendment requires 60 votes for approval. The presiding officer, with the Parliamentarian's advice, determines if a priority amendment is germane; if not, it needs 60 votes for approval. After cloture is invoked on a bill, opportunities to offer standard amendments before the vote on passage of the bill are limited. Senate rules restrict the number and form of pending amendments, potentially leading to all amendments remaining pending during the 30-hour post-cloture period. Votes would then occur on any pending amendments first, followed immediately by the bill, without further opportunity for amendments. After cloture is invoked on a bill, opportunities to offer standard amendments before the vote on passage of the bill are limited. Votes would occur first on any pending amendments, and then immediately on the bill, without any further opportunity for amendments. If the 30 hours of post-cloture consideration were to expire before all priority amendments were offered, a Senator could still offer a priority amendment in the prescribed order, which would be debated for one hour. This would restrict the ability to offer amendments other than the four priority amendments. The standing order impacts the Senate amending process by limiting opportunities for amendments after cloture is invoked on a bill. Three examples of possible proceedings are discussed, highlighting procedural facets of the standing order. These examples aim to explain what can be done with the consent of all Senators, a coalition of three-fifths of the Senate, and a simple majority. The standing order impacts the Senate amending process by limiting opportunities for amendments after cloture is invoked on a bill. Possible procedures in different contexts might assist in clarifying options Senators have when negotiating unanimous consent agreements. Proponents of a measure might negotiate unanimous consent agreements for specific bills to add predictability to the process. The standing order in the Senate impacts the amending process by providing predictability in scheduling votes and discussions on amendments. Senators historically proceed with ad hoc arrangements for floor consideration even with less than unanimous support. The standing order influences unanimous consent agreements and the decision to waive procedural rights. Senators in the Senate may negotiate the disposition of minority and majority priority amendments without unanimous consent. A numerical majority can table an amendment, while a numerical minority can filibuster it. A unanimous consent agreement can benefit both sides by allowing minority and majority priority amendments to receive a vote, requiring 60 votes for approval. A unanimous consent agreement benefits both minority and majority by allowing priority amendments to receive a vote with 60 votes required for approval. This agreement streamlines the legislative process by avoiding time-consuming cloture procedures and advancing consideration of the legislation. The Senate uses unanimous consent agreements to streamline the legislative process by allowing priority amendments to be voted on with 60 votes required for approval. Floor managers negotiate terms for the consideration and disposition of amendments, leading to a final vote on the bill. The Senate reaches a final vote on a bill through unanimous consent or the cloture process. Proponents may face challenges if a single Senator objects, affecting the decision to proceed. The standing order allows a coalition of three-fifths to bring a bill up for debate, emphasizing the importance of support from the majority. The standing order allows a three-fifths majority to bring a bill up for debate in the Senate, expediting the process by potentially reducing the time needed for final disposition. This can be beneficial when cloture is expected and could also expedite the consideration of non-germane amendments. The standing order in the Senate allows for expedited consideration of bills by invoking cloture on both the bill and any non-germane amendments simultaneously. This process can reduce the overall time needed to pass legislation with three-fifths support. The Senate follows procedural steps to bring a bill to a vote, including offering a motion to proceed, cloture, minority amendments, a complete substitute amendment, and deadlines for submitting additional amendments. The Senate sets deadlines for filing amendments, invokes cloture on the bill with a three-fifths vote, and considers the pending amendment for 30 hours before agreeing to the majority leader's amendment with at least 60 votes. The Senate passes the bill, as amended, by majority vote after considering amendments from both minority and majority parties. The possibility of this occurrence could affect unanimous consent negotiations, with leaders indicating that the four priority amendments are a floor, not a ceiling. If proponents try to preclude amendments, Senators may oppose cloture. In the 113th Congress, Senators could oppose cloture to limit the number of amendments offered to four. A bipartisan coalition of 60 Senators could expedite the process of passing major legislation in 5 days, compared to at least 10 days under regular procedures. Senators may use a standing order to begin consideration of a bill before it has the necessary support to reach a final vote. Proponents of a measure may believe that once it is before the Senate, with amendments agreed to, it will gain enough support to end consideration. They may see the lack of initial supermajority support as a process disagreement rather than a policy one. Having a measure on the floor can increase the issue's importance and influence Senators' voting decisions. Starting consideration with a debate-limited motion to proceed may not be preferred by proponents. Beginning consideration of a bill without a three-fifths coalition to end consideration could waste floor time that could be used more productively on other legislation. Even if cloture is invoked, a bill may never pass, especially if there is no support for it. Using a debate-limited motion to draw attention to an issue may be less effective if the minority can quickly change the subject with irrelevant amendments. This could lead to potential votes on unrelated topics without a guarantee of a final vote on the main measure. The Senate may consider a measure using a special motion without a guarantee of a final vote. The procedural steps include offering a motion to proceed, allowing for debate, and offering amendments related or unrelated to the bill. Debate on the amendments is unlimited, and a simple majority cannot close debate to reach a vote. The Senate may consider a measure using a special motion without a guarantee of a final vote. Senators attempt to negotiate a unanimous consent agreement or a policy proposal capable of receiving three-fifths support. If unsuccessful, the Senate turns to other business. This proceeding would differ from those hitherto available in that the bill would be taken up quickly by majority vote and a vote would occur in relation to a minority party amendment on any subject. The Senate has standing orders to accelerate the consideration of nominations with cloture. The standing order reduces the maximum time for consideration from 30 hours to 8 hours for most nominations and 2 hours for U.S. district court nominations. This aims to address concerns about the lengthy nomination process in recent Congresses. The Senate has standing orders to expedite the consideration of nominations with cloture, reducing the maximum time for consideration. One complaint is about individual Senators delaying nominations that would otherwise be approved easily. S.Res. 15 aims to streamline the cloture process for executive branch and federal court nominations. The Senate has standing orders to expedite the consideration of nominations with cloture, reducing the maximum time for consideration. Cloture cannot be filed on a nomination until it is before the Senate, and if invoked by three-fifths of the Senate, the maximum number of hours for post-cloture consideration is reduced. This standing order excludes some high-level executive and judicial nominations. The standing order limits post-cloture consideration for certain high-level executive and judicial nominations in the 113th Congress. The procedure under this standing order differs from Rule XXII, with time divided in the usual form where managers from each side control half the time. Consideration terms are likely established by unanimous consent, allowing Senators to negotiate within their party. The standing order in the Senate limits post-cloture consideration for certain nominations, allowing Senators to negotiate within their party. The time for quorum calls will be charged to the side suggesting the absence of a quorum, unless agreed otherwise. Individual Senators can delay nomination consideration by using floor time, even if there is majority support. Once cloture is invoked, only time spent considering the nomination counts towards the 30 hours of post-cloture consideration time. The Senate's standing order limits post-cloture consideration for nominations, allowing negotiation within parties. Senators can delay consideration by using floor time, even with majority support. Once cloture is invoked, only time spent on the nomination counts towards the 30 hours of post-cloture consideration time. The practice of placing \"holds\" on nominations evolved to accommodate individual Senators' procedural power. Section 2 of S.Res. 15 allows three-fifths of the Senate to expedite the consideration of nominations on the floor. The majority leader could file cloture on multiple U.S. district court nominations in a short timeframe, with cloture and approval votes occurring within a few hours of each other. This process could potentially extend late into the evening if all available time is used for each nomination. The Senate could expedite the consideration of nominations on the floor by allowing 15 minutes for each cloture and approval vote, potentially approving 5 of 10 nominations by 10:30 p.m. This standing order may lead to quicker approval of nominations with little debate and could impact the practice of honoring holds on nominations. The Senate approved a standing order on January 24, 2013, which could affect the consideration of nominations by limiting a single Senator from preventing widely supported nominations. The standing order may make it harder for Senators to withhold consent for quick approval of nominations. The majority and minority leaders clarified that the standing order will not impact the practice of consulting home-state Senators on certain judicial nominations. The Senate approved S.Res. 16 on January 24, 2013, making changes to the standing rules. This new rule allows for an expedited method to end debate on a bill with the support of a bipartisan group of 16 Senators, including party leaders. A cloture motion on a motion to proceed, signed by the majority and minority leaders and at least seven Senators from each party, will mature in one session day. If successful, the motion to proceed will not be subject to debate. The Senate approved a rules change allowing an expedited method to end debate on a bill with bipartisan support. The motion to proceed will not be subject to debate, unlike the previous requirement of 30 hours of consideration post-cloture. This change streamlines the process for bringing up measures with wide support in the Senate. The Senate approved a rules change allowing an expedited method to end debate on a bill with bipartisan support, reducing the time required for consideration post-cloture. This change streamlines the process for bringing up measures with wide support in the Senate, potentially influencing behind-the-scenes negotiations over the Senate agenda. The Senate approved a rules change allowing an expedited method to end debate on a bill with bipartisan support, reducing the time required for consideration post-cloture. This change streamlines the process for bringing up measures with wide support in the Senate, potentially influencing behind-the-scenes negotiations over the Senate agenda. The new expedited process requires the consent of seven fellow party members and the leader to take up a bill, potentially leading to negotiations within party members. S.Res. 16 allows for a bipartisan three-fifths coalition to quickly authorize a conference committee with the House, streamlining the process for bringing up measures with wide support in the Senate. This rules change reduces the time required for consideration post-cloture and could influence negotiations over the Senate agenda. To establish a conference committee, cloture must be invoked by three-fifths of the Senate, followed by a simple majority vote to authorize the motion. Each chamber must pass a measure of the other with amendments, then take three parliamentary actions to formally establish the committee. This includes adopting a motion to establish disagreement with the other chamber's version of the measure and insisting on their own amendments. The chamber that first passed the bill adopts a motion to disagree to the amendment(s) proposed by the other. Both chambers must agree to send the measure to conference, with the Senate taking the first step by proposing a conference or agreeing to the House request. The final step is appointing conferees, with S.Res. 16 streamlining the process into a single motion. The Senate can create a conference committee by agreeing to a House request or requesting a conference. The presiding officer appoints conferees, and the motion is not subject to division. The motion is in order after the House sends an amendment to the Senate or disagrees to a Senate amendment. Conference is often arranged after the Senate passes a House bill with an amendment. After the Senate passes a House bill with an amendment, a new motion to go to conference can be made. If unanimous consent is not obtained, the Senate can send the bill back to the House. The House can then disagree to the Senate amendment and request a conference. Once the bill and amendment are returned to the Senate, a motion to authorize a conference can be made. If the Senate considers its own bill, it can send it to the House for amendment, and then agree to a conference once the bill is returned. This is the earliest point at which the Senate can authorize a conference. The new rule allows the Senate to agree to a conference by unanimous consent after considering its own bill or by laying aside its own bill to take up a House-passed measure. The consolidated motion cannot include a provision for the \"hookup\" process, which can only be done quickly by unanimous consent. If cloture is filed on the motion to authorize a conference, it will be subject to only two hours of debate. The Senate can now agree to a conference by unanimous consent after considering its own bill or taking up a House-passed measure. If cloture is filed on the motion to authorize a conference, it will be subject to only two hours of debate. If three-fifths of the Senate agrees to invoke cloture, further debate on the motion would be limited. If cloture is not invoked, the motion would remain pending and subject to extended debate. Prior to this rules change, unanimous consent was effectively required to send a measure to conference. The Senate rarely found it practical to pursue the route to conference due to the time-consuming process involved in invoking cloture separately on each parliamentary action and potentially having to obtain cloture to limit debate on each action in sequence. In recent Congresses, the Senate has often avoided sending a measure to conference due to procedural challenges. Instead, they have relied on amendments between the houses to resolve differences on a bill. The informal discussions used to reach a compromise are similar whether through a conference report or amendments between the houses. The Senate has made changes to the rules regarding amendments between the houses to address procedural challenges in sending measures to conference. The new procedures aim to ease the path for conference by removing certain requirements and restrictions, potentially increasing the use of conference committees. The Senate's rules change regarding amendments between houses aims to facilitate the formation of conference committees by eliminating certain requirements. This could lead to more debates on authorizing conferences on the Senate floor, as opposed to the previous practice of unanimous consent. The Senate may see an increase in motions to instruct conferees, especially for legislation with limited debate and amendment opportunities. These motions are not binding but can be used to influence the conference report. This could be necessary if the Senate relies on a motion to authorize a conference committee. If the Senate needs to use a motion to authorize a conference committee, it may lead to conference committees being arranged later than usual. This could impact which chamber acts first on the conference report. Typically, the Senate amends a House bill, insists on its amendment, and requests a conference. The chamber requesting the conference usually acts last on the resulting conference report. The new compound motion would not be allowed immediately after the Senate passes a House bill with an amendment, so the conference would only be authorized after House action. If the House disagrees with a Senate amendment and requests a conference, it would be the House that acts last in the usual congressional practice. The change in the process of authorizing a conference committee could impact negotiations on committee composition and conferee ratio. Previously, unanimous consent was required, giving individual Senators leverage over conference committee composition. With the new process, leverage will still exist for the minority party, assuming they hold at least 41 seats. The new Senate Rule XXVIII creates a faster method to end debate, with a two-hour \"layover\" period for cloture motions and no post-cloture debate. This change reflects recent practices of shortening the cloture process while still requiring a three-fifths vote to end consideration. The Senate Rule XXVIII change allows for a faster cloture process with a two-hour \"layover\" period and no post-cloture debate, preserving the three-fifths vote requirement. This change shifts negotiating leverage from individual Senators to minority coalitions."
