A settlement agreement was reached in May 2007 to address workers' concerns. The Architect of the Capitol and the Office of Compliance have been discussing steps to improve conditions in multiple hearings since 2006. Other committees have also expressed concerns about the tunnels and related allegations. The Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, Subcommittee on Employment and Workplace Safety, addressed tunnel safety concerns during a March 1, 2007 hearing on asbestos effects. Congress allocated funds for Capitol Power Plant repairs in FY2006 and FY2007, but did not support the Architect of the Capitol's request for funds in FY2008.

Efforts are being made to attract different participants by potentially associating with the executive branch. The Center's Board of Trustees is working with the State Department and judiciary to establish a shared funding mechanism. The FY2008 Consolidated Appropriations Act required Open World to prepare a report on options for transferring the Open World Leadership Center to an executive branch department or agency. The Stennis Center received $430,000 in FY2011, and there have been discussions about refunding the Office of Technology Assessment for scientific studies. Some Members support refunding the Office of Technology Assessment (OTA) through \"Dear Colleague\" letters and legislation. Others suggest that technology assessments could be done more cost-effectively by existing legislative branch agencies. The FY2008 Consolidated Appropriations Act allocated $2.5 million to GAO for technology assessments, with funding continuing in FY2009. Representative Rush Holt requested $35 million for OTA in FY2010. Discussions included the possibility of other agencies like CRS and GAO conducting these studies, comparing costs and timeliness with reestablishing OTA.
