    "content": "Japan's August 1999 agreement with the United States for ballistic missile defense cooperation has the potential to enhance the U.S. Navy's ability to defend against intermediate-range ballistic missiles in Asia. While Japan has committed to R&D cooperation on Navy interceptor missiles, it has not decided to acquire a missile defense capability. The extent of Japan's future participation in missile defense will depend on various factors such as threat perceptions, national defense strategy, regional relationships, constitutional constraints, and cost. The report analyzes Japanese perspectives on ballistic missile defense and participation in the U.S. missile defense R&D program, highlighting current trends in Japanese security thinking, major actors in policymaking, and political constraints. It notes areas of convergence and divergence between American and Japanese views, addressing policy considerations for Congress and the Bush Administration regarding Japan's uncertain participation. Since the mid-1990s, Congress has supported the development of a missile defense capability to protect U.S. forces in the Asia-Pacific region, regional allies, and Taiwan from short- and medium-range missiles, requiring Japanese support. Concerns about the inadequacy of current defense systems against ballistic missiles and cruise missiles have been raised, highlighting the growing threat posed by the development of intermediate-range missiles. Intelligence officials emphasized the threat of intermediate-range ballistic missiles with WMD capabilities from anti-U.S. regimes like North Korea and Iraq. Congress responded to China's missile tests towards Taiwan in 1996 by supporting the development of a missile defense system in the Asia-Pacific region. Section 1533 of the FY1999 National Defense Authorization Act mandated a study on establishing a theater ballistic missile defense system to protect key regional allies. The FY1999 National Defense Authorization Act mandated a report on U.S. missile defense systems for key allies in the Asia-Pacific region, including Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan. The Department of Defense delivered the report in May 1999, focusing on defense options against limited ballistic missile attacks. The Department of Defense report in 1999 outlined defense options for South Korea, Japan, and Taiwan against limited ballistic missile attacks. Congress showed support for developing a theater-level missile defense capability in 2001, aiming for more ambitious objectives like the Navy's sea-based TMD system to potentially serve as an early national missile defense capability. Rep. Vitter introduced bills supporting Asian missile defense capability and upgrading Navy interceptors to defend against North Korea and Iran. The Defense Against Regional Threats Act aimed to deploy missile defense systems for various countries and NATO members. The bill aims to seek negotiated burden-sharing agreements with nations to share costs for ballistic missile defense systems. It reflects impatience with the Clinton Administration's avoidance of testing or deploying systems that violate the ABM treaty. The proposed legislation supports the Bush Administration's revamp of the U.S. BMD program to defend against limited attacks by rogue states. The United States military uses Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) systems to defend against missiles from \"rogue\" states. TMD systems defend against short and theater-range missiles, while NMD systems protect against ICBMs. The U.S. Army and Navy are developing anti-missile systems, with the Navy's Sea-Based Midcourse Defense chosen for an \"Asian\" TMD. The Bush Administration aimed to enhance BMD programs to blur the line between TMD and NMD, utilizing technologies applicable to various BMD threats. The former Navy Theater Wide program could potentially serve as a near-term NMD capability, with a sea-based option building upon its technologies. The report discusses the Administration's approach to missile defense, including deploying systems on Navy's Aegis cruisers and sea-based systems in the Sea of Japan to intercept ICBMs. Another concept involves using aircraft with laser systems to destroy missiles in their boost phase. The focus is on U.S.-Japan cooperation on missile defense. The main ballistic missile threat to U.S. forces in the Asia-Pacific region is from short- and medium-range ballistic missiles. The challenges in attacking ICBMs and theater-range missiles are technologically different, with the Standard SM-3 interceptor missile lacking speed and range to intercept an ICBM effectively. The United States may need a more capable interceptor missile to defend against ICBMs, requiring a higher velocity, longer range, and a different kinetic kill vehicle. Critics argue that the interceptor missile's velocity has been kept artificially low to comply with the 1972 ABM Treaty. The United States may need a more capable interceptor missile to defend against ICBMs, requiring a higher velocity and longer range. Some argue that the current technology cooperation between the United States and Japan for BMD systems is unclear. The House and Senate Armed Services Committees reduced the Defense Department's request for boost-phase interceptor testing due to incomplete concept design. The Department of Defense plans to seek Japanese cooperation on a Sea-based boost-phase interceptor for access to sensor technology. The U.S. Navy had been developing two missile defense systems for shipboard deployment until the end of 2001. The Navy's lower tier BMD program, the Navy Area Defense (NAD) system, was cancelled in December 2001 due to poor performance and cost issues. This leaves the Navy without a program for lower tier defense against ballistic missiles and cruise missiles. The Navy's lower tier BMD program, the Navy Area Defense (NAD) system, was cancelled in December 2001 due to poor performance and cost issues, leaving the Navy without a program for lower tier defense against ballistic missiles and cruise missiles. The Sea-Based Midcourse Defense (SMD) program, a Navy missile defense program, remains intact and may be accelerated, but uncertainties exist regarding its future, including technological challenges and questions about organizational control. The Sea-Based Midcourse Defense (SMD) program aims to achieve a capability to intercept short- and medium-range ballistic missiles in mid-course or early terminal phase. It is designed to defend a larger area than the canceled Navy Area Defense (NAD) system and is expected to achieve initial capability for sea-based missile defense by 2006. The program faces uncertainties related to technological challenges and organizational control. The Sea-Based Midcourse Defense (SMD) program aims to intercept ballistic missiles in mid-course using the Lightweight Exo-Atmospheric Projectile (LEAP) kinetic kill vehicle. Intercepting a missile in mid-course requires different technology than in its terminal phase. The SMD system could potentially shield Japan from North Korean missile attacks. The Sea-Based Midcourse Defense (SMD) program aims to shield Japan from North Korean missile attacks. Japan's interest in U.S. missile defense programs dates back to the 1980s, when they shared technology with the U.S. for various weapons systems. The Japanese government reluctantly collaborated with the US on the FS-X next-generation fighter program, despite preferring to develop an indigenous fighter aircraft. This decision was influenced by pressure from the Reagan Administration due to trade sanctions imposed on Japan. Japan faced criticism for failing to meet a trade agreement and for selling sensitive U.S. technology to the Soviet Union. The FS-X co-production deal with the U.S. sparked a debate over technology cooperation, with concerns that Japan could use U.S. technology to compete in aerospace production. The George H. W. Bush administration initiated a policy review in response to these concerns. The FS-X collaboration between Japan and the U.S. faced challenges due to technology transfer issues and political reactions to the trade deficit. This experience led to Japan's aversion to joint development agreements with the U.S. and strengthened the case for national self-sufficiency in defense production. The frustrating FS-X experience could influence Japan's future decisions on acquiring a BMD capability. In 1990, Japan and the U.S. initiated a missile defense system study called WestPac under the SDI initiative. Japan kept a minimal role to avoid sensitive political issues and concerns about U.S. pressure to purchase a missile defense capability. This study was completed in October 1994. After completing the WestPac study in October 1994, the US and Japan started a \"Bilateral Study on BMD\" to address the ballistic missile threat to Japan. Concerns about China's medium-range ballistic missiles and North Korea's expanding capabilities drove Japan's participation. North Korea's missile capability significantly increased with the test firing of the No-Dong 1 missile in May 1994, which had a range of about 1,000 km. The Taepo Dong-1 ballistic missile test in August 1998 raised public concern about North Korea's missile threat, especially after a stage flew over Japan and landed in the Pacific Ocean. Japan's 1999 Defense White Paper dedicated more pages to North Korea's military affairs following these events. In December 1998, Japan decided to cooperate with the US on developing a ballistic missile defense system after North Korea's missile launch. A memorandum of understanding was signed in August 1999 for joint research on missile defense, but Japan has not yet decided on acquiring this capability. Public discussions on military issues in Japan increased due to regional missile proliferation concerns. The Bush Administration's decision in 2001 to merge national missile defense with other BMD programs has caused uncertainty in Japan about participating in joint missile defense technology research. Japan is concerned about the constitutionality of cooperating on technology that could be used to defend U.S. territory. The Japanese constitution allows for collective self-defense under international law but prohibits its exercise. The U.S. changes in missile defense strategy have not affected Tokyo's interest in cooperation. Japan is focused on acquiring BMD capability and supporting the deployment of a BMD system in Asia. The exact nature of Japan's role depends on unpredictable political and national security factors. Japan's role in American missile defense is influenced by political and national security factors. Japan's participation could enhance the effectiveness of a sea-based BMD system, providing a defensive umbrella over Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan. The Sea of Japan is an ideal location for a boost-phase intercept capability against missile launches from North Korea. Japan's potential contribution to the NTW program includes sophisticated communications infrastructure, Aegis-equipped vessels, and technology risk reduction. The Pentagon sees Japan as a valuable collaborator due to its geographic location and technological capabilities. The Pentagon is seeking expanded Japanese cooperation for research and development on boost-phase interceptor technology. Japan's financial contribution to the project is modest but could be significant if it chooses to deploy a BMD capability by purchasing U.S. missiles and components. The project leverages Japan's industrial and engineering strengths, allowing for cost sharing. Japan's financial contribution to the U.S. Cooperative BMD Research Project could be significant if it decides to purchase U.S. hardware. The Japanese Diet has allocated about 6.9 billion yen for design and trial manufacturing activities in fiscal year 2002. The U.S. Department of Defense spending for the project will total $37.6 million in FY2002 and $31.9 million in FY2003. Despite strong support for the program, budget cuts have affected the Japanese Defense Agency's request. Despite strong support for the program among officials concerned with alliance relations, some in the Pentagon's Missile Defense Administration have opposed research and development cooperation with Japan due to small payoff and bureaucratic complications. The Bush Administration and U.S. Navy view Japanese participation in the U.S. missile defense program as an alliance builder and force capability enhancement. Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz directed the organization to continue cooperative efforts despite alleged lack of support in the BMDO. The North Korean missile launch in 1998 led to Japan considering joint cooperation with the U.S. on BMD research and development. The two governments agreed on the Naval Theater Wide (NTW) system concept for joint analysis and experiments, focusing on lightweight nose cone, stage-two rocket engine, advanced kinetic warhead, and two-color infrared sensor. The U.S. Navy and Japan are collaborating on BMD research, focusing on sensors and advanced kinetic warheads. Japan plans to upgrade Aegis destroyers for BMD capability and acquire a sea-based TMD capability. The U.S. has requested expanded cooperation from Japan on BMD research. The United States requested additional cooperation from Japan on BMD research and development related to interceptor ship-borne radar tracking technology. Japanese officials were divided on how to respond due to restrictions on collective self-defense and budget constraints. As of March 2002, no concrete information on expanded BMD research has been made public. The issue of BMD cooperation was discussed in general terms during the Bush-Koizumi summit meeting, with implications for Japan's relations with the United States and China. The development and deployment of a TMD system in Japan have significant national policy implications, with varying views within government and political circles. Support for TMD cooperation increased after North Korea's Taepo Dong launch, with the Japan Defense Agency leading advocacy. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs offers reserved support, concerned about its impact on Japan-China relations. The Ministry of Finance in Japan reluctantly agreed to commit funds for a multi-year defense program, despite concerns about cost estimates and public skepticism. The blurring of national and theater missile defense has made it challenging to sell TMD cooperation to the Japanese public. The Bush Administration's new BMD strategy could impact future Japanese missile defense cooperation, particularly in relation to the ABM Treaty. The Bush Administration's decision to withdraw from the 1972 ABM Treaty troubled Japan, as it was seen as a fundamental pillar of nuclear stability. Japan's post-World War II anti-nuclear policy and legal interpretation of Article 9 of the constitution forbid participation in U.S. nuclear strategy and collective self-defense, respectively. Japan acknowledges its right to self-defense under international law but is limited by its constitution to only defend its territory. The U.S.-Japan Security Treaty is considered constitutional as Japan's responsibilities are focused on its own defense. Japan is not obligated to defend the United States or participate in security cooperation with other countries. Japanese officials are concerned about the new U.S. approach to missile defense. Japanese officials have expressed concern about the new U.S. approach to missile defense, with Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage receiving an ambiguous response during a visit to Japan. Japanese leaders are hesitant to fully support the U.S. initiative due to concerns about being linked to U.S. global nuclear strategy. However, for now, Japan has indicated that the new strategy will not affect joint research and development activities on the NTW interceptor. The Japan Defense Agency's position on U.S. missile defense programs remains unchanged, focusing only on joint research on TMD. Japan offers moral support for the U.S. NMD program but emphasizes it is for U.S. defense, not Japan's. There is a clear difference in technologies between long- and short-range missiles, according to a senior JDA official. The stance of Japan's political parties on missile defense cooperation highlights opposition, especially with Koizumi's LDP relying on coalition allies for support. The LDP, historically the only party supporting a strong military and alliance with the US, now lacks a majority in the upper house of the Diet. The current coalition government includes the New Komeito and the New Conservative Party. The LDP, a splinter group, regained a majority in the Lower House but still lacks one in the Upper House, relying on coalition partners for legislation. The party's stance on missile defense is divided, with a nationalist wing pushing for self-sufficiency. defections and seat losses have made the LDP more conservative, impacting US-Japan alliance relations. The LDP works closely with pro-alliance officials but is constrained by its coalition ally, New Komeito, which opposes expanding the Japanese military's role. The Conservative Party and Liberal Party support missile defense cooperation, with Ichiro Ozawa leading the latter. Ozawa has lost support since splitting the LDP in 1993. The opposition Democratic Party has an ambiguous stance on defense policy, with some parties re-examining their positions post-9/11. Some parties agree on the need to strengthen alliance cooperation and Japan's defense capabilities, but not all support acquiring a BMD capability. The New Komeito sees the deterrent value of BMD-related technology cooperation with the United States. The Minshuto, Japan's leading opposition party, has an ambiguous stance on missile defense policy to avoid internal rifts. The Japan Communist Party and Japan Social Democratic Party are strong opponents of missile defense cooperation, with the Socialists losing support and becoming a marginal political force. The Socialists in Japan have lost support and are now a marginal political force. Japanese defense industry is enthusiastic about joint cooperation on missile defense, seeking valuable technology and new business opportunities. Cooperation with the United States is seen as a rare chance for large-scale contracts, especially for major defense contractors like Mitsubishi Heavy Industries. The Japanese defense industry, including Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, is interested in joint cooperation on missile defense to gain technology and business opportunities. Manufacturers of high technology initially had concerns about cooperation but are now less hesitant due to economic conditions and changing public attitudes. The Japanese media, particularly Yomiuri Shimbun and Sankei Shimbun, have shown increased interest in BMD-related issues since the Taepo Dong launch. The Yomiuri Shimbun, Sankei Shimbun, and Nihon Keizai Shimbun support Japan's military programs, including BMD. Yomiuri urged Japan and the US to cooperate on BMD after North Korea's missile launch. Sankei advocates for Japan's participation in BMD deployment for security. Asahi Shimbun, a major daily newspaper in Japan with a critical view of government actions, warned against Japan's participation in the U.S. BMD program, citing strained relationships with China and Russia. Media support for missile defense softened after President Bush's speech, with even conservative Yomiuri expressing caution due to costs and technological challenges. The Nihon Keizai Shimbun supports missile defense for promoting nuclear disarmament despite objections. Japanese public shows high concern about the growing missile threat, especially from the Korean Peninsula. The Japanese public has high concern about the situation on the Korean Peninsula and arms control regarding weapons of mass destruction and missiles. There is a lack of consensus on cooperating with the U.S. on ballistic missile defense development, with varying levels of support and opposition among respondents. Many Japanese citizens are apprehensive about the deployment of a BMD system and its implications for Japan's Self-Defense Forces. The deployment of a BMD system is a crucial decision for Japanese policymakers, with implications for the U.S.-Japan alliance, security relations with China, and other Asian neighbors. The Japanese government prioritizes alliance considerations in their stance on missile defense cooperation with the United States, aiming to strengthen the alliance. Some U.S. analysts view missile defense cooperation as a significant alliance-builder with Japan. The goal of strengthening the alliance has driven Japan to proceed with the BMD program despite criticisms. Joint development is a way for Japan to respond to demands for burden-sharing. The potential ballistic missile threat from China is a key reason for Japan's interest in BMD. Possessing a BMD capability could impact regional conflict and deter Chinese missile development. Some in Japan are concerned about the program's impact on relations with Taiwan and China. The BMD program may strain relations with Taiwan, Japan, and trigger a regional arms race. China opposes Taiwan's inclusion in U.S.-Japan Defense Cooperation Guidelines and the BMD. Progress in restraining North Korea's missile program could lead to Japanese cooperation on BMD due to the Chinese missile threat. China has downplayed opposition to the U.S. missile defense program post-9/11 for better U.S.-China relations. Japan's efforts to improve relations with China and South Korea have been met with mixed reactions. While tensions with China have eased, concerns remain about Japan's military ambitions and historical legacy. In its relations with South Korea, Japan made progress in 1998 but continued friction persists. During a visit to Tokyo in October 1998, South Korean President Kim Dae Jung received Japan's first written apology for past aggression from Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi. However, tensions between Japan and South Korea have persisted, including disagreements over missile defense. South Korea prefers developing its own missiles to counter North Korea's ballistic missile capability rather than supporting a U.S.-Japan BMD system. Since 1979, South Korea has been limited to deploying missiles with a range of 180 kilometers, but in 2000, the Clinton Administration allowed them to develop missiles with ranges up to 300 kilometers. The U.S. also agreed to research on missiles with up to 500 kilometers range, but South Korea has not acted on this agreement due to President Kim Dae Jung's \"Sunshine\" policy. Japan is concerned about South Korea's offensive ballistic missile capability and the negative impact of deploying a BMD system on its diplomatic relations in Asia, particularly with Southeast Asian nations who fear Japanese remilitarization. The U.S.-Japan alliance is viewed favorably in Southeast Asia as it signifies continued U.S. engagement in regional security and prevents Japan from becoming an independent military power. Some Japanese policymakers are concerned about the provocative nature of joint deployment of a BMD system in Southeast Asia, as it could negate Tokyo's efforts to improve relations with China. The constitutional issue of collective defense arrangements in Japan has been a topic of debate, with most officials and the public leaning towards maintaining the current stance. Prime Minister Koizumi and a minority within his party advocate for a more flexible interpretation of the constitution to allow for collective defense, but the majority of Japanese officials and the public view this as a step too far. Many Japanese are more concerned about the expansion of the roles of the military and see Article 9 as a safeguard against militarism. Japan's response to the U.S. War on Terrorism, particularly in providing logistical support to U.S. forces in the Indian Ocean after 9/11, could indicate the impact of the constitutional issue on future Japanese BMD cooperation. The Japanese government faced opposition from within the LDP, New Komeito, and the Democratic Party over sending an Aegis destroyer to the Indian Ocean in 2001 due to constitutional concerns. Critics argued that Japan would be implicated in any military actions by U.S. Aegis ships. The opposition, including conservative leaders, could hinder potential BMD cooperation scenarios. Some analysts suggest that an Aegis destroyer may be sent with the relief force when the current naval contingent is rotated home. Koizumi's retreat on the issue of BMD cooperation may reflect what is politically possible for the foreseeable future. Opposition in Japan against participation in the U.S. BMD program is based on a 1969 parliamentary resolution on the peaceful use of space, but the issue seems to be resolved in favor of BMD. The Japanese government resolved the issue in favor of BMD, stating that their involvement in the NTW program aligns with the peaceful use of outer space. Public opinion has supported the deployment of a national reconnaissance system since North Korea's missile launch in 1998. Critics argue that participation in the U.S. BMD program violates Japan's ban on arms exports, but the government claims that any military technology transfer would comply with existing laws. Some LDP members with defense industry ties are pushing for a change in Japan's ban on arms exports to allow Japanese contractors to participate in the production of BMD components for export to the United States. Japan faces financial challenges in acquiring a BMD capability due to its struggling economy and high public fiscal debt. Military budgets in Japan have been leveling off since around 1998, with competition for funds between BMD procurement and other systems like fighter aircraft and destroyers. Japan faces financial challenges in acquiring a BMD capability due to its struggling economy and high public fiscal debt. The costs of Japan's participation in research and development related to BMD systems are relatively small, but acquiring a robust ballistic missile defense could cost as much as $50 billion over several years. The Japanese government has limited defense spending increases, with analysts estimating the need for significant investment in new arms acquisitions. The Japanese government's budget for military hardware procurement is limited, with the entire budget being less than $40 billion. The decision to acquire a BMD capability would have significant costs and implications, especially considering other spending priorities and budget constraints. The current Five-Year Defense Outline has funding for planned procurement programs only, making it difficult for the JDA to choose between BMD and other weapons system modernization programs. Japan faces budgetary constraints and other spending priorities, making it challenging to acquire a BMD capability without exceeding the informal 1% of GDP limitation on defense spending. This decision could lead to criticism from both neighbors and the Japanese public. However, not deploying a BMD system could have consequences for U.S.-Japan security relations, as it could help protect U.S. troops in Japan and Japanese lives and assets. Many in the U.S. view Japan's participation in BMD as necessary for alliance burden-sharing. Japan's burden-sharing in supporting U.S. forces is around $4 to $5 billion annually, with host-nation support declining. A $30 million reduction in Japan's annual support was agreed upon in 2000, highlighting the challenges in financing a BMD capability. U.S. efforts to minimize the reduction show limits to American sympathy for Japan's political situation. The U.S. BMD program progress raises uncertainties for Japan's future participation, impacting U.S.-Japan alliance cooperation. Japanese decisions on acquiring BMD capability could affect the effectiveness of U.S. BMD capability in Asia. Burden-sharing issues arise due to Japan's commitment to technology research for Sea-Based Midcourse Defense. The U.S. Department of Defense anticipates a significant Japanese technological contribution for Sea-Based Midcourse Defense. Japan's cooperation in joint technology research would benefit them if a BMD capability is deployed with the U.S. 7th fleet. Signs indicate Japan's interest in acquiring a BMD capability, shown through their commitment to cooperative R&D and inclusion of new Aegis destroyers in their defense plan. The current five-year defense plan includes the possibility of Japan acquiring a BMD capability, which could impact defense burden-sharing. The utility of a jointly deployed U.S.-Japan BMD capability in regional conflicts is being considered, with restrictions on joint military operations being gradually lifted. The Japanese Navy's rules restrict combat support for missions not related to defending Japanese territory. If a conflict arises on the Korean Peninsula or between China and Taiwan, the US may pressure Japan to deploy missile defense capabilities outside its borders. It is uncertain if Japanese Aegis ships sharing real-time data for missile defense would be allowed under current rules. An integrated binational BMD capability could be useful in situations threatening Japanese territory, but may not be as beneficial for U.S. forces in scenarios outside Japanese territorial waters. U.S. forces may need to operate independently in such cases. The limitations raise questions about the effectiveness of joint missile defense operations. Japanese Prime Minister Koizumi has suggested that Japan may need to reconsider its stance on collective security in the event of an attack on U.S. military forces in the region. Despite initial plans for constitutional revision, Koizumi has prioritized other issues due to public opposition to changing Article 9. This caution may impact Japan's involvement in regional deployment of a BMD system and its implications for U.S. security. Japan's potential involvement in a regional BMD system could impact U.S. operational flexibility in Asia. Concerns arise from historical mistrust of Japan's intentions among its neighbors, with China viewing a U.S.-Japan BMD capability as a threat to its interests. The possibility of Japan joining a collective security arrangement targeting China raises doubts about the effectiveness of Article 9 in inhibiting Japan's participation in such alliances. The potential integration of Japan into a regional BMD system could raise concerns among its neighbors, particularly China, about the remilitarization of Japan. Issues such as command, control, communication, and intelligence could be critical in an integrated U.S.-Japanese BMD capability. Japan's neighbors may prefer a Japanese capability linked to the United States, while China opposes both deployment options. The United States may depend on the Japanese Cabinet for decision-making in crisis management situations. Questions arise about allowing a U.S. commander to control joint systems. Integration of U.S. and Japanese missiles into a joint system could pose dilemmas. Suggestions have been made for a joint command and control system to allow independent action if needed. Japanese officials and defense analysts acknowledge the inadequacy of their crisis management and C\u00b3 capabilities. Prime Minister Koizumi aims to secure emergency powers for crisis decision-making, but legislation approval is uncertain. The US and Japan share concerns about ballistic missile proliferation in Asia and have a mutual interest in theater missile defense. Japan's potential contributions to cooperative research on the Sea-Based Midcourse System are significant. Japan is considering acquiring and deploying a BMD capability while keeping its options open. Japan's possession of a BMD capability would enhance U.S. missile defense in Asia, relying on bases like Yokosuka. Japanese officials are considering acquiring a BMD capability, but many issues need resolution for a potential U.S.-Japan interoperable system. Japanese defense officials are leaning towards a national BMD capability that would be interoperable with the United States. However, it is uncertain if Japan will agree to an integrated command and control arrangement due to public opposition to constitutional changes for collective self-defense. Senior Bush Administration officials are urging Japan to address constitutional constraints, but any decision to opt for joint deployment of a BMD capability would still be based on Japan's national interest perceptions. The potential decision by Japan to opt for joint deployment of a BMD capability raises foreign policy issues and operational challenges for U.S. forces. Concerns include U.S. relations with China and Taiwan, negotiations to eliminate the North Korean missile threat, and fears of China threatening Japan with ballistic missiles. Missile defense is seen as a means to counter China's military power. The impact of future political change on Japanese decision-making regarding BMD cooperation is uncertain. Political changes since 1993 have not significantly affected Japan's defense posture or U.S.-Japan security cooperation. The two potential alternatives to the current political status quo, the Democratic Party of Japan and the nationalistic wing of the LDP, are not enthusiastic about missile defense cooperation with the United States. The future political impact on Japan's decision-making regarding missile defense cooperation with the United States is uncertain. Public opposition to U.S. bases in Japan, particularly in Okinawa, is focused on environmental and quality of life concerns, mainly involving the U.S. Marines stationed there. Some groups supporting defense buildup and closer alliance relations are hesitant about hosting a major U.S. military presence more than five decades after the end of the U.S. post-World War II occupation. Okinawans have successfully pushed for a fifteen-year limit on U.S. base use through the Japanese government. The Japanese government wants to limit the U.S. Marines' use of a replacement for the Futenma Marine Air Station to fifteen years. Japan's involvement in joint development of the U.S. missile defense program shows progress in alliance burden sharing. Japan's decision on acquiring a BMD capability may not have a critical impact on U.S. missile defense capabilities in Asia. Japan's participation in the research and development phase of an American sea-based capability in Asia is seen as potentially contributing important technology. A decision by Tokyo to acquire a BMD capability could have significant foreign policy implications for the United States. Congress may need to carefully consider the assumptions and terms of further BMD cooperation with Japan, including obtaining more information on threat perceptions, attitudes towards China, and Japan's fiscal situation and defense budget. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Japan is focused on policies towards China, Japan's fiscal and defense budget trends, public attitudes towards U.S.-Japan security cooperation and bases in Japan, and the potential for constitutional revision and emergency powers for Japanese authorities."
