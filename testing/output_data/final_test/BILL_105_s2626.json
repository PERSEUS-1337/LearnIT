    "content": "The Act titled \"Health Care for America's Children Act of 1998\" is cited as the short title. Congress finds that over 10 million children in the US lack health insurance, with nearly half eligible for Medicaid but not enrolled. Uninsured children are 4 times more likely to go without needed medical care, miss immunizations, lack a family doctor, and receive timely preventive care or treatment for serious illnesses. Uninsured children also end up needing emergency room care at twice the cost of office-based care. The Agency for Health Care Policy and Research (AHCPR) emphasizes the importance of outreach activities to increase enrollment of Medicaid-eligible children. Effective strategies include simplified applications, continuous eligibility, and placing eligibility workers in schools and day care centers. The Medicaid Children's Enrollment Performance Bonus is outlined in Section 3. The Social Security Act is amended to include a children's enrollment performance bonus for states that effectively reach and enroll eligible children in medical assistance programs. States must demonstrate implementation of outreach strategies to qualify for the bonus. The State uses streamlined procedures to determine eligibility for medical assistance for children in families with incomes below a specified level.

Compliance with outstationing and alternative application requirements is also required. The State must simplify verification of eligibility requirements and report annually on the number of children enrolled in medical assistance programs as a result of outreach efforts. The State must simplify verification of eligibility requirements and report annually on the number of children enrolled in medical assistance programs as a result of outreach efforts.

Amounts provided to the State under any other provisions of this title shall not be reduced solely as a result of the State's eligibility for a performance bonus under this subsection."
