Legal permanent residents (LPRs) entering after August 22, 1996, are barred from Medicaid for five years. States can use state funds to provide coverage for LPRs within five years of arrival. Refugees and asylees are eligible for Medicaid for seven years. LPRs with a substantial work history or military connection are eligible. LPRs receiving Supplemental Security Income (SSI) are eligible for Medicaid. Noncitizens' eligibility for federal Medicaid benefits is based on their immigration status and arrival date. Legal permanent residents (LPRs) entering after August 22, 1996, are barred from Medicaid for five years. States can use state funds to provide coverage for LPRs within five years of arrival. Refugees and asylees are eligible for Medicaid for seven years. LPRs with a substantial work history or military connection are eligible. LPRs receiving Supplemental Security Income (SSI) are eligible for Medicaid. Medicaid coverage is required for all SSI recipients. LPRs sponsored for admission after 1997 have their sponsor's income and resources \"deemed\" available to them for eligibility. All aliens who meet Medicaid requirements are eligible for emergency Medicaid. Unauthorized aliens are generally ineligible for Medicaid, except for emergency Medicaid for emergency conditions. The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 allows unauthorized aliens to receive medical assistance for emergency conditions under Title XIX of the Social Security Act. This provision defines \"emergency medical condition\" as a medical condition with acute symptoms of sufficient severity. Unauthorized aliens seeking emergency Medicaid must demonstrate state residency, which many are unable to do. Eligibility requires being poor, aged, disabled, or part of a family with children. Working-age single males are generally ineligible for Medicaid. The reimbursement provision in P.L. 108-173 mirrors a similar provision in the Social Security Act. The reimbursement provision in P.L. 108-173 is similar to a provision in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, allocating funds for state emergency health services for unauthorized aliens based on estimates provided by the INS. The funds were divided among the 12 states with the highest number of unauthorized aliens. Eligible states could use the funds for emergency medical services for unauthorized aliens who would otherwise qualify for Medicaid. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 allocated funds for emergency health services for unauthorized aliens based on INS estimates. California received 45% of the funding due to its high unauthorized alien population. The total cost incurred by states for unauthorized aliens is a contentious issue, with many arguing that immigration is a federal matter. Some argue that immigration, particularly border control, is a federal responsibility, and the federal government should bear the cost of related expenses. However, provisions in PRWORA aimed to limit immigrant access to public benefits to promote self-sufficiency and deter migration. CMS gathered data on emergency medical costs for unauthorized aliens in 12 states. Total expenditures are shown in Table 2. Table 2 displays the total emergency health service costs for unauthorized aliens, which includes emergency Medicaid and expenses on emergency services for individuals not meeting Medicaid eligibility. The data, reported by states, vary due to different accounting procedures. Despite discrepancies, the data approximates the cost of emergency services for unauthorized aliens, with federal government covering over half the expenses. The federal government reimburses over half of the emergency costs for unauthorized aliens in states like California and Maryland. A study by the Government Accountability Office found that the impact of unauthorized aliens on hospitals' uncompensated care costs is difficult to assess due to lack of information on patients' immigration status. The Government Accountability Office study found that hospitals struggle to determine the cost of uncompensated care for unauthorized aliens. Most hospitals rely on the lack of a Social Security number to identify unauthorized aliens, but it's unclear if this method accurately estimates the care provided. Several states with high unauthorized populations reported that a significant portion of their emergency Medicaid expenditures were for services for unauthorized aliens. The study by the Government Accountability Office revealed that emergency Medicaid expenditures for labor and delivery services accounted for more than half of the costs in some states. Despite an overall increase in emergency Medicaid spending in 10 states, it still remains a small fraction of total Medicaid expenditures. Additionally, the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 has not been implemented, which would provide reimbursement for emergency medical assistance to unauthorized aliens. The Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 imposes restrictions on funding availability for reimbursement of emergency medical assistance to unauthorized aliens. Lack of appropriation is a major obstacle to implementation, along with challenges in verifying immigration status and determining other federal funding sources. The Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 restricts funding for emergency medical assistance to unauthorized aliens. There are challenges in verifying immigration status and determining federal funding sources, including Medicaid DSH payments. A pilot project for reimbursement of emergency ambulance services in Nogales, Arizona was not recommended for expansion due to resource redirection by the Border Patrol. The report suggests that Congress should develop a coordinated policy involving the Department of Health and Human Services, State and local health services, and other authorities for reimbursement of ambulance costs. Medicaid funding does not cover reimbursement for unauthorized aliens, but states must make adjustments to payment rates for hospitals treating low-income and Medicaid patients, including unauthorized aliens. States define qualifying hospitals and payment formulas in their Medicaid plans. The report suggests that Congress should develop a coordinated policy for reimbursement of ambulance costs involving various authorities. Several bills in the 107th Congress aimed to provide additional funding to states for emergency health services for unauthorized aliens, similar to legislation in the 108th Congress. S. 169 introduced by Senator Kyl would have authorized $2 billion annually for states with the highest number of unauthorized aliens. Senator Bingaman introduced S. 2449 in 2002, proposing $50 million annually for 15 states with the most unauthorized aliens. The bill aimed to allow states to use funds for health benefits regardless of immigration status. Senator Kyl's amendment for additional funding for emergency medical costs was defeated. The Medicare Prescription Drug Act of 2003 provides reimbursement to states for emergency care for unauthorized aliens. The Medicare Prescription Drug Act of 2003 allocates $250 million for emergency care for unauthorized aliens, with $167 million based on the percentage of unauthorized aliens in each state and $83 million for states with the highest percentage of apprehensions. The Secretary of HHS is directed to reimburse local providers for emergency health care services. The Medicare Prescription Drug Act of 2003 allocates $250 million for emergency care for unauthorized aliens. The Secretary of HHS is required to establish a process for entities to apply for reimbursement for emergency health care services provided to unauthorized aliens. Advanced payments will be made quarterly based on projected expenditures. Only Medicare participating hospitals can apply for funds under this provision. The CMS policy paper proposes a grant program to cover ambulance transportation for aliens with emergency medical conditions. Providers must seek funds from all available sources before requesting payment. CMS suggests a single-payment pool for each state for quarterly or annual payments to providers. Hospitals must collect immigration information for payment under Section 1011, but individual level information would be kept at the hospital and not routinely transmitted to CMS. The CMS policy paper proposes a grant program for ambulance transportation for aliens with emergency medical conditions. Hospitals must collect immigration information for payment under Section 1011, but individual level information would be kept at the hospital and not routinely transmitted to CMS. Some are concerned that DHS could use hospital records to locate unauthorized aliens, making them less likely to seek medical treatment. CMS has revised the policy and will not require providers to ask about a patient's immigration status for reimbursement. The former INS was instructed to provide a one-time payment to hospitals in Arizona for treating unauthorized immigrants. This funding was deemed necessary due to the burden on hospitals from treating immigrants injured during interactions with the Border Patrol. Additionally, a report with recommendations to address the issue of unreimbursed costs was requested by the Committees on Appropriations. The Services Reimbursement Act of 2003 (S. 412) and its companion bill (H.R. 819) would appropriate $1.450 billion annually from FY2004 to FY2008 to reimburse states for emergency care to unauthorized aliens. The funds would be distributed based on the percentage of unauthorized aliens in each state and the states with the highest percentage of apprehensions. H.R. 690 and H.R. 1515 introduced by Representative Gutierrez and Flake respectively aim to extend medicaid coverage for organ transplants to aliens under 18 and provide reimbursement for emergency medical care to aliens paroled into the United States for medical reasons. H.R. 3722, introduced by Representative Rohrabacher, aimed to place conditions on reimbursement to health care providers for emergency services for unauthorized aliens, requiring providers to obtain information on the alien's citizenship, immigration status, address, financial data, and biometric identifier. The bill was brought to the floor on May 17, 2004, but the motion to pass it was defeated 331 to 88 on May 18, 2004. H.R. 3722 aimed to impose conditions on reimbursement for emergency services for unauthorized aliens, requiring providers to collect citizenship, immigration status, address, financial data, and biometric identifier. The bill also proposed making non-paying aliens removable and holding employers liable for reimbursement. Additionally, it called for a study on negotiating treaties for international medical evacuation funding through visa surcharges. H.R. 3722 proposed conditions for reimbursement of emergency services for unauthorized aliens, including collecting personal information and holding employers liable. H.R. 4360 aimed to make a grant program for emergency care permanent and allocate $250 million from foreign aid funds for reimbursement. The amendment introduced by Representative Thomas Tancredo aimed to prohibit CMS from using funds to pay salaries for personnel administering a grant program providing reimbursement for emergency care to unauthorized aliens. The amendment failed, raising policy issues on federal funding for states with large unauthorized alien populations. Some argue that immigration is a federal issue, with the federal government responsible for establishing policy and policing borders. They believe federal funds should cover immigration-related costs, not states. Concerns also exist about lack of data on unauthorized aliens and funding disparities for emergency medical costs. The 2000 census data suggests a significant increase in illegal migration in the late 1990s, leading to discrepancies in estimates of unauthorized residents in the United States. Estimates range from 7 million to 11 million unauthorized aliens, highlighting the challenges in accurately assessing the unauthorized population for grant distribution. The distribution of grant funds based on state's unauthorized population may be inaccurate. Anecdotal reports suggest unauthorized aliens are dispersed among many states, not concentrated in a few. Limiting states eligible for reimbursement for medical treatment may exclude smaller states with high proportions of unauthorized aliens."
