Congress recognizes the exceptional natural characteristics and wildlife habitats of these lands. An option agreement is to be made with Big Sky Lumber Company and Louisiana Pacific Corporation for land exchange in the Gallatin area. The Secretary of Agriculture shall acquire lands from the Big Sky Lumber Company in the Gallatin National Forest for exchange, as depicted on maps dated February 1993. The Secretary of Agriculture will acquire lands from the Big Sky Lumber Company in the Gallatin National Forest for exchange. In return, the Secretary of the Interior will convey approximately 16,278 acres of National Forest System lands through a warranty deed. This exchange is subject to certain reservations and conditions as outlined in the Act of 1890. The Secretary of Agriculture will acquire lands from the Big Sky Lumber Company in the Gallatin National Forest for exchange, subject to reservations and conditions.

The Secretary of Agriculture will acquire lands from the Big Sky Lumber Company in the Gallatin National Forest for exchange, subject to reservations and conditions. Reciprocal easements shall be conveyed at the time of the exchange, with the Secretary and the Company executing and delivering easements over federally owned lands. The Big Sky Lumber Company will provide easements or rights-of-way across their lands as agreed with the United States in exchange for lands in the Gallatin National Forest. In the North Bridger Range, grazing leases will be allowed to continue under acceptable terms, and timber harvest practices will be regulated. The timber harvest practices on the lands must adhere to Montana Forestry Best Management Practices and state laws. The Secretary will consider acquiring the lands through exchange and report to the relevant committees. The timing of the transaction involves reviewing title for non-Federal lands and conducting appraisals. The Secretary will review appraisals and titles for non-Federal lands within sixty days to determine compliance with applicable standards for acquisition. This includes verifying title standards, approving conveyances, and ensuring surface and subsurface estates are included without reservation. The Secretary will review appraisals and titles for non-Federal lands within sixty days to determine compliance with acquisition standards. This includes verifying title standards, approving conveyances, and ensuring surface and subsurface estates are included without reservation. If the appraisal or title quality does not meet Federal standards, corrective actions will be advised for an affirmative determination. The conveyance of lands must be completed within sixty days after a positive determination by the Secretary. Compliance with the option is required, regardless of section (3)(e)(2). The Secretary must ensure that title to certain lands is escrowed as per the Option Agreement before conveying them. References to the Company include successors and assigns. SEC. 4. LAND CONSOLIDATION--PORCUPINE AREA. The Secretary is authorized to acquire lands listed in the Option for fair market value. Reports on the acquisition must be submitted annually to Congress. SEC. 5.

The Secretary is authorized to acquire lands and interests in lands listed in the Option, in accordance with the terms of the Option. Annual reports on the acquisition must be submitted to Congress. SEC. 7. SEVERED MINERAL EXCHANGE. Congress finds that certain areas in Montana have mineral rights owned by Burlington Resources, Incorporated. Burlington has agreed to exchange mineral rights with the Secretary to consolidate ownerships and avoid conflicts. The exchange of lands should be completed within two years of this Act's enactment. The Secretary may acquire mineral interests owned by Burlington or its affiliate underlying surface lands owned by the United States in specified areas. In exchange, the Secretary shall convey federally owned mineral interests of equal value to Burlington. The value of the exchanged mineral interests should be approximately equal based on available information. To ensure the wilderness values are preserved during mineral interest exchanges, a formal appraisal based on drilling is not required. The Secretary and Burlington must share all available information on mineral interests. If information is lacking, exchanges can be based on similar development potential and geologic characteristics. Federally owned mineral interests can be identified for exchange. The Secretary and Burlington must consult with the Department of the Interior for the exchange of mineral interests, especially if federally owned mineral interests are insufficient. If needed, other federally owned mineral interests in Montana can be exchanged for lands in private ownership. The Secretary of the Interior will convey federally owned mineral interests outside National Forest System boundaries as per a final exchange agreement with Burlington. Mineral interests include locatable and leasable minerals, oil and gas, geothermal resources, and other subsurface rights. SEC. 8. GENERAL PROVISIONS. The maps mentioned in sections 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 can be corrected by the Secretary and the Company. Any corrections made must be reported to the Senate and House Committees. The maps will be available for public inspection at the Forest Service office. Lands conveyed to the United States will include surface estate and subsurface rights owned by the Company or Burlington, with exceptions at the Secretary's discretion. The Secretary may accept title subject to outstanding oil and gas rights, with no surface occupancy permitted for access or exploration. Lands acquired under this Act cannot be used for accessing non-Federal property interests. All lands conveyed will be added to Gallatin National Forest and administered accordingly. Lands acquired within the Hyalite-Porcupine-Buffalo Horn Wilderness Study Area shall be managed to maintain their wilderness character and potential for inclusion in the National Wilderness Preservation System according to the Montana Wilderness Study Act of 1977. Authorization of appropriations is granted to carry out the Act."
