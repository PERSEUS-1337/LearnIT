    "content": "The United Nations Security Council is one of the six principal organs of the United Nations, consisting of 15 nations with five permanent members and 10 non-permanent members. The permanent members have veto rights over resolutions, and non-permanent members are elected for two-year terms. The Council has primary responsibility for international peace and security under the U.N. Charter. The U.N. Security Council, established in 1945, has the authority to respond to threats to peace, breaches of peace, and acts of aggression. It has authorized the use of force on several occasions, using terms like \"force\" or \"all means necessary\" in resolutions. The Council's actions are guided by Chapter VII of the U.N. Charter. The U.N. Security Council has authorized the use of force on four occasions before 1990, including during the Korean War and in the Congo. The U.N. Security Council authorized the prevention of oil shipments to Rhodesia by force if necessary. The Council did not cite the Charter in these resolutions, but cited Chapter VII in all resolutions since 1990. It gave authority to U.N.-commanded peacekeeping operations and non-U.N. coalition operations to use force. The U.N. Security Council authorized the use of force in various operations, including the Persian Gulf coalition, Unified Task Force in Somalia, Operation Turquoise in Rwanda, Multinational Force in Haiti, and NATO operations in Bosnia. The Council adopted 12 resolutions between August and December 1990 in response to the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. After condemning the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and demanding Iraq's withdrawal, the U.N. Security Council imposed economic sanctions in Resolution 661 (1990) and authorized maritime forces to ensure strict implementation in Resolution 665 (1990). Resolution 678 (1990) authorized states to use all necessary means to implement previous resolutions. In 1991, the Council adopted Resolution 687 (1991) which established a range of post-war obligations on Iraq. Resolution 687 (1991) established a range of post-war obligations on Iraq, including boundary demarcation, U.N. Iraq-Kuwait Observer Mission, weapons of mass destruction, return of Kuwaiti property, compensation, sanctions, and repatriation of nationals. The resolution also imposed obligations on Iraq's internal affairs, such as accepting inspectors for weapons inspections and international assistance for its population. The UN provided assistance for housing, protection, and feeding of population segments fleeing human rights violations by the Iraqi government. Despite economic sanctions, Iraq could export limited petroleum under tight UN control. The UN adopted 39 resolutions on Iraq from 1992 to 2002, addressing issues like boundary demarcation and observation missions. The UN Security Council addressed various issues related to Iraq from 1992 to 2002, including boundary demarcation, UN observation missions, reparations payments, inspections, and the oil for food program. Key resolutions included setting up the oil for food program (Resolution 986), creating UNMOVIC (Resolution 1284), and addressing import/export monitoring for weapons of mass destruction (Resolution 1051). The UN Security Council adopted Resolution 1441 in 2002, giving Iraq a final opportunity to comply with disarmament obligations and setting up an enhanced inspection regime. Iraq was required to provide a full declaration of its weapons programs by December 8. The UN Security Council adopted Resolution 1441 in 2002, requiring Iraq to provide a full declaration of its weapons programs by December 8. The resolution stated that false statements or omissions, as well as failure to comply with disarmament obligations, would be reported to the Council for assessment. Iraq was mandated to provide immediate, unimpeded access for inspections and interviews by UNMOVIC and IAEA, with any interference or non-compliance to be reported immediately to the Council. President Bush addressed the U.N. General Assembly on September 12, 2002, focusing on Iraq's failure to comply with U.N. Security Council resolutions. He urged the Council to take action against Iraq's repeated violations, emphasizing the need for enforcement of resolutions to ensure peace and security. The Council is addressing the \"Situation between Iraq and Kuwait\" and considering various topics including the UNIKOM mission, Resolution 661 Sanctions Committee, Oil for Food program, and UNMOVIC reports. Council members faced issues in drafting Resolution 1441 in response to President Bush's request, including the inspection regime to apply. The pre-Resolution 1441 resolutions included approval of access to presidential palaces in Iraq and the establishment of UNMOVIC in 1999. The Council is discussing access to presidential palaces in Iraq and the establishment of UNMOVIC in 1999. There are debates on setting a deadline for Iraqi compliance and authorizing actions in case of non-compliance. Some countries prefer not passing an additional resolution for inspection access. The United States seeks authorization for consequences in a single resolution on inspections and Iraqi compliance. During the first quarter of the year, the U.N. Security Council reviewed the work of UNMOVIC and IAEA, considering next steps. Efforts were made by the U.S. and U.K. to adopt a second resolution on Iraq's non-compliance. On March 17, 2003, U.N. Secretary-General authorized the withdrawal of all remaining personnel from Iraq. The withdrawal of all remaining United Nations personnel from Iraq was announced, suspending mandates of various UN programs due to inoperability. A coalition led by the United States initiated hostilities in Iraq on March 19, 2003, citing Iraq's breaches of disarmament obligations. On March 26 and 27, 2003, the Security Council met to discuss the situation in Iraq, authorized under existing Council resolutions 678 (1990) and 687 (1991). Sixty-eight U.N. member states participated in the debate, but no resolution was reached."
