    "content": "From the mid-1970s to the mid-1990s, economic and trade relations between the United States and Vietnam were frozen due to the legacy of the Vietnam War. President Ford extended the trade embargo to cover the reunified nation in 1975. Relations began to improve during the Clinton Administration, with efforts to recover the remains of missing U.S. military personnel and Vietnam's withdrawal from Cambodia prompting a shift in U.S. policy. President Bill Clinton ended the U.S. trade embargo on Vietnam in 1994, leading to the restoration of diplomatic relations in 1995. Bilateral relations improved due to Vietnam's shift to market socialism in 1986, resulting in nearly 30 years of rapid economic growth. The U.S. and Vietnam signed a bilateral trade agreement in 2000, boosting foreign investment in Vietnam's manufacturing sector. The United States and Vietnam signed a bilateral trade agreement in 2000, leading to improved economic and trade relations. Vietnam was granted permanent normal trade relations status in 2006 as part of its accession to the World Trade Organization. Both countries have established a Trade and Investment Agreement Council to discuss trade and investment policies. Official trade data between the U.S. and Vietnam show a similar pattern of growth in bilateral trade. Following the end of the U.S. embargo in 1994, trade between the United States and Vietnam grew slowly due to Vietnam's lack of NTR. However, after receiving conditional NTR in 2001, trade flows increased rapidly. Bilateral trade doubled between 2001 and 2002, and rose again in 2007 when the U.S. granted PNTR status to Vietnam. Both countries are part of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), with Vietnam expressing a desire for closer trade relations. Vietnam has shown interest in closer trade relations with the United States through initiatives like applying for the U.S. Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) program and negotiating a bilateral investment treaty (BIT). However, these efforts have taken a backseat due to the TPP agreement. The United States has also expressed interest in closer economic relations, including potentially lifting restrictions on arms sales to Vietnam. Trade friction has arisen from the rapid growth in Vietnam's clothing and catfish exports to the United States. In 2009, Vietnam's catfish exports (basa, swai, and tra) caused tensions with the United States. Economic issues like the U.S. designating Vietnam as a \"non-market economy\" and concerns about intellectual property rights also affected bilateral relations. The U.S. expressed interest in joining the Trans-Pacific Partnership, leading to negotiations with countries like Australia, Malaysia, Peru, and Vietnam. Japan later joined the discussions in 2012. Vietnam's membership in the TPP, signed in 2016, could complicate congressional support due to its mixed economy. Supporters believe it would open a market for U.S. exports, while opponents cite human rights concerns and unfair government support for industries. Vietnam is the fifth-largest U.S. trading partner. Vietnam, the fifth-largest U.S. trading partner, initially pushed for various provisions in the TPP agreement, including market economy designation, trade liberalization in services, relaxation of clothing trade rules, prohibition of discrimination against state-owned enterprises, and special consideration for developing economies. The U.S. urged Vietnam to implement economic and regulatory reforms to meet TPP obligations. The United States expressed concerns about Vietnam meeting TPP standards for SPS measures, workers' rights, IPR enforcement, and SOEs. Vietnam's negotiations with 15 other nations for the RCEP, a regional trade agreement excluding the U.S., added complexity. Uncertainty remains on how RCEP could impact Vietnam's commitment to TPP. Vietnam's government praised the TPP for its potential trade and investment benefits. The TPP agreement is seen as beneficial for Vietnam, with duty-free market access for clothing, footwear, and textiles to the US, attracting foreign investors. Concerns about effects on agriculture, pharmaceutical prices, and labor laws were downplayed. The agreement also includes provisions for gradual tariff elimination and safeguard measures for important goods. The TPP agreement benefits Vietnam with duty-free access for clothing, footwear, and textiles to the US. The textile provisions use the \"yarn forward\" approach and a \"short supply list\" for Vietnamese exports. A trade and labor relations plan commits Vietnam to ILO standards and allows grassroots labor unions. Government procurement is opened to foreign suppliers with restrictions on certain goods and services. The TPP agreement allows Vietnam duty-free access for clothing, footwear, and textiles to the US, with provisions for government procurement to foreign suppliers. The agreement also includes commitments to protect and enforce intellectual property rights, eliminate tariffs over a phased period of up to 20 years, and establish tariff rate quotas. The United States and Vietnam exchanged letters regarding U.S. inspection requirements for catfish-like fish, acknowledging the importance of these fish to Vietnamese farmers. Vietnam asserted that U.S. laws on catfish protectionism. The United States and Vietnam exchanged letters regarding U.S. inspection requirements for catfish-like fish, emphasizing the importance of pangasius, tra, and basa to Vietnamese farmers. The two countries commit to consulting on final U.S. regulations for Siluriformes inspection. The U.S. promises to consider a transitional period for rule implementation and provide technical assistance for compliance. Conflicting objectives were seen in TPP negotiations, with the U.S. supporting a \"yarn-forward\" rule of origin and Vietnam advocating for a \"cut and sew\" rule. The TPP agreement includes a \"yarn-forward\" rule of origin for textiles and apparel, with a list of materials in \"short supply\" that can be sourced outside TPP nations. This list of 187 items may benefit Vietnamese apparel, but challenges remain as Vietnam currently sources fabrics from non-TPP nations like China. Vietnam's textile industry sources fabrics from China, lacking capacity. Investors from China, South Korea, and Taiwan are building factories in Vietnam to comply with TPP rules. Some Japanese and U.S. companies are also setting up manufacturing facilities in Vietnam. Criticisms exist regarding Vietnam's restrictions on workers' rights despite improvements in labor laws. The State Department's 2014 human rights report on Vietnam highlighted issues with labor rights, including suppression of independent unions, forced labor, child labor, and poor working conditions. Vietnamese workers can legally engage in collective bargaining but must be part of the Vietnam General Confederation of Labor (VGCL). Efforts to form independent unions have been met with government suppression, leading to arrests of union leaders. Industry-wide or trade unions representing workers from different enterprises are also prohibited in Vietnam. Since the launch of doi moi in Vietnam, there has been progress on worker rights despite restrictions on their right to form independent unions. Unofficial \"labor associations\" have emerged, the VGCL has become more supportive of workers, and Vietnamese workers have gone on strikes feeling unrepresented by the official union. Concerns have been raised about the ability of Vietnamese workers to call official strikes, especially at state-owned enterprises. According to the State Department's human rights report for Vietnam, strikes in 2015 did not follow legal processes. However, there were some improvements for Vietnamese workers in 2014 and 2015, such as the formation of the Committee of Labor Relations by the VGCL. The chairman of VGCL is advocating for a higher minimum wage, and a strike in Ho Chi Minh City in 2015 led to changes in a social insurance law. Between 2005 and 2008, the number of illegal factory worker strikes in Vietnam increased significantly. The Vietnamese government acknowledged issues with enforcing labor laws after a rise in wildcat strikes. Humanitarian aid agencies and news agencies reported on the problems with workers' rights and efforts to improve working conditions in Vietnam. The Vietnamese government has collaborated with international organizations to enhance labor laws and regulations. The Ministry of Labour, Invalids, and Social Affairs worked with the International Labor Organization to establish new laws, approved by the National Assembly in 2012. Efforts are also being made to eliminate child labor with the help of Spain's Agency for International Development Cooperation. The United Nations provided funding to improve grassroots relations for the VGCL. The Vietnamese government has collaborated with international organizations to enhance labor laws and regulations. Efforts are being made to eliminate child labor with the help of Spain's Agency for International Development Cooperation. The United Nations provided funding to improve grassroots relations for the VGCL. Vietnamese workers face constraints on their right of association, ability to form unions, and address grievances. Labor organizers have been arrested for attempting to organize independent labor unions. Some foreign-owned factories violate Vietnamese laws on working hours and conditions, and hire under-aged workers. Chapter 19 of the TPP requires all parties to ensure compliance with labor laws. The TPP requires parties to comply with ILO labor standards, including freedom of association, elimination of forced labor, child labor protections, non-discrimination, and acceptable working conditions. Members must also promote corporate social responsibility initiatives and public awareness of labor laws. The TPP agreement establishes a Labour Council to discuss labor issues and review compliance with labor provisions. The United States-Vietnam Plan requires legal reforms for Vietnamese government to comply with TPP Chapter 19, allowing workers to form grassroots labor unions without prior authorization. Labor unions can be formed across enterprises and at levels above the enterprise in Vietnam. Grassroots labor unions can register with either the VGCL or a competent government body, giving them the right to elect representatives, adopt rules, manage finances, bargain collectively, and lead strikes. These unions have equal rights in law and practice as stated in the ILO Declaration. Vietnam's laws do not require labor unions registered with the government to operate according to the Statutes of Viet Nam General. The Plan requires Vietnam to change its labor laws and establish necessary institutional changes before the TPP agreement enters into force between the United States and Vietnam. If Vietnam fails to comply with its obligations after a five-year transition period, the United States may withhold or suspend tariff reductions. Additionally, Vietnam will develop and implement a strategy for labor rights-based strikes in accordance with ILO guidance. The Vietnamese government will develop a strategy for targeting inspection activities in sectors with forced labor or child labor. Independent experts will be allowed to conduct research studies in these sectors and publicly release their findings. A Senior Officials Committee will monitor compliance with legal and institutional reforms under the Plan for 10 years. The SOC will meet annually for 10 years and conduct joint reviews in the third, fifth, and tenth year after the TPP agreement. Critics point out shortcomings in ensuring Vietnam's compliance with workers' rights and lack of provisions for registering labor unions. Chapter 15 of the TPP requires national treatment and nondiscriminatory practices in government procurement. Chapter 18 of the TPP Agreement mandates member nations to adhere to international intellectual property rights agreements and provide national treatment to the intellectual property of other nations. The United States and Vietnam have exceptions for certain goods and services in government procurement, with the US using a \"negative list\" approach and Vietnam using a mix of \"negative list\" and \"positive list\" methods. The TPP Agreement mandates member nations to adhere to international intellectual property rights agreements and provide national treatment to the intellectual property of other nations. It also allows measures to protect public health and promote access to medicines. Trademarks are protected for at least 10 years, copyrights for 70 years after the author's death, and data exclusivity for biologics for 5-8 years. The US and Vietnam agreed on applying Article 9.6 to new pharmaceutical products containing biologics. Article 9.6 of the TPP Agreement provides five years of protection for new pharmaceutical products containing biologics. Chapter 17 requires state-owned enterprises to treat foreign companies equally and prohibits non-commercial assistance to these enterprises. The TPP agreement exempts certain entities like SOEs and designated monopolies from specific provisions. The US and Vietnam have identified their respective entities for exemption. Implementing legislation must be passed by Congress for the TPP to take effect in the US. Vietnam's National Assembly will review the TPP agreement in July 2016. Vietnam's National Assembly will consider the TPP agreement in July 2016, potentially influencing Congressional decision on TPP implementation. Membership in the trade agreement could bring economic benefits for Vietnam and increased market access for U.S. companies. The trade agreement may also signal improved bilateral relations and cooperation on geopolitical issues. According to assessments, Vietnam stands to benefit economically from the TPP, with expectations of increased trade and foreign investment. Concerns exist about potential job losses in the U.S. and a trade deficit with Vietnam. There are also worries about the impact on human and workers' rights in Vietnam. Analysts are skeptical about Vietnam's commitment to the US-Vietnam Plan for Trade and Labor Relations, doubting the protection of workers' rights. Some critics fear reduced US leverage on Vietnam's human rights. Others believe the Plan will improve working conditions and attract US investment. Catfish trade tensions persist between the two countries. Vietnamese exports of basa, swai, and tra frozen fish fillets have gained a significant share of the U.S. market despite objections from the U.S. catfish industry. The U.S. government has taken actions such as prohibiting the labeling of these fish as \"catfish\" and imposing antidumping duties on them. In 2015, the U.S. imported over $320 million of basa, swai, and tra from Vietnam. The number of companies exporting catfish to the United States declined significantly after antidumping duties were imposed. Despite this, U.S. imports of basa, swai, and tra from Vietnam continued to rise. The 2008 Farm Bill transferred catfish inspection from the FDA to the USDA, heightening tensions around catfish trade. The Vietnamese government views the U.S. response as trade protectionism. The 2008 Farm Bill raised concerns about the legal status of Vietnam's basa, swai, and tra exports to the United States, with supporters of U.S. trade policies citing consumer safety and fair business practices. Vietnam accuses the U.S. of protectionism, pointing to anti-dumping measures on shrimp and plastic bags. The 2008 Farm Bill transferred regulation of imported catfish from FDA to USDA, raising concerns about stricter inspection standards for catfish including basa, swai, and tra. Vietnam objected, citing potential impact on trade commitments and jobs for Vietnamese farmers. The 2008 Farm Bill transferred catfish regulation from FDA to USDA, causing concerns about stricter inspection standards for basa, swai, and tra. The new regulations took over five years to finalize, with draft regulations sent to OMB in 2009 and published in 2015. USDA proposed mandatory catfish inspection in 2011, leading to debates on protectionism and consumer safety. The USDA proposed mandatory inspection of imported catfish products, including basa, swai, and tra, under the definition of catfish. The Agricultural Act of 2014 amended the Federal Meat Inspection Act to require inspection of all fish of the order Siluriformes by the USDA, superseding previous laws. Coordination between FDA and USDA for inspection was also mandated. The USDA finalized catfish inspection regulations in December 2015, with full implementation by September 2017. Imported catfish must comply with USDA sanitation standards to be imported into the United States. Foreign countries must demonstrate equivalency with U.S. standards to export catfish to the United States. They need to show their laws, regulatory system, and standards align with FSIS requirements. FSIS conducts inspections and may visit overseas catfish facilities. Prior to March 1, 2016, countries had to provide a list of exporting establishments and documentation of their regulatory authority. During the transition period until September 1, 2017, FSIS will inspect U.S. catfish establishments for compliance with FDA regulations. Foreign countries must prove equivalence in their catfish inspection systems to export to the U.S. Additional documentation may be requested within 90 days. Starting in 2010, Vietnam tightened export hygiene standards for basa, swai, and tra fish. All exports needed certificates for hygiene and food safety. Vietnamese fish breeders were trained by a U.S.-based company to comply with U.S. standards. In 2011, a 10-year, $2 billion \"master plan\" for development was approved. Prime Minister Dung approved a 10-year, $2 billion plan for Vietnam's fish farming industry development. Vietnam's Ministry of Foreign Affairs expressed disappointment over new catfish regulations, citing potential trade barriers and harm to Vietnamese farmers. Officials raised concerns about the short 18-month transition period and possible violation of WTO agreements. U.S. Secretary of Agriculture visited Vietnam to discuss new catfish inspection requirements. Vietnam's Commercial Counselor urged the United States to revoke new catfish inspection regulations to avoid a potential WTO challenge. Vietnam, along with other nations, raised concerns about the regulations hampering TPP negotiations and violating U.S. WTO obligations. Vietnam submitted comments to the WTO expressing deep concerns about the U.S. catfish regulations. The new catfish inspection regulation of the United States is raising concerns about potential WTO violations. The ITC extended antidumping duties on frozen fish fillets from Vietnam, sparking opposition from the Vietnamese government. In response, the Department of Commerce reduced antidumping duties on Vietnam's catfish exports to the U.S. Restrictions on military equipment sales to Vietnam have been in place since the end of the Vietnam War in 1975. The U.S. banned military sales to Vietnam and included them on the ITAR list in 1984. These restrictions have hindered diplomatic relations and bilateral ties between the two countries. The State Department amended ITAR to allow non-lethal defense articles and services to be exported to Vietnam on a case-by-case basis. Vietnam was then able to participate in the FMF program and purchase spare parts for military equipment captured during the Vietnam War. The Obama Administration previously linked arms sales to human rights conditions, but since 2013, concerns about China's assertiveness have also influenced the debate over arms sales to Vietnam. The Obama Administration's concerns about China's assertiveness in the South China Sea have led to the decision to allow arms sales to Vietnam for maritime security. The State Department announced the future transfer of defense articles to Vietnam, with a focus on maritime security. Additionally, the White House planned to provide financial assistance to Vietnam for maritime security in FY2015 and FY2016. The Obama Administration plans to provide $20.5 million in FY2016 to help Vietnam bolster its maritime Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities and enhance command and control within Vietnam's maritime agencies. Admiral Harry Harris Jr. believes that improving the relationship with Vietnam is a strategic opportunity, with calls for a complete end to arms sales restrictions since the partial lifting of the embargo. Vietnam's Ambassador to the United States also advocates for the end of the arms embargo to strengthen relations. The end of the arms embargo between the United States and Vietnam is seen as a step towards fully normalized relations. However, human rights issues remain a concern, with Secretary of State Kerry linking further relaxation of arms sales restrictions to progress on human rights. Discussions are ongoing about ending the restrictions before President Obama's visit in May 2016, but the sale of arms to Vietnam may face controversy in Congress due to concerns about Vietnam's human rights record. Provision of maritime security-related defense articles is currently acceptable. The provision of maritime security-related defense articles is currently acceptable due to tensions in the South China Sea. Vietnam may request advanced radar equipment, testing the limits of arms sales restrictions. Vietnamese leaders seek to change Vietnam's official designation from \"nonmarket economy\" to \"market economy\" under U.S. trade law. Vietnam is transitioning from a centrally planned economy to a market economy, allowing private enterprise and competitive market allocation. The country seeks to change its official designation from \"nonmarket economy\" to \"market economy\" under U.S. trade law. Vietnam's economy is transitioning to a market economy with private enterprise and competitive market allocation. State-owned enterprises (SOEs) still play a significant role in key sectors like mining and energy, with 46% of the 500 largest enterprises in Vietnam being SOEs. The top five enterprises in Vietnam are all SOEs. Vietnam's economy is transitioning to a market economy with private enterprise and competitive market allocation. State-owned enterprises (SOEs) still play a significant role in key sectors like mining and energy. Many SOEs have been converted into quasi-private corporations through equitization, with the Vietnamese government retaining a controlling interest in most shares. The number of SOEs in Vietnam has been reduced to 1,309 by restructuring or equitization. Despite attempts to sell shares in 25 SOEs in 2014, over 70% remained unsold. The government equitized 143 SOEs in 2014 and plans to equitize about 280 in 2015, allowing them to continue managing the operations of these companies. The doi moi process in Vietnam has led to deregulation of most prices and wages, but the government still controls key prices like industrial products and basic consumer goods. Inflationary pressure led to tightened price controls in 2010, which were later loosened but reinstated in 2013. Vietnamese government workers have fixed pay scales, while private enterprise workers' wages are market-driven. Inflation has caused upward pressure on wages in Vietnam. Vietnam's recent inflation has led to upward pressure on wages. The government's anti-inflation policy aims to curb wage increases. Vietnam asserts that most prices and wages are market-determined, especially for goods exported to the US. The country faces competitive pressure from other Asian nations. Vietnam seeks recognition as a market economy from major trading partners. ASEAN, Australia, India, Japan, and New Zealand have designated Vietnam a market economy for international trade. Vietnam seeks market economy designation for trade normalization with the US. Being a nonmarket economy may lead to adverse rulings in trade cases. The 114th Congress could potentially address Vietnam's designation through legislation. Vietnam has requested inclusion in the US Generalized System of Preferences. Vietnam requested to be added to the U.S. Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) program as a \"beneficiary developing country\" in 2008. The U.S. Trade Representative initiated a review of Vietnam's eligibility for GSP benefits, citing the need for improved labor standards. Vietnam has been accepted into GSP programs of Canada, the EU, and Japan, but awaits a decision on its U.S. application. Vietnam's interest in joining the U.S. GSP program has decreased as they see inclusion in the TPP as a better option. The Vietnamese government views acceptance into the GSP program as a step towards normalizing bilateral relations. If the TPP is not implemented soon, Vietnam's interest in the GSP program may increase. Compliance with the labor agreement in the TPP could impact Vietnam's eligibility for the GSP program. Under Title V of the Trade Act of 1974, Congress does not have a direct role in deciding Vietnam's acceptance into the U.S. GSP program; this authority lies with the President. Congress can indicate preferences through hearings, communications, or legislation specifying eligibility criteria for Vietnam. Each chamber could also pass a resolution urging the President to approve or deny Vietnam's application. In the 113th Congress, the Fostering Rights through Economic Engagement in Vietnam Act (H.R. 1682) aimed to deny Vietnam's entry into the GSP program unless certain human rights conditions were met. President Bush and Prime Minister Dung initiated talks for a bilateral investment treaty (BIT) to enhance the investment climate. The first round of BIT negotiations took place in Washington, DC in December 2008. The second round of BIT negotiations between Vietnam and the US took place in Hanoi in June 2009, followed by a third round in Washington, DC in November 2009. Subsequent talks planned for early 2010 did not occur, as bilateral BIT discussions were put on hold due to both countries joining TPP negotiations. If TPP implementation faces challenges, Vietnam's BIT negotiations may resume. Vietnam may restart BIT talks if TPP implementation encounters issues. The 2001 BTA between the US and Vietnam included provisions for investment, dispute settlement, and compliance with WTO TRIMs. Both nations committed to negotiating a bilateral investment treaty in good faith. The United States and Vietnam may need Senate ratification for a BIT negotiated during the 114th Congress. Congressional action may be necessary if the BIT requires changes in U.S. law. Economic issues like clothing imports and IPR protection are key concerns for the 114th Congress in relation to Vietnam. Vietnam's clothing exports to the U.S. have increased significantly since being granted conditional NTR status in 2001. U.S. clothing imports from Vietnam increased significantly after being granted conditional NTR status in 2001. By 2015, the value of these imports exceeded $10.5 billion, although the share of clothing in total U.S. imports from Vietnam had declined to 27.6%. In 2015, 27.6% of U.S. imports from Vietnam were clothing. Efforts to restrict clothing trade with Vietnam led to protests but Vietnam eventually complied with U.S. policies. Concerns were raised by Members of Congress about the impact on U.S. textile companies and workers. Major U.S. apparel retailers and importers argued that restricting trade from Vietnam would harm U.S. companies and consumers. Congressional debate continues on this issue. The U.S. government remains critical of Vietnam's record on intellectual property rights protection, as Vietnam was included in the \"Watch List\" in the U.S. Trade Representative's 2016 Special 301 Report due to ongoing issues with online piracy and counterfeit goods. Congressional and commercial interest in the growth of clothing imports from Vietnam persists, with differing opinions on trade agreements and provisions. The U.S. government criticizes Vietnam for ongoing issues with online piracy and counterfeit goods, impacting trade relations and potential trade agreements. Enforcement of intellectual property rights remains a challenge in Vietnam. The focus will be on recent trade relations between the United States and Vietnam, examining trends in merchandise trade, trade in services, and foreign direct investment. Top U.S. imports from Vietnam in 2015 included electrical machinery, footwear, and furniture, while top U.S. exports to Vietnam were aircraft, electrical machinery, cotton, machinery, and oil seeds. In 2015, Vietnam's top imports from the United States included cotton, machinery, oil seeds, electrical machinery, footwear, and wood for furniture. There is a significant interplay between the top trade commodities of both countries, with Vietnam importing materials from the U.S. for manufacturing goods that are then exported back to the U.S. Vietnam's electrical machinery exports to the United States have seen significant growth since 2001, reaching over $8.3 billion in 2015. This sector constitutes nearly 22% of total U.S. imports from Vietnam. The potential for further growth in this sector is high due to Vietnam's skilled and cost-effective workforce, according to foreign investors and Vietnamese economic officials. Efforts to limit Vietnam's top exports to the U.S. could result in a decrease in U.S. exports to Vietnam and potential job losses in the United States. Vietnamese economic officials prioritize expanding production of higher-valued electronics for transition to middle-income economy. Vietnam is the second-largest source of footwear imports for the US, after China. US footwear industry supports eliminating most footwear tariffs in future trade agreements. Vietnam has seen a significant increase in furniture and bedding imports to the United States, becoming the 4th largest source. The US perceives a trade advantage in various service sectors, particularly financial services, with Vietnam committing to liberalization as part of trade agreements. Vietnam has liberalized various service sectors, including financial services, telecommunications, and distribution services. The United States is expected to push for more access during TPP and BIT negotiations. In 2014, Vietnam licensed 1,843 foreign direct investment projects worth $21.9 billion, with South Korea being the leading investor. The United States was the 10th largest investor in 2014. The accumulated value of FDI in Vietnam from 1989-2014 is $252.7 billion, with South Korea, Japan, and Singapore being the top investors. The United States was the 7th largest investor during this period. Growing U.S. interest in investment opportunities in Vietnam could impact TPP and BIT negotiations. Growing U.S. interest in investment opportunities in Vietnam could impact TPP and BIT negotiations, leading to potential business disagreements and pressure on Congress. The official merchandise trade data for the United States and Vietnam is provided in the table below."
