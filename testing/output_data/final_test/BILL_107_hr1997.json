    "content": "The \"Uniformed and Overseas Citizen Absentee Voting Reform Act of 2001\" is the short title of the Act enacted by the United States Congress. Some 3,000,000 to 6,000,000 American citizens, including 576,000 Federal employees and their dependents, live outside the U.S. They contribute to the country's security, economy, and culture. Progress has been made in allowing them to participate in the democratic process, but shortcomings were revealed in the 2000 national elections. In the 2000 national elections, nearly 40 percent of overseas ballots were rejected in one State, highlighting grave shortcomings in the system. Timely information about American citizens voting from abroad is not currently provided by the States, hindering the effectiveness of the overseas voting system. Simplification of voter registration and absentee ballot procedures for absent uniformed services and overseas voters is addressed in Section 3. Requiring states to accept official form for simultaneous voter registration and absentee ballot application, with a deadline of at least 30 days before the election for processing. The text introduces new paragraphs requiring the use of the official post card form for simultaneous voter registration and absentee ballot application, as well as the transmission of absentee ballots to absent uniformed services voters and overseas voters. Additionally, there are conforming amendments to ensure compliance with the requirements. Amendment to Section 104 of the Act requires the use of a single application for all subsequent elections. Amendment to Section 104 of the Act mandates the use of a single application for all future elections. If a State accepts an official post card form from absent uniformed services or overseas voters for voter registration and absentee ballot application, the voter is automatically registered for future Federal elections and will receive absentee ballots. This does not apply if the voter changes registration or notifies the State of their wish to no longer be registered. The State can remove a voter from the registered voter rolls if the voter registers in another State or no longer wishes to be registered. This does not affect voter removal programs allowed under the National Voter Registration Act of 1993. SEC. 4. Removing barriers to acceptance of completed ballots. Section 102 of the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act is amended to include special requirements for acceptance of completed absentee ballots, stating that a State must count a ballot submitted by an absent uniformed services voter or overseas voter if received within 14 days after the election, signed and dated by the voter. The amended Section 102 of the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act specifies that a State cannot reject an absentee ballot from an absent uniformed services voter or overseas voter for lacking a postmark if the ballot is signed, dated, and witnessed within the state's deadline for submission. SEC. 5. OTHER REQUIREMENTS TO PROMOTE PARTICIPATION OF OVERSEAS AND ABSENT UNIFORMED SERVICES VOTERS. Section 102 of the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act is amended to include new requirements for notifying absent uniformed services voters and overseas voters about the approval or rejection of their voter registration applications or absentee ballot requests. The amended Section 102 of the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act requires states to notify absent uniformed services voters and overseas voters about the approval or rejection of their voter registration applications or absentee ballot requests. States must also notify voters if their absentee ballot has been received and provide reasons for rejection if applicable. The Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act allows voters to use facsimile machines and the Internet to transmit applications and requests to the State. States cannot require notarization for voter registration or absentee ballots from absent uniformed services voters or overseas voters. The Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act requires states to compile and publish information on absent uniformed services voters and overseas voters, including voter registration applications, absentee ballots sent, and completed absentee ballots. The Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act mandates states to compile and publish data on absentee voters, including rejected ballots and reasons. States must break down the information by local jurisdiction and overseas locations, and transmit it to the Presidential designee for Presidential election years. States must compile and transmit data on absentee voters to the Presidential designee for the report described in section 102(6). SEC. 6. ADDITIONAL DUTIES OF PRESIDENTIAL DESIGNEE. The curr_chunk discusses amendments to the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act, including educating election officials on their responsibilities and developing a standard oath for use with materials. The curr_chunk discusses amendments to the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act, specifically requiring states to use a standard oath prescribed by the Presidential designee for accompanying documents under the Act. Amendments to the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act include allowing the transmission of ballots through facsimile machines and the Internet for overseas voters. The Presidential designee is required to make the Federal write-in absentee ballot and application available through these methods. Amendment to the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act includes specifying statistical analysis of voter participation for overseas voters and absent uniformed services voters. SEC. 7 amends the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act to provide protections to recently separated uniformed services voters. Recently separated uniformed services voters (or their spouses or dependents) are treated the same as absent uniformed services voters for any election within a 60-day period after separation. A separated uniformed services voter is defined as an individual who has left the uniformed services, was a voter while in the services, and can provide Department of Defense Form 214 as proof. The term 'uniformed services voter' refers to a member of a uniformed service on active duty or a member of the merchant marine. The individual must meet specific requirements and be qualified to vote in the election. Financial assistance will be provided to states for compliance costs under the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act. States must submit an application to receive payment, and appropriations are authorized for this purpose. The effective date of this provision is specified. The amendments made by sections 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 will apply to elections after the enactment of this Act."
