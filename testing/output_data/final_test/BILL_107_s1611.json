The Act aims to eliminate unfair advantages held by States in the intellectual property system and reaffirm relief against State officials violating IP laws. Additionally, it seeks to remove State sovereign immunity in cases where their instrumentalities, officers, or employees violate the United States Constitution by infringing Federal intellectual property. SEC. 3. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY REMEDIES EQUALIZATION. Amendment to Patent Law: No remedies under section 284 or 289 shall be awarded in civil actions for patent infringement if a State or State instrumentality is the owner of the patent, unless the State has waived its immunity from suit in Federal court for intellectual property infringement. The waiver of immunity for patent infringement remedies must comply with state laws and remain effective. Exceptions to the limitation on remedies include pre-existing contract-based expectations and cases where the purchaser was unaware of state ownership of the patent. The limitation can be raised at any point in a proceeding until January 1, 2004. The court may stay proceedings until January 1, 2004, to allow the State to waive immunity for copyright infringement cases involving works created after January 1, 2002. The State has waived its immunity from suit in Federal court for infringement of intellectual property protected under Federal law, in accordance with the constitution and laws of the State. The limitation on remedies does not apply if it affects a legitimate contract-based expectation before January 1, 2002, or if the party seeking remedies was a bona fide. The limitation on remedies under trademark law applies if the party seeking remedies was a bona fide purchaser for value of the exclusive right and did not know that a State was once the legal owner. The limitation can be raised at any point in a proceeding, with the court having the option to stay the proceeding until January 1, 2004, to allow the State to waive its immunity. No remedies shall be awarded in civil actions under this Act for violations of trademark rights if a State was the legal owner, unless the State waives its immunity by January 1, 2004. The limitation on remedies under the Act does not apply if it would affect a pre-existing contract-based expectation or if the party seeking remedies was a bona fide purchaser without knowledge of the infringement by a State or its instrumentality. The Act limits remedies if a State or its instrumentality was once the owner of the right. Technical amendments to patent law are made by repealing Section 296 of title 35, United States Code. The Act repeals Section 296 of title 35, United States Code, and makes amendments to copyright and trademark laws. SEC. 4 clarifies remedies for statutory violations by State officers and employees under various federal acts, allowing for monetary damages, declaratory relief, and more. SEC. 5 addresses State liability for constitutional violations involving intellectual property. Any State or State instrumentality that violates the exclusive rights of a patent owner, copyright owner, owner of a mask work, owner of a registered mark, or owner of a protected plant variety in a way that deprives a person of property, shall be liable in Federal court for compensation. Any violation of the exclusive rights of a patent owner, copyright owner, owner of a mask work, owner of a registered mark, or owner of a protected plant variety that results in property deprivation is subject to civil action in Federal court for compensation. This does not affect the ability to seek other forms of relief. Compensation for violations of intellectual property rights may include various forms of damages, costs, and fees as outlined in relevant laws. Enhanced damages are not included in the compensation. The burden of proof lies with the party bringing the action. The burden of proof in actions for infringement under the applicable Federal statute is the same as if the action were brought under such statute. For all other matters, including whether the State provides an adequate remedy for property deprivation, the burden of proof is on the State or State instrumentality. This section applies to violations occurring after the enactment of this Act. SEC. 6. RULES OF CONSTRUCTION. The district courts have jurisdiction over actions under this Act. The Act should be broadly construed to protect intellectual property. If any provision is deemed unconstitutional, the rest of the Act remains unaffected."
