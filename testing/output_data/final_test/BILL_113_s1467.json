    "content": "The \"FISA Court Reform Act of 2013\" is the short title of this Act. It includes definitions for various terms used in the Act. In this Act, definitions are provided for key terms such as \"decision,\" \"FISA,\" \"FISA Court,\" \"FISA Court of Review,\" \"Office,\" and \"significant construction or interpretation of law.\" A \"significant construction or interpretation\" means a significant construction or interpretation of a provision under FISA. A \"Special Advocate\" refers to the Special Advocate appointed under section 3(b). The Office of the Special Advocate is established under section 3. The Office of the Special Advocate is established in the executive branch as an independent establishment, with the head of the Office being the Special Advocate appointed by the presiding judge of the FISA Court of Review from a list of candidates submitted by the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board. The Special Advocate can be appointed without a security clearance and serves a 5-year term, with the possibility of reappointment for consecutive terms. Dismissal can only occur for good cause, including the inability to qualify for a security clearance. The presiding judge of the FISA Court of Review may appoint an Acting Special Advocate from qualified employees of the Office or a list provided by the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board if the Special Advocate position is vacant. The Acting Special Advocate has the same powers as a Special Advocate and serves until a new appointment is made. The Special Advocate appointed under civil service laws has the authority to review FISA Court applications and decisions. The executive branch must cooperate to provide necessary security clearances. The Special Advocate appointed under civil service laws has the authority to participate in FISA Court proceedings, request participation, appeal decisions, and protect advocacy. The Special Advocate appointed under civil service laws vigorously advocates before the FISA Court to minimize surveillance and data collection. They can delegate duties to outside counsel but not certain authorities. The FISA Court can order agencies to provide necessary documents to the Special Advocate or outside counsel for their duties. Advocacy before the FISA Court is addressed in Section 4. The FISA Court may appoint the Special Advocate to participate in proceedings and grant standing as a party. The Special Advocate can request reconsideration of FISA Court decisions within 30 days of relevant documents being available. The FISA Court has discretion to grant or deny motions for reconsideration. The Special Advocate can file a motion for amicus curiae participation, and the FISA Court may also facilitate such participation. Regulations for this process must be established within 180 days of the Act's enactment. After the enactment of this Act, the FISA Court will create rules for public access to information for amicus curiae participation. SEC. 5. APPELLATE REVIEW. The Special Advocate has the authority to appeal FISA Court decisions within 90 days, with standing before the FISA Court of Review. The FISA Court of Review must review and issue a decision on any appealed FISA Court decision. The FISA Court of Review has the authority to conduct mandatory reviews of FISA Court decisions. The standards for review include de novo for issues of law and clearly erroneous for facts. The Court accepts amicus curiae briefs and allows for participation in oral arguments. Regulations for public information disclosure are required within 180 days of the Act's enactment. The Special Advocate can seek Supreme Court review of FISA Court of Review decisions and has standing in related proceedings. SEC. 6. DISCLOSURE. The Attorney General is required to publicly disclose decisions from the FISA Court or FISA Court of Review that involve significant legal interpretations. This includes decisions appealed by the Special Advocate. The disclosure must include documents detailing the legal questions addressed, their resolutions, and the context of the matter. The Attorney General must disclose FISA Court or FISA Court of Review decisions involving significant legal interpretations, including those appealed by the Special Advocate. This disclosure can be in the form of releasing decisions in full or redacted, summaries of decisions, or related documents like applications and briefs. The disclosure should provide information on the legal questions addressed, their resolutions, and the context of the matter. The Attorney General must disclose FISA Court or FISA Court of Review decisions involving significant legal interpretations, including those appealed by the Special Advocate. Decisions must be disclosed within specific timeframes, such as 180 days for decisions issued prior to the enactment of the Act, 30 days for FISA Court decisions, and 90 days for FISA Court of Review decisions. The Special Advocate can petition the FISA Court or FISA Court of Review for public disclosure of classified information or release of an unclassified summary. Each petition must include a declassification proposal or summary of the documents to be released. The Attorney General plays a role in this process. The Special Advocate can petition the FISA Court for public disclosure of classified information. The Attorney General can oppose the petition within 90 days. The FISA Court must declassify and make available any requested material within 91 days. The Special Advocate can request public disclosure of significant legal decisions, with a waiting period of 181 days after the enactment of the Act. The Special Advocate must submit an annual report to Congress detailing the Office's activities, assessing the Act's effectiveness, and proposing new legislation for improvement. SEC. 8. PRESERVATION OF RIGHTS. This Act does not give the Attorney General authority to prevent the FISA Court from declassifying decisions or limit the public's access to information under the Freedom of Information Act or any other law."
