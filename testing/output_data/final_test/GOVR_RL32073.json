    "content": "LNG facilities are gaining public attention for their role in the nation's energy infrastructure and vulnerability to terrorist attacks. Concerns about natural gas prices and shortages are driving up demand for LNG imports, but there are risks associated with transporting and storing LNG. Some in Congress are reviewing security provisions in federal LNG regulation. The proposed legislation, S. 1594 and H.R. 2830, aims to enhance federal protection for vessels and infrastructure handling LNG and other hazardous cargoes. H.R. 2830, passed by the House of Representatives, would require the Coast Guard to enforce security zones around LNG tankers and limit reliance on state resources for LNG security. It also mandates a comparative risk assessment of LNG processes and a report on state and local support for Coast Guard security resources. This report provides an overview of industry and federal activities related to LNG security, including U.S. LNG infrastructure, safety record, security risks, and initiatives post-9/11. It summarizes recent changes in federal LNG and maritime security law, discusses policy concerns, and focuses on industry and federal activities in LNG infrastructure security. The report also touches on state and local agency activities related to federal efforts. The report focuses on local issues of interest to policy makers regarding shipping, marine terminals, and land-based storage facilities within gas utilities. It discusses LNG safety in relation to security and explains how natural gas becomes liquefied natural gas (LNG) for more efficient storage and transportation. The report discusses LNG imports to the United States from various countries and the use of LNG for heating, cooking, and power generation. It also mentions the history of LNG use in the United States since the 1940s and the export of Alaskan LNG to Japan. In the 1970s, LNG imports began to supplement domestic gas production in the United States, accounting for only 1% of total consumption in 2002. Meanwhile, countries like Japan heavily relied on LNG imports, with 97% of its natural gas supply coming from LNG in 2002. The increasing demand for natural gas in the US, driven by environmental concerns and low gas prices, has led to high and volatile gas prices due to supply not keeping up with demand. Average annual gas prices at the wellhead have risen from $1.50-$2.50/Mcf in the 1990s to above $6.00/Mcf since 2005. International LNG prices have fallen, making it more competitive with domestic natural gas. Industry analysts estimate LNG can be delivered to U.S. pipelines for $2.25-$4.15/Mcf. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan called for increased LNG imports to help economic growth due to cost reductions in liquefaction and transportation. The high gas prices in the American distant futures market have made the US a potential large LNG importer. The Energy Information Administration projects US LNG imports to account for 13% of total gas supply in 2030. The physical infrastructure of LNG includes tanker ships, marine terminals, and storage facilities. LNG tankers are double-hulled and insulated to maintain safe temperatures during transit. LNG tankers transport cargo to marine terminals for distribution to domestic markets. Over 200 tankers are currently in service worldwide, with more expected by 2013. Onshore terminals include docks, handling equipment, storage tanks, and connections to gas pipelines. The siting of onshore LNG terminals in the US is regulated by FERC. There are eight active onshore LNG terminals in the United States, including the Everett terminal in Massachusetts. The United States has several LNG terminals, including ones in Cove Point, Maryland; Elba Island, Georgia; and Kenai, Alaska. These terminals receive LNG shipments for distribution to domestic markets. Cove Point could receive up to 200 shipments per year, Elba Island can receive approximately 118 shipments annually, and Kenai is the oldest LNG terminal in the US, built for export to Japan. The United States has several LNG terminals, including ones in Nikiski, Lake Charles, Pe\u00f1uelas, Quintana Island, and Sabine Pass. These terminals receive LNG shipments for distribution to domestic markets, with capacities ranging from 10 to 200 shipments per year. The offshore LNG terminal near the Sabine Pass Channel in Cameron Parish can receive around 300 ships per year. It received its first commercial cargo in April 2008. Offshore terminals connect to land via underwater pipelines to avoid community opposition and permitting issues. They also pose fewer security risks compared to on-shore terminals. However, environmental concerns may arise if seawater is used for regasification, impacting the local ecosystem. Offshore LNG terminals are regulated by the Maritime Administration (MARAD) and the U.S. Coast Guard. The U.S. has one operating offshore LNG terminal in the Gulf of Mexico, Louisiana, regulated by MARAD and the U.S. Coast Guard. It can handle up to 60 LNG shipments per year. Another terminal near Boston is set to start in 2008. 28 LNG terminal proposals have been approved in North America for the U.S. market, with some withdrawn due to various issues. Developers have proposed 13 more U.S. terminals. Developers have proposed an additional 13 U.S. terminals for LNG storage facilities. These plants, known as peak shaving plants, supplement pipeline gas supplies during peak demand periods. LNG is stored in refrigerated tanks integrated with the local gas pipeline network. The facilities usually liquefy natural gas from the interstate pipeline grid, while smaller ones receive LNG by truck. LNG tanks are surrounded by containment impoundments to limit spills. According to PHMSA, there are 103 active LNG storage facilities in the U.S. across 31 states. There are 103 active LNG storage facilities in the United States, mainly in the Northeast due to historical constraints. Safety hazards have been debated for decades, with improvements in technology and standards since the 1940s. However, serious hazards remain as LNG is volatile and stored in large quantities. The 2004 accident at Algeria's Skikda LNG terminal added to safety concerns, with the infrastructure also vulnerable to terrorist attacks. LNG poses a serious hazard of explosion or fire due to its combustible nature. LNG poses serious hazards of explosion or fire due to its combustible nature and extreme cold. Experts have identified potentially catastrophic events from an LNG release, with pool fires being a major concern. These fires are intense, burning hotly and rapidly, and cannot be extinguished until all the LNG is consumed. The thermal radiation from LNG pool fires may also cause injuries to people. LNG pool fires are a serious hazard as their thermal radiation can cause injuries and damage property far from the fire. If LNG spills and forms a vapor cloud that ignites, it can lead to a fire that gradually burns back to the spill site. Experts believe that an LNG tank failure could result in a catastrophic event. Experts believe that in the event of an LNG tank failure, an instantaneous pool fire is more likely to occur than a large vapor cloud fire. There is a theoretical possibility of a \"flameless explosion\" if LNG spills on water, but this has not been extensively studied on a tanker scale. While an LNG vapor cloud is not toxic, it could cause asphyxiation by displacing breathable air. The LNG vapor cloud is not toxic but could cause asphyxiation by displacing breathable air. LNG spills could injure people or damage equipment through direct contact, but the environmental damage is limited as LNG dissipates completely. The LNG tanker industry has a record of safety over the last 45 years, with no serious accidents at sea or in port. The LNG marine safety record is strong due to double-hulled design of tankers, equipped with safety systems. Onshore LNG terminals have had approximately 13 serious accidents since 1944, with some fatalities. In 1977, a worker died in Algeria, and in 1979, another fatality occurred at Cove Point, Maryland. A fire in Skikda, Algeria in 2004 killed 27 workers and injured 74. The accident was due to poor maintenance, not a design flaw. LNG facilities have had other fatal accidents since 1944, but not involving LNG. LNG tankers and facilities are potential targets for terrorism. LNG facilities are vulnerable to terrorism, with tankers being potential targets for physical or cyber attacks. Attacks on LNG facilities could disrupt regional electricity grids and communication networks, impacting LNG control and safety systems. LNG shipping disruptions pose downstream risks, especially in LNG-dependent regions like New England. LNG tankers are of particular concern due to their accessibility compared to fixed terminal facilities. According to a 2004 report by Sandia National Laboratories, LNG tankers are potentially more accessible than fixed terminal facilities, making spills harder to control. The report states that an intentional LNG spill could cause major injuries and significant damage within 500 meters of the spill site, with impacts extending up to 1.5 miles. Other studies have varied in their conclusions about LNG tanker vulnerability, with a 2007 Government Accountability Office report reviewing six unclassified studies on the subject. The GAO report highlighted the uncertainty surrounding LNG spill consequences due to conflicting modeling assessments. Congress allocated $8 million in 2008 for large-scale LNG fire experiments to address these uncertainties. The outcome of this research will determine policymakers' confidence in LNG tanker vulnerability analyses. Operators of LNG infrastructure had security programs in place before September 11, 2001, focusing on personnel safety and vandalism prevention. The attacks on September 11 raised concerns about LNG infrastructure vulnerability to various threats, including systematic attacks by foreign terrorists. Government and industry have since implemented new initiatives to enhance security. Multiple federal agencies oversee LNG infrastructure security, with the Coast Guard leading shipping and terminal security, and other agencies having authority over peak-shaving plants and some LNG terminals. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) has siting approval responsibility for land-based LNG marine terminals and peak-shaving plants. State and local authorities, along with federal agencies like the U.S. Coast Guard and Maritime Administration, play key roles in securing LNG infrastructure. The Coast Guard is the lead federal agency for maritime security, overseeing port security and inspecting commercial ships entering U.S. waters. Under the Maritime Transportation Security Act of 2002 (P.L. 107-295), the Coast Guard and Maritime Administration share siting approval authority for offshore LNG terminals. Post-9/11, the Coast Guard prioritized protecting ships and facilities, including LNG, based on vulnerability assessments. They evaluated marine targets' susceptibility to terrorist threats and potential use as weapons, focusing on tankers' vulnerability to explosives or being commandeered. The Coast Guard conducted vulnerability assessments on key maritime assets, including LNG terminals, bridges, channels, and tunnels, to enhance security measures. Following the 9/11 attacks, security was increased for LNG tankers and ports, with measures such as security reviews, revised plans, and establishment of security zones around terminals. Patrols were also intensified in Boston harbor, and reassessments were done before allowing LNG shipments to resume at certain terminals. The Coast Guard has increased security measures for LNG shipments, including inspections, on-board escorts, advanced notifications, and boarding for inspection before entry into Boston harbor. The Everett terminal receives the most heavily secured shipments due to passing through Boston harbor. The Coast Guard has implemented enhanced security measures for LNG shipments entering Boston harbor, including armed escorts, security zones, suspension of overflights, and inspection of adjacent piers. Additional undisclosed security measures are also in place. These provisions are in line with security requirements for other U.S. LNG terminals and are governed by regulations in Title 33 of the Code of Federal Regulations. The rules establish Coast Guard port officers as maritime security coordinators and set requirements for maritime area security plans and committees. Owners or operators of marine assets must designate security officers, perform security assessments, develop security plans, and comply with maritime security alert levels. The rules apply to LNG tankers entering U.S. ports and land-based U.S. LNG terminals. Vessels, including LNG tankers, must carry an automatic identification system. The Coast Guard reviews and approves security plans for marine traffic around proposed LNG marine terminals. The Coast Guard is involved in evaluating LNG terminal siting applications and led the development of maritime security standards. The International Ship and Port Facility Security Code (ISPS Code) sets security requirements for governments, port authorities, and shipping companies. President Bush signed the Security and Accountability for Every Port Act of 2006, which includes general maritime security provisions that could apply to LNG. The Security and Accountability for Every Port Act of 2006 includes maritime security provisions for LNG vessels and facilities, such as facility security plans, inspections, vessel tracking, port security centers, grants, and training programs. The Coast Guard is responsible for implementing these provisions, while MARAD shares siting approval authority for offshore LNG terminals. The Coast Guard and MARAD oversee LNG terminals and maritime security. Congress passed the Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Act of 2006 to promote LNG transportation in U.S. flag vessels. The act prioritizes processing offshore LNG siting applications for U.S. flag vessels and considers the nationality of officers and crew. OPS within PHMSA also plays a role in ensuring safety. The Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) regulates the safety and security of LNG peak-shaving plants under the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act of 1968. Security regulations for LNG facilities are outlined in 49 C.F.R. 193, covering procedures, enclosures, communications, monitoring, lighting, power sources, and warning signs. Additional security provisions are included in federal LNG safety regulations and National Fire Protection Association standards. OPS published a security advisory for LNG facility operators in response to a security breach in August 2006. Register a security advisory for LNG facility operators following a security breach at an LNG peak-shaving plant in Lynn, MA in August 2006. The breach allowed intruders to access the main LNG storage tank by bypassing security barriers and alert systems. The advisory recommends ensuring alarms and monitoring devices are functional, security personnel are well-trained, timely response to breaches, updating security procedures with relevant threat information, coordinating security activities, and conducting independent security audits. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) oversees security for the interstate gas pipeline network. The TSA oversees security for the interstate gas pipeline network and land-based LNG facilities. The Pipeline Security Division within TSA is responsible for developing security standards, implementing risk mitigation measures, building stakeholder relations, and monitoring compliance with security regulations since 2003. Since 2003, TSA has implemented various initiatives for pipeline security, including developing security plans, conducting on-site reviews, assessing cross-border pipelines, and providing security training. By February 2008, TSA had completed 73 CSR reviews, with companies implementing security plans, conducting background checks, and raising awareness of pipeline security. TSA also issued recommended security practices for pipeline operators in 2005. In 2005, TSA issued recommended security practices for pipeline operators, with revised guidance released in 2006 and a planned second revision in 2008. FERC is responsible for permitting new land-based LNG facilities and ensuring safe operation through inspections. The agency inspects LNG facilities every two years to monitor physical plant conditions and changes from the approved design. FERC's LNG siting authority is derived from the Natural Gas Act of 1938. FERC, under the Natural Gas Act of 1938, has jurisdiction over on-shore LNG marine terminals and peak-shaving plants involved in interstate gas trade. Post-9/11, FERC emphasized security at LNG facilities, adding a security chapter to inspection manuals and conducting biennial inspections with a focus on security measures. In 2005, FERC inspected 11 jurisdictional LNG sites, prioritizing security improvements. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has the authority to regulate chemical facilities with high security risks. In 2007, DHS finalized regulations requiring facilities with hazardous chemicals, including LNG, to submit information for security assessments and plans. These regulations may apply to inland LNG peak-shaving plants. The Coast Guard, TSA, and FERC have overlapping security jurisdiction over certain facilities at onshore LNG terminals. FERC's biennial LNG site visits include security inspections, TSA oversees onsite pipeline security, and the Coast Guard asserts lead security authority over the entire terminal in its maritime security regulations. To avoid confusion, the agencies have entered into an interagency agreement to coordinate safety issues. The agencies have entered into an agreement to address safety and security issues at waterfront LNG facilities, including terminal facilities and tanker operations. They will cooperate in siting approval, inspection, operational review, communication, and dispute resolution. FERC conducts security reviews for new LNG terminal applications in consultation with the US Coast Guard. Assessments of LNG terminal proposals are conducted by Coast Guard field units with input from various stakeholders. FERC engineers assist with marine spill issues, and both FERC and the Coast Guard require navigational suitability and security assessments. Post-9/11, gas infrastructure operators, including those with LNG facilities, enhanced security measures and emergency plans in response to the heightened terrorist threat. The operators increased security measures for gas infrastructure, including LNG facilities, after 9/11. A task force with industry and government representatives developed security standards and guidelines for pipelines and LNG facilities, endorsed by the OPS. They also collaborated on a government threat notification system with federal agencies. Homeland Security and industry have made significant efforts to secure the nation's LNG infrastructure. Challenges remain in implementing and sustaining LNG protection activities, with concerns about public costs, terrorist threats, and security differences between foreign and U.S. LNG vessels. Cost estimates for LNG security are limited, but in 2003, the Coast Guard estimated it cost $40,000 to $50,000 to escort an LNG tanker to the Everett terminal. The public cost of security for an LNG tanker shipment to the Everett terminal is estimated to be around $100,000, excluding costs incurred by the terminal owner. Other active LNG terminals may have lower marine security costs due to their distance from dense populations and fewer vulnerabilities. The nine active onshore U.S. LNG terminals, including Everett, expect to have enough capacity for over 1,100 shipments per year in 2009. Increasing LNG imports to meet 13% of total U.S. gas supply by 2030 could require some 2,300 LNG shipments. Annual costs for marine LNG security could exceed $55 million by 2009 and $115 million by 2030. Analysts predict that U.S. LNG terminals will operate below capacity in the next several years, so actual security costs will likely be lower. The potential increase in security costs from growing U.S. LNG imports is a concern to policy makers. Coast Guard resources dedicated to securing maritime LNG could be used for other missions like boating safety, search and rescue, and drug interdiction. LNG security is funded from the Coast Guard's general maritime security budget, with an additional $11 million allocated in FY2006 for increased port presence and LNG transport security. In December 2007, the GAO recommended the Coast Guard develop a national resource allocation plan for LNG security. Coast Guard Commandant Admiral Thad Allen expressed concerns about securing LNG deliveries, citing insufficient resources. State and local agencies are also seeking more funding for LNG security. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 requires cost-sharing for LNG tanker security, with new terminal operators responsible for additional security costs. The FERC recommends private security staff to supplement Coast Guard and local forces, and as federally mandated security systems are implemented, public costs may decrease. Advancements in security technology and threat intelligence could help lower LNG security costs in the future. The potential rise in security expenses from increased U.S. LNG shipments may necessitate a review of these costs. The potential increase in security costs from growing U.S. LNG shipments may require a review of associated recovery mechanisms. S. 1594 proposes a security cost-sharing plan to assist the USCG in securing LNG tankers. H.R. 2830 would enforce LNG facility security plans and require the Coast Guard to certify adequate security resources before approving new terminal plans. The Commandant of the Coast Guard opposes the requirement for the Coast Guard to provide LNG tanker security in H.R. 2830. The Commandant of the Coast Guard opposes the requirement in H.R. 2830 for the Coast Guard to provide LNG tanker security, citing concerns about flexibility, balancing risks, and distribution of security burden. President Bush has threatened to veto the bill due to these provisions, but it passed the House with a large margin. The bill has yet to pass in the Senate. The likelihood of a terrorist attack on U.S. LNG infrastructure has been debated since 9/11, with no attacks on LNG tankers or facilities to date. However, gas and oil facilities have been targeted internationally, such as the French oil tanker Limburg in 2002 and warnings of Al Qaeda attacks on energy facilities in Texas in 2003. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has identified LNG infrastructure as a potential terrorist target, with suspicions of possible associations between stowaways on LNG tankers and terrorist plots. The risks associated with LNG shipments are real, according to a 2004 report by Sandia National Laboratories. The 2004 report by Sandia National Laboratories highlighted potential terrorist threats to LNG tankers, including ramming, explosives, hijacking, and external attacks. While some experts believe the concern is overstated, industry representatives acknowledge the theoretical possibility of a deliberate LNG catastrophe for harming people. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and experts believe LNG facilities are secure compared to other hazardous infrastructures. FERC notes the difficulty in estimating the probability of a terrorist attack on LNG facilities. Former CIA Director James Woolsey believes a terrorist attack on LNG is possible. Former CIA Director James Woolsey and LNG terminal operators believe a terrorist attack on an LNG tanker in U.S. waters is unlikely due to limited potential impacts compared to other targets. The Coast Guard stated in a 2006 evaluation that there were no specific credible threats against proposed LNG facilities, but noted the dynamic threat environment. Policy makers and community leaders must use their judgment to determine if security measures for LNG facilities adequately protect the public. S. 1594 aims to enhance federal protection for LNG vessels and infrastructure, including new international standards, safety and security assistance for foreign ports, and incident response plans. Concerns exist about the security oversight of foreign-flagged LNG tankers compared to U.S. vessels. Some stakeholders advocate for using U.S. crews in LNG terminal operations to address these concerns. The U.S. Coast Guard officials have stated that existing security provisions for foreign-flagged LNG tankers are on par with potential U.S. counterparts, aligning with the International Ship and Port Facility Security (ISPS) Code. Vessels, including LNG tankers, must have an International Ship Security Certificate (ISSC) under the ISPS Code, requiring a threat-scalable security plan for access control, cargo handling, surveillance, and monitoring. The U.S. Coast Guard enforces security measures for cargo handling and delivery of ships stores, surveillance, and monitoring. A Ship Security Officer ensures compliance with the ship's security plan. Questions have been raised about preferential treatment of U.S. LNG tankers, potentially impacting free trade principles. Federal efforts to promote U.S. flags and crews on LNG tankers may require careful consideration of benefits and costs due to potential maritime treaty and trade implications. The growing U.S. LNG industry poses economic benefits but also risks. The U.S. LNG industry is growing quickly, offering economic benefits but also posing risks due to potential terrorist threats. Security measures have been implemented to safeguard LNG infrastructure, reducing vulnerability to terrorism. The debate on LNG infrastructure security in the United States has been contentious, with local officials and community groups challenging proposals. Local officials and community groups have opposed LNG infrastructure proposals due to safety concerns, making it challenging to locate new terminals near gas markets. Despite the scrutiny, industry and government expect approval for enough new LNG infrastructure to meet long-term U.S. import needs. Several new U.S. import terminals have been approved, with more awaiting federal authorization. Alongside expansions in existing U.S. terminals and new facilities in Canada and Mexico, the approved U.S. terminals will satisfy most of the country's LNG demand for the next two decades. The construction of new LNG terminals in the U.S. may not be ideally located for cost efficiency, but it is better to build them in these locations than not at all. Despite public scrutiny, the safety of new LNG terminals and tanker operations is expected to be higher, reducing the likelihood of challenges during construction. The added costs of building more secure terminals farther from markets may reflect the public's willingness to pay for LNG security. The public's willingness to pay for LNG security is evident in the continued private investments in U.S. LNG terminals. Congress may need to assess the costs and resource requirements of LNG security, especially with increasing imports. It should ensure appropriate funding, balance security needs with evolving risks, and ensure the industry bears its security burden. Improved understanding of LNG security risks could help avoid costly blanket investments. Congress may need to focus security spending on more refined terror threat information to protect critical infrastructure, including U.S.-flagged LNG tankers. Coordination among various groups is essential for effective U.S. LNG security, with oversight challenges for Congress in ensuring common security goals are met."
