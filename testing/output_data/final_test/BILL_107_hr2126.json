The Congress finds a serious decline in U.S. university nuclear science and engineering programs, with a low supply of personnel and a decrease in degree programs. Universities struggle to support research and training reactors, with a significant decline in the number of reactors since 1980. This neglect in human investment and training is concerning. The neglect in human investment and training infrastructure is impacting national R&D investment. The decline in a competent nuclear workforce and lack of trained scientists/engineers will hinder the US in solving waste storage issues, operating fission reactors, responding to nuclear events globally, preventing nuclear weapon proliferation, and operating naval nuclear reactors. Future neglect in human resources for nuclear sciences will lead to a decline in nuclear science departments, aging faculties, and closing training reactors, diminishing the appeal of nuclear science to future students. The Department of Energy's Office of Nuclear Energy, Science and Technology is urgently needed to address the impending retirement of 50% of the industry's nuclear workforce and 76% of the national labs' workforce in the next 5-15 years. They play a crucial role in maintaining human resources and training investments in nuclear sciences for the United States. The Office of Nuclear Energy, Science, and Technology funds various programs for nuclear science and engineering research, including basic nuclear science, collaborative research on fuel cycles and fission power systems, refueling training reactors, instrumentation upgrades, and student fellowships. The Department of Energy funds programs for nuclear science and engineering research, including basic nuclear science, collaborative research on fuel cycles and fission power systems, refueling training reactors, instrumentation upgrades, and student fellowships. The Secretary of Energy, through the Office of Nuclear Energy, Science and Technology, will support a program to maintain the nation's human resource investment and infrastructure in nuclear sciences and engineering. This includes developing fellowship programs for students, assisting universities in faculty recruitment, and maintaining investments in fundamental nuclear research. The Nuclear Engineering Education Research Program will maintain investment in fundamental nuclear sciences and engineering. Collaborative nuclear research between industry, national laboratories, and universities will be encouraged through the Nuclear Energy Research Initiative. Funds will be allocated for research reactor infrastructure maintenance, including refueling with low enriched fuels and upgrading operational instrumentation. The Nuclear Engineering Education Research Program supports collaboration between universities and the U.S. nuclear industry for re-licensing and upgrading training reactors. It also includes a reactor research and training award program. The Secretary of Energy will develop a sabbatical fellowship program and a visiting scientist program for university professors and laboratory staff in nuclear science and technology. The Secretary may provide fellowships for students to spend time at Department of Energy laboratories in nuclear science. Research programs may supplement operation of research reactor with cost sharing. All financial assistance awards require independent merit review. Authorization of appropriations for Department of Energy programs. Authorization of appropriations for Department of Energy programs includes specific sums authorized for fiscal years 2002 to 2006 for various purposes such as graduate and undergraduate fellowships and junior faculty research initiation grants. Authorization of appropriations for Department of Energy programs includes specific sums authorized for fiscal years 2002 to 2006 for nuclear engineering and education research, as well as communication and outreach related to nuclear science and engineering. Authorization of appropriations for Department of Energy programs includes specific sums authorized for fiscal years 2002 to 2006 for refueling of research reactors, instrumentation upgrades, and re-licensing assistance. The allocated funds range from $200,000 to $8,000,000 for various activities outlined in the sections. Authorization of appropriations for Department of Energy programs includes specific sums authorized for fiscal years 2002 to 2006 for reactor research and training awards, totaling $6,000,000 to $20,000,000, and for University-DOE laboratory interactions, totaling $1,000,000 to $1,200,000. The authorization of appropriations for Department of Energy programs includes specific sums authorized for fiscal years 2003 to 2006 for reactor research and training awards, totaling $1,100,000 to $1,300,000 annually."
