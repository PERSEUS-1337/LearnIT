    "content": "The \"Ethanol Energy Promotion Act of 2001\" prohibits the use of MTBE as a fuel additive and repeals the waiver of oxygen content requirement. Additionally, it provides credits for exceeding reduction in carbon monoxide and volatility requirements. Section 211(k)(7) of the Clean Air Act is amended to allow for credits for gasoline with higher oxygen content, which can offset Reid Vapor Pressure levels requirements. The Clean Air Act allows credits for gasoline with higher oxygen content to offset Reid Vapor Pressure levels requirements, ensuring that the ozone forming potential of the gasoline does not exceed that of other compliant gasoline. The Clean Air Act now requires federal vehicles to be certified clean fuel vehicles capable of using ethanol and using ethanol whenever economically feasible. Additionally, a small ethanol producer credit is introduced. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to allow cooperative organizations to allocate a portion of the small ethanol producer credit to their patrons based on quantity or other criteria. Cooperative organizations can allocate a portion of the small ethanol producer credit to patrons based on business done with them for the taxable year. The election for this allocation must be made on a timely filed return and is irrevocable for that year. The credit apportioned to patrons is not included in the organization's taxable income but is included in the patrons' income. The small ethanol producer credit can be allocated to patrons by cooperative organizations based on business done with them for the taxable year. This allocation is included in the patrons' gross income as provided in section 87. If the credit amount for a taxable year is less than initially reported, special rules apply. The cooperative organization's credit shown on the return for the year will be reduced by the excess not apportioned to patrons, resulting in an increase in tax. This increase is not considered tax for credit determination purposes. Definition of small ethanol producer and improvements to the credit are also outlined. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to increase the eligible small ethanol producer limit from $30,000,000 to $60,000,000. The small ethanol producer credit is not considered a passive activity credit. The credit can now be applied against minimum tax. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to increase the eligible small ethanol producer limit from $30,000,000 to $60,000,000. Special rules for the small ethanol producer credit are outlined, including separate application of the credit under sections 39 and the limitation under paragraph (1). The small ethanol producer credit is defined as the credit allowable under subsection (a) by reason of section 40(a)(3). It is not added back to income under section 87 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Section 87 of the Internal Revenue Code is being amended regarding the income inclusion of alcohol fuel credit. Section 87 of the Internal Revenue Code is being amended to include the alcohol fuel credit in gross income for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2001. This includes the alcohol mixture credit and the alcohol credit determined for the taxpayer. Additionally, a conforming amendment is made to Section 1388 for the apportionment of the alcohol fuels credit between cooperative organizations and their patrons."
