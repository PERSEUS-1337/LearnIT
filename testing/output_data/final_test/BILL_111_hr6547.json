    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Protecting Students from Sexual and Violent Predators Act\" and includes amendments regarding background checks in the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. The \"Protecting Students from Sexual and Violent Predators Act\" mandates that each State receiving funds must conduct criminal background checks for school employees, including searches of state criminal registries, child abuse registries, the National Crime Information Center, and FBI fingerprint checks. The \"Protecting Students from Sexual and Violent Predators Act\" requires criminal background checks for school employees, including FBI fingerprint checks and searches of the National Sex Offender Registry. Individuals who refuse consent, provide false information, or have felony convictions related to homicide or child abuse cannot be employed as school employees. The \"Protecting Students from Sexual and Violent Predators Act\" mandates criminal background checks for school employees, including checks for crimes like child abuse, child pornography, spousal abuse, rape, kidnapping, arson, assault, battery, and drug offenses committed within the past 5 years. Additionally, individuals convicted of violent or sexual crimes against minors are prohibited from being employed in schools. The section mandates periodic criminal background checks for school employees and provides a process for employees to appeal the results of the background check if they believe it is inaccurate or incomplete. The appeal process does not allow the employee to work during the appeal. The section defines \"school employee\" as someone with job duties that involve exposure to students, whether employed by an educational agency or a third-party entity providing services to schools. It also defines \"sexual predator\" as a specific type of individual. The term 'sexual predator' is defined as a person 18 years or older convicted of a sexual offense against a minor. Section 2 of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 was amended to include a new section 9537 for background checks. This amendment was passed by the House of Representatives on December 21, 2010."
