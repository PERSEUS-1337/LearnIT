    "content": "The report provides background information on the Navy's Arleigh Burke (DDG-51) and Zumwalt (DDG-1000) class destroyer programs, highlighting potential oversight issues for Congress. The Navy's FY2020 budget requests funding for three DDG-51s, with decisions impacting Navy capabilities, funding requirements, and the U.S. shipbuilding industrial base. The evolution of Navy cruiser and destroyer designs over the years is also discussed. Since the 1980s, Navy cruisers and destroyers have shown substantial overlap in size and capability, leading to the Navy now collectively referring to them as large surface combatants (LSCs). This distinction separates them from small surface combatants (SSCs) like frigates, Littoral Combat Ships (LCSs), mine warfare ships, and patrol craft. The Navy aims to achieve and maintain a fleet of 355 ships, including 104 LSCs, with 88 LSCs in its force by the end of FY2018. The Navy aims to achieve a force of 104 large surface combatants by FY2029, including 88 ships such as Ticonderoga class cruisers and Arleigh Burke class destroyers equipped with the Aegis combat system for air defense and blue-water operations. The DDG-51 program began in the late 1970s, and existing ships are being modified for ballistic missile defense capability. The DDG-51 program, including some CG-47s, is being modified for ballistic missile defense operations. A total of 82 DDG-51 ships have been procured through FY2019, making it one of the largest Navy shipbuilding programs since World War II. The design has evolved from Flight I/II to Flight IIA DDG-51s, with changes like adding a helicopter hangar. The Navy shifted DDG-51 procurement to the Flight III design in FY2017, incorporating the new AMDR radar. Congress granted authority for a multiyear procurement contract for DDG-51s planned for FY2018-FY2022, the fourth MYP contract for the program. DDG-51s are built by General Dynamics/Bath Iron Works. The Navy is modernizing its existing DDG-51s to extend their service lives to 45 years, allowing for a total of 355 ships by 2034. Lockheed and Raytheon provide radar systems for the Aegis system on DDG-51s. The Navy plans to have a total of 355 ships by 2034, 20 years earlier than previously planned. The fleet in the 2030s will have more destroyers but fewer attack submarines and aircraft carriers. The Navy is not procuring any more DDG-1000 class destroyers and is requesting funding to complete the procurement cost for the three existing ships. The DDG-1000 is a multi-mission destroyer designed for naval surface fire support and littoral operations. The DDG-1000 class destroyers were designed with Advanced Gun Systems (AGSs) to fire Long-Range Land-Attack Projectiles (LRLAP). However, due to rising costs, the Navy stopped procuring LRLAP projectiles in 2016. They are now exploring cheaper alternatives for the AGSs. No replacement munition has been announced yet. The mission orientation of the DDG-1000s is shifting from NSFS to surface strike, focusing on using missiles to attack surface ships and land targets. The mix of missiles in the VLS tubes may now emphasize anti-ship and land-attack cruise missiles. The AGSs on each DDG-1000 are currently dormant as the Navy decides whether to procure a replacement munition or pursue another option. Lockheed Martin and Raytheon are key players in Navy surface combatant radar and combat system integration. GD/BIW and HII/Ingalls have a history of building Navy surface combatants, with most of their recent work focused on these ships. Navy surface combatants are maintained and modernized at various U.S. shipyards. The DDG-1000 program may replace AGSs with additional VLS tubes for missiles. Lockheed and Raytheon are key contractors for Navy surface combat systems. Raytheon was selected to make the AMDR for the Flight III DDG-51. The Navy's shipbuilding supplier firms' financial health has been a concern, as they are crucial for Navy surface combatant production. The Navy's proposed FY2020 budget includes $5,323.3 million for the procurement of three DDG-51s, with additional funding for future DDG-51s in FY2021 and FY2022. Lockheed and Raytheon are key contractors for Navy surface combat systems, with Raytheon selected to make the AMDR for the Flight III DDG-51. The financial health of the Navy's shipbuilding supplier firms is a concern for production of Navy surface combatants. The Navy's proposed FY2020 budget includes funding for the procurement of three DDG-1000 class ships, with a request for additional procurement funding. Congress is tasked with deciding whether to approve, reject, or modify the funding requests for the DDG-51 and DDG-1000 programs, considering cost, technical, and schedule risks. An oversight issue for Congress is the accuracy of the Navy's pricing for the proposed work. The Navy plans to modify the design of the DDG-51 Flight IIA destroyer to create a Flight III configuration with the new Air and Missile Defense Radar (AMDR). This modification will require increased electrical power and cooling capacity, leading to an estimated average cost of $1.8 billion per ship, 15% higher than the Navy's estimate. The Navy completed Flight III detail design activities in December 2017, incorporating the AMDR program's SPY-6 radar with significant changes to the ship's systems. The Navy plans to field mature critical technologies on other ships before integration with Flight III to reduce technical risk. Software-related deficiencies affecting SPY-6 have caused delays in radar array delivery. Software-related deficiencies have delayed the delivery of the SPY-6 radar array for integration testing with the Aegis combat system by at least 1 year. Despite the delays, the Navy plans to complete testing, install the radar on the ship, and activate the combat system for shipboard testing by January 2022. The Navy expects to finalize a draft test and evaluation master plan for Flight III by early 2022. There is ongoing disagreement between the Navy and the Director, Operational Test and Evaluation on the necessity of using a self-defense test ship equipped with Aegis and SPY-6 radar for performance validation during operational test and evaluation. Since 1985, 67 DDG 51 class ships have been delivered, with ongoing production. The AMDR program's technology maturity and design stability are in question, with critical testing scheduled for 2023 on a DDG 51 Flight III ship to ensure design stability. Testing delays have impacted the integration of the SPY-6 radar array with the Aegis combat system, with disagreements on the necessity of using a self-defense test ship for validation during operational testing. The program office tested a full-scale radar array at the Navy's Pacific Missile Range Facility, completing several successful tests but facing a failure in a ballistic missile test due to a software issue. The array's performance was verified through a successful retest in January 2019, with additional testing scheduled for 2019. The Navy has revised the acquisition schedule for Aegis combat system equipment testing, with software development completed for core radar capabilities. Further radar updates and software development are ongoing to integrate AMDR with the Aegis combat system. Testing will occur at a land-based site before installation on the lead ship for final integration and testing. The Aegis combat system is still undergoing production readiness challenges, with delays and cost growth reported for low-rate production units. Issues with a digital receiver component are causing delays in the delivery of the first production radar. The contractor delivery of the first production radar for the AMDR program is at risk of being delayed from December 2019 to April 2020. The Navy plans to procure most of its 22 radars before completing operational testing, which may lead to retrofitting and increased costs. The AMDR Test and Evaluation Master Plan has not been approved yet, posing challenges for the program. The Navy's test approach for the AMDR and DDG 51 Flight III programs lacks realistic operational conditions without an AMDR-equipped test ship. The program is revising its operational test strategy to include AMDR requirements and updated simulation tactics. The self-defense and survivability capabilities of DDG 51 Flight III will only be fully understood after operational testing is completed. The program office disagrees with the assessment of technology maturity, arguing that combat system testing is unnecessary for mature radar technologies. The Navy's test approach for the AMDR and DDG 51 Flight III programs lacks realistic operational conditions without an AMDR-equipped test ship. Concerns for Congress include the potential impact on the DDG-51 program of a possible change in the surface force architecture towards a smaller proportion of large surface combatants and a larger proportion of small surface combatants. The Navy is conducting a new Force Structure Analysis to reassess its fleet composition. The Navy is reassessing its fleet composition with a potential new surface force architecture that may include a larger proportion of small surface combatants and unmanned surface vehicles. This shift could lead to a planned force mix with twice as many small surface combatants as large ones, along with a new third tier of USVs. The Navy's current 355-ship goal calls for twice as many large surface combatants as small ones, but the new architecture could change this ratio. A press report from January 15, 2019, suggests that the Navy is taking steps towards a different future that could revolutionize how the fleet operates. The Navy is considering a new surface force architecture that may involve more small surface combatants and unmanned surface vehicles. Rear Adm. Ronald Boxall mentioned a need for 104 large surface combatants and 52 small ones, indicating a shift towards smaller platforms. The upcoming construction of the FFG(X) frigate is exceeding expectations in terms of lethality for small combatants. This potential change in fleet composition could reshape how the Navy operates. The Navy is considering a new surface force architecture with more small surface combatants and unmanned vehicles. The FSA may recommend more frigates over destroyers, leading to a healthier mix of small and large surface combatants in the fleet. This shift aims to modernize the Navy's fleet composition for better balance and capability. The Navy is considering a new surface force architecture with more small surface combatants and unmanned vehicles. The potential oversight issue for Congress in FY2019 concerns the Navy's plan to shift the mission orientation of the DDG-1000s from NSFS to surface strike. Congress may inquire about the analytical basis for this shift, potential costs, and cost-effectiveness of operating DDG-1000s with an emphasis on surface strike. Additionally, questions may arise about the decision to procure a replacement munition for the ships' AGSs or pursue alternative options. The DDG-1000 program was initiated in the early 1990s with a focus on naval surface fire support (NSFS) and littoral operations. Congress is considering shifting the mission orientation of the DDG-1000s to surface strike, raising questions about costs and cost-effectiveness. Additional background information on the program is provided in Table 1 summarizing congressional action on Navy's FY2020 procurement funding requests. The DDG-1000 program was initially focused on naval surface fire support and littoral operations. It was designed to replace the Navy's large-caliber naval gun fire capability lost with the retirement of the Iowa-class battleships. The ship has a reduced crew size of 175 sailors and incorporates new technologies like an integrated electric-drive propulsion system. The DDG-1000 was also meant to be the basis for a planned cruiser called CG(X), which was later canceled. The DDG-1000 design includes an integrated electric-drive propulsion system and automation technologies for a reduced crew size. It is larger than the Navy's current Aegis cruisers and destroyers, with estimated procurement costs of $9,242.3 million for the first two ships and $3,789.9 million for the third. The first DDG-1000 was commissioned in October 2016. The delivery dates for the DDG-1000 program were revised multiple times in the Navy's budget submissions, leading to a ship being commissioned into service more than two years before its delivery date. The program originated in 2001 as a replacement for the DD-21 program, aiming to develop three new classes of surface combatants. The Navy's DDG-1000 program includes a destroyer, cruiser, and littoral combat ship. The first ship in the class is named Zumwalt after Admiral Elmo R. Zumwalt. The DDG-1000 incorporates new technologies for reduced detectability. The DDG-1000 program includes new technologies such as a wave-piercing hull design, composite materials for the superstructure, electric-drive propulsion, total-ship computing system, automation technologies for a reduced crew, dual-band radar, new vertical launch system, and a new 155mm gun. Shipbuilders and Combat System Prime Contractor GD/BIW are involved in the construction, with Raytheon as the prime contractor for the combat system. The DDG-1000 acquisition strategy involved building the first ship by HII/Ingalls and the second by GD/BIW. A proposal for a winner-take-all competition was deferred by USD AT&L in 2005, with Congress expressing opposition. The Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act for 2005 prohibited a winner-take-all competition for the DDG-1000 program. The Navy shifted to a \"dual-lead-ship\" acquisition strategy, requiring two ships to be built by different shipyards. Congress continued to prohibit a winner-take-all strategy in subsequent defense authorization acts. The USD AT&L granted Milestone B approval for the DDG-1000 program on November 23, 2005, allowing it to enter the System Development and Demonstration phase. The Navy's dual-lead-ship acquisition strategy was approved, with a low rate initial production quantity of eight ships. Contract modifications were awarded to GD/BIW and HII/Ingalls on February 14, 2008, for the construction of the two lead ships under cost plus incentive fee contracts. The construction of the dual lead ships for the DDG-1000 program involved a series of decisions regarding final-assembly yards between HII/Ingalls and GD/BIW. Ultimately, an agreement was reached for GD/BIW to build all three ships, with HII/Ingalls receiving a greater share of new DDG-51s in exchange. The agreement was made for GD/BIW to build all three DDG-1000 ships, with HII/Ingalls continuing to make certain parts. The Navy's procurement plans for DDG-1000s were reduced over the years, with the final decision to build only three ships. The Navy decided to end procurement of DDG-1000s and resume procurement of DDG-51s due to a reevaluation of future operating needs, emphasizing open-ocean antisubmarine warfare, countering anti-ship cruise missiles, and countering ballistic missiles. The DDG-51 design was deemed more cost-effective and capable of fulfilling these missions. Congress approved the Navy's proposal to stop procuring DDG-1000s in the FY2010 budget. In FY2010, Congress approved ending DDG-1000 procurement and restarting DDG-51 procurement. The Navy's shift in destroyer procurement plans signaled the end of the post-Cold War era and a focus on mid-ocean operations against competitors like China and Russia. The estimated procurement cost for all three DDG-1000s increased. The procurement cost for all three DDG-1000s has increased by $4,218.4 million, or 47.0%, since the FY2009 budget. This cost growth was due to the truncation of the DDG-1000 program from seven ships to three, reallocating costs to the remaining ships. The Navy's cost estimate for the program shifted towards a higher estimate developed by the Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation office. The Navy funded the DDG-1000 program to CAPE's higher cost estimate for FY2011-FY2015 and their own estimate for FY2016 and beyond due to a Nunn-McCurdy cost breach. The program was still 3% below the starting point for a new breach as of the FY2015 budget submission. The procurement cost for the fifth DDG-1000 was limited to $2.3 billion by the FY2006 defense authorization act. The Navy notified Congress of a critical cost breach in the DDG-1000 program under the Nunn-McCurdy provision, leading to program restructuring and milestone recertification. The program's procurement cost for the fifth DDG-1000 was capped at $2.3 billion, but with the truncation of the program to three ships, this cost cap became irrelevant. The Navy notified Congress of a critical cost breach in the DDG-1000 program under the Nunn-McCurdy provision, leading to program restructuring and milestone recertification. DOD must certify that the program is essential to national security and has no alternatives at lower cost for it to continue. Truncating the program to three ships increased the average research and development costs per ship to $3.1 billion, impacting the program acquisition unit cost. In response to a critical cost breach in the DDG-1000 program, Ashton Carter restructured the program and issued the necessary certifications under the Nunn-McCurdy provision. The restructuring included changes to the ship's design affecting its primary radar, a shift in the Initial Operational Capability timeline, and revisions to testing and evaluation requirements. The DDG-1000 program was originally planned to have a dual-band radar with Raytheon's X-band SPY-3 multifunction radar and Lockheed's S-band SPY-4 Volume Search Radar. However, due to program restructuring, the ship will now be equipped with an upgraded multifunction radar only, eliminating the Volume Search Radar. The Navy identified the removal of the Volume Search Radar as a cost-saving opportunity. The SPY-3 Multi-Function Radar (MFR) on DDG 1000 will undergo modifications to focus on meeting ship Key Performance Parameters. Ship operators can optimize the radar for horizon or volume search, with limited horizon search capability without the Volume Search Radar (VSR). The removal of VSR will save $300 million, offsetting program cost increase. The MFR software modification for volume search will cost less than procuring VSR. The Navy determined that eliminating the SPY-4 VSR from the DDG-1000 increased integration costs for the dual-band radar on aircraft carriers by $54 million. This reduced the net total cost savings to about $246 million. The program manager stated that the S-band radar is not needed for the DDG-1000 and operational requirements can be met with the X-band radar with software modifications. The PAUC for the DDG-1000 program increased by 86%, triggering the Nunn-McCurdy critical. The PAUC for the DDG-1000 program increased by 86%, leading to a Nunn-McCurdy critical cost breach. The program was truncated to three ships, accounting for 79 of the 86 percentage points increase. The remaining seven percentage points were due to development cost increases. Funding for the program was directed to align with the Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation (CAPE) office's estimate for FY2011-FY2015 and the Navy's estimate for FY2016 and beyond. The cost estimate for the DDG-1000 program is higher than the Navy's estimate. Funding for the program will align with the CAPE estimate for FY2011-FY2015, leading to an increase in costs. The DOD plans to address the funding shortfall through reprogramming actions. The PAUC for the program is $7.4 billion per ship, with an APUC of $4.3 billion per ship. The cost estimate for the DDG-1000 program is higher than the Navy's estimate, with a total cost of $12.8 billion for all three ships. The CAPE believes there is a 50% chance the program will be completed within this cost estimate. The DOD reinstated the program's Milestone B certification in October 2010, authorizing production of all three ships. The May 2019 GAO report on the DDG-1000 program stated that most critical technologies are matured, with some still approaching maturity. The Navy expects full maturity as ship construction progresses over the next 2 years. The Navy's advanced gun system, including the projectile and gun, is costly and essential for precision fires and offensive operations. Despite evaluating other munition options, no viable replacement was found, leaving the guns inoperable on ships. The Navy will use a modified radar in place of a volume search radar. Design instability in the DDG 1000 program since 2009 has led to significant cost increases and schedule delays. Development and testing of technologies continue, with potential for further delays. The Navy's DDG 1000 program faces design instability, cost increases, and schedule delays. Development and testing of technologies continue, potentially disrupting the Navy's claimed design stability. Shipbuilder delivery of the lead ship's HM&E was delayed due to electrical work issues. Production readiness for the class is ongoing, with completion expected in September 2020. Cyber security evaluations and certifications are also scheduled for completion. The shipbuilder faced problems with the power system for DDG 1001, leading to engine damage and replacement by the Navy. DDG 1000's final delivery is scheduled for May 2019, with DDG 1001 to follow in September 2020. Serious deficiencies identified by the Board of Inspection and Survey are still being corrected on both ships. The Navy encountered serious deficiencies in the HM&E of DDG 1000 and DDG 1001, leading to potential delays in fleet readiness. To address construction delays, parts from DDG 1002 are being used, with uncertain impacts on its schedule. DDG 1000's mission was changed to offensive surface strike in January 2018. The Navy is transitioning DDG 1000's mission to offensive surface strike, with plans to evaluate future mission sets. The Navy anticipates spending about $1 billion on modifications for this new mission. Progress is being made on delivering the Zumwalt class ships, with DDG 1000 completing combat systems availability and final delivery scheduled for September 2019. DDG 1001 has started combat systems availability, and DDG 1002 is 84 percent complete. DDG 1001 began combat systems availability in April 2019, and DDG 1002 is 84 percent constructed. Future systems added to Zumwalt-class ships will enhance offensive capabilities."
