    "content": "The Act titled \"Deepwater Offshore Wind Incentive Act\" provides a production credit for energy generated from deep water offshore wind under section 45R of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The Deepwater Offshore Wind Incentive Act offers a production credit for electricity generated from deep water offshore wind facilities. The credit is based on the kilowatt hours of electricity produced and sold by the taxpayer during a 10-year period. There is a national limitation on the amount of credit allowed for each facility based on the national megawatt capacity limitation. The national megawatt capacity limitation allocated to offshore wind facilities must not exceed 6,000 megawatts. The allocation prioritizes facilities that will be operational sooner, with the first 5,000 megawatts given preference. The Secretary will allocate the remaining megawatts based on facility technology. Regulations for this process must be established within 6 months. A deep water offshore wind facility is defined as owned by the taxpayer. A 'facility' refers to a wind facility owned by the taxpayer, using wind to generate electricity in deep waters within US waters, placed in service between enactment and January 1, 2030.
