FINDINGS.\" Summarized chunk:\nThe Congress finds that in 2005, the oil industry had significant revenues and profits, while multilateral development institutions provided billions in financing to the international oil and gas industry. Limited public resources should support the critical needs of developing countries, not the oil and gas industry. Providing financing to oil and gas operations overseas increases dependence on imported oil and gas, leading to poverty, economic inequality, poor governance, corruption, and conflict in developing countries. Countries rely on external debt for infrastructure in oil and gas projects, contributing to over one-third of global greenhouse gas emissions. Wealthy countries emit the majority of greenhouse gases, but the poorest nations will suffer the most from climate change. The World Bank Group recommended ending oil project financing by 2008 after evaluating their impact on poverty, local environments, and global climate. The Export-Import Bank is addressed in Section 2. The Export-Import Bank Act of 1945 is amended to prohibit financing for oil and gas projects. This includes a ban on guaranteeing, insuring, or extending credit for such projects or entities involved in them. The definition of an oil or gas project includes field development, processing facilities, pipelines, terminals, and other production or distribution operations.
