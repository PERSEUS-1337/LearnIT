    "content": "When a Senator introduces a bill or joint resolution, it is usually referred to a Senate committee for further consideration. Senate rules require that bills and resolutions have three readings before passage, with the third reading occurring before a vote on final passage. Bills and joint resolutions may be read twice on the same day for reference to committee. The Senate may use Senate Rule XIV to bypass referral of a bill or joint resolution to a committee and place it directly on the Senate Calendar of Business for consideration. This allows for the full Senate to consider the measure without delay or potential inaction from a committee. Senate Rule XIV allows for a bill or joint resolution to be placed directly on the Senate Calendar of Business for consideration, bypassing referral to a committee. This ensures that the measure is available for floor consideration without delay or potential inaction from a committee. Senate Rule XIV allows a bill or joint resolution to be placed directly on the Senate Calendar of Business for consideration, bypassing referral to a committee. This procedure is typically initiated by the majority leader or another Senator, preventing further committee referral. For example, S. 1035 was placed directly on the calendar following a request by Majority Leader McConnell. The Senate Rule XIV allows bills to be placed directly on the calendar for consideration, bypassing committee referral. Majority Leader McConnell requested S. 1035 to be placed on the calendar, leading to a second reading objection and further discussion on April 22. The bill (S. 1035) was read for the second time and placed on the Senate Calendar under Rule XIV after objection to further proceedings. It is now listed as Calendar Order No. 60 for floor consideration along with other measures. The Senate follows a procedure to have House-passed bills and joint resolutions placed directly on the Senate Calendar, sometimes by unanimous consent. This allows bills to bypass committees and be considered for floor action."
