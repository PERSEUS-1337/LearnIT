    "content": "Nicaragua is a Central American nation with a population of 5.4 million and a per capita income of $1,000. It is classified as a lower middle income developing country by the World Bank. The country's key challenge is to boost growth rates to reduce poverty, especially in rural areas. Nicaragua has a history of conflict and anti-democratic rule under the Somoza dictatorship until 1979. In 1979, the Somoza government in Nicaragua was overthrown by the leftist Sandinista National Liberation Front (FSLN) after a decade-long struggle with U.S.-backed counter-revolutionary forces. Since democratic elections in 1990, Nicaragua has implemented pro-market reforms and worked on building democratic institutions, but still faces challenges with corruption, poverty, and inequality. Daniel Ortega, a Sandinista leader, became President in 2007. On January 10, 2007, Sandinista leader Daniel Ortega was inaugurated as President of Nicaragua, despite winning only 37.9% of the vote in the November 2006 elections. Political tensions and disputes between leaders have hindered the consolidation of democracy in the country. Former President Arnoldo Alem\u00e1n and Daniel Ortega negotiated a power-sharing pact in 1998, influencing national politics. Nicaragua faces high levels of corruption, with concerns about the use of aid from Venezuela. Opposition leaders are urging transparency in the government's use of funds, particularly in the distribution of Venezuelan oil. The Sandinista party's influence over government entities, including the judiciary, poses a governance obstacle in Nicaragua. President Ortega and the FSLN must form alliances to pass legislation in the National Assembly. The PLC, previously aligned with the FSLN, broke ties and joined Eduardo Montealegre to challenge the ruling party in the 2008 municipal elections. In the November 2008 municipal elections in Nicaragua, the ruling FSLN and its allies will be challenged by the ALN. The country faces the challenge of boosting moderate growth rates and reducing poverty, with over two-thirds of the rural population living in poverty. Nicaragua is highly dependent on foreign aid and remittances. Nicaragua relies heavily on foreign aid and remittances, with remittances accounting for 17% of the country's GDP in 2006. The government has implemented a poverty reduction strategy and adopted a budget in line with IMF recommendations. President Ortega is expected to announce a development plan emphasizing sustainable agro-industrial development in mid-2008. Economic challenges in 2008 include the rising price of oil and the economic slowdown in the United States. President Ortega is working with the United States and the IMF to boost Nicaragua's long-term economic development prospects. He is also seeking aid from Iran and Venezuela for immediate needs, with Iran investing in ports, agriculture, and energy, and Venezuela co-financing infrastructure projects. Venezuela has pledged to build a $3.5 billion oil refinery and provide 10 million barrels of oil annually through the PetroCaribe program. Ortega shares an ideological affinity with President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez of Venezuela and other ALBA trade block countries. President Ortega maintains good relations with neighboring countries in Central America but is involved in a border dispute with Colombia. Despite tensions, the U.S.-Nicaraguan relationship remains intact, with Ortega oscillating between anti-U.S. rhetoric and reassurances of respecting private property and pursuing free-trade policies. In September 2007, Ortega criticized the United States as an \"imperialist global empire\" at the UN. Despite this rhetoric, Ortega has cooperated with the US by exchanging Soviet-made missiles for military and medical equipment. He also works with the IMF on poverty reduction and implements CAFTA-DR. The US provides foreign assistance to Nicaragua and they collaborate on counternarcotics, trade, and security. Additionally, the US granted Temporary Protected Status to Nicaraguan migrants after Hurricane Mitch in 1998 and extended it for eligible Nicaraguans after Hurricane Felix in 2007. The United States provided $50.2 million in foreign aid to Nicaragua in FY2006, $36.9 million in FY2007, and an estimated $28.6 million in FY2008 in response to Hurricane Felix. Additional assistance of $2 million in FY2008 and $38 million in FY2009 has been requested for Nicaragua, along with potential funds from the M\u00c3\u00a9rida Initiative. The FY2009 budget request includes $100 million in M\u00c3\u00a9rida Initiative funds for Central America, with increases in funds for security reform, combating transnational crime, democracy programs, and trade capacity building for Nicaragua under CAFTA-DR. Nicaragua also benefits from the Millennium Challenge Account (MCA) for promoting democracy and sustainable economic growth, with a $175 million compact signed in 2005 for rural development projects in Le\u00c3\u00b3n and Chinandega. Projects in Nicaragua aim to promote investment, strengthen property rights, assist farmers and rural businesses, and improve road infrastructure to reduce transportation costs. The United States supports democracy programs to reform government institutions, combat corruption, and promote the rule of law, providing $13 million for the 2006 elections and ongoing assistance for local government capacity and transparency. John Danilovich of the Millennium Challenge Corporation believes in collaboration between the United States and Nicaragua to combat poverty. The State Department's human rights report on Nicaragua highlighted concerns about respect for human rights, including unlawful killings by police, harsh prison conditions, arbitrary arrests, and corruption in government entities. Human rights issues in Nicaragua also include child labor and violations of worker rights in free trade zones. Human Rights Watch criticized Nicaragua's ban on all abortions, even in cases where the mother's life is at risk. The State Department's report on Nicaragua highlighted concerns about human rights violations, including unlawful killings by police, harsh prison conditions, and corruption. Nicaragua is a key transshipment point for drugs from South America to the United States, with increased trafficking on the Pacific Coast since 2006. Law enforcement efforts led to significant drug seizures and arrests in 2007, but corruption remains a challenge in counterdrug efforts. Nicaragua has requested more assistance from the United States to combat drug gangs. The FY2009 budget includes increased counternarcotics aid for Nicaragua. The country approved CAFTA-DR in 2005 and attracted textile investors due to low wage costs. Foreign Direct Investment in Nicaragua rose to $282 million in 2006, a significant increase from the previous year. Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in Nicaragua increased to $335 million in 2007, with exports to the United States reaching $1.6 billion. Nicaraguan imports from the U.S. also rose, including machinery, grains, fuel oil, and pharmaceuticals. Property claims by U.S. citizens have been a contentious issue in bilateral relations since the 1980s. The Nicaraguan government has settled many property claims through compensation, including those of 4,500 U.S. citizens. Less than 700 claims remain unresolved, but the Ortega government's commitment to processing them was recognized with a waiver renewal in 2007 allowing Nicaragua to receive U.S. foreign assistance despite past expropriations."
