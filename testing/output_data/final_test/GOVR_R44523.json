    "content": "Congress has shown interest in hydropower regulation and development, including discussions with various stakeholders. The 114th Congress passed energy bills with provisions that could significantly impact hydropower regulation, potentially changing parts of the licensing process. This report analyzes the hydropower provisions in the North American Energy Security. The North American Energy Security and Infrastructure Act of 2016 and the Energy Policy Modernization Act of 2016 aim to modify regulation and development processes for nonfederal hydropower projects, establishing explicit timelines for project licensing. The North American Energy Security and Infrastructure Act of 2016 and the Energy Policy Modernization Act of 2016 aim to modify regulation and development processes for nonfederal hydropower projects, establishing explicit timelines for project licensing. The bills propose appointing the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) as the lead agency for nonfederal hydropower facility regulation and require more robust data on hydropower projects to be made publicly available. Differences in the bills include extending the construction start date for projects, with the Senate version allowing an eight-year extension while the House version does not address this. The House version of S. 2012 addresses hydropower regulation and development, including specific timelines for project licensing. It focuses on extending construction timelines for certain projects and does not require licenses and preliminary extensions for pumped storage projects like the Senate version. The House version also modifies the regulation process for seven specific projects. The House version of S. 2012, under Title VIII, Sections 8001-8006, focuses on construction timelines for specific projects and license criteria. Section 1201 of S. 2012 would add considerations for minimizing infringement of property rights when issuing hydropower licenses. Section 1201 of S. 2012 aims to minimize infringement of property rights for nonlicensees when issuing hydropower licenses, adding a private landownership condition to address this concern. Section 1202 of S. 2012 in the House version modifies aspects of a specific project's license, while Section 1203 designates FERC as the lead agency for coordinating nonfederal hydropower project licensing and complying with NEPA. The National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) would be formalized by the proposed legislation, designating FERC as the lead agency for coordinating nonfederal hydropower project licensing. Section 1203 establishes deadlines for FERC and other parties involved in the federal authorization process, requiring early identification and communication of any issues that may delay or prevent authorization. Section 1203 of the proposed legislation designates FERC as the lead agency for coordinating nonfederal hydropower project licensing. It establishes deadlines for resolving issues that may delay authorization, allows applicants to pay a third-party contractor for assistance, and requires FERC to maintain a consolidated record of all decisions. Section 1204 of the proposed legislation focuses on the delay of a federal authorization, requiring agencies or tribes to file for an extension in court if they cannot meet FERC's deadline. The court may grant an extension if certain conditions are met, setting a new schedule if approved. Section 1205 of S. 2012, as engrossed in the House, would require FERC to compile a list of best practices and studies to support federal authorization proceedings. Section 1206 of S. 2012, as engrossed in the House, would require FERC to establish a basin-wide or regional review program for projects with multiple applicants and commission environmental studies. It also includes a new section for closed-loop pumped storage projects, mandating FERC to issue and amend licenses and permits for such projects. Section 1207 of S. 2012, as engrossed in the House, focuses on licenses and permits for closed-loop pumped storage projects. FERC would assess safety before issuing a license, with limited authority to impose conditions for public safety and wildlife protection. The section also allows for joint permittees and license transfers to nonmunicipal entities. Section 1207 of S. 2012 introduces improvements to hydroelectric project licensing and dam safety by allowing FERC to approve license amendments for project upgrades. FERC has specific timelines for making determinations and soliciting comments from various agencies and tribes. Final action on the application must be taken within 150 days, with conditions imposed relating to public safety protection. The proposed license amendment must relate to public safety and fish and wildlife protection. FERC would need to issue rules defining qualifying project upgrades and criteria, as well as establish new standards for license amendment applications. The Senate version of S. 2012 does not include similar language. Section 1208 of S. 2012 would add a new section to the FPA allowing FERC to issue exemptions for hydropower development at existing nonpowered dams. FERC would consult with agencies and tribes, impose conditions related to safety and wildlife protection, and not alter dam operations. Environmental review would be limited to an assessment unless FERC decides otherwise. The exemption for hydropower development at existing nonpowered dams under S. 2012 would involve limited environmental assessment, with the possibility of meeting NEPA obligations through categorical exclusion. Exemptees would pay annual charges to the United States, with proceeds going to the Treasury. The House-engrossed version of S. 2012 includes sections modifying aspects of project licenses, particularly focusing on construction timelines for specific projects. The Senate version of S. 2012 addresses hydropower in 11 sections, with a focus on construction timelines and compensation for pumped storage hydropower projects. The Senate version of S. 2012 addresses hydropower in 11 sections, focusing on construction timelines for specific projects and compensation for pumped storage hydropower projects. Section 3001 contains wide-ranging hydropower initiatives and emphasizes hydropower as a renewable and essential energy source. The Senate version of S. 2012 emphasizes hydropower as a renewable and essential energy source, proposing to increase federal purchase requirements for renewable energy starting in FY2016. The House version does not have comparable language regarding this modification. The House version of S. 2012 would modify the definition of renewable energy in Section 203(b) of EPAct05 to include all hydropower. Additionally, it would allow FERC to determine necessary investigations and data collection under Section 4(e) of the FPA. Section 3001 of S. 2012 proposes modifications to the Federal Power Act (FPA) regarding project construction timelines, license terms, and considerations for new development and efficiency improvements. The House version of the bill does not include similar language. Section 3001 of S. 2012 proposes changes to the Federal Power Act (FPA) related to hydropower projects. It would eliminate the applicant's ability to request a determination on fishway disputes and the Secretary's ability to submit written statements to FERC regarding license conditions. Section 3001 of S. 2012 proposes modifications to the Federal Power Act (FPA) regarding hydropower projects. It includes changes to licensing processes, emphasizing concurrent biological opinion preparation and water quality certification deadlines. Unlike the House version, the Senate bill does not mention a basin-wide or regional review program for comprehensive planning. Section 3001(i) of S. 2012 proposes modifications to the Federal Power Act (FPA) by adding new sections related to licensing process coordination and trial-type hearings. It emphasizes the completion of federal authorizations within three years and the resolution of interagency disputes through the Council on Environmental Quality chairman. Section 3001(i) of S. 2012 introduces a process for license applicants to receive a determination on covered measures after a trial-type hearing lasting up to 120 days. The FERC administrative law judge's decision is final, with the Secretary required to act on the determination within 60 days. Disagreements can be referred to the Council on Environmental Quality chairman. Additionally, a new section on \"Pumped Storage Projects\" is added to the Federal Power Act. Section 3001(i) of S. 2012 introduces a new process for license applicants to receive a determination on covered measures after a trial-type hearing. This section also requires FERC to submit an annual report on project license and permit issuance criteria, energy quantity, and capacity to congressional committees. Additionally, resource agencies must provide information for a publicly available website. Section 3001(j) of S. 2012 requires resource agencies to submit reports on terms and conditions that may impact energy production. FERC must establish a pilot program for hydropower studies, similar to the House version. Section 3002 modifies EPAct05 regarding hydroelectric production. Section 3002 of S. 2012 in the Senate would extend the eligibility period for the hydroelectric production incentive program to 2025, establish a sunset date for the program at 2035, and reauthorize appropriations at $10 million annually for FY2016 to FY2025. It also modifies Section 243 of EPAct05 for hydroelectric efficiency improvements. Additionally, sections 3003-3004, 10341-10344, and 10346 of S. 2012 would make changes to specific project licenses, while section 10345 would modify Section 10(h) of P.L. 86-787 related to the Equus Beds aquifer. The Senate version of S. 2012 includes provisions to extend the eligibility period for the hydroelectric production incentive program, establish a sunset date for the program, and make changes to specific project licenses. It also allows the Secretary of the Interior to carry out provisions under the act for 20 years and requires FERC to identify mechanisms for pumped storage hydropower assets. The House version of S. 2012 does not contain similar language, but both versions impact nonfederal hydropower, with FERC being designated as the lead agency for federal authorizations and issuing hydropower licenses. Congress is considering giving FERC a more prominent role in the hydropower licensing process, potentially shortening the process by promoting cooperation among stakeholders. Both bills set timeframes for licensing steps to expedite the process, but controversial provisions, such as mandatory conditioning authority and a new licensing schedule, have sparked debate. Concerns have been raised about FERC having unique authority to set the schedule for issuing hydropower licenses. The National Hydropower Association argues that bills could improve the hydropower licensing process by promoting collaboration and timely decision-making without limiting the authorities of environmental agencies and tribes. Section 3001(b)(2) of S. 2012 broadens the definition of renewable energy to include all hydropower, sparking debate on the types of hydropower that should qualify. The National Hydropower Association argues for improving the hydropower licensing process by promoting collaboration and timely decision-making. Debate arises on the types of hydropower that should qualify for the federal purchase requirement."
