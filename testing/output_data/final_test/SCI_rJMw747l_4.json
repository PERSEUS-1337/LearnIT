    "content": "Recent advances in Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have led to nearly photorealistic samples on large-scale datasets like ImageNet. The quality of these models raises questions about using the samples for data augmentation. Preliminary results suggest limitations of current metrics in evaluating GAN quality. The study highlights limitations of current metrics in evaluating GAN quality, showing significant increases in error rates with BigGAN images. It suggests the need for better metrics, proposing classification performance as a more suitable measure for downstream tasks. The advancements in GANs have led to nearly photorealistic samples, raising questions about their use for data augmentation. BigGANs have generated nearly photorealistic images of ImageNet data up to 512\u00d7512 resolution, achieving high-quality samples and capturing the data distribution. This suggests their potential use in downstream tasks with limited labeled data available. In this work, BigGANs are tested for data augmentation and replacement of the original data distribution. Two experiments are conducted: training ImageNet classifiers with BigGAN-produced data and augmenting the original ImageNet training set with BigGAN samples. The results show that using BigGAN samples does not improve classification performance. However, a new metric is introduced to better identify issues with GAN and other generative models. Training a classifier helps identify classes with poor performance in conditional generative models due to low quality samples or dataset diversity issues. Experiments involve using BigGAN models to replace or augment the ImageNet training set, testing different truncation parameters to balance quality and diversity. In experiments for diversity, truncation parameters of 0.2, 0.42, 0.5, 0.8, 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 were tested. Performance on replacement and augmentation was compared to Inception Score and Frechet Inception Distance metrics using a ResNet-50 classifier trained on ImageNet. The classifier was trained for 90 epochs with TensorFlow's momentum optimizer, showing performance on BigGAN datasets compared to the real dataset. The performance of classifiers trained on BigGAN datasets compared to the real dataset was analyzed. Results showed that classifiers trained on BigGAN samples generalize worse to real images at every truncation level. Performance breakdown by class at truncation level 1.5 revealed that most classes had decreased performance compared to the original dataset. Some classes showed marginal improvement, while others had significantly lower classification accuracy. The performance of classifiers trained on BigGAN datasets was analyzed, showing that they generalize worse to real images at every truncation level. Increasing the amount of BigGAN training data did not necessarily improve classifier accuracy. Models sampling from lower truncation values and with lower sample diversity performed better on data augmentation, with some showing a modest improvement in classification performance. The performance of classifiers trained on BigGAN datasets showed a 3% improvement in Top-1 Error, but required 1.5 times more training time. Inception Score and FID had little correlation with performance in replacement or augmentation experiments, indicating the need for alternative metrics for downstream tasks. Models with poor Inception Score and FID also performed poorly on classification, suggesting the need for alternative metrics. Inception Score does not consider intra-class diversity, while FID compares covariance matrices of data and model distribution. Per-class classification error provides a finer measure of model performance. FID suffers from high bias for low sample sizes, making per-class estimates unreliable. The curr_chunk discusses the importance of adding diverse samples to a dataset for better generalization in classification tasks. It highlights that samples generated from lower noise levels perform better on augmentation than replacement. The work includes using GANs for data augmentation and improving evaluation metrics for GANs. BID0 proposed an image-conditioned model for augmentation, showing improved results on smaller datasets. BID6 utilized a GAN to create synthetic training data for liver lesion images. Evaluation metrics like Inception Score and FID are used to compare sample quality from different models. BID12 suggests using classifier two-sample tests to assess GAN samples. BID13 constructs synthetic datasets to compare Inception Score and FID with changes in precision and recall. Geometry Score BID11 uses approximate manifolds to analyze GAN samples. In this study, the researchers investigated the performance of BigGAN, a state-of-the-art GAN model on ImageNet. Despite high scores on traditional GAN metrics, BigGAN was found to not accurately capture the data distribution of large-scale datasets like ImageNet. Additionally, there was only a slight improvement in classifier performance when training data was augmented with BigGAN samples. Classifier metrics were used to identify the classes where BigGAN performed well. In this study, researchers analyzed BigGAN's performance on ImageNet to determine its effectiveness on different classes. They highlighted the need for better evaluation metrics to gauge GANs' utility for downstream tasks."
