    "content": "The Act titled \"Government Customer Service Improvement Act of 2013\" defines terms like agency and customer, and emphasizes the development of customer service standards. The Government-Wide Standards developed by the Director of the Office of Management and Budget include goals for service improvements and target response times for various services. Additionally, agency Performance Improvement Officers are required to establish customer service standards. Each agency must establish customer service standards aligned with Government-wide standards. These standards should be included in Agency Performance Plans as required by law. The requirements include target call wait times, response times for correspondence, procedures for incorporating metrics into service agreements, and response times for processing benefits and payments. The Director of the Office of Management and Budget will establish a Customer Service Feedback Pilot Program involving the Internal Revenue Service and at least two other agencies. The program will collect feedback from customers on the quality of service provided, including recommendations for publishing contact information. The agency must provide performance information and customer service feedback in the performance report, but cannot disclose feedback specific to named employees. The Comptroller General will report to Congress on the Customer Service Feedback Pilot Program within two years of its implementation, assessing the program and recommending if it should be expanded Government-wide. The Director of the Office of Management and Budget will include agency achievements in meeting customer service performance standards in annual performance updates required by law. SEC. 4. PERFORMANCE APPRAISAL. Compliance with customer service standards shall be included in employee appraisal systems established by agencies. SEC. 5. SERVICE IMPROVEMENT UNIT PILOT PROGRAM. The Director of the Office of Management and Budget will establish the Service Improvement Unit Pilot Program to assist agencies not meeting Government-wide standards. Agency heads will detail employees with expertise in change management, process improvement, and IT innovation to work on the program. The program aims to work with agencies to improve service delivery and develop solutions for customer service standards. The Director of the Office of Management and Budget will establish a Service Improvement Unit Pilot Program to assist agencies in improving service delivery. This includes developing a plan within existing resources, monitoring implementation, and submitting monthly progress reports until customer service standards are met. A report on the pilot program's accomplishments and outcomes will be submitted to Congress within 2 years. The Administrator of General Services will provide support for the pilot program to improve service delivery. Agencies may offer up to 2 personnel authorizations with expertise in change management, process improvement, and information technology innovation. The pilot program will terminate 2 years after the enactment of the Act. SEC. 6. RETIREMENT REPORTING. The term \"agency\" is defined in this section. The Director of the Office of Personnel Management must submit monthly reports evaluating retirement information from agencies to Congress and the Comptroller General. The Director of the Office of Personnel Management must report on the number of pending applications for various retirement benefits and establish a timeline for modernization efforts. The reporting requirement may be suspended if processing times improve. The Office of Personnel Management must provide a timetable for completing the customer-focused retirement processing system and specify the deadline for Federal payroll processing entities to transmit personnel data electronically. Additionally, the Office must include progress updates on the system in each budget request submitted to Congress. SEC. 7. NO INCREASE IN EXPENDITURES. This Act will be carried out using existing funds, with no additional funds authorized."
