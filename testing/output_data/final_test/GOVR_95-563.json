    "content": "A complex set of rules and precedents govern the legislative process in the House of Representatives, with over 1,000 pages of rules and 30 volumes of precedents. Despite the volume of documents, understanding the House's procedures is not as difficult as it seems. The House's application of rules is generally predictable, and it tends to follow similar procedures under similar circumstances. Additionally, the House often waives, supplants, or supplements its standing rules with temporary procedures that fall into recognizable patterns. The House of Representatives operates under a complex set of rules and precedents, with over 1,000 pages of rules and 30 volumes of precedents. These rules aim to ensure that a majority of Members can work their will on the floor without being obstructed by minority filibusters or delays. The Constitution allows each house of Congress to determine its own procedures, with only a few restrictions imposed. The House of Representatives has the authority to determine its own rules and procedures, allowing it to amend rules unilaterally and suspend them as needed. Members must protect their rights by making points of order if rules are violated. House rules can be waived or suspended through formal procedures or unanimous consent, and enforcement is at the discretion of the House. The House of Representatives enforces time limits for floor deliberations to manage the participation of its members. Rules restrict Representatives from speaking for more than one hour, with stricter limits in certain circumstances. For example, debates on most bills are limited to 40 minutes under the \"suspension of the rules\" procedure. The House of Representatives enforces time limits for floor deliberations to manage member participation. Debate limitations prevent minority obstruction, with rules requiring germane topics and decorum. Members can speak on other subjects in one-minute speeches, special order speeches, and morning hour debates. The House of Representatives enforces time limits for floor deliberations to manage member participation and prevent minority obstruction. Members are expected to adhere to rules of courtesy and decorum, such as refraining from questioning or criticizing colleagues' motives. Bills and resolutions reported by House committees are placed on either the House Calendar or the Union Calendar for consideration on the floor, with tax, authorization, and appropriations bills typically on the Union Calendar. Placement on a calendar does not guarantee immediate floor consideration. Procedures for determining the order of business in the House of Representatives involve privileged measures that can interrupt the regular order of business under Rule XIV. All legislative business must become privileged to reach the floor if not considered by unanimous consent. The House of Representatives uses various modes of consideration for public bills and resolutions, depending on factors like bill importance, cost, and controversy among Members. The procedures vary in balancing opportunities for debate and amendments with the need for prompt action. The House of Representatives uses different procedures to consider legislation, balancing the need for prompt action with opportunities for debate and amendments. The most common procedure, \"suspension of the rules,\" allows for quick action on bills with overwhelming support, limiting debate to 40 minutes, prohibiting floor amendments, and requiring a two-thirds vote for passage. The House majority party leadership typically posts the text of upcoming measures on an internet website in advance. When a motion is made to suspend the rules and pass a bill in the House of Representatives, there is a 40-minute debate split between the Representative making the motion and the ranking minority member. No floor amendments are allowed, and a two-thirds vote is required for passage. When a motion is made to suspend the rules and pass a bill in the House of Representatives, a single vote occurs. If two-thirds of the Members present vote \"Aye,\" the motion is agreed to and the bill is passed. The House may debate the bill again at another time under a different mode of consideration, allowing floor amendments and more debate with a simple majority vote for passage. Multiple suspension motions can be considered in a day, leading to electronically recorded votes at 40-minute intervals if requested. The Speaker can postpone electronic votes on motions to suspend the rules until later on the same day or the following day. When the votes take place, they are clustered together without intervening debate. One of the ironies of the legislative process in the House is that most debate and votes on amendments to bills occur in Committee of the Whole, not on the House floor. This is due to the rule that limits debate in the House itself, allowing each Representative to speak for up to an hour on each bill, amendment, or debatable motion. This could result in over four hundred hours of debate on a single question. In the House, the \"hour rule\" limits debate to one hour per measure before a vote, preventing extensive debate that could hinder effective functioning. The majority floor manager controls the initial hour of debate, often supporting the measure's passage without amendment. The majority floor manager in the House controls the initial hour of debate, usually supporting the measure's passage without amendment. They may yield time to other Members and allocate control of half of the hour to the minority floor manager. If the majority floor manager moves the previous question and a majority votes for it, no more debate or amendments are allowed, and the House usually votes immediately on passing the bill. If the previous question is defeated, opponents of the bill would then control the second hour of debate. In the House, opponents of a bill may control the second hour of debate to try to amend the measure. Most bills are disposed of after one hour of debate with no opportunity for floor amendments. Major bills are not typically considered under the hour rule due to limited debate time and strict procedural rules. The most common legislation considered under the hour rule are procedural resolutions. In the House, major bills are debated and amended in the Committee of the Whole before being passed or defeated by the House itself. The Speaker presides over meetings of the House. The Speaker appoints another Member to chair the Committee of the Whole during the consideration of bills or resolutions. Rules in the Committee of the Whole differ from those in the House, making procedures more flexible, especially for offering and debating amendments. Most bills affecting federal taxes and spending must be considered in the Committee of the Whole before a House vote. The House adopts a resolution authorizing the Speaker to declare the House \"resolved\" into Committee of the Whole to consider a bill. There are two stages to consideration in Committee of the Whole: general debate and offering amendments. Members discuss the bill and its provisions during general debate, with the majority floor manager moving for amendments to be proposed. During or after general debate in the Committee of the Whole, the majority floor manager may move for the committee to transform back into the House. The House can then agree to this motion and later resume consideration of the bill in the Committee of the Whole. Alternatively, the committee can proceed directly to the amending process, where amendments can be made section by section or paragraph by paragraph. Amendments are in order after the relevant part of the bill has been read or designated. Amendments can also be made at any point with unanimous consent. The first amendments considered are usually those recommended by the reporting committee. Members of the Committee of the Whole can offer germane amendments to the bill, which are subject to a stringent standard of germaneness. The committee votes only on amendments, not the bill as a whole, and recommends amendments to the House. The previous question motion cannot be made in the Committee of the Whole, allowing for an open amendment process. After voting on all amendments, the committee rises and reports. After voting on amendments, the committee reports the bill back to the House with agreed-upon amendments. The amendment process is usually structured by a special rule adopted by the House. A first-degree amendment can be followed by a second-degree perfecting amendment, but this is rare in current floor practice. Members may offer germane amendments in the Committee of the Whole, which votes only on amendments and recommends them to the House. The amending process in the Committee of the Whole can be complex, with Members proposing various policy choices. Debate is governed by the five-minute rule, where the Member offering an amendment speaks for five minutes, followed by opposition for five minutes. Other Members can also speak for five minutes by motion. During the amending process in the Committee of the Whole, Members can speak for five minutes on each amendment by offering a motion \"to strike the last word.\" This motion allows for debate time but is not voted on when the five minutes expire. A majority vote can end the debate immediately. Special rules can limit the number and form of amendments considered. The House votes on adopted amendments by voice vote. During the amending process in the Committee of the Whole, Members can speak for five minutes on each amendment by offering a motion \"to strike the last word.\" A majority vote can end the debate immediately. The House usually approves amendments by one voice vote, with the option for separate votes. After the \"third reading and engrossment\" stage, a motion to recommit the bill to committee can be made, potentially leading to the bill being effectively \"killed.\" The House uses a complicated process to consider major bills, starting with a decision to resolve into Committee of the Whole. The Rules Committee can report resolutions affecting the order of business, proposing a \"rule\" or \"special rule\" to make a bill in order for floor consideration. A special rule resolution proposes to bring a bill to the floor for debate, amendment, and voting by a simple majority. It allows the House to consider a measure that is not otherwise privileged business and can interrupt the regular order of business. If accepted, the House proceeds to consider the bill itself. Special rule resolutions are privileged measures that set special procedural ground rules for considering a bill, supplementing or supplanting standing House rules. They determine debate time, control of time, expedite final House action, and may waive points of order. The most controversial aspect is the amendments Members can offer under the resolution. The special rule resolutions set procedural rules for considering a bill, including the types of amendments that can be offered. Different types of rules, such as open, modified open, closed, and structured rules, dictate the scope of permissible amendments. These rules are crucial as they can limit the policy choices available to Representatives. The Rules Committee recommends procedural rules for considering bills, including types of amendments allowed. Special rules can limit policy choices for Representatives, with open rules being rare. The House can debate and vote on these resolutions, with the option for Members to propose amendments. Ultimately, the House has control over the process. The House of Representatives retains control over the legislative process, including considering bills by unanimous consent. The Speaker enforces policies for unanimous consent requests, ensuring coordination with party leaders and committee leadership. Both the House and Senate must pass a bill for it to become law, requiring procedures for reconciling differences in versions passed by each chamber. The Senate and House pass different versions of bills, which must be reconciled before the legislative process is completed. This can be done by exchanging amendments between the chambers or through a conference committee of Representatives and Senators negotiating compromises. The process of resolving differences between the houses can be complex, with only basic elements summarized here. The House and Senate reconcile differences in bills through amendments or conference committees. The House may accept Senate amendments, amend them, or request a conference. If agreements are reached, the bill can be sent to the President for approval. The House and Senate reconcile differences in bills through amendments or conference committees. If the House and Senate agree to send their versions of the bill to a conference committee, the Speaker appoints the House conferees. These conferees deal only with provisions of the bill on which the two houses disagree, without inserting new provisions or changing approved ones. To resolve disagreements in bills, the House and Senate appoint conferees who must reach agreements on disputed provisions. The conferees sign a report recommending their agreements, along with a joint explanatory statement. The House may waive points of order against the conference report to facilitate its consideration on the floor. The conference report is a proposed package settlement of disagreements between the House and Senate, which can be accepted or rejected without amendments. If both houses agree by a simple majority vote, the bill is enrolled for presentation to the President. In rare cases, conferees may not reach agreement on certain amendments. The conferees may reach an agreement on amendments in conference or report disagreements back to the two houses. The House and Senate take actions on amendments in disagreement until resolved, or a new conference committee is created. The bill cannot become law until all disagreements are addressed. The bill cannot become law until all disagreements are addressed between the two houses. Representatives can demand a recorded vote using the House's electronic voting system. In Committee of the Whole, an electronic vote is ordered when 25 Members request it. In the House, a quorum is required for conducting business, with a majority of Representatives needed. A quorum is assumed present unless a Member objects. Electronic votes can be demanded if a quorum is not present, with rules restricting when objections can be made, usually during voting. In the House, a quorum is required for conducting business, with a majority of Representatives needed. If a quorum is not present, an electronically recorded vote is automatically ordered by the Speaker to establish a quorum. Members can participate in voice or division votes even if less than a quorum is present, as long as no one objects. Morning Hour Debate allows Members to make speeches before the legislative session begins. During the legislative session in the House, the Speaker approves the Journal, Members can request a recorded vote on it. After the Pledge of Allegiance, Members may seek unanimous consent to speak for one minute on any topic. Majority party leaders determine the House's floor schedule, consulting with minority party leaders. The schedule is usually arranged in advance for each week, with the majority leader announcing the upcoming week's schedule during the last floor session of the week. The House schedule for the week is typically announced by the majority leader during a traditional colloquy with the minority party leader. The House considers multiple measures under the \"suspension of the rules\" procedure on Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday, with recorded votes clustered together at the end of the day. Other days usually involve considering a major bill under a special rule reported by the House Committee on Rules, followed by debate and voting procedures. The House schedule for the week is typically announced by the majority leader during a traditional colloquy with the minority party leader. The House considers multiple measures under the \"suspension of the rules\" procedure on Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday, with recorded votes clustered together at the end of the day. Following consideration in the Committee of the Whole, the House would take final votes on the measure after voting on recommended amendments and a minority motion to recommit. The Speaker anticipates which Member should be seeking recognition for the next bill or resolution, and may decline recognition for other privileged measures. Special order speeches are given at the end of legislative business on most days. The House schedule is announced by the majority leader during a colloquy with the minority party leader. Representatives can give \"special order\" speeches on current issues and bills. The House rules are published in the House manual. Precedents of the House are compiled in various volumes. The House procedures are detailed in various publications such as Deschler's Precedents and House Practice. The Parliamentarian and his team provide expert assistance on House procedures. Additional volumes of House precedents are expected in the future. The House procedures are detailed in various publications such as Deschler's Precedents and House Practice. The Parliamentarian and his team provide expert assistance on House procedures. Additional volumes of House precedents are expected in the future. In the Committee of the Whole, various CRS reports cover topics such as the Discharge Rule, Parliamentary Reference Sources, Resolving Legislative Differences, The Speaker of the House, Suspension of the Rules, and Quorum Requirements in the House."
