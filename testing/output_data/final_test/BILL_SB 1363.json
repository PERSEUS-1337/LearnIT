    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Chapter 3.1 of Division 26.5 of the Public Resources Code addresses Ocean Acidification and Hypoxia Mitigation. The Legislature recognizes the threats posed by ocean acidification and hypoxia to marine ecosystems, particularly on the west coast. The West Coast Ocean Acidification and Hypoxia Science Panel, consisting of scientists from California, Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia, provided findings and recommendations to address these issues. Ocean acidification is primarily caused by global carbon dioxide emissions, with local factors intensifying its effects. The West Coast Ocean Acidification and Hypoxia Science Panel recommends strategies to reduce ocean acidification and hypoxia exposure, including protecting and restoring critical coastal habitats. Eelgrass ecosystems are diverse and important for aquaculture and valuable species, with protection and restoration efforts promoting a healthier ocean for ecosystems and industry. Since the 1850s, 90% of California's eelgrass acreage has been destroyed, leaving the remaining 10% vulnerable to various threats. Eelgrass habitats offer numerous benefits such as providing essential habitat for various marine species, improving water quality, mitigating hypoxia, sequestering carbon, and protecting shorelines from erosion and sea level rise. Advancing eelgrass protection in California is crucial for coping with ocean acidification and hypoxia. The Ocean Acidification and Hypoxia Reduction Program aims to develop projects researching eelgrass beds' role in carbon dioxide removal and hypoxia reduction, and identify areas for habitat conservation and restoration. The California Ocean Protection Trust Fund is established in the State Treasury to support science, monitoring, and coordination for ocean and coastal policy. The council will consider approaches for carbon dioxide removal from seawater that provide multiple cobenefits, including essential fish and bird habitat and mitigating sea level rise impacts. The California Ocean Protection Trust Fund is established in the State Treasury to support projects and activities that eliminate or reduce threats to coastal and ocean ecosystems, habitats, and species through grants or loans to public agencies, nonprofit corporations, or private entities. The California Ocean Protection Trust Fund supports projects to improve fisheries management through grants or loans for the development of fishery management plans that promote long-term stewardship and collaboration with fishery participants. Eligible projects include community-based management strategies and ecosystem improvement incentives. Eligible expenditures cover research, monitoring, data collection, and implementation costs. The curr_chunk is about costs related to the development and implementation of a fishery management plan. The curr_chunk focuses on promoting sustainable fisheries through various initiatives such as developing selective fishing gear, implementing community-based management mechanisms, conducting collaborative research projects, promoting value-added wild fisheries, and creating revolving loan programs. Additionally, it mentions improving coastal water quality and increasing public access to ocean and coastal resources while ensuring long-term protection and conservation. The curr_chunk focuses on improving management, conservation, and protection of coastal waters and ocean ecosystems. It includes providing monitoring and scientific data to enhance state efforts, acquiring resources to reduce threats to ocean ecosystems, and addressing coastal water contamination from biological pathogens through collaborative projects. The curr_chunk focuses on funding adaptive management, research, and monitoring to minimize climate change impacts on California's ocean ecosystem, including sea level rise, ocean productivity changes, and ocean acidification. It aims to increase understanding of the ocean's role in carbon sequestration and improve coastal and ocean resource management. Grants or loans may be provided to private entities for projects aligning with public purposes under specific sections. The information developed should guide the State Air Resources Board in adopting early action measures to reduce emissions as per the California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006. The council, when authorizing grants or loans for projects, must promote coordination of state programs to protect and conserve ocean resources in line with specified purposes and relevant Fish and Game Code sections."
