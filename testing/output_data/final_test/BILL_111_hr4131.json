    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Smoke-Free Federal Workplace Act\". Congress finds that secondhand smoke contains over 4,000 chemicals, including 69 carcinogens, leading to nearly 50,000 deaths annually in the US. The Surgeon General has determined in 2006 that there is no safe level of exposure to secondhand smoke, causing lung cancer and heart disease in non-smoking adults. Workplaces are a significant source of exposure, and smoke-free policies are the most effective way to eliminate it. The Institute of Medicine reports in 2009 highlighted the benefits of smoke-free laws in reducing heart attacks and recommended prioritizing tobacco control in military and veteran populations to achieve a tobacco-free military. SEC. 3. SMOKE-FREE FEDERAL BUILDINGS. (a) Smoking prohibited in Federal buildings within 90 days of enactment. \n(b) Enforcement responsibilities outlined for Executive, Judicial, and Legislative branch buildings. The House Office Building Commission, Senate Committee on Rules and Administration, and Architect of the Capitol are responsible for enforcing the smoking prohibition in Federal buildings owned or leased for use by the House of Representatives, Senate, and other establishments. Capitol will enforce smoking prohibition in Federal buildings used by the legislative branch, with fines of $250 for first offense, $500 for second offense, and $1,000 for subsequent offenses. SEC. 4. PREEMPTION. This Act does not override any state or local laws that offer greater protection. Federal agencies can still enforce stricter smoke-free or tobacco-free policies. For the purposes of this Act, definitions include:\n- Executive agency: as defined in section 105 of title 5, United States Code.\n- Federal agency: includes Executive agencies, establishments in the legislative or judicial branches.\n- Federal building: any structure owned or leased by a Federal agency, excluding military installations or VA health care facilities. A military installation refers to facilities under the Department of Defense's jurisdiction, excluding those used for civil works or by civilian defense employees."
