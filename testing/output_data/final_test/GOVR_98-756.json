    "content": "Before 1961, no prior authorization was needed for defense appropriations, except for construction funds. In 1959, a rider was attached to the construction authorization bill to require prior authorization for procurement of planes, missiles, and ships starting in 1961. This was done to regain some control over defense programs from the Appropriations Committees. Congress oversees the defense budget through two yearly bills: the defense authorization and defense appropriations bills. The authorization bill establishes agencies responsible for national defense and sets policies, while the appropriations bill provides budget authority for military departments. The appropriations bill provides budget authority for military departments and defense agencies to draw funds from the Treasury. The authorization-appropriations process ideally proceeds in an orderly sequence, with each step generating part of the information trail. This process is documented in various official documents of Congress and publications like Congressional Quarterly Weekly Report and USCCAN. The data in Table 1 and Table 3 reflect an earlier authorization-appropriations process from 1961 to 1969, starting with the President submitting his budget proposal. The defense authorization and appropriations process involves the President submitting a budget proposal to Congress. The bill goes through hearings, markup, and debate in both the House and Senate, with potential differences reconciled by a conference committee. The authorization and appropriations process involves the President submitting a budget proposal to Congress. The bill goes through hearings, markup, and debate in both chambers, with votes on the conference agreement taken. If passed, it is sent to the President for consideration and signature. The legislative text and bill number come together for consideration on the floor in various ways, such as substituting text from one chamber's bill for another. The legislative process can be complicated by events like voice votes or unanimous consent agreements, making it difficult to track bill contents and member votes. Continuing resolutions (CRs) are passed when appropriations bills are not enacted by the end of the fiscal year, providing temporary budget authority for specified purposes. For more information on CR components and the defense budget, refer to CRS Report R42647. The Congressional Record includes different types of votes such as voice votes, teller votes, division votes, and unanimous consent votes. Only recorded votes have a vote number and tally in the Congressional Record. Recorded votes are done electronically with each vote given a sequential number, and the vote totals along with how each Member voted are recorded. In the Congressional Record, vote totals and Member votes are recorded. Different types of votes include teller votes, unanimous consent votes, and voice votes where Members shout \"ayes\" or \"noes\" in chorus."
