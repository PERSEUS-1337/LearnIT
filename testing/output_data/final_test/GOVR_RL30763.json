    "content": "Several federal laws have been enacted in recent years to address telemarketing issues, with the FCC and FTC responsible for regulating different aspects. The FCC focuses on consumers' privacy rights and the use of telephone systems by telemarketers, while the FTC is concerned with the content and consequences of calls. Individual states have also passed laws related to telemarketing practices. The TCPA, P.L. 102-243, signed in 1991 by President Bush, was the first federal law addressing telemarketing. It directed the FCC to create rules balancing telemarketers' business practices with consumer privacy concerns. Key provisions include maintaining a do-not-call list for residential numbers, honoring requests for 10 years, exempting nonprofit organizations, and excluding business numbers from the rules. Consumers on a company's do-not-call list can sue if multiple calls are made within a year. Calls to private residences are only allowed between 8:00 a.m. and 9:00 p.m. Restrictions apply to using autodialers or prerecorded messages for certain numbers without prior consent. Telephone solicitation calls to private homes are prohibited unless consent is given. Prerecorded voice calls are allowed if consent is given, for noncommercial purposes, in emergencies, or if there is an established business relationship. Calls to business numbers are permitted. Callers must provide their identity and contact information. Autodialers or prerecorded calls must disclose their identity and contact information. Autodialer calls must release the phone line within five seconds of a hang-up. Unsolicited fax advertisements are prohibited without permission or an established business relationship. Messages sent to fax machines must include sender's identity, date, time, and contact number. FCC's rule on this can be found in the Federal Register of October 23, 1992. The FCC finalized rules in August 1995 regarding telemarketing practices and consumer privacy concerns. In September 2002, the FCC announced a review of its telemarketing rules due to advancements in technology and new marketing techniques. Public comments were sought on the need for rule revisions to address these changes. The FCC sought public comment on revising rules related to the TCPA, including issues such as autodialers, prerecorded messages, and do-not-call lists. The FTC also considered a national do-not-call list but was limited in regulating certain industries. The FCC had considered creating a national do-not-call database in 1992 but decided against it due to cost concerns. The FCC decided against creating a national do-not-call database in 1992 due to cost and privacy concerns. However, on June 26, 2003, the FCC announced the establishment of a national do-not-call registry for both interstate and intrastate calls. The FCC established a national do-not-call registry for both interstate and intrastate calls in 2003. States can maintain their own do-not-call registries, but must include residents in the national database. Consumers can request to be added to company-specific do-not-call lists or give permission to receive telemarketing calls. The registry became effective on October 1, 2003, allowing consumers to register complaints if needed. The FCC established a national do-not-call registry in 2003, allowing consumers to register complaints if necessary. Telemarketers can call customers with whom they have an established business relationship for a limited time. The updated TCPA rules also restrict predictive dialers to reduce abandoned calls and require identification in case of abandonment. Blocking caller ID information is prohibited, and unsolicited fax advertisements must be preceded by permission. The FCC postponed the implementation of a new rule requiring written permission for unsolicited fax advertisements due to concerns from businesses and nonprofits about the high cost and administrative burden of obtaining permission from all customers and members. The rule was scheduled to go into effect on August 25, 2003, but has been delayed until January 1, 2005. The FCC postponed the implementation of the fax rule until January 1, 2005. The FCC extended the stay of the fax rules until June 30, 2005, due to pending congressional action. Tax-exempt nonprofit organizations and certain calls are exempt from TCPA rules. Banking, insurance, telecommunications, and airline companies are not exempt from the updated FCC rules. The FCC will implement its rules in conjunction with the FTC's national do-not-call registry. The FCC will implement its rules in conjunction with the FTC for the national do-not-call registry. The FCC provides information on the updated TCPA rules on its website. The American Teleservices Association filed suit against the FCC rules, claiming potential job losses and First Amendment violations. The court denied the motion to stay the FCC's order. The court denied the motion to stay the FCC's order on September 26, 2003. President Clinton signed P.L. 103-297 on August 16, 1994, directing the FTC to establish rules prohibiting certain telemarketing activities. The FTC's Telemarketing Sales Rule (TSR) was adopted on August 15, 1995, covering most telemarketing calls and consumer responses to mail. The rule, effective December 31, 1995, restricts calls to 8:00 a.m. - 9:00 p.m. and prohibits calling consumers who have opted out. The Telemarketing Sales Rule prohibits telemarketers from calling consumers between 8:00 a.m. and 9:00 p.m. without permission. It requires prompt disclosures, prohibits misrepresentations, and prohibits withdrawing money without authorization. Telemarketers must identify themselves and the purpose of the call, provide material information before a purchase, and disclose that no purchase is required for prize promotions. Telemarketers and sellers must provide material information such as cost, quantity, restrictions, refund policy, and odds of winning in prize promotions. They are required to maintain records for two years, including advertising materials, sales records, and authorizations for payment. Exceptions to the Telemarketing Sales Rule include consumer-initiated calls, business-to-business calls, and certain sales. Certain types of businesses like banks, federal credit unions, and insurance companies are exempt from the Telemarketing Sales Rule. However, individuals or companies providing telemarketing services under contract for these exempt businesses are covered by the rule. Consumers should seek clarification from state authorities or the FTC regarding coverage. The FTC, states, and private individuals can enforce the rule through civil actions in federal district courts. The Telemarketing Sales Rule can be enforced through civil actions in federal district courts. The FTC conducted a review of the rule's effectiveness and proposed changes, including the creation of a national do-not-call list. More information can be found at http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/rulemaking/tsr/tsr-review.htm. The FTC proposed the creation of a national do-not-call list for consumers to opt out of telemarketing calls. The list would not stop all calls due to exemptions, and the FTC also proposed rules against blocking caller ID, obtaining credit card information improperly, and using predictive dialers resulting in \"dead air.\" The FTC proposed a national do-not-call list for telemarketing calls, with rules against blocking caller ID and using predictive dialers causing \"dead air.\" The FTC accepted comments on the proposed rule changes until March 29, 2002, and considered user fees for telemarketers accessing the registry. No charges were proposed for consumers to add their names to the list. The FTC proposed a national do-not-call list for telemarketing calls, with rules against blocking caller ID and using predictive dialers causing \"dead air.\" They estimated the cost of developing the list to be $5 million, with $3 million coming from user fees paid by approximately 3,000 telemarketers. The Direct Marketing Association opposed the user fees, stating it would be counterproductive and a financial burden. The DMA currently operates a do-not-call list with 4.5 million names. The full text of the proposed user fees can be found in the Federal Register of May 29, 2002. The FTC announced the creation of a national do-not-call registry and changes to the Telemarketing Sales Rule on December 18, 2002. The changes only apply to companies regulated by the FTC and telemarketing calls crossing state lines. State laws cover telemarketing practices within a state, and certain industries like long-distance phone companies, banks, credit unions, airlines, and insurance companies are not covered by FTC regulations. The FCC's revised TCPA rules and national do-not-call registry now cover companies previously regulated by the FTC. Political solicitations are not included in the revised TSR. The Final Amended Rule, effective from March 31, 2003, can be found on the FTC website. Some provisions were extended to October 1, 2003, including the establishment of the National Do-Not-Call Registry after reviewing over 60,000 public comments. After reviewing over 60,000 public comments, the FTC established a national do-not-call registry for consumers to stop unwanted telemarketing calls. Congress provided funding approval in 2003 through the Do-Not-Call Implementation Act (P.L. 108-10), allowing the FTC to collect fees and coordinate with the FCC on regulatory matters. The Do-Not-Call Implementation Act of 2003 authorized the FTC to develop a national do-not-call registry, with annual reports to Congress required. Funding was approved for the registry, with a contract awarded to AT&T Government Solutions for its operation. The FTC authorized a national do-not-call registry, with AT&T awarded the contract to operate it. Consumers must register each phone number separately, with numbers remaining on the list for five years. Telemarketers face fines for ignoring the registry, and must update their calling lists every three months. The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2004 directed the FTC in this regard. The Act of 2004 directed the FTC to amend the TSR to require telemarketers to \"scrub\" their calling lists monthly. Telemarketers must remove numbers on the do-not-call registry within 31 days of making a call, with exemptions for established business relationships. Companies must maintain their own do-not-call lists and add names upon consumer request. Dead air calls violate the TSR, but telemarketers have a \"safe harbor\" if they meet specific requirements. This includes ensuring no more than three percent of answered calls are abandoned and allowing phones to ring for at least 15 seconds before disconnecting. Starting October 1, 2003, telemarketers must ensure that consumer's telephone calls ring for at least 15 seconds before disconnecting and connect each call to a sales representative within two seconds. From January 29, 2004, telemarketers must transmit their telephone number to a consumer's caller ID service, with their company's name if possible.

Charitable Solicitations\u2014Exempt from national registry, must not call consumers who requested not to be called. The FTC announced an amendment to the TSR on July 29, 2003, establishing fees for industry access to the National Do-Not-Call Registry. The first five area codes of data are free, with a $25 fee for access to a single area code and a maximum annual fee of $7,375 for access to the entire country. Companies exempted from the TSR will have free access to the registry to encourage them to scrub their lists voluntarily. More information on fees and a guide for telemarketers can be found on the FTC website. On July 31, 2003, a fee rule synopsis was published in the Federal Register regarding amendments to the Telemarketing Sales Rule. The DMA filed a lawsuit against the FTC for overstepping its authority with the national do-not-call registry. The court ruled in favor of the DMA on September 23, 2003, stating that the FTC had exceeded its authority. Congress passed a bill (H.R. 3161) on September 25 to clarify the FTC's authority in response to the court's ruling. On September 25, Congress passed bill H.R. 3161 to clarify the FTC's authority. President Bush signed the legislation on September 29, which became P.L. 108-82. On January 29, 2003, a lawsuit was filed against the FTC in the U.S. District Court for Colorado. The court ruled on September 25, 2003, that the national registry established by the FTC was unconstitutional. The FTC's motion for an emergency stay pending appeal was denied on September 29. The district judge also warned the FTC not to assist the FCC with implementing the national do-not-call registry. On September 26, the FTC filed an appeal with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit in Denver regarding the constitutionality of the do-not-call registry. The court issued a stay pending appeal on October 7, and oral arguments were heard on November 10, 2003. The Denver Appeals Court upheld the constitutionality of the national do-not-call list on February 17, 2004. The U.S. Supreme Court rejected an appeal on October 4, 2004.
