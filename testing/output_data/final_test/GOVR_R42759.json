    "content": "The 2008 farm bill expired in 2013, leading the 113th Congress to consider a new omnibus farm bill. The Senate passed S. 954, while the House initially rejected H.R. 1947 but later approved a revised version, H.R. 2642, which excluded a nutrition title. The House approved a nutrition title (H.R. 3102) on September 19 and adopted a resolution (H.Res. 361) on September 28 combining bills H.R. 2642 and H.R. 3102 into one bill for resolving differences with the Senate. Conference on the two measures is pending. This report compares the \"farm safety net\" provisions in the bills, focusing on commodity price and income support programs, federal crop insurance, and disaster assistance programs. Both versions of the 2013 farm bill contain commodity and disaster program provisions, with modifications to the crop insurance program in both bills. The Senate and House bills aim to reshape farm commodity support, reauthorize disaster programs, and expand crop insurance coverage. Current support includes direct payments, CCP, ACRE, and marketing assistance loans for traditional program crops. Direct payments are based on historical production, CCP pays when prices fall below a target, ACRE provides payments when revenue drops, and marketing assistance loans offer low-price protection. The Senate and House bills propose to eliminate direct payments, CCP, and ACRE programs for farm commodity support. Instead, new programs with different names, triggers, and formulas would be implemented to address shallow losses. The savings from eliminating current programs would be used to update farm programs, enhance crop insurance, and reauthorize disaster programs. The Senate bill aims for $12.4 billion in savings over 10 years, while the House bill targets $9.8 billion in savings. Both Senate and House bills aim to eliminate direct payments, CCP, and ACRE programs for farm commodity support, reallocating savings to update farm programs, enhance crop insurance, and reauthorize disaster programs. The bills address shallow losses and provide disaster assistance for livestock producers. The two bills would eliminate direct payments, the main component of current commodity spending, and introduce updated price and revenue programs to manage risk. The Senate bill covers crop years 2014-2018 and suspends permanent price support authority to motivate Congress to reexamine agricultural policy. In contrast, the House bill covers crop year 2014 onwards and repeals permanent law to better protect farm program beneficiaries in the long run. Covered commodities include wheat, oats, barley, corn, and rice. Under the 2013 farm bills, farm programs for traditional crops are restructured, eliminating direct payments, the CCP program, and the ACRE program. Cotton is not included as a program commodity due to a World Trade Organization case, and a new insurance product called Stacked Income Protection Plan (STAX) covers it. Producers do not pay fees for participating in farm programs, unlike the federal crop insurance program. Marketing assistance loans continue to provide low-price protection. The 2013 farm bill restructures farm programs, eliminating direct payments, CCP, and ACRE. Cotton is not included due to a WTO case, and a new insurance product, STAX, covers it. Marketing assistance loans provide low-price protection. The new farm bill replaces CCP with Adverse Market Payments or AMP and Price Loss Coverage or PLC. Reference prices are set in statute to better protect producers in a market downturn. The 2013 farm bill restructures farm programs, replacing direct payments, CCP, and ACRE. Cotton is excluded due to a WTO case, with a new insurance product, STAX, covering it. The new farm bill introduces Adverse Market Payments (AMP) and Price Loss Coverage (PLC) to protect producers in a market downturn. Payment rates are calculated based on reference prices and national farm prices or loan rates. The Senate bill pays on 85% of historical plantings, while the House bill pays on 85% of planted acreage to align payments with producer risk. Yield updating is available under the House bill for all crops, while the Senate bill limits it to rice and peanuts. During the farm bill debate in recent years, commodity groups representing rice and peanut producers have led efforts to retain a reference price option for price protection. An amendment to eliminate AMP for crops other than rice and peanuts failed. The revenue-based program in the 2008 farm bill is replaced by Agriculture Risk Coverage (ARC) in S. 954 and Revenue Loss Coverage (RLC) in H.R. 2642. The Agriculture Risk Coverage (ARC) in S. 954 and Revenue Loss Coverage (RLC) in H.R. 2642 provide payments on planted acres when crop revenue drops below a specified percentage of historical revenue. Producers absorb a portion of the shortfall, with the government capping payments at 10% of benchmark revenue. Crop insurance can cover remaining losses if purchased at sufficient levels. ARC in the Senate allows coverage at county or individual farm levels, while RLC in the House is only available at the county level and cannot be combined with PLC. Payments are made in addition to any crop insurance indemnities. The Agriculture Risk Coverage (ARC) and Revenue Loss Coverage (RLC) programs provide payments on planted acres when crop revenue falls below a specified percentage of historical revenue. These revenue-based farm programs offer a guarantee based on deviations from historical crop prices, while crop insurance is based on expected market prices. Revenue-based programs can provide a higher revenue guarantee if historical prices are high relative to expected market prices. The federal crop insurance program offers subsidized insurance to protect against farm losses in yield, crop revenue, or whole farm revenue. The federal crop insurance program offers subsidized insurance to protect against individual farm losses in yield, crop revenue, or whole farm revenue. More than 100 crops are insurable, and the program is permanently authorized by the Federal Crop Insurance Act. Both versions of the farm bill increase funding for crop insurance, with new insurance products accounting for most of the additional cost. The crop insurance title in both bills includes provisions for new insurance products and increased funding. A key difference is a provision in S. 954 that reduces crop insurance premium subsidies for producers with high income. Amendments for mandatory funding and eliminating premium subsidies for tobacco crop insurance were also discussed in Senate floor action. Additionally, a new crop insurance policy for \"shallow losses\" is authorized under both bills, with the Supplemental Coverage Option available for purchase by crop producers. The Supplemental Coverage Option (SCO) is a new area-wide yield or revenue loss policy available for purchase by crop producers to cover part of the deductible under their underlying policy. Premium is subsidized at 65%, and coverage would begin by the 2014 crop year. If a farmer participates in ARC under Title I of the Senate bill, the deductible under SCO is increased to 22%. Acres covered by RLC are not eligible for SCO in the House bill. The House committee bill introduces the Supplemental Coverage Option (SCO) for crop insurance, where farmers can purchase coverage to offset part of the deductible. If a loss occurs, an initial indemnity is triggered under the individual crop insurance policy, followed by a second indemnity from SCO if there is a county-level loss. Farmers may incur a loss of approximately 10%, with additional payments made if the farm price falls below the reference price. If a producer chooses Revenue Loss Coverage (RLC) instead of Price Loss Coverage (PLC), SCO is not available, and only an RLC payment would be made. The Senate bill allows producers to participate in both the ARC revenue program and SCO, with SCO indemnity potentially filling the gap between ARC payment and individual policy indemnity. Both bills address cotton separately to resolve Brazil's WTO case, with a new cotton program called STAX included in the farm bill. STAX offers a county-based revenue insurance policy, similar to SCO but based on expected county revenue. STAX is a county-based revenue insurance policy for cotton producers, offering indemnity for revenue losses exceeding 10% but not more than the deductible level. Producers can purchase STAX in addition to their individual crop insurance policy or as a stand-alone policy, with a payment rate multiplier of 120% available. The farmer subsidy for STAX is set at 80% of the policy premium, and the price guarantee is based on current market prices. The 2012 House committee bill (H.R. 6083) proposed a minimum price of $0.6861 per pound for insurance guarantee calculation. STAX policy participants would not receive benefits available to other crops, pending Brazil's approval. Crop insurance changes aim to enhance coverage for various commodities. The bills propose revisions to crop insurance for organic crops and require research on whole farm revenue insurance with higher coverage levels. Studies are also included on insuring specialty crop producers for food safety, swine producers for disease events, and poultry producers for catastrophic events. Additionally, there is a study on insuring producers of biomass sorghum for renewable energy. The Senate bill includes provisions for alfalfa and peanut revenue insurance, as well as payments for private-sector index weather insurance. There are also requirements for USDA to notify the public of insurance policy modifications and reduce crop insurance subsidies for conservation purposes. Premium subsidies for crop insurance are available only in the Senate-passed bill. In the Senate bill, crop insurance premium subsidies are available only if producers comply with wetland and highly erodible land conservation requirements. Producers growing ineligible crops may qualify for payments under USDA's Noninsured Crop Disaster Assistance Program (NAP), which requires a 50% crop loss due to natural disasters or prevented planting of 35% of intended acreage. NAP applicants must pay a $250 administrative fee annually. The NAP provides coverage for crop losses due to natural disasters or prevented planting of more than 35% of intended acreage. Producers can receive 55% of the average market price for losses exceeding the minimum threshold. Both bills offer additional coverage at 50% to 65% of established yield and 100% of average market price, with a premium of 5.25% of the selected coverage level and production value. Premiums are reduced by 50% for limited resource, beginning, and socially disadvantaged farmers. The Senate bill allows retroactive payments for fruit crop losses in 2012 in disaster-declared counties. The Senate bill increases NAP fees, eliminates NAP for grazing crops, and reauthorizes disaster programs for livestock and tree assistance. The 2013 farm bills retroactively cover losses from FY2012-FY2018. The crop disaster program from the 2008 farm bill is not reauthorized, but elements are included in the new ARC program. S. 954 also provides disaster benefits for tree fruit producers who suffered losses in 2012. The Livestock Indemnity Program, Livestock Forage Disaster Program, Emergency Assistance for Livestock, and Tree Assistance Program would be reauthorized to provide disaster benefits to producers for livestock mortality, grazing losses, and orchard losses. The programs would compensate ranchers for livestock mortality, grazing losses due to drought or fire, and disaster losses not covered by other programs. The bills aim to provide financial assistance to orchardists and nursery growers for replanting trees or nursery stock and pruning/removal after natural disasters. The payments cover a percentage of the costs, with limits on total payments per person based on adjusted gross income. S. 954 reduces the farm program payment limit and adds a limit on loan deficiency payments, while H.R. 2642 sets a limit on all Title I payments. The Livestock Indemnity Program and other disaster assistance programs would also be reauthorized to provide benefits for livestock and orchard losses. The House and Senate bills propose changes to farm program payments, including combining peanuts with other commodities, tightening limits on Adjusted Gross Income (AGI), and setting a combined AGI limit of $750,000 in S. 954 and $950,000 in H.R. 2642. Some high-income individuals disqualified under the 2008 farm bill may be eligible again due to the higher proposed AGI limits. The House bill caps overall farm program spending at $16.96 billion for FY2014-FY2020. Both the House and Senate bills propose changes to farm program payments, including combining peanuts with other commodities, tightening AGI limits, and setting a combined limit of $750,000 in S. 954 and $950,000 in H.R. 2642. The bills also address disaster programs, with S. 954 retaining a $100,000 per person payment limit for certain programs, while H.R. 2642 sets a limit of $125,000. Both bills introduce significant changes to dairy policy, eliminating certain programs and replacing them with a new dairy margin insurance program. The Dairy Market Stabilization Program in S. 954 reduces milk production incentives when margins are low, not present in H.R. 2642. H.R. 2642 requires USDA to follow standard rulemaking procedures and assess market impacts. S. 954 includes provisions for alternative milk pricing formulas and analyzing effects of different pricing procedures. The sugar program structure remains unchanged in both bills, with the Senate bill reauthorizing it through 2018 and the House bill without an expiration date. Funding for the next farm bill is based on the CBO's baseline projection of mandatory program costs. The May 2013 baseline is used to measure S. 954 and H.R. 2642 against expected outlays for all mandatory farm bill programs. The May 2013 baseline projects expected outlays for all mandatory farm bill programs, with $973 billion over FY2014-FY2023. Farm safety net programs have a budget authority of $143 billion, including $59 billion for commodity programs and $84 billion for crop insurance. Disaster programs do not have baseline funding. The baseline amounts can be used for reauthorization, reallocation, deficit reduction, or offsets for other provisions. For more details, refer to CRS Report R42484. The CBO scores of the farm bill versions show savings in farm safety net provisions. The savings would be used to revise farm programs, enhance crop insurance, and reauthorize disaster programs. The House bill saves $18.7 billion in commodity programs, while the Senate bill saves $17.4 billion. Both bills increase crop insurance expenditures. The proposed changes in the farm safety net by the Senate and House farm bills are analyzed by researchers. The economic consequences of the bills are expected to be similar, with reduced federal spending and minor effects on commodity markets. The House bill offers more support to rice, barley, and peanuts producers, while the Senate bill benefits corn and soybean producers. Program benefits will depend on market conditions and producer choices. The Senate and House farm bills propose changes to the farm safety net, with potential impacts on program benefits and average net farm income. The House bill may offer more support to rice, barley, and peanuts producers, while the Senate bill may benefit corn and soybean producers. The analysis suggests that 80% of representative farms would receive greater financial benefits under the House bill compared to the Senate bill. The House bill offers more support to rice, barley, and peanuts producers compared to the Senate bill. The average difference in net cash farm income between the two bills is $19,900 per farm, favoring the House bill in cases of higher cash income. Key drivers include higher reference prices and the Supplemental Coverage Option in the House bill, while the Senate bill expands the SCO deductible. In a declining price scenario, 74% of farms benefit more from the House bill, down from 80% in the baseline scenario. The ARC program in the Senate bill and RLC in the House bill could lead to overcompensation for shallow losses, while SCO alone may result in fewer concerns. The potential impact of a multi-year price decline is a major policy concern, with the Senate bill offering declining ARC guarantees over time if market prices drop, compared to fixed minimum prices in the House bill. The House bill proposes fixed minimum prices in the price and revenue programs for crops, potentially creating planting incentives that differ from market signals. Concerns have been raised about the potential sharp increase in farm program costs, with estimates varying depending on farm prices. The House bill proposes fixed minimum prices in the price and revenue programs for crops, potentially creating planting incentives that differ from market signals. Concerns have been raised about the potential sharp increase in farm program costs, with estimates varying depending on farm prices. The CBO uses a stochastic scoring method that accounts for various price scenarios, while the bill includes details on Commodity Programs, Crop Insurance, and Miscellaneous programs."
