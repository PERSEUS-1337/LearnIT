    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Senator Paul Simon Study Abroad Program Act of 2017\". Congress finds that study abroad programs are essential for preparing students for success in the global economy. These programs offer access to international knowledge, language learning opportunities, and cultural understanding. However, only a small percentage of US postsecondary students participate in study abroad, with minority, first-generation, community college, and disabled students being underrepresented. The Lincoln Commission was authorized by Congress to expand study abroad opportunities for US students, with a focus on developing nations. Leadership from administrators and faculty is crucial for increasing participation and improving program quality. A competitive grant program is necessary to encourage and support leadership in making study abroad an integral part of the undergraduate experience. The purposes of this Act include increasing access to quality study abroad opportunities, promoting diversity in study abroad destinations, especially in developing countries, and encouraging institutions of higher education to expand study abroad opportunities. Section 741 of the Higher Education Act of 1965 is amended to include the Senator Paul Simon Study Abroad Program, defining terms like \"institution of higher education\" and \"national of the United States.\" The term 'national of the United States' refers to a US national or a lawful permanent resident. A 'nontraditional study abroad destination' is a less common location for studying abroad. A 'student' is a US national enrolled in a US higher education institution. 'Study abroad' is an educational program involving study, work, or research. The Senator Paul Simon Study Abroad Program is an educational program conducted outside the US for academic credit. Its objectives include having at least 1,000,000 undergraduate students study abroad annually within 10 years of its enactment in 2017. The Senator Paul Simon Study Abroad Program aims to increase study abroad participation among underrepresented groups and in nontraditional destinations, particularly in developing countries, through competitive grants to institutions of higher education. The Senator Paul Simon Study Abroad Program provides grants to institutions of higher education to expand access to study abroad, evaluate progress, sustain increased participation, and establish health and safety guidelines. The Senator Paul Simon Study Abroad Program provides grants to institutions of higher education to expand access to study abroad. Consortia of institutions may include nongovernmental institutions that promote study abroad opportunities. The Secretary administers the program, considering recommendations from the Commission on the Abraham Lincoln Study Abroad Fellowship Program. The Secretary consults with representatives of diverse institutions of higher education and submits an annual report to the Senate and House committees on the implementation of the Senator Paul Simon Study Abroad Program. Appropriations are authorized for each fiscal year."
