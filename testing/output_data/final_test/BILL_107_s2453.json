The Department of Energy plans to convert the plutonium to fuel for nuclear reactors by 2019. The United States and the State of South Carolina have a strong interest in the safe and efficient operation of plutonium disposition facilities at the Savannah River Site. The MOX facility will bring economic benefits to South Carolina, but it must be built to realize these benefits. South Carolina wants to ensure safe storage of transferred plutonium, maximize the benefits of the MOX facility, and process or remove defense plutonium materials promptly. SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS.\n\n(a) MOX Production Objective Defined.--The term ``MOX production objective'' means production at the MOX facility of mixed-oxide fuel from defense plutonium and materials at a rate of not less than one metric ton per year. The average rate is measured from the facility's operational declaration to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission assessment.\n\n(b) MOX Facility Defined.--The term ``MOX facility'' refers to the mixed-oxide fuel fabrication facility at the Savannah River Site in Aiken, South Carolina.\n\n(c) Defense Plutonium and Materials Defined.--The term ``defense plutonium or materials'' denotes weapons-usable plutonium. The Secretary of Energy must submit a plan to Congress by February 1, 2003, for the construction and operation of the MOX facility. The plan includes schedules to achieve MOX production objectives by January 1, 2009, and processing 34 metric tons of defense plutonium into mixed oxide fuel by January 1, 2019. The Secretary must submit annual reports to Congress on the implementation of the MOX facility plan, including compliance assessments and production objective updates. The Secretary must submit annual reports to Congress on the implementation of the MOX facility plan, including compliance assessments, production objective updates, and corrective actions if construction or operation is behind schedule by 12 months or more. The Secretary must submit annual reports to Congress on the MOX facility plan, with corrective actions if needed to meet production objectives by January 1, 2009. Plans must include milestones for compliance with production goals. If there is a risk of not meeting objectives, the Secretary must take necessary actions. The Secretary must suspend transfers of defense plutonium to the MOX facility if production objectives are not met by 2009 due to failure to achieve milestones in the corrective action plan. This suspension will continue until the Secretary certifies that the production objective can be met. The Secretary must suspend transfers of defense plutonium to the MOX facility if production objectives are not met by 2009. This suspension will continue until the Secretary certifies that the production objective can be met. Upon making a determination, the Secretary shall submit a report to Congress on options for removing defense plutonium from South Carolina. Each report will include an analysis of options, cost, schedule, and environmental requirements. The Secretary will start the necessary analysis under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 upon receiving a report for selecting options. If the MOX production goal is not met by January 1, 2009, the Secretary must remove a certain amount of defense plutonium from the Savannah River Site by specific dates, in accordance with environmental laws. If the MOX production objective is not achieved by January 1, 2011, the Secretary will pay South Carolina $1,000,000 per day until certain conditions are met, including the removal of defense plutonium from the state. If the MOX production objective is not achieved by January 1, 2017, the Secretary will pay South Carolina $1,000,000 per day until certain conditions are met, including the removal of defense plutonium from the state. If the MOX production objective is not achieved by January 1, 2017, the Secretary will pay South Carolina $1,000,000 per day until certain conditions are met, including the removal of defense plutonium from the state. The Secretary shall make payments under this subsection from amounts authorized to be appropriated to the Department of Energy. If the State of South Carolina obtains an injunction that prohibits the Department from meeting any deadline specified by this subsection, the deadline shall be extended for a period equal to the injunction's duration. The Secretary must submit a plan to Congress for processing 34 metric tons of defense plutonium at the MOX facility annually. If the facility ceases operations, any remaining mixed oxide fuel must be removed. When the facility permanently stops operations, any remaining mixed oxide fuel at the Savannah River Site must either be transferred for use in commercial nuclear reactors or removed from South Carolina according to a report to be submitted to Congress by the Secretary. SEC. 4. STUDY OF FACILITIES FOR STORAGE OF PLUTONIUM AND PLUTONIUM MATERIALS. The Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board will study the adequacy of the K-Area Materials Storage facility for storing defense plutonium and materials. A report on the study must be submitted to Congress and the Secretary within one year. The report will address the suitability of the facility for monitoring and observing stored materials. The Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board will assess the adequacy of KAMS for storing defense plutonium and materials, including remote monitoring and handling. Recommendations will be made to enhance safety and functionality. A report must be submitted to Congress annually. The Secretary and the Board will submit an annual report to Congress on the actions taken in response to recommendations regarding the adequacy of KAMS for storing defense plutonium and materials."
