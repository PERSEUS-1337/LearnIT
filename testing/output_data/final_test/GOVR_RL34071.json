    "content": "Ten years after the Handover in 1997, Hong Kong has seen changes in its political and economic landscape, impacting its social and cultural identity. Despite setbacks, the HKSAR remains a vibrant international trade hub in Asia. The Joint Declaration signed in 1984 governed the actual transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong from British colonial rule to China. The Joint Declaration signed in 1984 in Beijing promised Hong Kong a high degree of autonomy and unchanged social and economic systems for 50 years. China's National People's Congress passed the Basic Law in 1990, outlining policies consistent with the Declaration. Hong Kong is important to the US as a major trade hub in Asia and ally in liberalizing international trade. The United States-Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992 commits the US to treat Hong Kong as a separate entity from China as long as it remains sufficiently autonomous. The Act empowers the President to determine Hong Kong's autonomy status based on factors from the Joint Declaration. It does not mention the Basic Law. Hong Kong's Common Law legal system and civil liberties are seen as a model for human rights in Asia. The United States-Hong Kong Policy Act emphasizes the importance of Hong Kong's role in the economy, supports democratization, and prioritizes human rights. It requires annual reports on Hong Kong's conditions of interest to the US. The act was amended in subsequent years. The United States-Hong Kong Policy Act requires annual reports on Hong Kong's conditions of interest to the US, focusing on democratization, human rights, and civil liberties. Little progress has been made in democratization, but civil liberties have been largely respected, with concerns about self-censorship in the media. Hong Kong's economy faced external shocks post-1997, leading to a prolonged recession. The Asian Financial Crisis of 1997 and the outbreak of SARS in 2003 led to a recession in Hong Kong, affecting asset values, commodity prices, and GDP. However, the economy has since rebounded, with deepening trade relations with China playing a significant role. Additionally, economic ties with China have strengthened in the past decade, partly due to global market conditions and agreements like the Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement (CEPA) and the Individual Visit Scheme. The economic ties between Hong Kong and China have strengthened in the past decade through agreements like the Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement (CEPA) and the Individual Visit Scheme. Hong Kong has seen changes in its society and culture, including a decline in the expat population, a rise in the mainland population, and concerns about preserving Hong Kong's culture, such as historic buildings. The economic ties between Hong Kong and China have strengthened through agreements like CEPA and the Individual Visit Scheme. Social and cultural changes have raised the issue of a \"Hong Kong identity\" distinct from a \"Chinese identity.\" The political, economic, and cultural changes do not seem to erode Hong Kong's separateness from the Chinese mainland, but there are aspects that warrant monitoring. The economic changes blur the border between Hong Kong and the mainland, while social changes blur the difference between being Chinese and a \"Hong Konger.\" If the separation effectively disappears, the US may reconsider extending special treatment to Hong Kong. The HKSAR is an executive-led government with power in the hands of the Chief Executive and appointed department secretaries. Since the Handover, there has been political debate over Hong Kong's executive, legislative, and judicial powers. Controversies include the selection process for the chief executive and their term. Hong Kong's legislature has limited powers, while the courts adjudicate legal cases except for national defense, foreign policy, and Basic Law interpretation. The political debate in Hong Kong post-Handover has focused on the selection process and term of the chief executive, composition of Legco, and judicial powers, particularly Basic Law interpretation. There has also been a shift in political parties and increased political involvement among the Hong Kong population. The politicization of the Hong Kong population has increased post-Handover due to more opportunities for political involvement, perceived government dysfunction, and attention to political issues. The Basic Law outlines the selection process for the Chief Executive, emphasizing gradual progress and local consultations. The Basic Law outlines the selection process for the Chief Executive in Hong Kong, emphasizing gradual progress and local consultations. The Chief Executive is to be selected by a broadly representative nominating committee through universal suffrage, with a secret ballot on a one-person-one-vote basis. Amendments to the selection method post-2007 require a two-thirds endorsement. Subsequent to 2007, amendments to the selection process of the Chief Executive in Hong Kong require a two-thirds majority endorsement from the Legislative Council and the Chief Executive's consent, with approval from the National People's Congress. Controversies arose regarding the term and selection of Chief Executive, particularly with Tung Chee Hwa's resignation in 2005. In 2005, a controversy arose over the length of the term for Tung Chee Hwa's replacement as Chief Executive of Hong Kong. Some argued for a full five-year term, while others believed the replacement should only serve the remaining two years of Tung's term. Tsang requested a decision from Beijing, which ruled that the replacement should finish Tung's term, leading to objections from pro-democracy parties and the Bar Association. Following the controversy over the term length for Tung Chee Hwa's replacement as Chief Executive of Hong Kong in 2005, Donald Tsang was selected to complete the remainder of Tung's term. A campaign to change the selection process for the Chief Executive in 2007 emerged, but Tsang's proposal for incremental modifications was defeated in December 2005, resulting in no changes to the selection process. In the 2007 Chief Executive selection, Tsang faced a challenge from Alan Leong Kah Kit of the Civic Party. Leong secured 132 votes in the Election Committee, making him an official candidate. Despite losing to Tsang, Leong garnered 123 votes. The election featured public debates and a split vote in the Election Committee, seen as modest progress by pro-democracy advocates. The Election Committee's split vote in the 2007 Chief Executive selection is seen as modest progress by pro-democracy advocates. The Chinese government maintains it's too early for direct elections, but a \"Green Paper\" on universal suffrage is expected to be released by the Commission on Strategic Development. The upcoming \"Green Paper\" from the Hong Kong government will outline options for the Chief Executive selection process, including the composition of the nominating committee, voting requirements, candidate limits, and the transition to universal suffrage. The earliest possible date for universal suffrage is 2012, but analysts predict an interim measure expanding the Election Committee. According to Hong Kong's Department of Constitutional Affairs, the resolution of the model and roadmap for Chief Executive election will come before the decision on direct election by universal suffrage. Legco member Leung Kwok Hung suggests the Chinese government may consider direct popular election of the Chief Executive in 2022. Concerns exist that delaying universal suffrage until 2022 may be a strategy to block democratization in Hong Kong. Legco, under British rule, was historically composed of members appointed by the British Governor to represent the business community. After the signing of the Joint Declaration, the last British Governor, Chris Patten, reformed Legco into a more democratic institution. In 1995, the last Legco under British rule was selected with 20 seats in geographical elections with universal suffrage, 30 seats by functional constituencies, and 10 by a special Election Committee. The voting age was also lowered from 21 to 18. The Patten reforms broadened participation in the election by lowering the voting age to 18 and creating a Legco that would serve before and after the Handover. The Chinese government objected to the reforms, ruling them incompatible with the Basic Law. A \"Provisional Legislative Council\" was created to replace the reformed Legco after the Handover. After the Handover, the Provisional Legislative Council replaced the reformed Legco. In 1998, Hong Kong selected a new Legco with 60 members from different constituencies. Turnout for the geographical constituency seats was about 53%. In 2000, the third post-Handover Legco was selected with 24 members from geographical constituencies, 30 from functional constituencies, and six from the Election Committee. In 2004, the Legco elections saw a 30-30 split between geographical and functional constituencies, with increased turnout to over 55% for geographical seats. There was discussion about democratization of Legco and reforms in the selection of members, but direct universal suffrage was opposed by the Chinese government. Tsang's proposed 2005 reforms aimed to move towards universal suffrage for all Legco seats by increasing the number of directly elected members and adding functional constituency seats selected by District Council members. This was seen as a step towards democratization. Opponents to Tsang's 2005 proposed reforms argued that increasing functional constituency seats without expanding voter eligibility was not democratic. Some \"pro-democracy\" advocates aim to eliminate functional constituency seats altogether, while others seek a system where every eligible voter can vote in both geographical and functional constituencies. In December 2005, Legco rejected Tsang's reforms, prompting further investigation by the Committee on Governance and Political Development. In response to opposition, Tsang authorized the Committee on Governance and Political Development to investigate implementing universal suffrage for Legco. The democratization of Legco elections is complex due to functional constituencies. Changes in Legco formation require approval from two-thirds of current Legco, Chief Executive, and National People's Congress Standing Committee. Concerns exist that functional constituency members can block proposals diluting their power. Observers fear Chinese government interpretations of the Basic Law may impact decisions. Some observers believe that Annex III language may require Standing Committee approval for changes. Hong Kong's judicial system remains intact post-Handover, except for cases involving Basic Law interpretation. Increase in civil cases post-Handover, with ambiguity in cases related to Basic Law interpretation. Independent judicial power granted to HKSAR under Article 2 of Basic Law. Article 2 of the Basic Law grants the HKSAR independent judicial power, including final adjudication. The Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal has the power of final adjudication. The courts in Hong Kong should be free from interference. The Standing Committee of the NPC has the power to interpret the Basic Law. The HKSAR courts can interpret the provisions of the Basic Law within their autonomy. The HKSAR courts have the power of final adjudication, but if decisions involve the relationship with the Chinese government or central affairs, they must seek interpretation from the Standing Committee. There have been three cases since 1997 where Chinese government interpretations of the Basic Law have raised concerns. Interpretation of Articles 22 and 24 of the Basic Law in Hong Kong defines \"permanent resident\" status and the \"right of abode.\" Chinese citizens born in HKSAR or residing in Hong Kong for seven years are eligible. Article 22 requires approval for entry into HKSAR for settlement purposes. The Hong Kong government faced a lawsuit regarding children born in mainland China with at least one parent eligible for permanent resident status in Hong Kong. The lawsuit claimed these children had the right of abode in Hong Kong under Article 24. The government argued that approval from the Chinese government was required under Article 22. The case raised concerns about the potential influx of 1.6 million eligible children from China, which could strain Hong Kong's resources. The Hong Kong government faced a lawsuit over children born in mainland China with at least one parent eligible for permanent resident status. Concerns arose about the potential strain on resources due to the influx of 1.6 million eligible children. The Court of Final Appeal ruled in favor of a broad definition of eligibility, prompting Chief Executive Tung to seek interpretation from the NPC Standing Committee. The Committee sided with the government for a more restrictive interpretation of the Basic Law. The Standing Committee ruled that children could only emigrate to Hong Kong if a parent was a permanent resident at their birth. Critics called it a \"reinterpretation\" of the Basic Law, leading to protests. This raised concerns about the independence of Hong Kong's courts and the protection provided by the Basic Law. The number of civil cases in Hong Kong doubled from 8,161 in 1996 to 17,270 in 2006, attributed to the increased use of Chinese in courts and greater legal awareness among the population. This rise reflects a growing concern for legal rights among Hong Kong people. Since the Handover in 1997, Hong Kong has seen the emergence of larger political parties organized around shared political perspectives, with some older parties undergoing a generational shift. People in Hong Kong tend to vote based on their opinion of the politician rather than loyalty to a specific party. This shift in political landscape has been influenced by economic difficulties and increased legal awareness among the population. The major Hong Kong political parties are divided into \"pro-democracy\" and \"pro-Beijing\" factions. The leading \"pro-democracy\" parties include the Democratic Party, the Frontier Party, the Civic Party, and the League of Social Democrats. On the other hand, the main \"pro-Beijing\" parties are the Liberal Party and the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong (DAB). The Democratic Party, founded in 1994, has over 600 members and was popular before the Handover in 1997, winning 19 seats in the 1995 Legco elections. Since the Handover, the Democratic Party's political fortunes have declined due to internal disagreements on various issues, including opposition to a minimum wage law. In 2002, some members left and joined the Frontier Party. The Democrats won nine seats in the 2004 Legco elections, down from 19 in 1995. Albert Ho Chun Yat is the current chairman, while Martin Lee Chu Ming stepped down in 2001. The Frontier Party, associated with Emily Lau Wai Hing, saw some ex-Democratic Party members join in 2002. They did well in the 1998 and 2000 Legco elections but only won one geographical seat in 2004. The Frontier Party won only one geographical seat in the 2004 elections. They support a minimum wage law and anti-trust legislation. The Civic Party emerged from protests against anti-sedition legislation in 2006 and became the second largest pro-democracy party in Legco. The LSD, founded in 2006, is the most radical pro-democracy party, associated with activist Leung Kwok Hung. The LSD, also known as \"Long Hair,\" aims to defend grassroots interests and supports minimum wage and anti-trust laws. The Liberal Party, linked to Hong Kong's business community, opposes these laws and takes a conservative stance. The DAB, the oldest major party in Hong Kong, focuses on grassroots support with over 10,000 members. The DAB has the most political support in Hong Kong with over 10,000 members and the most Legco seats. Its chairman, Ma Lik, caused controversy by questioning the severity of the events in Tiananmen in 1989. Factors like the Tung administration's perceived failure and a more critical media have raised political awareness in Hong Kong over the last 10 years. Changes in Hong Kong's government have led to a more open relationship with the population, allowing people to express their views about government officials. Tung Chee Hwa's appointment as the first HKSAR Chief Executive was met with skepticism due to his lack of political experience and perceived ties to Beijing. His administration faced various crises, which were poorly handled, leading to increased political awareness among the people in Hong Kong. The Tung administration's shortcomings in Hong Kong led to increased political awareness and criticism among the population. The Hong Kong media also began covering more political content, with talk radio stations featuring hosts who highlighted government shortcomings. The shift from a British colony to a \"highly autonomous\" region changed the nature of Hong Kong's top government officials, with the Governor and department secretaries being British civil servants in the colonial era. Legco members were also appointed by the Governor during that time. Since the Handover, the selection of the Chief Executive and Legco members is done locally, with top government officials being Hong Kong-born. This shift has led to increased political engagement among Hong Kong residents, who now have different expectations of officials and feel more comfortable expressing their opinions. Hong Kong residents are supposed to continue enjoying the same civil liberties as before the Handover, as outlined in the Joint Declaration. Since the Handover, civil liberties such as freedom of speech, assembly, and press have been generally upheld in Hong Kong under the Basic Law. There have been concerns about threats to these freedoms, but political demonstrations occur regularly with minimal interference from authorities. In 2003, 500,000 Hong Kong residents protested against the \"Article 23\" legislation that could restrict freedom of speech and assembly. The Hong Kong government has allowed protests by groups like Falun Gong, contrasting with China's actions. Article 23 of the Basic Law requires legislation against acts against the Central People's Government. In September 2002, Chief Executive Tung proposed legislation to comply with Article 23, which was met with widespread opposition and growing demonstrations in Hong Kong. Critics argued it could be used for political purposes and extend mainland laws into Hong Kong, while supporters believed it was time for compliance. Public demonstrations increased in response to the debate. As opposition to the proposed Article 23 legislation grew, public demonstrations in Hong Kong escalated. A protest rally on December 12, 2002, was followed by a massive march on July 1, 2003, with over half a million participants. The diverse rally lasted late into the night, surprising government officials with its size and depth of opposition. Support from the \"pro-Beijing\" Liberal Party also waned, with leader James Tien Pei Chun resigning from the Executive Council and advising for a postponement of the legislation. On September 5, 2003, Tung withdrew the proposed Article 23 legislation following massive protests and opposition. The events showed that Hong Kong citizens could influence government policy directly, leading to the formation of the pro-democracy Civic Party. The unrest may have contributed to Tung eventually stepping down. Some attribute Kong's actions to Tung's resignation. While Article 23 raised concerns about civil liberties, ongoing protests by Falun Gong and other groups show Hong Kong's commitment to residents' rights. Despite occasional arrests, Hong Kong courts uphold free speech and assembly rights. Annual rallies support human rights in Hong Kong and China, with Falun Gong protesters near the Star Ferry pier. Protesters near Hong Kong's Star Ferry pier are largely left alone by the police. Concerns about press freedom include allegations of increased self-censorship in the local media since the Handover, with dismissals of critical journalists and announcers. The dismissals of critical journalists in Hong Kong were believed to be driven by fears of losing advertising revenue. The government formed a committee to review public service broadcasting, but suspicions were raised by the Hong Kong Journalists Association due to past attempts to influence program content at Radio Television Hong Kong (RTHK). In March 2007, a committee recommended creating a new public broadcasting entity in Hong Kong. Various proposals for the future of public broadcasting include turning RTHK into an information agency or a not-for-profit entity supported by the government. Selling RTHK to private investors is also being considered. The ICAC searched Hong Kong newspapers' offices in an investigation regarding the disclosure of a witness' name under the witness protection program. The raids raised concerns about press freedom in Hong Kong. The last 10 years have seen major restructuring and transformation in Hong Kong's economy, following severe economic shocks like the Asian Financial Crisis and SARS. While most changes have been positive, there are concerns about future challenges. During the Asian Financial Crisis in the late 1990s, many Southeast Asian economies were affected, leading to significant currency devaluations. The Hong Kong dollar and Chinese renminbi were exceptions due to their link to the U.S. dollar. Despite this, the Hong Kong economy was not completely insulated, facing a speculative attack in 1998 that was countered by a $15 billion intervention by the government. During the Asian Financial Crisis in the late 1990s, Hong Kong's economy faced a speculative attack in 1998, leading to interventions by the government to save the linked exchange rate. This resulted in a sharp decline in real estate prices, stocks, consumer goods, and wage cuts. Despite initial efforts to stabilize real estate values, property prices fell nearly 40% in the third quarter of 1998, causing a deflationary recession with rising unemployment. However, signs of recovery started to emerge in 1999 and gained momentum in 2000. After signs of recovery in 1999 and 2000, Hong Kong faced external shocks with the burst of the \"dot.com\" bubble and the 9/11 attacks. The city's rebound was slower this time, with economic growth between 2001 and 2003 but falling prices and rising unemployment. Confidence in the business community waned, leading to closures of companies and retail stores, impacting Hong Kong's resilience. Hong Kong faced economic challenges due to external shocks like the burst of the \"dot.com\" bubble and the 9/11 attacks. The city's resilience was further tested by the SARS outbreak between November 2002 and July 2003, leading to a significant impact on tourism and local service industries. Despite efforts to recover, the economy remained weak, with calls for leadership from the Chief Executive going unanswered. Ultimately, it was the actions of the government in Beijing that played a crucial role in providing support. The Chinese government's new travel policy, the Individual Visit Scheme (IVS), allowed mainland residents to visit Hong Kong individually, boosting tourism significantly. Between 2001 and 2006, the number of mainland visitors to Hong Kong increased from 4.4 million to 13.6 million, accounting for over half of the city's visitors in 2006. The Individual Visit Scheme (IVS) allowed mainland residents to visit Hong Kong individually, boosting tourism significantly. A mini free trade agreement called CEPA provides Hong Kong companies preferential access to the Chinese mainland markets, eliminating import tariffs for over 1,400 types of products. The impact of IVS and CEPA on Hong Kong was strong, bringing relief to the city's ailing industries. The influx of mainland tourists brought large quantities of renminbi and pressure on Hong Kong's services sectors to learn Mandarin. Hong Kong's economy experienced strong growth after the SARS outbreak and the introduction of the IVS, with real GDP growing at rates comparable to its last expansionary period before the Handover. Unemployment rates gradually declined, and confidence in the economy and businesses of Hong Kong improved. The Handover led to increased economic interaction between Hong Kong and the Chinese mainland, with Hong Kong previously seen as a regional economic hub. However, due to the Asian Financial Crisis, investment flows to Southeast Asia decreased. The rapid growth of the Chinese economy has made it a more attractive market for Hong Kong's companies. The Chinese economy's growth has attracted Hong Kong companies for business expansion, leading to deeper economic ties post-Handover. The Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement (CEPA) has facilitated trade between the two regions despite being separate customs territories. Hong Kong companies investing in China are treated as foreign entities under Chinese law. Under CEPA, Hong Kong has gained a competitive advantage in China by allowing tariff-free imports of over 1,400 products and providing greater market access for service sectors. Hong Kong companies can establish wholly-owned subsidiaries in China and offer financial services denominated in renminbi. Additionally, Hong Kong practitioners have privileges in providing certain professional services in China. Under CEPA, Hong Kong residents have advantages in converting currency, opening renminbi checking accounts, and exporting goods to China tariff-free. Research shows an increase in domestic exports to China and capital investment induced by CEPA in both manufacturing and services sectors. CEPA, a bilateral agreement between China and Hong Kong, aims to expand the scope to include more products and services for Hong Kong businesses. It allows Hong Kong manufacturers to sell to mainland consumers, shifts away from export-oriented operations, opens new business prospects for service providers, and grants improved access to Chinese companies for the financial sector. CEPA is part of the economic development of the pan-Pearl River Delta. According to studies, the economic relationship between Hong Kong and the Pearl River Delta is crucial for both economies. Hong Kong serves as the business hub for the region, focusing on high-value administrative and financial activities, while the Chinese mainland handles operational, support, and manufacturing activities. The combined GDP and trade volume of the Hong Kong-Pearl River Delta region is comparable to China's Yangtze River Delta region, despite utilizing half the land mass and population. The Pan-Pearl River Delta region and the Yangtze River Delta region are both important economic hubs, but the former faces challenges due to immigration and customs borders. Hong Kong businesses are increasingly investing in mainland China, while mainland companies are also investing in Hong Kong. Economic pressures may lead to closer collaboration between Hong Kong and southern China to address border complications. Hong Kong's economic relationship with the Chinese mainland is deepening, with total foreign direct investment reaching nearly $190 billion by 2005. China-related companies make up a third of those listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, with a market capitalization value exceeding $870 billion. Bilateral trade between Hong Kong and China more than doubled in value between 1997 and 2006, with China accounting for 46% of Hong Kong's total trade by 2006. In contrast, trade with the United States saw minimal growth over the same period. The economic relationship between Hong Kong and China has deepened, with trade with the United States declining from 15% to 9% of Hong Kong's total trade. Hong Kong's services exports to China increased from $6.8 billion in 1997 to $16.4 billion in 2005, while imports from China rose from $7.8 billion to $9.1 billion during the same period. China's share of Hong Kong's services exports grew from 19.4% to 26.3%, while its share of services imports decreased from 31.1% to 27.0%. The growing economic ties raise questions about Hong Kong's long-term autonomy as an economic entity. The economic relationship between Hong Kong and China has deepened, with a synergetic dynamic maintained through various institutions and structures. However, there are signs of potential integration into the Chinese mainland economy in the long run, as mainland companies increase their influence in Hong Kong's stock exchange and business activities. Hong Kong's financial sector is also moving towards more renminbi-denominated services. The economic relationship between Hong Kong and China is deepening, with signs of potential integration into the Chinese mainland economy in the long run. Hong Kong's financial sector is shifting towards more renminbi-denominated services, raising concerns about the future of the Hong Kong dollar and its linked exchange rate with the U.S. dollar. The economic integration between Hong Kong and China may blur the distinction between the two economies, potentially impacting Hong Kong's autonomy. The U.S.-Hong Kong Policy Act aims to maintain separate customs territory status for Hong Kong. The U.S.-Hong Kong Policy Act supports Hong Kong's separate customs territory status, most favored nation status, free exchange of currencies, trade of sensitive technologies, and calls for a bilateral investment treaty with the U.S. It also recognizes Hong Kong as an international transport center. The U.S. continues to recognize Hong Kong's ship and airplane registrations and calls for new air service agreements. There have been few changes in U.S.-Hong Kong economic and trade relations since the Handover. Hong Kong is a separate member of the WTO and aids in trade negotiations. The exchange of products subject to U.S. export controls continues smoothly. The two governments concluded a new air services agreement in 2002 to liberalize air services. The U.S. and Hong Kong concluded a new air services agreement in 2002 to liberalize air services. U.S. trade with Hong Kong has shown minimal growth since the Handover, with a slight increase in exports but a decline in imports. Total merchandise trade increased by $300 million over the last 10 years, leading to a $5.0 billion U.S. bilateral trade surplus with Hong Kong. Both exports to and imports from Hong Kong decreased after September 11, 2001, with imports continuing to decline due to manufacturing relocation to mainland China. The relocation of Hong Kong's manufacturing to the Chinese mainland has impacted U.S. service trade with Hong Kong, totaling $8.6 billion in 2005. U.S. exports were $3.7 billion, imports were $4.9 billion, and U.S. foreign direct investment in Hong Kong totaled $37.9 billion by the end of 2005. Concerns about long-term U.S.-Hong Kong trade relations have been raised, despite overall satisfaction with the business environment in Hong Kong among American Chamber of Commerce members. AmCham member companies in Hong Kong are satisfied with the business environment and plan to expand in the next three years. However, they have concerns about U.S. policies, particularly the taxation of foreign earned income, which they see as hindering economic and trade relations. The U.S. tax code changes have increased the effective tax rate for U.S. nationals working in Hong Kong, making it more expensive compared to other expats. AmCham HK is concerned about the high cost of hiring U.S. nationals in Hong Kong, urging companies to hire foreign nationals from other countries instead. They also highlight the issue of air pollution in the city, with frequent high pollution readings and visibility problems across Victoria Harbour. The Hong Kong government is addressing the city's air pollution issue, which has worsened since the 1980s due to factors like factory emissions from Guangdong Province and increased traffic congestion. Initiatives like the \"Action Blue Sky\" Campaign and converting taxi cabs to LPG are part of efforts to reduce pollution. The Hong Kong government is taking steps to reduce air pollution by converting vehicles to LPG and working with utility companies. Despite efforts, air pollution remains a significant issue. Additionally, there are concerns about the quality of education for expat children in Hong Kong. The number of Western expats in Hong Kong has significantly declined since the Handover, with a noticeable decrease in British, American, and Canadian expats between 1996 and 2001. This decline is attributed to the removal of British troops and the shift towards more mainland Chinese residents. The change in demographics has altered the international quality of Hong Kong, with more Chinese cultural attributes becoming prominent. Additionally, executive positions in the private sector once held by Western expats are now being filled by others. The influx of mainland Chinese immigrants in Hong Kong is causing tensions within the local population, with some viewing them suspiciously. Claims of mainland immigrants being responsible for a rise in crime, decline in education quality, and loss of good manners are common. The decline in quality of education, rise in crime, and loss of good manners in Hong Kong since the Handover has led to concerns about the middle class. Middle management jobs moving to the Chinese mainland are forcing residents to work harder for less pay, as evidenced by declining salaries and a rising Gini coefficient. The Chinese government is concerned about Hong Kong's middle class, with former director Lu Ping acknowledging the need for more support for them. There is a sense of nostalgia in Hong Kong pre-1997 Handover, with private sadness over the loss of British heritage. Musician Anthony Wong Yiu Ming also played a role in expressing these sentiments. Since the Handover, there is a growing interest in preserving Hong Kong's cultural heritage, including historical buildings of both Chinese and colonial design. Musician Anthony Wong Yiu Ming performed a concert in 1997, featuring a love song that expressed sorrow over a past relationship and appreciation for the other person's influence, while dressed in a British Union Jack outfit. The symbolism of Wong's clothing was not lost on the audience. The Hong Kong government has increased efforts to preserve historical buildings, such as the reconstruction of Murray House in Stanley in 1999. The reconstruction of Murray House in Stanley in 1999 was a significant effort to preserve historical buildings in Hong Kong. Recent debates and protests over the proposed demolition of the Railroad Clock Tower and Queen's Pier reflect a reevaluation of Hong Kong's identity and its relationship with China. In a survey post-Handover, Hong Kong residents identified themselves as \"Hong Kong citizens,\" \"Chinese Hong Kong citizens,\" \"Hong Kong Chinese citizens,\" or \"Chinese citizens.\" A 2006 survey showed a slight shift towards greater association with Chinese identity. Self-identification is significant, with criticism of the Chinese government viewed differently by pro-Beijing and pro-democracy politicians. The issue in Hong Kong revolves around loyalty to Hong Kong and China, with a focus on maintaining Hong Kong's separate identity while also being a gateway to China. The government emphasizes Hong Kong as an international city and bridge to China, but the long-term ability to remain distinct is uncertain. Analysts see few signs of needing significant changes. Most analysts believe there are few issues indicating a need for significant changes in U.S. policies towards Hong Kong. The U.S.-Hong Kong Policy Act is being upheld, with Hong Kong fulfilling its obligations to the U.S. under existing treaties. Congress may consider areas affecting U.S.-Hong Kong relations, with strong support for democracy among Hong Kong residents. In surveys conducted prior to the Standing Committee of the NPC announcement in April 2004, 70-80% of respondents supported direct election of Chief Executive in 2007. Nearly three-quarters supported direct election of Legco before NPC's opposition, with two-thirds continuing support afterwards. Congress can promote Hong Kong's progress towards universal suffrage by monitoring the Committee on Governance and Political Development and assisting Legco in its research. In FY2006, the State Department allocated $450,000 to a project in Hong Kong to strengthen political parties and civil society organizations. The State Department's Country Report on Human Rights Practices for China includes a section on Hong Kong's progress towards democracy. Congress may provide information and resources to Hong Kong's political parties as they consider forming grassroots-based parties. Public opinion polls show no perceived erosion in civil liberties since the Handover in Hong Kong. The Article 23 proposals in Hong Kong are on hold, with Congress considering consultations with Legco on legal options. Economic and trade relations between Hong Kong and the United States are strong, but growth lags behind other economies. The decline of U.S. nationals in Hong Kong may indicate a reduction in presence. The decline of U.S. nationals in Hong Kong may suggest a decrease in U.S. influence. U.S. business representatives suggest Congress re-examine tax laws for foreign income and support efforts to reduce air pollution in Hong Kong. They also propose fostering more international schools with U.S.-aligned curriculum. The author conducted interviews in Hong Kong in 2007 to gather information for a report.
