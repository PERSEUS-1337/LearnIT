    "content": "The EU implemented the REACH directive in 2007 to manage chemicals in EU commerce, consolidating regulations to protect public health and the environment while maintaining industry competitiveness. The legislation applies to nearly all chemicals in EU commerce, including imported chemicals and chemical mixtures. The REACH directive, implemented by the EU in 2007, requires chemical producers and importers to register chemicals with the European Chemicals Agency. Registration is mandatory for chemicals produced or imported in quantities exceeding one metric ton per year, with increasing information requirements as production volume rises. The directive aims to manage chemicals in EU commerce to protect public health and the environment while ensuring industry competitiveness. Registration of new chemicals is required before entering commerce. Pre-registration for existing chemicals ended on November 30, 2008. The first registration deadline for existing chemicals was on November 30, 2010, for \"substances of very high concern\" or those produced in high volumes. The second deadline was on May 31, 2013, for substances produced in a specific range annually. The final deadline is on May 31, 2018, for substances produced or imported in small quantities. Member states evaluate the dossiers. The EU member states evaluate chemical dossiers based on ECHA guidelines and may request additional data for health and environmental assessments. The REACH Community Rolling Action Plan lists substances under evaluation, with 90 high-priority substances identified for risk evaluation. ECHA suspects these substances may pose risks to human health or the environment. ECHA will evaluate 115 substances in the next two years to determine risks and the need for data collection or restrictions. Producers of \"substances of very high concern\" may need authorization for specific uses and must demonstrate risk control measures. Authorization is required for manufacturing, importing, or using chemicals after a certain date. Producers must also provide analysis of possible substitutes or a substitution plan if available. As of October 23, 2013, ECHA has identified 22 substances as substances of very high concern (SVHC) effectively banned in the EU unless authorized by law. A total of 144 chemicals or chemical groups are SVHC candidates for authorization, including carcinogens, mutagens, toxic chemicals, PBTs, and vPvBs. No use of PBTs or vPvBs is allowed unless there is no suitable alternative and the benefits outweigh the risks. Unacceptable risks may lead to restrictions on chemical use. The REACH regulation allows for the authorization and restriction of chemical use based on risks. The U.S. government had concerns about trade implications, such as increased testing costs and timelines for chemicals exported to the EU. Some U.S. chemical industry representatives find REACH regulations impractical due to concerns about the proposed list of \"high concern\" chemicals. The EU chemical industry is worried about compliance costs impacting innovation and competitiveness. National governments in the EU fear economic repercussions, including companies relocating outside the EU to avoid REACH regulations. The EU estimates that 12% of chemicals in commerce may be withdrawn due to the high costs of production and distribution under REACH. The REACH regulation is costly for production and not profitable for distribution. Some end users may be left without needed chemicals if production sources are lost. Despite initial support, some organizations are less enthusiastic about the final regulation, which exempts some chemicals. However, REACH addresses flaws in older EU laws by reducing regulatory requirements for new chemicals while increasing safety information for existing ones, potentially encouraging innovation. REACH regulation in the EU shifts responsibility for chemical safety onto manufacturers, importers, and users, potentially promoting innovation and substitution of less toxic chemicals. Some groups in the US are considering a similar approach to address concerns about slow chemical risk assessment."
