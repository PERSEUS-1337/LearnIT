    "title": "AB 1279",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Chapter 10.7 is added to the Business and Professions Code, establishing the Music Therapy Act. The Act outlines requirements for national certification of music therapists, including education, supervised clinical work, and internship training. Upon completion of AMTA training, individuals can take the national board certification exam by CBMT for the MT-BC credential, demonstrating competence in music therapy practice. Board certification sets a national standard for professionalism and competence in music therapy. The MT-BC credential is awarded by the CBMT upon completion of an approved training program and passing an objective examination. Music therapists must adhere to the CBMT Code of Professional Practice and recertify every five years. The legislative intent is to define music therapy and help identify qualified music therapists. Music therapy is the clinical use of music interventions to address physical, emotional, cognitive, and social needs in various settings. Treatment plans are tailored to individual or group clients, setting goals and strategies for therapy services. Music therapy interventions include music improvisation, receptive music listening, songwriting, lyric discussion, music and imagery, singing, music performance, learning through music, music combined with other arts, music-assisted relaxation, music-based patient education, electronic music technology, adapted music intervention, and movement to music. An individual providing music therapy must have a bachelor's degree from an approved music therapy program to use the title \"Board Certified Music Therapist.\" The current requirements for certification for the MT-BC credential include 1,200 hours of supervised clinical work and internship training. Music therapists are not authorized to provide mental health counseling, psychotherapy, or occupational therapy without the proper license. Using the title \"Board Certified Music Therapist\" without meeting the requirements is considered an unfair business practice under Chapter 5 of Part 2 of Division 7."
