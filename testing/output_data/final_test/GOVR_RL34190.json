    "content": "In 1997, a new strain of avian influenza (\"bird flu\") named H5N1 emerged in Hong Kong, killing six people. It has since spread to other countries, infecting over 300 people, with a high mortality rate. Concerns have been raised about a global human pandemic. A flu pandemic could strain public health systems worldwide, affecting infrastructure and commerce through absenteeism and supply chain disruptions. Public health functions in the US are decentralized, with states leading disease surveillance and quarantine efforts. The federal government provides funding, guidance, and technical assistance to state and local planners for public health threats, but has limited authority to direct planning efforts. National preparedness depends on individual state preparedness. Pandemic planning at all levels is part of broader emergency planning, with similar approaches to leadership and coordination. A flu pandemic presents unique challenges that require specific attention in planning. The federal government provides funding and guidance to state and local planners for public health threats, with a focus on pandemic planning. Key challenges include the simultaneous impact on all jurisdictions, the need for a prolonged response, and potential disruptions to essential services due to high absenteeism. States have received annual federal funding since 2001 for emergency planning, with evolving requirements. The CRS report describes evaluations of states' pandemic preparedness efforts and presents an analysis of state pandemic plans submitted to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services in July 2005. States were not given specific direction on plan content and were not required to update plans during subsequent grant cycles. Since July 2006, states have received federal funding for emergency planning. Since July 2006, states have received dedicated funding for pandemic preparedness through federal grants. Additional guidance has emphasized training and exercises, with pandemic planning benchmarks included in a municipal homeland security grant program. For more information on pandemic planning activities, refer to various CRS Reports. The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and federal/state quarantine and isolation authority reports highlight challenges in pandemic preparedness. Recommendations for future planning efforts are suggested, but the report will not be updated. In 2005, CRS worked with NORC to create a database for analyzing state pandemic plans. NORC collaborated with the University of Chicago to develop a database for analyzing state pandemic preparedness plans. The database included information from one pandemic planning document from each state and DC. Comprehensive plans were analyzed first, followed by annexes and brief summaries if comprehensive plans were not available. Out of the 51 plans analyzed, 14 were referenced. The database analyzed 51 state pandemic plans, with varying levels of detail and publication dates ranging from 2002 to 2006. The plans covered eight key areas of pandemic planning activities. The analysis examined 66 variables related to pandemic planning activities in state plans, covering areas such as Communications, Healthcare Services, and Other Essential Services. The variables were dichotomous, indicating whether plans included mention of a specific activity. The variables were designed to reflect public health preparedness activities and planning challenges outlined in federal guidance documents. The analysis findings have limitations, as the variables were not weighted for importance. The analysis of pandemic planning activities in state plans revealed limitations. Variables were intentionally developed to highlight planning gaps, not to cover all activities in the plans. Some planning elements may be detailed in broader public health or emergency management plans not analyzed. Some states have only provided brief summaries of pandemic plans, and certain tasks may be delegated to local officials. The analysis of state pandemic plans revealed limitations in delegation of response tasks to local officials and lack of detailed operational plans for certain aspects of pandemic planning. Efforts to standardize analysis were subjective, and the analysis reflects a snapshot in time of a dynamic national planning effort. The database contains state pandemic plans available as of July 2006. The analysis of state pandemic plans in July 2006 revealed limitations in delegation of response tasks to local officials and lack of detailed operational plans. Efforts to standardize analysis were subjective, and the analysis reflects a snapshot in time of a dynamic national planning effort. The analysis does not intend to grade or rank individual state pandemic plans but emphasizes the importance of national preparedness for pandemic flu being dependent on individual state preparedness. Areas with fewer \"yes\" responses may indicate where future planning efforts need added emphasis. The federal government has provided funding and guidance for state pandemic preparedness efforts since FY2002. States have received grants from various agencies to improve public health capacity and healthcare system preparedness. However, there has been no comprehensive assessment of state pandemic planning efforts published. While agencies evaluate state compliance with requirements, none have published assessments of states' performance. The HHS Office of Inspector General, White House Homeland Security Council, and Government Accountability Office have reported on federal and state pandemic planning efforts, but there has been no comprehensive assessment of state pandemic planning performance. In 2006, DHS conducted a comprehensive assessment of state preparedness for catastrophic events, evaluating states on various benchmarks related to health and medical preparedness. Results showed that fewer than half of the states were fully sufficient for each benchmark. Researchers from RTI analyzed 49 state pandemic plans in early 2006, noting significant variation among states due to federalism and limited scientific information on flu transmission. They recommended more detailed planning guidance from HHS and further research on interventions like masks and school closures for disease control. The Trust for America's Health (TFAH) published annual \"report cards\" grading states on preparedness benchmarks, including flu testing. They also created a model to assess economic losses from a severe pandemic, predicting tourism and entertainment industries would be hardest hit. The Trust for America's Health (TFAH) published annual \"report cards\" grading states on preparedness benchmarks, including flu testing. They also created a model to assess economic losses from a severe pandemic, predicting that states with high levels of tourism and entertainment would be the hardest hit. In December 2006, the Associated Press (AP) reported on findings of interviews with health officials in every state regarding pandemic planning. Many states had not invested state funds for planning, relying solely on federal funds. Health officials highlighted shortages of healthcare workers as a major bottleneck in ramping up health system capacity during a pandemic. There was a lack of consensus on certain planning elements, such as school closures and antiviral drug stockpiling. The findings for 66 variables in state pandemic plans were tabulated and discussed. In the analysis, state plans were reviewed for specific planning assumptions related to pandemic flu. These assumptions aim to ensure consistency and relevance in planning efforts, such as anticipating high absenteeism rates during a severe pandemic. The HHS Pandemic Plan outlines overarching planning assumptions, including the universal and near-simultaneous nature of a pandemic and expected shortages of vaccine and antiviral drugs. Emergency managers have identified unclear lines of authority as a significant issue in disaster response. The Incident Command System (ICS) was developed in the 1970s to address shortcomings in managing wildfires, such as unclear lines of authority and lack of coordination among responding agencies. The National Incident Management System (NIMS) was established in 2002 by Congress to ensure effective collaboration among responders from different jurisdictions and disciplines during disasters. DHS serves as the focal point for federal disaster preparedness and response activities, refining delegations of authority among key federal response agencies. State and federal response agencies have refined delegations of authority and coordination mechanisms for emergency management. State agencies must adopt uniform practices for federal grant funding. Analysis shows that state plans for flu pandemic response vary in mentioning leadership and coordination variables. Only a few plans mention the National Incident Management System (NIMS), despite it being a requirement for federal preparedness funds. State plans for flu pandemic response vary in mentioning leadership and coordination variables, with only a few mentioning the National Guard's possible role. It is important to specifically outline how the National Guard could be utilized during a pandemic, as it is a state response asset under the Governor's control. Most plans mention pandemic flu exercises, but only a few mention both NIMS and the National Guard. States were required to conduct public health emergency response exercises and develop pandemic plans as conditions of their FY2005 CDC grants. Congress later mandated pandemic flu exercises for states to establish procedures for quarantine, surge capacity, diagnostics, and communication. CDC guidance required testing of community gatherings control, medical surge capacity, and mass vaccination/prophylaxis. Funds were provided in July 2006 for these exercises. The only national multi-sector pandemic exercise reported has been a table-top simulation conducted by members of the Cabinet. CDC coordinates domestic surveillance for seasonal flu. State and local health departments report information to flu surveillance systems run by CDC. Challenges in rapid detection of novel flu viruses include vague symptoms and difficulty in distinguishing specific strains. Many state pandemic plans include laboratory-based surveillance for flu-like illness, but most do not integrate human and animal flu surveillance data or use syndromic surveillance. There is considerable variation among states in planning for surveillance and detection during a pandemic. Many state pandemic plans lack procedures for screening international travelers for influenza and struggle with vaccine rationing during a pandemic. Vaccines must be matched to specific strains for good protection, but production is time-consuming, leading to shortages in the early months of a pandemic. Policymakers face challenges in balancing competing goals for vaccine distribution. About two-thirds of state plans discuss priority groups for vaccination. Only six state plans attempted to enumerate individuals in priority groups for vaccination during a pandemic, which is crucial for matching vaccine supply to demand and advising officials and the public on who should receive the vaccine. Most states planned to follow federal guidelines for vaccine prioritization. Federal recommendations prioritize healthcare workers and first responders for vaccination to ensure they can continue working and prevent the spread of illness. Following them are individuals at high risk for serious flu complications. However, criticism exists for not addressing other planning goals like essential service continuity and vaccinating populations likely to spread the flu. Global analysis shows variability in vaccine priority schemes, especially regarding children, highlighting the lack of consensus on this issue. States' efforts to plan for vaccine procurement and distribution during a pandemic may have been complicated by uncertainty about the ways in which vaccine may be made available. Federal funding has supported the development of pre-pandemic vaccines, but it is unclear if the government would purchase matched vaccines during a pandemic. Centralized control could simplify planning efforts but may also have significant drawbacks. The HHS Pandemic Plan outlines the distribution of vaccines through existing commercial channels and distribution mechanisms. Congress passed the Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Act in 2006 to track the initial distribution of federally purchased flu vaccine during a pandemic. During a pandemic, unlicensed flu vaccine may be used under FDA's IND provisions, requiring strict control and tracking. Vaccine parity, indicating the number of doses received, is crucial for effective use. Most state plans address vaccine adverse event tracking but not IND protocol conduct. During a pandemic, state plans focus on vaccine adverse event tracking and delegate vaccine management to local health departments. Coordination between state and local efforts is crucial for effective vaccination campaigns. Stockpiling antiviral medications is a priority, with the federal government aiming to treat 75 million individuals. States were expected to procure 31 million of the 75 million treatment courses of antiviral drugs during a pandemic. A survey found that 24 states lacked funding to purchase the planned amounts. HHS proposed priority groups for antiviral drugs, similar to vaccine management, with a focus on treating severe flu cases first. Only 29 state plans addressed priorities for antiviral drugs. Most state plans did not address the implementation of Investigational New Drug (IND) protocols for unlicensed antiviral drugs, but about half mentioned adverse event tracking. Isolation and quarantine authority is generally based in state law, crucial in the response to SARS but less likely to be successful. Influenza has a shorter incubation period than SARS, making it difficult to identify persons who should be quarantined. More than half of the plans discussed isolation and quarantine procedures during a pandemic, with some mentioning the authority to compel isolation and quarantine. Only two plans discussed the use of judicial review to protect civil liberties. This may indicate a gap in state legal preparedness for public health threats. States have revised public health authorities since the 2001 terrorist attacks, but the scope still varies. Only nine plans mentioned designated locations for isolation and quarantine, with \"home\" being a common choice. This reflects the assumption that healthcare facilities could be overwhelmed during a pandemic. Ill individuals could receive care in healthcare facilities, including alternate ones, while those exposed or mildly ill could be isolated at home. Few pandemic flu plans discussed large congregate isolation facilities. Less than one-third of plans detailed social distancing measures like school closures and work leave policies. CDC published a guide in 2007 for interventions such as isolation, quarantine, and teleworking. States have been required to develop public health emergency risk communication plans since FY2002. The HHS Pandemic Plan emphasizes the importance of effective risk communication during a flu pandemic to manage public expectations, address rumors, and ensure public cooperation. States can assist localities in public communication by maintaining a common website and providing expert resources. During a pandemic, public communication is crucial. Two-thirds of plans designate a lead public information official, often an employee of the state health department. Some plans create a joint communications function, following the National Incident Management System. However, not all plans address training, outreach, monitoring of information, and maintenance of public information resources. During a pandemic, there is a concern that medical surge capacity could be a weakness in preparedness. The healthcare system operates at full capacity and relies on a just-in-time supply chain. Stockpiling vaccines and supplies is important, but the healthcare workforce may be the limiting factor in delivering services during a pandemic. An influenza pandemic could disrupt the healthcare system in various ways. During a pandemic, the healthcare system may face challenges such as deferral of elective procedures, diversion of patients, protective quarantines, and scarcity of resources. Traditional mass casualty management strategies may not be effective during a pandemic due to the widespread nature of the disease. Options to expand healthcare capacity include stockpiling supplies and altering standards of care. During a pandemic, healthcare systems may need to implement altered standards of care, such as providing healthcare at alternate sites and changing staffing ratios. States also discussed deploying the Strategic National Stockpile for emergency supplies. During a pandemic, states may need to rely on the Strategic National Stockpile for emergency supplies, but it may not be sufficient to sustain general healthcare services nationwide. Few state plans address stockpiling drugs and supplies or expanding healthcare capacity, including medical surge capacity, workforce surge capacity, and alternate healthcare sites. Mental health and psycho-social support for citizens are also not adequately addressed in most plans. Only one-third of pandemic plans specifically address mental health and psycho-social support for responders, and the management of mass fatalities. A severe pandemic could result in 1.9 million deaths, causing high absenteeism and disruptions in essential services. Coordination between federal, state, local governments, and the private sector will be crucial for a comprehensive response. The National Strategy and HHS Pandemic Plan released in 2005 led to pandemic planning summits in all 50 states. The National Governors Association developed a pandemic planning guide for governors and launched regional workshops to examine state pandemic planning in non-health areas. The workshops focused on governance, maintenance of essential services, and coordination of response strategies among levels of government during a pandemic. Table 8 presents findings on the continuity of essential services during and after a pandemic. Few state plans mentioned emergency food distribution, public utilities, and re-establishment of routine functions like schools and businesses. Findings highlighted gaps in pandemic flu planning, with many variables not mentioned. The analysis may underestimate the robustness of state plans, but emphasizes the importance of having a plan in place. The state pandemic flu plans analyzed reflected authorship by public health officials, addressing core functions like surveillance and vaccine management. Challenges remain in prioritizing limited medical assets, coordinating surveillance for early detection, and addressing legal liability issues. Few plans covered leadership, coordination, and continuity of non-health services, highlighting gaps in pandemic flu planning. This analysis focused on pandemic planning at the state level, highlighting the decentralized nature of public health authority and the challenges it poses. Local health departments have varying degrees of autonomy, complicating planning efforts. Variability among states in pandemic planning has been noted, with the federal government unable to dictate preparation measures directly to states. The federal government cannot directly dictate state pandemic preparedness measures, but can establish requirements for federal funding. Flexibility is needed for states to prepare for different threats. Pandemics may require more standardized planning and federal directives due to their predictable nature, but uncertainties complicate uniform planning efforts. The CRS database analyzed state pandemic plans available as of July 2006, with states required to submit plans to HHS in July 2005. States were not given specific direction on plan content or updates during FY2005 funding cycle. FY2006 guidance emphasized exercises, assessments, and assistance to local jurisdictions, but did not explicitly require plan updates. This reflects a broader trend in disaster preparedness. The focus on disaster preparedness has shifted towards evaluating exercises and drills to test response capabilities, rather than solely on planning. The Homeland Security Exercise and Evaluation Program (HSEEP) provides a standardized approach for conducting and evaluating exercises, but its application to pandemic flu preparedness is not specified. The RAND Corporation, contracted by HHS, developed the Public Health... The RAND Corporation, under contract from HHS, developed the Public Health Preparedness Database for flu preparedness. It includes evaluation criteria for exercises and a searchable database of exercises used to evaluate public health preparedness. There are two local exercises for pandemic flu, but none at the state level. Federal pandemic planning in the US has focused on the public health sector for decades, with recent emphasis on multi-sector preparedness due to the threat of H5N1 avian flu. The federal government has been engaged in multi-sector planning efforts since 2005, including scenarios for various incidents. Congress has provided almost $8 billion in grants to states for public health and hospital preparedness since 2001. The federal government has provided grants through two programs administered by CDC and HRSA to improve public health capacity and prepare healthcare facilities for mass-casualty events. Grants are administered at the state level by the State Health Official, with requirements for local consultation and funding pass-through. States and DC were required to develop pandemic flu plans starting in FY2004. States and DC were mandated to develop pandemic flu plans starting in FY2004, with submissions due to CDC by July 2005. Plans were voluntarily developed earlier, but the FY2004 requirement did not reference this. All states and DC met the July 2005 deadline for plan submissions, which coincided with the deadline for FY2005 cooperative agreement funds applications. The FY2005 guidance reiterated the need for pandemic flu plans, referencing the earlier voluntary guidance. Many plans, some updated post-deadline, are publicly available on an HHS website. In FY2005, states were not required to revise their pandemic flu plans submitted by the July 2005 deadline. In November 2005, HHS published the HHS Pandemic Influenza Plan, which provided detailed activities for state and local jurisdictions to respond effectively to a pandemic. Activities included surveillance, healthcare planning, infection control, vaccine distribution, public health communications, and workforce support. In May 2006, the White House Homeland Security Council published the National Strategy for Pandemic Influenza, Implementation Plan, assigning over 300 preparedness tasks to various government departments. Congress provided $6.1 billion in emergency funding for pandemic preparedness in FY2006, including $600 million for state and local preparedness administered by the CDC. The CDC administered pandemic funding to states and territories through the public health preparedness grant program. States were required to conduct community-wide planning, exercises, and drills. Supplemental funding was provided in phases from spring to fall 2006, with an additional $175 million in FY2007. Targeted state funding for pandemic preparedness was given after the July 2005 deadline for pandemic plans submission. States were expected to use public health and hospital preparedness funds for pandemic planning before this funding became available. Ongoing pandemic planning efforts are expected. Pandemic planning efforts are ongoing and supporting documents are continually updated. States submitted pandemic plans to HHS by July 2006, with guidance emphasizing exercises and assistance to local jurisdictions. States were not given specific direction on plan content in July 2005 and were not required to update plans during FY2005 funding cycle. The Department of Homeland Security administers grant programs for disaster preparedness, including the Metropolitan Medical Response System program which incorporated pandemic planning in FY2006. Other grant programs may mention pandemic preparedness but do not have specific requirements or benchmarks. The MMRS program initially awarded contracts to municipalities for disaster response. The MMRS program awards contracts to municipalities for disaster response plans, including planning, training, and equipment purchasing. 124 cities receive annual MMRS awards to develop plans for mass casualty incidents, coordinating efforts among various local entities. Each jurisdiction receives funding to establish or sustain preparedness capabilities and update plans as needed. MMRS guidance for FY2006 emphasized pandemic preparedness in planning and operations documents. The MMRS program awards contracts to municipalities for disaster response plans, including planning, training, and equipment purchasing. 124 cities receive annual MMRS awards to develop plans for mass casualty incidents. MMRS guidance for FY2006 emphasized pandemic preparedness in planning and operations documents, addressing mutual aid agreements, priority dispensing of vaccines, public safety services, legal authorities, and updating COOP and COG plans. The FY2007 guidance added requirements for clear lines of succession, protection of key resources, operation of alternate facilities, and emergency communications. The FY2007 MMRS guidance emphasized pandemic preparedness, including the use of CDC funds for antiviral drugs and ventilators before MMRS funds. Grantees' MMRS plans are not publicly available for analysis."
