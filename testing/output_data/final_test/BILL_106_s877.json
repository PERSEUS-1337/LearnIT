An unaffiliated provider can offer advanced services in competition with the incumbent carrier, and the carrier can seek pricing flexibility by filing a petition with the Commission. If the Commission determines that advanced services are being offered by an unaffiliated provider, the petition of the incumbent carrier will be approved unconditionally. The rates, terms, and conditions of advanced services offered by an incumbent local exchange carrier or its affiliate are not regulated outside their territory. The carrier must file a schedule of charges for advanced services with the Commission if they are not subject to competition. The filing of a schedule of charges for advanced services by an incumbent local exchange carrier or its affiliate will be deemed lawful and effective 2 days after filing with the Commission, unless action is taken by the Commission before the end of that period. The term 'incumbent local exchange carrier' is defined as per section 251(h). SEC. 263 states that section 251(b)(1) does not apply to a local exchange carrier providing advanced services, regardless of other laws."
