    "content": "One of the offsets for raising the defense and nondefense caps in FY2014 and FY2015 in the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 was a reduction in the cost-of-living adjustment for military retirees under the age of 62. Instead of using the full Consumer Price Index, a lower adjustment was implemented until age 62, when beneficiaries would receive a bump-up in their benefit level. This change affected almost all military retirees below the age of 62. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 included a provision to reduce the cost-of-living adjustment for military retirees under 62, saving $6.235 billion for the Department of Defense. This generated debate, with some arguing for a reversal to preserve benefits and others defending the adjustments as minimal compared to lifetime benefits. Some argued that reducing the cost-of-living adjustment for military retirees under 62 would have minimal impact compared to their lifetime benefits. Admiral Winnefeld stated that the increases in military compensation have closed gaps with the rest of the workforce. Military retirement benefits are exceptional as servicemembers do not contribute to their basic retirement benefits, and health insurance premiums for military personnel have been frozen since 1995. Congress reversed the COLA adjustments for disability retirees and survivor benefit recipients in response to concerns about their shorter life expectancies. The FY2014 Consolidated Appropriations Act (H.R. 3547/P.L. 113-76) revised the formula for disability retirees and survivor benefit recipients. Congress further amended the reduced COLA provision to only apply to uniformed service members who joined on or after January 1, 2014. This change effectively excluded all military personnel who joined before 2014 and current retirees from the COLA reduction provision. Only those who join in 2014 or later and qualify for non-disability retirement will be affected. Non-disability retirees who joined in 2014 or later will be subject to the COLA provision, along with REDUX retirees. The first major cohort impacted will be those retiring in 2034. About 40% of military retirees would likely have been affected by the lower COLAs in the original BBA. The demographic portrait in Table 1 shows average age, years of service, and retirement benefits for military retirees. Excluding reservists, 1.6 million military retirees currently receive benefits, with about half below the age of 62. Most would face reduced COLAs for 1 to 10 years based on DOD Actuary statistics. The average disabled retiree retired at age 42 after 22 years of service, receives $30,550 in retired pay per year, and is now 62 years old. Officers generally are several years older. The average retired pay for military retirees varies based on rank, with officers receiving about twice as much as enlisted personnel. New FY2012 retirees were slightly older, had more years of service, and received higher average retired pay compared to earlier retirees. Future retirees would have been more affected by the BBA's lower COLAs. Future retirees would have been more affected by the BBA's lower COLAs than the current beneficiary population because they are generally younger, so the reduced COLAs would have affected them for a longer period of time. The decision to exempt disabled retirees from the lower COLAs may reflect the fact that disabled retirees generally retire at younger ages, meaning that lower COLAs would affect them for a longer period of time, and that their benefits are lower as well. Disabled retirees would have experienced a greater loss of retirement income than nondisabled retirees due to lower COLAs affecting them for a longer period of time. Enlisted disabled personnel would have been more affected than disabled officers in percentage reductions to their income. The original BBA formula would have affected retired personnel differently based on demographic characteristics. Disabled retirees would have been more impacted than nondisabled retirees. CRS used DOD Actuary data and CBO projections to estimate effects on current and future retirees. Average lifetime retirement benefits are $590,000 for enlisted personnel and $1.37 million for officers. Average age of nondisabled current retirees is 61 for enlisted and 66 for officers. The original BBA formula would have affected retired personnel differently based on demographic characteristics. Current disabled military retirees would have received reduced COLAs, with enlisted retirees facing a $13,000 or 3% decrease in lifetime benefits of $390,000, and officers experiencing reductions in lifetime benefits of $440,000. Future military retirees in their early 40s would have been more affected, receiving reduced COLAs for about 18 years. Future nondisabled military retirees in their early 40s would have received reduced COLAs for about 18 years until the age of 62. CRS calculated the effect on retirement income for enlisted and officer retirees under the BBA formula, showing a potential impact of lower COLAs on average lifetime retirement income. Enlisted and officer retirees would see a reduction in lifetime retirement benefits due to lower COLAs. Enlisted personnel would receive $1.67 million instead of $1.73 million, a 4.0% decrease over 36 years. Officers would get $3.74 million instead of $3.83 million, a 2.3% decrease over the same period. The estimates are based on joining the military at age 21 for enlisted personnel and age 23 for officers, retiring in their 40s, and receiving reduced COLAs until age 62. The Defense Department Actuary projected a life expectancy of 84 for the average officer, with disabled retirees facing a greater impact from reduced COLAs due to retiring at younger ages. Disabled retirees would have fewer years with full COLA benefits compared to nondisabled retirees. The majority of currently disabled retirees would have experienced several years of reduced COLAs if the original BBA had remained in effect. CRS estimated the impact of reduced COLAs on future disabled military retirees. Enlisted personnel would have received $1.16 million instead of $1.29 million, a 9.6% reduction over 37 years. Officers would have received $2.60 million instead of $2.74 million, a 5.3% decrease over 38 years. The estimates were based on DOD Actuary data for average disabled retirees. Under the original BBA, disabled retirees faced double the potential impact compared to nondisabled retirees. Some disabled retirees may also receive additional income from Combat Related Special Compensation (CRSC) or Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) disability benefits. Concurrent receipt allows certain disabled military retirees to receive CRSC or VA disability benefits on top of their DOD retirement benefits if their disability is combat-related or assessed at 50% or higher."
