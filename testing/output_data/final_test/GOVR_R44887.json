    "content": "In recent decades, efforts have been made to improve educational attainment levels of students with disabilities through federal policies and supports. Data collection has also been enhanced to track relevant trends. This report discusses policies promoting educational attainment and trends in high school graduation and college enrollment for students with disabilities. It starts with laws related to education at secondary and postsecondary levels. The report provides an overview of data on transition-aged students with disabilities, federal legislation, and factors influencing high school graduation rates and postsecondary enrollment. It focuses on federally funded studies of students with disabilities at secondary and postsecondary levels, without delving into existing research or detailed comparisons of rights and services. The IDEA, enacted in 1975 and reauthorized in 2004, provides special education services for children with disabilities aged birth to 21. Approximately 13% of K-12 students received IDEA services in the 2013-2014 school year. States receive grants to support special education services, including individualized education programs (IEP) for qualifying students. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) provides special education services for children with disabilities aged birth to 21. Qualifying students receive an individualized education program (IEP) and a free appropriate public education (FAPE) in the least restrictive environment. Transition services for students aged 16 and older focus on improving academic and functional achievement to facilitate their movement from school to post-school. The IDEA supports students with disabilities in transitioning from school to post-school activities based on individual needs, strengths, and interests. It includes instruction, related services, community experiences, employment objectives, and daily living skills. Amendments to the IDEA have increased accountability for improving the performance of students with IEPs. The Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) reauthorized the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) in 2015, emphasizing students' progress towards educational goals, requiring states to develop performance indicators, and reporting on state and student progress every two years. ESEA is the largest federal aid source for K-12 education, supporting low-achieving students in schools with high poverty levels through programs like Title I-A. The ESEA's Title I-A program includes educational accountability requirements for states, LEAs, and schools to receive funds. Amendments under NCLB aimed to promote educational progress for all students, including those with disabilities. While not specifically targeted, students with disabilities are impacted by accountability provisions. States were required to develop accountability systems under NCLB, affecting students with disabilities. The NCLB provisions required states to develop accountability systems to track student progress, including specific subgroups like students with disabilities. Student proficiency and graduation rates were monitored, with consequences for schools that did not meet academic standards. The NCLB and ESSA emphasize holding all students, including those with disabilities, to the same academic standards and closing achievement gaps. Schools must focus on the academic progress and graduation rates of students with disabilities. The HEA, enacted in 1965 and reauthorized in 2008, authorizes student financial aid programs for postsecondary education. Funding for HEA programs is provided through appropriations acts. The Higher Education Act (HEA) authorizes student financial aid programs for postsecondary education, including targeted grant programs for students transitioning into postsecondary education and grants supporting program and institutional development at colleges and universities. Specifically, programs like TRIO Student Support Services (SSS) and Comprehensive Transition and Postsecondary (CTP) programs provide support and assistance to students with disabilities. The TRIO SSS program aims to improve retention and graduation rates for low-income, first-generation college students. The TRIO SSS program aims to support students with disabilities, limited English proficiency, and those traditionally underrepresented in postsecondary education. The U.S. Department of Education provides grants to Institutions of Higher Education to offer services to participants, with a focus on low-income, first-generation college students. The CTP programs for students with intellectual disabilities, funded through the HEOA, served around 1,000 students in SY2015-2016. These programs offer transition support without the requirement of a recognized credential or specific duration, focusing on curriculum advising and participation. The education laws require students with intellectual disabilities to receive curriculum advising, participate in courses with non-disabled students, and prepare for employment. Two civil rights laws, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act, protect students from discrimination based on their disabilities in education. Accommodations such as extended test time and accessible classrooms are provided under Section 504. Students with disabilities are entitled to accommodations like large print or braille materials. Section 504 ensures a Free Appropriate Public Education (FAPE) and individualized plans for K-12 students. Postsecondary institutions must provide academic adjustments and access under Section 504. In SY2011-2012, over 6 million K-12 students were served under IDEA, while nearly three-quarters of a million were served under Section 504. At the postsecondary level, students with disabilities attending IHEs protected by Section 504 coordinator for accommodations like extended time on tests and physical access to campus facilities. The ADA broadens the definition of disability to include those perceived as having a disability. The ADA and Section 504 protect individuals with disabilities in various aspects of life. The ADA aims to eliminate discrimination against individuals with disabilities by providing broad nondiscrimination protection in employment, public services, accommodations, transportation, and telecommunications. The ADA Amendments Act was passed in 2008 to reinstate a broad scope of protection following narrow interpretations of the term \"disability\" by the courts. The ADA and Section 504 require equal access for people with disabilities in educational institutions from pre-K to postsecondary levels. The ADA extends rights to access facilities and accommodations, allowing participation in public and private activities. Federal data tracks students with disabilities transitioning from secondary to postsecondary education. The percentage of students with disabilities graduating with a regular high school diploma has increased substantially since SY1995-1996, with a rise from less than 30% to over 70% two decades later. Dropout rates among secondary school-aged students served under IDEA have declined from nearly 46% to 18% in SY2014-2015. States report annually to ED the number of students with disabilities transitioning from secondary to postsecondary education. Dropout rates for students with disabilities have decreased from 46% in the mid-1990s to 18% in SY2014-2015. States report annually to ED the number of students with disabilities who graduate from high school with a regular diploma. Students must meet the same academic standards as those without disabilities to be included in the data. The Adjusted Cohort Graduation Rate (ACGR) for students with disabilities has been tracked since SY2013-2014, showing a decrease in dropout rates from 46% in the mid-1990s to 18% in SY2014-2015. This more precise estimate allows for comparison to the general population's graduation rates, highlighting improvements in educational outcomes for students with disabilities. The ACGR data for students with disabilities increased more than the general student population from SY2013-2014 through SY2014-2015, but remained 20 percentage points lower overall. Data on students with disabilities graduating with a regular diploma provides a complete picture of secondary students served by IDEA. Comparing graduation rates of students with and without disabilities would require further ACGR data analysis. The predecessor legislation was reauthorized in 1983, leading to the first National Longitudinal Transition Study (NLTS) tracking students with disabilities from ages 13 to 21 as they transitioned from high school to adult life. The study revealed that students with disabilities were more likely to be male, poor, and minorities, often dropped out of high school without a diploma, and had limited access to transition planning. The National Longitudinal Transition Study-2 (NLTS2) found that over 80% of secondary school-aged students with disabilities named postsecondary education as a primary goal in their transition plans. Within eight years of leaving high school, 60% of students with disabilities enrolled in postsecondary education, with most starting within a year. They mostly enrolled in two-year programs or community colleges. Students with disabilities primarily enrolled in two-year programs or community colleges (44%), vocational, business, or technical schools (32%), and four-year colleges or universities (19%). They typically enrolled full-time (71%) working towards a diploma or certificate (90%). Many no longer identified as disabled in postsecondary education, with only 28% disclosing their disabilities for accommodations. Only 19% of postsecondary students with disabilities received accommodations from their schools, with the most common being extra time for tests. The NLTS2 study provides insights into the transition of students from high school to postsecondary life in the early 2000s, but may not reflect current outcomes. A new NLTS study started in 2012. The NLTS 2012 study aims to provide insights into the characteristics and outcomes of young adults with disabilities transitioning from high school to postsecondary education and life. It complements the NLTS2 findings and recent data on graduation and college enrollment rates, offering a more accurate picture of students with disabilities in this transition period. The NPSAS also includes a survey on students with disabilities at Title IV postsecondary institutions. In the most recent NPSAS administration, 11% of undergraduates and 5% of post-baccalaureate students reported having a disability. Male and female undergraduates reported disabilities at similar rates, with significant differences in characteristics such as veteran status and age. Older students and veterans had higher rates of reported disabilities. The NPSAS data cannot be compared across years due to changes in survey questions. The increase in postsecondary students self-identifying as disabled may reflect reluctance to adopt the disability label in new institutions, rather than actual increases in disabilities among older undergraduates. The increased rates of students with disabilities graduating from high school and pursuing postsecondary education may be influenced by factors such as higher earnings, self-sufficiency, and changes in the postsecondary landscape. Unemployment rates among 16 to 24 year olds after the 2007-2009 recession may have also played a role in declining high school dropout rates and increasing postsecondary enrollment. Several congressional actions, including P.L. 101-476 (IDEA; 1990), have contributed to the increasing percentages of students with disabilities graduating from high school with a regular diploma and enrolling in postsecondary education. P.L. 101-476 introduced requirements for transition services in IEPs for students turning 16, setting goals for postsecondary life and services needed to achieve them. It also added new disability categories like autism and traumatic brain injury. The growth in autism and traumatic brain injury (TBI) categories under IDEA has been significant, with autism now accounting for nearly 10% of all children with IEPs. More than two-thirds of students with autism and three-quarters of students with TBI graduated from high school with a regular diploma in SY2014-2015. Legislation like IDEA and NCLB have required students with IEPs to participate in statewide assessments and relate their programming to achievement in the general education curriculum. States were also mandated to establish performance goals and include students with IEPs in assessments. The NCLB and IDEA legislation required states to track academic progress of students with disabilities, including those with IEPs, in statewide assessments. These laws emphasized holding all students to the same standards, closing achievement gaps, and expecting proficiency in reading and math. IDEA increased accountability by including students with disabilities in all assessments. The HEOA established a new competitive CTP grant program called Model Transition Programs for Students with Intellectual Disabilities into Higher Education (TPSID), which funds IHEs to create model transition programs for students with intellectual disabilities from secondary to postsecondary education."
