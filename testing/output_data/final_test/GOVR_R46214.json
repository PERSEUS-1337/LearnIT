The latest report extends the analysis through FY2018, showing a $917.8 billion spending in that year, a 2.2% increase from FY2017. The latest Congressional Research Service (CRS) report shows federal spending on programs for low-income individuals in FY2018 increased by 2.2% to $917.8 billion. These programs have an explicit focus on low-income individuals but vary in purpose, design, and target population. The largest portion of assistance goes to families with working parents and the disabled. Federal spending on low-income benefits and services increased from FY2008 to FY2018, with the largest programs being entitlements. Federal spending on low-income assistance programs increased automatically during the recession, with additional funding provided in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. Spending on these programs rose by 36% during this period, stabilizing in FY2011 and FY2012. However, from FY2012 to FY2018, spending continued to increase steadily, particularly in healthcare for low-income individuals. Federal spending on low-income assistance programs is divided into eight categories: health care, cash aid, food aid, education, housing and development, social services, employment and training, and energy assistance. Health care represents over half of total spending in FY2018, followed by cash aid. The smallest categories are employment and training programs and energy assistance. Figure 2 shows federal spending on benefits for low-income individuals, with health programs dominating. Since FY2012, federal spending on low-income assistance programs has increased, primarily driven by higher spending on health care, particularly Medicaid. Spending on other programs has decreased annually since FY2016. Mandatory spending programs, such as entitlements, provide benefits to low-income individuals, while discretionary spending is determined through annual appropriations. Figure 3 illustrates federal spending in FY2018 on benefits and services for low-income individuals. In FY2018, federal spending on benefits and services for people with low income totaled $917.8 billion. The largest categories such as health, cash aid, and food aid are mainly funded through mandatory spending. Housing is primarily discretionary, while education is split between discretionary and mandatory components like the Pell Grant program. Social services and employment/training have a mix of mandatory and discretionary funding. Energy assistance is entirely discretionary. Of the total spending, $741.2 billion (81%) was allocated to programs receiving only mandatory funding. In FY2018, federal spending on benefits and services for low-income individuals totaled $917.8 billion. The majority of this spending, $741.2 billion (81%), went towards programs with mandatory funding. Health care accounted for 94% of all mandatory spending, with Medicaid alone making up 85% of health care spending. The remaining $176.7 billion was allocated to programs with discretionary funding or a mix of both mandatory and discretionary funding. In FY2018, federal spending on benefits and services for low-income individuals totaled $917.8 billion. The Earned Income Tax Credit, Child Tax Credit, SNAP, Pell Grants, and aid to disadvantaged school districts accounted for the majority of cash aid, food aid, and education aid. TANF provided cash assistance and social services, while SNAP was divided into different categories for spending. SNAP was the largest food assistance program in FY2018, with $63 billion in food assistance and $441 million in employment and training expenditures."
