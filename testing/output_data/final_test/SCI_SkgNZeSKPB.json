    "content": "Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are commonly used for sequence data. Building \"deep\" RNNs by stacking multiple recurrent layers can lead to higher-level abstractions, but stacking too many layers can cause vanishing or exploding gradients. Research investigates gradient propagation in multi-layer RNNs and introduces a new gated cell design to better preserve gradient magnitude, enabling the training of deeper RNNs. The proposed stackable recurrent (STAR) cell enables deeper recurrent architectures with improved performance for sequence modelling tasks on various datasets. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are powerful for sequential data processing, but struggle with long-term dependencies in their basic form. Gated architectures like LSTM and GRU have been proposed to address long-term dependencies in RNNs. However, deeper architectures are known to better capture abstract and longer-term features. Stacking multiple recurrent cells in a feedforward manner has been used to achieve this. In this paper, the focus is on designing the basic recurrent unit to ensure stable vertical gradient flow across layers, avoiding vanishing or exploding gradients. Deep recurrent architectures have shown the ability to extract complex features from input data, especially for image-like data. The need for multi-layer RNNs is apparent for capturing evolution over time in each layer. Gradients flow in two directions, backwards in time and downwards from deeper to shallower layers. The study focuses on stable gradient flow in deep recurrent architectures. It highlights issues with common RNN cells leading to gradient instabilities. The analysis shows how gradient magnitude changes through layers and introduces a new STAR unit to better preserve gradients, allowing for deeper stacking while remaining trainable. The study introduces a new STAR unit to address gradient instabilities in deep recurrent architectures, allowing for significantly deeper and trainable networks compared to conventional units like LSTM and GRU. This innovation leads to improved performance in various experiments with popular datasets. Architectures like GRU require proper initialization for RNN training. Some studies suggest using identity and orthogonal matrices to stabilize training. However, imposing orthogonality throughout training can lead to a more stable gradient flow but may hurt the model's representation power. Introducing skip connections in RNN can help mitigate the vanishing gradient problem. Training deep RNNs remains challenging despite various proposed solutions. Residual connections, gated feedback RNNs, and Recurrent Highway Networks have been introduced to address this issue. However, these architectures still face problems like exploding gradients. Li et al. (2018a) propose a restricted RNN with removed interactions to tackle these challenges. In experiments, Li et al. (2018a) propose a restricted RNN with reduced interactions between neurons in hidden layers to address the exploding gradient problem. While deep CNNs are effective, stacks of convLSTMs struggle to train well. Shallow versions are preferred in practice, such as using a single layer for action recognition (Li et al., 2018b) and two layers for hand gesture recognition (Zhang et al., 2018). The Kalman filter can be interpreted as recurrent networks, providing a probabilistic perspective on RNNs. RNN cells are non-linear transformations mapping input signals and hidden states. The length of input sequences can vary, and the relevant target prediction can be the final state, sequence of states, or a single label. Stacking multiple RNN cells involves passing hidden states between levels. The recurrent neural network (RNN) involves stacking multiple RNN cells on top of each other, passing hidden states between levels. The computation diagram shows the forward pass running from left to right and bottom to top, with gradients flowing in the opposite direction. The analysis reveals that common RNN cells tend to bias towards attenuating or amplifying gradients, affecting their magnitude across the lattice. Common RNN cells are biased towards attenuating or amplifying gradients, destabilizing training of deep recurrent networks. The Jacobian matrix acts as a \"gain matrix\" on gradients to prevent vanishing or exploding. Computing the singular values of the Jacobians is challenging without closed-form expressions. The proposed STAR unit helps preserve gradient magnitudes during backpropagation in deep recurrent networks, unlike vanilla RNN units which amplify gradients and LSTM units which attenuate them. Numerical simulation results support this hypothesis. The curr_chunk discusses the analysis of a novel RNN cell designed to prevent vanishing or exploding gradients. It draws connections to empirical results on GFRNN and proposes that the additional gradient flow benefits LSTM but may be counterproductive for vRNN. The goal is to avoid gradient issues in deep recurrent networks. The analysis focuses on a novel RNN cell designed to prevent vanishing or exploding gradients by examining the impact of design features on singular values. It suggests removing the output gate to address gradient shrinking issues. The proposed STAR cell in the RNN architecture removes the cell state, transfers the tanh non-linearity to the hidden state, and eliminates the input gate to improve performance, based on empirical observations and previous research findings. The STAR unit in the RNN architecture replaces the cell state, moves the tanh non-linearity to the hidden state, and removes the input gate for enhanced performance. It involves a gating variable to fuse previous hidden state and new input, acting like a \"Kalman gain\". The dynamics of the STAR unit are described by equations and Jacobian matrices, showing similarities to vRNN and LSTM cells in gradient preservation. The STAR cell in the RNN architecture maintains healthy gradient magnitudes and requires significantly less memory compared to classical LSTM and recurrent highway nets. It can be trained to greater depths and outperforms well-known RNN baselines on various sequence modelling tasks with different datasets. The study compares different recurrent units (vRNN, LSTM, LSTM with only a forget gate, RHN, and STAR) on various tasks like classifying agricultural crops and hand gesture recognition. The experimental protocol involves training multiple versions with different depths and reporting the model with the lowest validation loss. Performance is measured by the rate of correct predictions. The STAR cell in the RNN architecture shows promising results compared to classical LSTM and recurrent highway nets. The study compares different recurrent units on tasks like classifying agricultural crops and hand gesture recognition. The first experiment uses the MNIST dataset with 28x28 grey-scale images of handwritten digits flattened into 784x1 vectors. The second task, pMNIST, shuffles pixels with a fixed random permutation to create non-local long-range dependencies. The model must remember these dependencies to classify the digit correctly.

The second task, pMNIST, shuffles pixels with a fixed random permutation to create non-local long-range dependencies. The model must remember these dependencies to classify the digit correctly. In the experiments, the propagation through the network increases the gradients for the vRNN and shrinks them for the LSTM. STAR remains stable while other units experience rapid gradient decline or explosion, making STAR the only unit suitable for training deep models. Stacking deeper architectures benefits RNNs but increases the risk of catastrophic training failure, with STAR proving significantly more robust and trainable up to 20 layers on the MNIST dataset. The study evaluates different recurrent units on tasks like classifying agricultural crops using satellite images. The input data consists of sequences of 26 multi-spectral Sentinel-2A satellite images with a ground resolution of 10 m. The images are collected over a 102 km x 42 km area north of Munich, Germany between December 2015 and August 2016. The input data points for the classifier are patches of 3\u00d73 pixels recorded in 6 spectral channels, flattened into 54\u00d71 vectors. The RNN model is sequentially presented with these vectors for classification. The study evaluates different recurrent units on tasks like classifying agricultural crops using satellite images. The input data consists of sequences of 26 multi-spectral Sentinel-2A satellite images with a ground resolution of 10 m. The RNN model is sequentially presented with 54\u00d71 vectors for classification. STAR outperforms all baselines in the tasks, but fails at 14 layers in the single-output task. The reason for this failure is not yet identified, possibly due to cloud cover affecting signal propagation. The study uses the 20BN-Jester dataset V1 to classify hand gestures in short video clips using a convolutional RNN. The model predicts gesture classes by analyzing 32 consecutive frames of size 112\u00d7112 pixels. Increasing the depth of the convRNNs improves performance, with convolutional STAR showing the strongest improvement at 12 layers. The results confirm the effectiveness of deeper networks in gesture classification tasks. The study confirms the effectiveness of deeper architectures for convolutional RNNs in classifying hand gestures. It highlights the advantages of using STAR for deeper networks, showing higher performance and better memory efficiency. The analysis reveals issues with gradient preservation in deep RNNs, leading to the risk of vanishing or exploding gradients as network depth increases. The study introduces the STAckable Recurrent unit (STAR) to address gradient preservation issues in deep RNNs. Evaluation on popular datasets shows STAR units can be stacked in deeper architectures. Future work includes formal mathematical analysis of gradient flow and exploring better initialization schemes for deep RNN training. In training deep RNNs, chrono initialisation is applied for bias terms, with hidden units set to 128. Networks are trained for 100 epochs with batch size 100, using the Adam optimizer. A feedforward layer with softmax activation converts hidden states to class labels. In the RNN layers, the hidden units are set to 128 and trained for 30 epochs with batch size 500 using Adam optimizer. Convolution kernels are 3x3 with 64 filters in each layer. A shallow CNN with 4 layers converts hidden state to label, with filter depths of 128, 128, 256, and 256. Models are fitted with SGD with momentum, batch size 8, starting learning rate of 0.001 decaying to 0.000001 over 30 epochs, and L2-regularization with weight 0.00005 applied to all parameters."
