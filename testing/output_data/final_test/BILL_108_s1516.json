    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Salt Cedar and Russian Olive Control Demonstration Act\". This Act establishes the Salt Cedar and Russian Olive Control Demonstration Program. The Secretary of the Interior, in cooperation with other agencies, will conduct a program to assess and demonstrate solutions for managing salt cedar and Russian olive trees in the western United States, including reestablishing native vegetation and disposing of biomass. The Secretary will assess salt cedar and Russian olive infestation in the western United States, including acreage, severity, control methods, water consumption reduction feasibility, and land restoration challenges. The Secretary will identify long-term management strategies and provide grants to institutions of higher education for public policy development related to the destruction of salt cedar and Russian olive trees, biomass removal, and land restoration. The Secretary will establish a program funding 5 projects to control salt cedar and Russian olive trees in collaboration with various entities. The program will fund 5 projects to control salt cedar and Russian olive trees by implementing various methods, assessing the effects of combining control methods, and determining optimal combinations. The program aims to determine optimal control methods for salt cedar and Russian olive trees, assess soil conditions, define final vegetative states for revegetation, prevent regrowth of invasive trees, monitor water savings, and impacts on groundwater and surface water. The program aims to assess wildfire activity, changes in wildlife habitat, biomass removal methods, economic impacts, and restoration of land. The Secretary will analyze economic means to use or dispose of biomass resulting from salt cedar removal within a year of funds availability. The analysis will determine economic viability of biomass removal from salt cedar and Russian olive trees, build upon existing research on beneficial uses of tree fiber, and explore economic development opportunities through wood product manufacture using biomass from demonstration projects. The assessment, identification, demonstration projects, and analysis will each have specific cost limits: $4,000,000 for assessment, $2,000,000 for long-term management strategies, $7,000,000 for demonstration projects, and $3,000,000 for analysis. The Federal government will cover the full expenses for management strategies, demonstration projects on Federal land, and analysis. For demonstration projects on non-federal land, the Federal share of costs will not exceed 75% for the first 5 years. The Secretary may grant 5-year extensions for long-term monitoring at 100% funding. Non-federal share for projects on non-Federal land can be in the form of in-kind contributions. Cooperation with Federal agencies and other entities is required for assessments, projects, and analysis. The Secretary will subject assessments, management strategies, demonstration projects, and analysis to independent review. An annual report to Congress will detail results, reviews, and fund expenditures. Public access will be facilitated. Authorization of Appropriations: $20,000,000 for fiscal year 2005 and $15,000,000 for each subsequent fiscal year to carry out the Act. Public access to information resulting from the Act will be facilitated by the Secretary. The Senate passed S. 1516 on May 19, 2004, directing the Secretary of the Interior to control salt cedar and Russian olive as part of the Reclamation Projects Authorization and Adjustment Act of 1992."
