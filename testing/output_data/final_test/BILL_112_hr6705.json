The \"Building Efficiently Act of 2012\" introduces a 25-year recovery period for energy-efficient nonresidential real property.

The term 'Standard 90.1-2004' refers to the energy efficiency standard set by the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air Conditioning Engineers and the Illuminating Engineering Society of North America. Related persons are defined as individuals who are part of an affiliated group or have a specified relationship as outlined in tax regulations. The energy efficiency standard 'Standard 90.1-2004' is defined by ASHRAE and IESNA. Related persons are individuals with specified relationships as per tax regulations. Subsection rules apply if 'more than 50 percent' is substituted, and double benefits are denied for buildings under subsection (e)(3)(G). A 20-year recovery period for energy-efficient residential rental property is outlined in section 168(e)(3) of the Code. The text discusses the definition of qualified energy efficient residential rental property under section 168 of the Code.

The taxpayer must elect to apply this paragraph to the building. The certification requirements for a building include being certified to reduce energy costs by 40% compared to a reference building under the International Energy Conservation Code 2004. \"For purposes of determining related persons, individuals can be considered related if they are part of an affiliated group or have a relationship as described in section 267(b), with the threshold of '80 percent or more' replacing 'more than 50 percent' in the subsection.\" The deduction under section 179D shall not be allowed if this section applies to a building by reason of subsection (e)(3)(F)(ii).
