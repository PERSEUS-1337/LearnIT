    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Learning Opportunities With Creation of Open Source Textbooks (LOW COST) Act of 2009\". The College Board reported that students spent $805 to $1,229 on college books and supplies. The gross margin on new college textbooks is 22.7%. College textbook prices have risen at twice the rate of inflation over the last two decades. An open source material project could reduce costs and increase accessibility to educational materials. (5) College-level open source course materials in math, physics, and chemistry are a high-priority initiative. (6) The scientific and technical workforce in Federal agencies, national laboratories, and university-based research programs could contribute significantly. (7) Federal oversight is needed for creating and maintaining standard, publicly vetted textbooks to ensure respect for intellectual property and uphold quality, educational effectiveness, and scientific accuracy standards. SEC. 3. OPEN SOURCE MATERIAL REQUIREMENT FOR FEDERAL AGENCIES. Federal agencies spending over $10,000,000 on scientific education must allocate 2 percent of funds for open source materials collaboration. Agencies must work with NSF and DOE to develop and verify educational open source materials. Federal agencies spending over $10,000,000 on scientific education must allocate 2 percent of funds for open source materials collaboration. The open source materials must include college-level textbooks on physics, chemistry, or math, be posted on the Federal Open Source Material Website, updated annually with the latest research, and free of copyright violations. The grant program is established. The grant program established authorizes grants for eligible entities to create open source educational materials in college-level physics, chemistry, or math. Recipients must also evaluate and report on the effectiveness of the materials produced. The report must be evaluated and reported to the Director and Secretary. $15,000,000 is authorized for fiscal year 2010, with additional funds for each succeeding year. The Director and the Secretary will jointly create regulations for implementing the Act, including standards for open source materials. In this Act, the term \"Director\" refers to the Director of the National Science Foundation. An \"eligible entity\" is defined as an institution of higher education, nonprofit or for-profit organization, Federal agency, or any other organization producing open source materials. The \"Federal Open Source Material Website\" is where agencies must post open source materials for public access and use. The term \"institution of higher education\" refers to an institution defined in the Higher Education Act of 1965. \"Open source materials\" are materials available for free on a website and can be downloaded, redistributed, and altered by the public. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Energy."
