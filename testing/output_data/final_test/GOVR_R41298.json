    "content": "During the first 100 days of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal in 1933, the Securities Act of 1933 and the Glass-Steagall Act (GSA) were enacted to regulate the public offering of securities and prohibit commercial banks from underwriting and dealing in securities. The GSA also prohibited affiliations between banks and securities firms, with further restrictions enacted in the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (BHCA) to prevent companies owning banks from taking ownership or controlling interest in insurance. Banks in the United States are limited in their activities to the \"business of banking\" and face restrictions on proprietary trading. They are subject to various regulations including capital standards, affiliation restrictions, and management interlocking restrictions. Companies owning banks are not allowed to have ownership or controlling interest in insurance companies, securities firms, or other non-banking entities. Banks in the United States are heavily regulated to ensure safe and sound operations, compliance with laws, and consumer protection. Federal banking regulators have enforcement tools to address any issues found during examinations. Being a bank grants access to the federal safety net, including deposit insurance and lending facilities. Securities firms, on the other hand, are primarily regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Securities firms regulated by the SEC focus on registration, risk disclosure, and preventing fraud, rather than safety and soundness. They are not subject to capital and liquidity standards or safety examinations like banks. These firms do not have access to the federal safety net and are not restricted in their activities. The regulatory systems for commercial and investment banks blurred due to competition, financial innovation, and technological advances. The FRB and OCC issued regulations expanding securities activities for BHCs and bank subsidiaries. The GLBA in 1999 furthered this trend by repealing restrictions. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 (GLBA) repealed sections of the GSA and BHCA, establishing the financial holding company (FHC) structure. Calls for reexamining permissible activities for commercial banks post-2008 recession have been made, with proposals for curbs on \"proprietary trading\" in financial regulatory reform bills. The financial regulatory reform bills propose curbs on \"proprietary trading\" by banking institutions, limiting trading unrelated to customer needs and investing in hedge funds or private equity funds. The Volcker Rule, urged by Paul Volcker, is under analysis in both House and Senate bills. Appendices provide full legislative language. The OCC and FRB are empowered to enforce and interpret the rules. The FRB has the authority to enforce and interpret the complexities of the GSA and BHCA. Banks started expanding into securities activities in the 1970s due to factors like high inflation and competition from securities firms. Regulators became more lenient over time, allowing banks to engage in a wider range of securities activities. Regulators became less cautious over time, allowing banks to engage in a greater universe of securities activities. By the 1990s, the FRB had authorized certain BHCs and their subsidiaries to underwrite and deal in various bank-ineligible securities, including municipal bonds, commercial paper, mortgage-backed securities, corporate debt securities, and equity securities. The FRB also approved other securities activities such as investment advice and brokering. The FRB regulates securities-related activities for banks, including agency functions for customers and transactions as principal. This includes underwriting government obligations, trading in swaps and derivatives, and buying and selling bullion. Banks must adhere to limitations and conditions to engage in these activities. Commercial banks gained authority to make proprietary investments in a wider range of securities after GLBA, but generally must be organized as an FHC to do so. The GLBA introduced the FHC, allowing companies to expand into a broader array of financial services. FHCs can engage in activities that are financial in nature or complementary to financial activities, as long as they do not pose a substantial risk to the depository's safety and soundness. The FRB has the authority to issue orders related to these activities. The GLBA authorized the FRB, in coordination with the Treasury Secretary, to issue regulations supplementing the list of permissible activities for FHCs. FHCs with securities or insurance affiliates can engage in merchant banking activities, acquiring shares or assets of companies not otherwise authorized, as part of underwriting or banking activities, held temporarily for up to 10 years. The GLBA authorized the FRB to issue regulations allowing FHCs with securities or insurance affiliates to engage in merchant banking activities, acquiring shares or assets of companies held temporarily for up to 10 years. Restrictions are in place to prevent routine management of the portfolio company by depository institution subsidiaries of the FHC. Executive officers of certain subsidiaries, including securities broker and depository institution subsidiaries, may not serve as executive officers of the portfolio company. The GLBA authorized FHCs to engage in merchant banking activities, allowing temporary management of a portfolio company when necessary for a reasonable return on investment. FRB approval is not generally required unless the investment exceeds a certain level. FHCs can also make merchant banking investments through a private equity fund in nonfinancial companies. Private equity funds can be used by FHCs to invest in nonfinancial companies, as long as certain qualifications are met. The fund must be exclusively engaged in investing in shares, assets, and ownership interests for resale, not be an operating company, have no more than 25% equity held by the FHC, have a term no longer than 15 years, and not be formed to evade merchant banking restrictions. Investments through a private equity fund are subject to a 15-year limitation for FHCs. The Federal Reserve Act imposes limitations on transactions between an FHC and its subsidiaries and private equity fund if control exists. Control is presumed if the FHC controls more than 15% of the private equity firm's total equity, but this presumption can be rebutted with evidence presented to the FRB. The Federal Reserve Act imposes limitations on transactions between an FHC and its subsidiaries and private equity fund if control exists. Control is presumed if the FHC controls more than 15% of the private equity firm's total equity. The FRB issued guidance on FHCs' equity investments and merchant banking activities, focusing on sound policies and practices for investments. The Federal Reserve Act imposes limitations on transactions between an FHC and its subsidiaries and private equity fund if control exists. Control is presumed if the FHC controls more than 15% of the private equity firm's total equity. The FRB issued guidance on FHCs' equity investments and merchant banking activities, focusing on sound policies and practices for investments. FHCs are advised to monitor transactions with portfolio companies to limit risks and ensure transactions are on reasonable terms. GLBA allows banks to affiliate with securities firms within the FHC structure and own financial subsidiaries engaging in similar activities. The GLBA authorized national and state-chartered banks to control or hold interests in financial subsidiaries engaging in various financial activities permitted for FHCs, with exceptions for underwriting insurance, investing in real estate, and certain other activities. The GLBA authorized banks to control or hold interests in financial subsidiaries engaging in activities related to credit insurance, real estate development, merchant banking, and insurance portfolio investing. The Secretary of the Treasury can designate additional financial activities in coordination with the FRB. National banks must meet certain criteria to hold financial subsidiaries engaging in proprietary financial activities. Chairman Paul Volcker urged the Senate Committee to prevent banks from engaging in proprietary and speculative activities like sponsoring hedge funds and private equity funds. He emphasized the need for regulators to have broad and specific authority to define and regulate such activities. Chairman Paul Volcker urged regulators to define and regulate hedge funds and private equity funds to prevent bank-based funds from functioning as such. He also highlighted the importance of addressing the dangers of proprietary trading by bank fund managers to protect institutions and customers. Volcker mentioned that only a few large commercial banks engage in significant proprietary trading activities. H.R. 4173, passed by the House of Representatives, focuses on proprietary trading in certain systemically significant financial holding companies. The bill grants the Federal Reserve authority to ban proprietary trading if it poses a threat to the company's safety or financial stability. Proprietary trading is defined as trading financial instruments with the company's own money. The FRB has the power to make exemptions. The bill grants the Federal Reserve broad power to make exemptions to ban proprietary trading, including exemptions for activities like market-making, risk hedging, and asset valuation. Section 619 of H.R. 4173 requires federal banking agencies to jointly prohibit proprietary trading and investing in hedge funds by covered entities. The Financial Stability Oversight Council, similar to the House bill's Financial Services Oversight Council, must conduct a study within six months of enactment of the legislation. The study will assess the implications of banning proprietary trading and investment in hedge funds, focusing on factors like taxpayer costs, risks to the financial system, and safety of institutions. The Council will then make recommendations based on the study findings.

The Conference Report limits the Council's power to recommend implementation strategies for promoting banking safety, limiting transfers to unregulated entities, protecting taxpayers and consumers, reducing conflicts of interest, limiting risky activities, accommodating insurance company investments, and timing divestiture of illiquid assets. The divestiture of illiquid assets is affected by the implementation of section 619, requiring joint rulemaking by federal banking regulators, the SEC, and CFTC within nine months.
