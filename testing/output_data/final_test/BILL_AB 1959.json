    "title": "AB 1959",
    "content": "The State of California enacts the following. Section 245 of the Penal Code in California is amended to specify punishments for assault with a deadly weapon or firearm. Offenders face imprisonment in state prison or county jail, fines up to $10,000, or both. Any person who commits assault with a machinegun, assault weapon, or .50 BMG rifle faces 4, 8, or 12 years in state prison. Assault with force likely to cause great bodily injury results in 2, 3, or 4 years in state prison or a county jail, or a fine up to $10,000. Assault with a semiautomatic firearm leads to 3, 6, or 9 years in state prison. Any person who commits assault with a deadly weapon other than a firearm on a peace officer, firefighter, or emergency medical technician engaged in their duties faces 3-5 years in state prison. Assault with a firearm on these individuals results in a similar penalty. Any person who assaults a peace officer, firefighter, or emergency medical technician with a semiautomatic firearm while they are on duty faces imprisonment in state prison for five, seven, or nine years. A person who commits an assault with a machinegun, assault weapon, or .50 BMG rifle on a peace officer, firefighter, or emergency medical technician engaged in their duties shall be imprisoned for 6, 9, or 12 years. If a deadly weapon owned by the offender is used, it will be confiscated and disposed of as a nuisance. The term \"peace officer\" in this section refers to individuals designated as peace officers in Chapter 4.5 of Title 3 of Part 2. No reimbursement is required for local agencies or school districts under this act, as any costs incurred would be due to creating a new crime, eliminating a crime, changing penalties, or altering crime definitions."
