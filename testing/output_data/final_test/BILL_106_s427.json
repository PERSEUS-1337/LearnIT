    "content": "The \"Mandates Information Act of 1999\" may be cited as the short title. Congress finds that before acting on proposed private sector mandates, careful consideration should be given to their effects on consumers, workers, and small businesses. The costs of private sector mandates are often borne by consumers, workers, and small businesses in various forms such as higher prices, lower wages, reduced benefits, and hiring disincentives. The purposes of this Act are to improve Congress' deliberation on private sector mandates by providing complete information and ensuring focused deliberation, and to help Congress distinguish between harmful and beneficial mandates. The Act aims to enhance Congress' consideration of private sector mandates by providing comprehensive information and facilitating focused deliberation. It also seeks to assist Congress in distinguishing between detrimental and advantageous mandates. The amended section requires the Director to estimate the indirect impacts of Federal private sector mandates on consumers, workers, and small businesses, including any disproportionate effects on specific regions or industries. The Act aims to enhance Congress' consideration of private sector mandates by providing comprehensive information and facilitating focused deliberation. It requires an analysis of the effect of Federal private sector mandates on worker wages, benefits, employment opportunities, hiring practices, expansion, and profitability of businesses with 100 or fewer employees. The estimate prepared under this paragraph shall not be considered in determining the direct costs of all Federal private sector mandates in the bill. The bill amends the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 to establish a point of order if Federal mandates exceed specified thresholds. It also adjusts threshold amounts for Federal mandates to include both sections 424(a)(1) and (b)(1). The Congressional Budget Act of 1974 is amended to establish a point of order for Federal mandates exceeding specified thresholds. Threshold amounts for Federal mandates in sections 424(a)(1) and (b)(1) are adjusted. Additionally, rulemaking powers of the Senate are exercised by Congress. Congress has the power to establish rules for the Senate and House of Representatives, which supersede other rules if inconsistent. Each House can change these rules at any time, similar to any other rule."
