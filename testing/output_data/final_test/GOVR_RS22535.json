    "content": "The Federal Employee Dental and Vision Benefits Enhancement Act of 2004 established the Federal Employees Dental and Vision Insurance Program (FEDVIP) for federal employees, Members of Congress, annuitants, and dependents. Enrollees are responsible for 100% of the premiums, and eligible family members include a spouse and unmarried dependent children under age 22. Eligible family members for FEDVIP include a spouse, unmarried dependent children under age 22, and qualified disabled children 22 years or older. Former spouses receiving an annuity apportionment, deferred annuitants, and those in FEHB temporary continuation of coverage are not eligible. There are four nationwide dental plans and three regional plans. Three vision plans offer both nationwide and overseas coverage. Enrollment can be done during the standard open season for FEHB plans or following a qualifying life event. New employees have 60 days to enroll. FEDVIP enrollment can be done online at http://www.BENEFEDS.com or by calling 1-877-888-FEDS. Options include self-only, self +1, or family plans, different from FEHB plans. Enrollees can choose dental, vision, or both plans separately. Primary coverage comes from FEHB plans, with FEDVIP plans as secondary. Active workers can contribute to a Flexible Spending Account. Employees enrolled in a FEDVIP dental plan pay premiums based on location, with active workers contributing pre-tax through premium conversion. Unlike FEHB plans, employees cannot opt out of premium conversion. Pre-tax premiums are not available to annuitants. There are no preexisting condition exclusions, but there are waiting periods for orthodontia, which require staying in the same plan. For 2008, FEDVIP dental plans have waiting periods for orthodontia, with no preexisting condition exclusions. Enrollees can switch plans but may restart the waiting period. In-network services reduce out-of-pocket costs. Nationwide dental plans include Aetna, GEHA, MetLife, and United Concordia, with options for high and standard coverage. Regional plans like Triple-S, GHI, and CompBenefits are also available. Only nationwide plans offer overseas coverage and benefits include Class A services. The benefits of FEDVIP dental plans include Class A, B, C, and D services with varying premiums based on geographic location. Aetna's monthly premium for self-only coverage in Washington, D.C. is $28.97, while premiums range from $26.35 to $36.83 depending on the enrollee's location. Comparing dental plan premiums is more complex than FEHB plan premiums, as they vary by location and offer self + 1 and family options. Premiums for national dental plans in Washington, D.C. range from $22.71 to $37.90 for self-only coverage. Aetna had no premium increase, while other plans increased by $1 to $4.50 per month. The dental plan premiums for national plans in Washington, D.C. range from $22.71 to $37.90 for self-only coverage, with varying increases in premiums.

Premiums for self-only coverage range from $71.76 to $103.20, with high-option plans costing $20 to $40 more per year. Spectera had a small premium increase, while the other plans remained the same. Differences in benefits and network limitations exist, such as the requirement to stay in-network for covered services under the FEP BlueVision plan. Enrollees in vision plans like Spectera and VSP are responsible for any cost difference with providers. Covered services include eye exams, choice of lenses, and discounts on non-covered services. Services are scheduled, like exams every 12 months and new frames every 24 months. Plans also offer limited low vision coverage. Spectera's plans allow for an exam and new lenses and frames once a year with copayments for each service. Spectera's vision plans offer coverage for eye exams, lenses, frames, and discounts on non-covered services. Enrollees can choose between standard and high options, with the high option covering additional features like tinted lenses and UV coating. The plans have limited coverage for low vision and provide a schedule of payments for services outside the network. Enrollees can opt for contact lenses instead of glasses, with limits on disposable contacts. Factors to consider before enrolling in FEDVIP include coverage in a FEHB plan, likelihood of using covered services, and the dollar amount to allocate towards the plan. Each prospective enrollee must weigh considerations like coverage in a FEHB plan, likelihood of using covered services, and allocating funds towards the plan. FEDVIP plans are secondary payers to FEHB health plans, with limited dental and vision coverage in nationally available FEHB plans. GEHA added limited vision coverage, offering an annual eye exam with a $25 copayment. Some FEHB HMO-type plans offer more comprehensive dental coverage. Some FEHB HMO-type plans offer comprehensive dental and vision benefits, while high-deductible plans also provide some coverage. Enrollees should compare FEHB coverage to determine if enrolling in FEDVIP is beneficial, considering expected benefits against premiums. For example, individuals who wear glasses and have yearly eye exams may find lower costs by paying the premium instead of for each service separately. However, those who do not wear glasses may not benefit from vision supplemental insurance. Enrollees can choose between FEDVIP premiums and FSA contributions, with the option to enroll in both. FSA funds can be used for various healthcare expenses, including dental and vision services. Some individuals may opt to only contribute to an FSA and use the funds for dental or vision costs instead of enrolling in a specific plan. Individuals can choose between using FSA funds for dental and vision expenses or enrolling in FEDVIP for coverage. They can wait to see if they need dental or vision services under FEDVIP and use FSA funds for other medical expenses if not. Decisions about FEDVIP and FSA can be reviewed annually during open season."
