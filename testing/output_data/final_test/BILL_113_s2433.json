    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Ukrainian Independence from Russian Energy Act\". The Act \"Ukrainian Independence from Russian Energy Act\" highlights Congress's findings on Ukraine's dependence on Russian natural gas, manipulation of supplies by Russian entities for geopolitical leverage, energy subsidies leading to corruption, Ukraine's low energy efficiency, and potential gas consumption reduction with improved efficiency. The Act \"Ukrainian Independence from Russian Energy Act\" emphasizes Ukraine's potential to significantly reduce natural gas consumption by over 50%, which could almost eliminate its reliance on gas imports from Russia. The World Bank estimates a 50% reduction in gas usage through efficiency measures. A coalition of 35 Ukrainian cities requested help to enhance energy efficiency and reduce gas imports. Ukraine's economy stabilization loan from the IMF includes measures to improve energy efficiency. The IMF loan package for Ukraine aims to stabilize the economy by reforming energy markets and gradually eliminating subsidies, leading to significant natural gas rate increases. This could have severe impacts on low-income households unless energy consumption is reduced. Ukraine has vast untapped oil and gas reserves, with estimated natural gas reserves of 5.4 trillion cubic meters. The annexation of Crimea by Russia may impact Ukraine's oil and gas reserves. Exports of liquefied natural gas from the US to Ukraine would not provide short-term assistance due to global market dynamics and lack of import facilities in Ukraine. Turkey may block shipments through the Bosphorus Strait for safety reasons. SEC. 3. POLICY ON SUPPORTING ENERGY INDEPENDENCE OF UKRAINE. The United States Government aims to coordinate with multi-donor efforts, encourage private sector investment, protect low-income households, increase transparency, improve energy efficiency, reduce reliance on Russian energy, and enhance the capacity of agencies in Ukraine. The United States Government collaborates with various entities to oversee energy efficiency and security projects in Ukraine. The United States Government collaborates with various entities to oversee energy efficiency and security projects in Ukraine. Assistance from the United States Agency for International Development is provided. The United States Agency for International Development will prioritize providing direct assistance to Ukraine to improve energy efficiency, increase energy supplies, and reduce reliance on Russian energy imports through loan guarantees to financial institutions and eligible borrowers. The measures described in subsection (b) include replacing inefficient boilers, upgrading district heating systems, improving metering and measurement systems for natural gas use, upgrading natural gas and heat distribution systems, improving building efficiency, reducing losses in natural gas transmission systems, improving compressor station efficiency, enhancing industrial sector efficiency, and providing legal and regulatory support for natural gas and electricity market rules. Authorization of Appropriations.--$10,000,000 is authorized for the Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development annually from 2015 to 2017 to support Ukraine's energy sector development, including gas and electricity market structuring, renewable energy sources, and energy infrastructure projects. SEC. 5. ASSISTANCE FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE. The Secretary of State will coordinate US agencies in supporting responsible production and transparency in Ukraine's natural gas sector through assessments, technology dissemination, and legal guidance to establish energy policies. The Secretary of State is authorized to appropriate $2,500,000 for each fiscal year from 2015 to 2017 to increase transparency and reduce corruption. The Trade and Development Agency will promote US private sector involvement in improving energy efficiency, developing oil and gas reserves, and renewable energy sources in Ukraine. They will fund various activities like feasibility studies, technical assistance, and conferences. $1,000,000 is authorized for each fiscal year from 2015 to 2017 for this purpose. The Overseas Private Investment Corporation will prioritize support for energy efficiency, oil and gas development, and renewable energy in Ukraine. They will expedite review and approval of applications for loans, guarantees, and insurance for eligible investors. The Export-Import Bank of the United States will also provide support. The Export-Import Bank of the United States will support the expansion of financial commitments for energy projects in Ukraine. The World Bank Group and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development will prioritize energy efficiency and domestic energy projects in Ukraine. The President will direct US Executive Directors of the World Bank Group and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development to promote investment in energy projects in Ukraine, including energy efficiency, domestic oil and gas reserves, and renewable energy sources. This aims to stimulate private investment in these projects. SEC. 10. EFFECTIVENESS MEASUREMENT. The President and relevant officials must ensure that loan guarantees and assistance provided under this Act are measured for effectiveness in achieving enhanced energy security for Ukraine. SEC. 11. BRIEFING ON ALTERNATIVE PIPELINE ACCESS AND SUPPLIES FOR UKRAINE. The Secretary of State must provide a briefing to the Senate and House committees on alternative pipeline access and supplies for Ukraine, including the viability of transporting natural gas from countries other than Russia and reducing gas consumption through efficiency measures or alternative energy sources."
