    "content": "Section 123 of the U.S. Atomic Energy Act governs nuclear cooperation between the United States and other countries through \"123 agreements.\" These agreements provide a framework for cooperation but do not guarantee exports. The State Department negotiates agreements with other countries based on criteria listed in the Act. Cooperation between the U.S. and Russia on civilian nuclear energy has fluctuated over the years. The U.S. and Russia began cooperation in 1973 for controlled thermonuclear fusion, fast breeder reactors, and research. The agreement was extended in 1983 and 1988, with increased safety exchanges after the Chernobyl accident. A Joint Coordinating Committee for Civilian Reactor Safety was established in 1988. Moscow's nuclear commerce with Iran hindered broader U.S.-Russian nuclear cooperation until 2006. Factors leading to a shift in U.S. policy under the George W. Bush Administration included Moscow's tougher stance on Iran. Under the Obama Administration, officials have expressed support for the nuclear cooperation agreement with Russia, waiting for the \"appropriate time\" to submit it to Congress. President Obama's letter outlines the benefits for U.S. interests, focusing on clean, safe, and secure nuclear energy growth. The Obama Administration supports a nuclear cooperation agreement with Russia, citing benefits for U.S. interests in clean, safe, and secure nuclear energy growth. Recent progress includes Russian support for a UN Security Council Resolution on Iran, the New START Treaty to reduce nuclear weapons, and joint efforts to combat nuclear terrorism. Congressional debate has focused on Russian-Iranian cooperation and the agreement's impact on the future. The U.S.-Russia 123 agreement on nuclear cooperation was approved by Congress in December 2010, paving the way for entry into force. Views on the agreement vary, with some seeing it as promoting bilateral cooperation on nonproliferation goals, while others believe the U.S. could gain leverage on negotiations with Russia by delaying approval. Legislation both supporting and opposing the agreement was introduced in the 110th Congress. In the 110th Congress, various resolutions were introduced regarding the U.S.-Russia 123 agreement on nuclear cooperation. Representative Edward Markey expressed disfavor with H.J.Res. 85, while Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee Joseph Biden and Senator Richard Lugar submitted S.J.Res. 42 for approval. Additionally, a resolution of disapproval, H.J.Res. 95, was introduced by Chairman Howard Berman and Ranking Member Ileana Ros-Lehtinen. H.R. 6574 was reported by the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, proposing approval of the agreement with certain conditions. In response to Russian actions in August over the conflict in Georgia, some members of Congress called on the Bush Administration to withdraw the U.S.-Russia 123 agreement on nuclear cooperation from congressional consideration. The President rescinded his prior determination regarding the agreement, leading to no basis for Congress to consider it. Secretary Rice and President Bush have decided to withdraw the U.S.-Russia 123 agreement on nuclear cooperation due to recent actions by the Russian government. The agreement aimed to enhance cooperation on nonproliferation issues and create commercial opportunities, but the current environment is not conducive for it. President Bush cited Russian actions in Georgia as a reason for the withdrawal, despite his previous determination that the agreement would not pose a security risk. The President has decided to withdraw the U.S.-Russia 123 agreement on nuclear cooperation, citing recent Russian actions in Georgia. The agreement was deemed not to pose a security risk, but the current environment is not conducive for it. Legislation in the 110th Congress focused on Iran's nuclear programs and sought to condition nuclear cooperation with Russia. The Iran Counter-Proliferation Act of 2007 aimed to prohibit agreements for cooperation with countries assisting Iran's nuclear program. The Iran Sanctions Act of 2008 included provisions prohibiting nuclear cooperation agreements with Russia until certain conditions are met, such as Iran dismantling its nuclear programs. The Security through Termination of Proliferation Act of 2008 also had similar restrictions on nuclear cooperation with countries aiding Iran, North Korea, or Syria. In 2008, concerns were raised by some members of Congress regarding the Nuclear Proliferation Assessment Statement (NPAS) in relation to a bilateral civilian nuclear accord with Russia. The NPAS, required for a 123 agreement package, is prepared by the State Department to explain how the agreement meets nonproliferation requirements. It includes an unclassified overview submitted with the agreement text and a classified annex submitted separately. The 2008 NPAS for the US-Russia 123 agreement raised concerns among some members of Congress for excluding information on nuclear trade between Russia and Iran. This led to a request by Congress for the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to evaluate the development process of the NPAS, its conclusions, and potential omissions. The GAO report was issued in July 2009. The GAO report in July 2009 recommended clarifying interagency roles, allowing adequate time for review, and establishing written procedures for 123 agreements. Chairman Berman emphasized preventing Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons and stated that the agreement would be examined further. Three joint resolutions were introduced in the House regarding the agreement. On May 21, 2010, Representatives introduced joint resolutions expressing disfavor or approval of a proposed agreement. Senate Foreign Relations Committee also introduced a resolution for approval. No positive action was taken yet. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee referred the agreement without requiring positive action from Congress for it to enter into force. The Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act of 2010 prohibits export licenses under a civilian nuclear cooperation agreement if the recipient country is not in full compliance with the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. The bill prohibits export licenses under a 123 agreement for countries whose nationals have engaged in activities with Iran related to nuclear weapons or advanced conventional weapons. The President can waive the provision if the country did not know about the activity or is taking steps to prevent recurrence. The United States and Russia cooperate on nuclear nonproliferation and energy initiatives, with a focus on civilian nuclear energy cooperation. This cooperation began in 2006 under Presidents Bush and Putin and continued in 2009 under Presidents Obama and Medvedev as part of the \"reset\" of relations with Russia. In July 2009, Presidents Obama and Medvedev established a Bilateral Presidential Commission with a Working Group on Nuclear Energy and Security. They focused on developing innovative nuclear energy systems, reliable fuel cycle services, nonproliferation regime, and international safeguards. An Action Plan for nuclear security and civil nuclear energy cooperation was agreed upon in September 2009. The Bilateral Presidential Commission established by Presidents Obama and Medvedev in July 2009 focused on nuclear energy cooperation. A commission report highlighted collaboration in research and development areas, including a new fuel services framework. The agreement could benefit the United States through access to Russian advanced fuel cycle research. Supporters believe partnership in developing technologies could enhance proliferation resistance. Critics warn of proliferation risks and the entrenchment of reprocessing as a necessary part of nuclear energy's future. The proposed agreement may provide Russia with access to U.S. nuclear technologies and markets. The proposed agreement between the United States and Russia would allow Russia to access U.S. nuclear technologies and markets. Some concerns exist regarding the agreement being seen as approval for Russia's nuclear industry despite safety and environmental issues. However, proponents argue that it would enable Russia to enhance its nuclear power capabilities by incorporating U.S. safety technology and standards. Additionally, the agreement aims to establish a global nuclear energy framework that addresses emerging states' fuel needs while discouraging indigenous enrichment and reprocessing. The agreement between the United States and Russia aims to address emerging states' fuel needs by providing a \"cradle to grave\" approach to nuclear fuel. Recent Russian nuclear power plant exports, like with Turkey, include construction, operation, fuel services, and spent fuel return. Efforts to discourage new states from building fuel cycle facilities involve multilateral fuel assurances and international fuel service centers. Russia has set up the International Uranium Enrichment Center at Angarsk under international safeguards, with an international LEU fuel reserve hosted at the site. Collaboration between the United States and Russia on nuclear fuel cycle services could increase customer states' confidence and participation. Some experts and policy makers suggest that a 123 agreement with Russia could allow for reprocessing U.S.-origin spent fuel from third countries or long-term spent fuel storage in Russia. This agreement would also permit enrichment activities using Russian facilities, such as conversion to less than 20% enrichment, fabrication of LEU fuel, and reprocessing of U.S.-origin spent fuel. The parties need to agree on reprocessing U.S.-origin spent fuel for potential cooperation. Nuclear liability coverage for U.S. companies in Russia must be clarified, as Rosatom Corporation has sovereign immunity. Russia has not ratified the Convention on Supplementary Compensation for Nuclear Damage, leading to ad hoc bilateral agreements for liability coverage. U.S. firms require Russia to ratify the CSC or adopt domestic laws for liability protection before doing business in Russia. The Contractors International Group on Nuclear Liability (CIGNL) expressed concerns about inadequate nuclear liability protection for U.S. companies in Russia. Proposed legislation in 2008 required Russia to ratify nuclear liability conventions or enact domestic laws before issuing licenses. The Obama Administration focused on negotiating a Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty with Russia, initiating a process of engagement in various sectors as part of a \"reset\" in U.S.-Russia relations. The NATO-Russia Council resumed meetings in April 2009, with Russia granting supply rights to NATO forces in Afghanistan. Differences persist over foreign policy issues like military bases, missile defense systems, and the Iranian nuclear program. Some advocate for expanding cooperation on civilian nuclear energy, while others believe it is premature. Ambassador Burns highlighted the potential of a 123 agreement to influence Russian policies. The 123 agreement between the US and Russia symbolizes a shift from nuclear rivals to partners, with supporters arguing it could improve bilateral relations. Critics fear it could reward an antidemocratic Russian government and go against US interests, as seen in President Bush's rescission of the agreement in 2008 after Russian military actions in Georgia. The Russian military actions in Georgia led to a shift in U.S.-Russian nuclear energy cooperation priorities. Russia increased cooperation with the U.S. and other countries negotiating with Iran over its nuclear program. Moscow insisted on IAEA safeguards on transfers to Iran's civilian nuclear reactor at Bushehr and required the return of spent fuel to prevent Iran from extracting plutonium. Russia's cooperation with Iran on nuclear energy includes inviting Tehran to participate in an international uranium enrichment center and providing nuclear fuel for the Bushehr reactor. Despite initially rejecting the offer, Iran eventually accepted the fuel from Russia. The Bush and Obama Administrations supported this approach as a way for Iran to access nuclear energy without developing its own fuel cycle. Russia has been hesitant to support sanctions on Iran but fully implemented several UN Security Council Resolutions in 2008. In 2009, Russia and the United States collaborated on proposals to supply nuclear fuel to Iran. In 2009, Russia and the United States collaborated on proposals to supply nuclear fuel to Iran, supporting UNSCR 1835 and UNSCR 1929. Analysts note a convergence in Russian and American views on the Iranian nuclear program, especially after the revelation of the enrichment facility at Qom in 2009. Questions about Russian cooperation with Iran hindered approval of the 123 agreement by Congress. The 2006 Iran Freedom Support Act and the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions Act prohibited nuclear cooperation with Iran. The 2009 amendment to the Iran Support Act (H.R. 2194) prohibited nuclear cooperation with a country if its citizens or companies were assisting Iran's nuclear weapons program. Reports in 2008 suggested Russian entities transferred sensitive nuclear technology to Iran, but this was stopped by Russian intervention. The 2009 Director of National Intelligence report mentioned concerns about Russian-Iranian cooperation in the classified annex. Entities in Russia and China are selling dual-use technologies in the Middle East and South Asia that could support WMD and missile programs. Russian entities have assisted missile and civil nuclear programs in Iran and India. There are concerns about the planned Russian sale of S-300 air defense systems to Iran, which could be deployed near Iranian nuclear facilities. The U.N. Security Council sanctions resolution on Iran in May 2010 would not prohibit this transfer. The State Department removed sanctions on four Russian entities in May 2010, with no current proliferation-related sanctions against Russian entities. Observers suggest this was in exchange for Russian support for a U.N. Security Council resolution on Iran. The Administration also lifted sanctions on two other Russian entities in March 2010 for aiding Iran's missile and weapons programs. The Department of Commerce lists Russian entities sanctioned in 1998 for aiding Iran's missile and weapons programs. Eight entities are subject to license requirements, with three reviewed case-by-case and five under \"presumption of denial.\" The list is under review for future leverage in coaxing Russian behavior on Iran. The 123 agreement is seen as a way to encourage Russia to press Iran on issues like the Bushehr reactor safeguards. Engaging Russia on a scientific level could improve transparency and act as a deterrent to Russian technical cooperation with Iran. Some are hesitant to approve the agreement due to unanswered questions about Russian government control over transfers to Iran's nuclear and missile programs."
