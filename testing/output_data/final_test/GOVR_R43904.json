    "content": "In 2017, Gallup found that 57% of Americans had confidence in the police, matching the 25-year average. Confidence in the police had decreased in 2014 and 2015 but was still higher than many other institutions. Confidence in the police varied by race/ethnicity, political ideology, and age. Whites have higher confidence in the police compared to Hispanics and blacks, with confidence increasing among whites but decreasing among Hispanics and blacks. Conservatives show more confidence in the police than liberals and moderates, with confidence increasing among conservatives but decreasing among moderates and liberals. People aged 55 and older have the highest confidence in the police compared to younger age groups. Policymakers may want to focus on increasing trust between the police and communities. Policymakers aim to enhance trust between police and communities, especially in urban areas, by increasing accountability for excessive force and addressing policies affecting public trust. However, the federal system limits Congress's influence on state and local law enforcement policies. Federalism defines the relationships between federal, state, and local governments, with varying levels of authority. Scholars describe these relationships as \"dual,\" \"cooperative,\" \"creative,\" \"coercive,\" or \"fragmented\" federalism. American federalism has evolved from a dual system to a more chaotic and fragmented one. States and the federal government now pursue their own policy priorities independently, leading to disjointed policy implementation. Congress can influence state and local policies through federal grant conditions under the Spending Clause. This includes questioning the conditioning of federal grants related to state and local policing. The Spending Clause limits Congress's power to regulate state law enforcement agencies. While some argue that federal grants can promote police accountability, others believe that Congress cannot compel states to enact or enforce federal programs through funding conditions. The use of federal funds for state and local law enforcement should be tied to implementing police accountability measures for institutional reform. This approach fosters a cooperative federalism relationship, allowing states flexibility in meeting federal standards while enhancing police accountability. Cooperative federalism strikes a balance between reform and state autonomy, transforming states into laboratories of democracy for national policy administration. The use of federal grants for state and local law enforcement agencies promotes cooperative federalism, allowing states flexibility in meeting federal standards for police accountability. The federal government has tools to improve police-community relations and accountability, such as collecting data on use of force, investigating police misconduct, and influencing state and local law enforcement. The federal government promotes cooperative federalism by using federal grants to support state and local law enforcement agencies. This includes collecting data on police use of force, investigating misconduct, and influencing law enforcement policies. Former Philadelphia Police Chief Ramsey emphasized the importance of transparency in data collection to establish trust with the public. The lack of comprehensive federal data on police-involved deaths has led to public reliance on media accounts of excessive force cases. The Washington Post started its own database of people shot and killed by the police due to this gap. While the federal government has programs collecting some data on police-involved shootings and use of force, none capture every incident in the US. The FBI's Uniform Crime Report only collects data on justifiable homicides by law enforcement, excluding non-lethal shootings or instances where officers shoot but do not hit suspects. The FBI's Uniform Crime Report collects data on justifiable homicides by law enforcement, but not on non-lethal shootings or instances where officers shoot but do not hit suspects. Law enforcement agencies participate in the UCR program voluntarily, leading to potential undercounting of justifiable homicides. The FBI acknowledges limitations in coverage and reliability of their data, hindering the analysis of use-of-force incidents. They are working with law enforcement organizations to collect national use of force data for a more comprehensive view. The FBI plans to collect data on use of force incidents resulting in death or serious injury, including officer-involved shootings. Local law enforcement agencies will submit data voluntarily, detailing incident circumstances, subject, and officer information. The FBI will release use of force statistics periodically to the public. The FBI plans to collect data on use of force incidents resulting in death or serious injury, including officer-involved shootings, and will release statistics periodically to the public. A pilot study was conducted in 2017, but the results have not been released yet. The DOJ has struggled to fulfill the mandate of acquiring data on excessive force by law enforcement officers. In April 1996, the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) and the National Institute of Justice (NIJ) published a status report on their efforts to collect data on police use of force. The report highlighted challenges in defining terms, reluctance by police agencies to provide reliable data, concerns about misapplication of reported data, lack of attention to provocation, and the level of detail needed to describe incidents. In November 1997, BJS released a second report on Police Use of Force: Collection of National Data, which included a pilot project surveying approximately 6,400 individuals. The report discussed a pilot project surveying 6,400 people who had interactions with law enforcement officers. It led to the Police Public Contact Survey (PPCS) and the National Police Use-of-Force Database Project funded by BJS and NIJ. Critics argue that the voluntary data submission makes the results incomplete and inconclusive. The DOJ collects data on citizens' interactions with police, including use of force, every three years through the PPCS. The PPCS is a survey administered to a sample of law enforcement agencies, limiting its ability to capture all incidents. Additionally, data on arrest-related deaths is collected under the Death in Custody Reporting Act of 2000. The Death in Custody Reporting Act of 2013 requires states to submit data to the DOJ on deaths of individuals in custody at various correctional facilities. Failure to comply may result in a reduction of funding under the Edward Byrne Memorial JAG program. The Death in Custody Reporting Act of 2013 mandates states to provide data on custodial deaths or risk losing funding from the Edward Byrne Memorial JAG program. The Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) oversees the Death in Custody Reporting Program (DCRP) to collect this data, including deaths in correctional institutions and arrest-related deaths. BJS suspended the collection of arrest-related deaths in 2014 due to data reporting issues. The Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) has replaced the Death in Custody Reporting Program (DCRP) with the Mortality in Correctional Institutions (MCI) program to collect data on deaths in custody. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) receives death certificate data for national publication on violent deaths. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) launched the National Violent Death Reporting System (NVDRS) in 2002, a state-based surveillance system for violent deaths. As of FY2018, NVDRS is funded to operate in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico, gathering and linking records from law enforcement for analysis. The National Violent Death Reporting System (NVDRS) gathers records from various sources in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico to report violent deaths, providing better quality information than death certificates alone. The federal government has legal tools to ensure law enforcement practices adhere to constitutional norms, including criminal enforcement against offending officers under federal civil rights statutes. The federal civil rights statutes enacted during the Reconstruction Era safeguard rights for African Americans under the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments. These statutes are the basis for police excessive force cases and DOJ investigations into police killings. The mens rea element of Section 242, which requires specific intent, has been a contentious issue. Different courts have varying interpretations, with some requiring a \"bad purpose or evil motive\" and others a \"reckless disregard\" standard. The federal civil rights statutes focus on protecting rights under the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments. One major legal tool is a federal statute that prohibits a \"pattern or practice of conduct by law enforcement officers\" that violates constitutional rights. This statute allows the Attorney General to take legal action if there is \"reasonable cause to believe\" such violations have occurred. The DOJ investigates constitutional violations by law enforcement, often leading to consent decrees with local police departments to address unconstitutional practices. For example, the New Orleans Police Department entered into a consent decree with the City of New Orleans after DOJ found numerous instances of unconstitutional conduct. The DOJ uses consent decrees to address unconstitutional practices in local police departments, including provisions on use-of-force reporting and citizen complaint systems. However, the effectiveness of consent decrees in reforming policing practices depends on the priorities of the administration in power. Former Attorney General Sessions limited the use of consent decrees to force changes in police departments, impacting DOJ's role in shaping policing in the United States. The Department of Justice (DOJ) plays a crucial role in enforcing federal laws related to police abuse of power. They set standards for law enforcement, bring together key parties on important issues, award grants to police and researchers, and investigate officials or agencies violating constitutional rights. The FBI leads investigations into color of law abuses and official misconduct, working to enhance public confidence in police oversight. The Department of Justice (DOJ) can prosecute cases of official misconduct, including excessive force, sexual assault, false arrests, and fabrication of evidence. The Civil Rights Division reviews law enforcement agencies for patterns of violating federal rights and targets agencies for civil remedies. Challenges exist in prosecuting police misconduct despite DOJ's authority. Experts have highlighted challenges in prosecuting police misconduct, such as the burden of proof on the DOJ to prove specific intent and skepticism about incentivizing institutional changes. Despite this, the Civil Rights Division is a longstanding instrument of police accountability in the US and can serve as a model for state and local law enforcement agencies. The DOJ plays a key role in setting policies and issuing guidance for federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies to improve trust and collaboration with communities in policing practices. The DOJ sets policies for its agencies and state/local law enforcement, including FBI investigations. They sponsor studies through agencies like NIJ and COPS to address policing challenges, such as body-worn cameras. In 2014, a report sponsored by the COPS Office focused on the use of body-worn cameras by police. In 2017, the DOJ released a report on improving police relationships with the LGBTQ community through policy changes and training. DOJ also initiated a national trust-building program in response to events in Ferguson, MO, investing in training and announcing a $4.75 million initiative in six cities. NIJ provides routine training to law enforcement agencies on various topics, and in 2017, DOJ awarded a grant to the International Association of. In 2017, the DOJ awarded a grant to the International Association of Chiefs of Police for the Collaborative Reform Initiative Technical Assistance Center, partnering with other law enforcement organizations to provide training. The DOJ sets policies for its agencies, but guidance to police forces is typically non-binding. The DOJ's Community Relations Service acts as a mediator between law enforcement and local communities, as seen in their involvement in Ferguson, MO after the shooting of Michael Brown. The DOJ's Community Relations Service acts as a mediator in community conflicts related to race, gender, and other differences. It focuses on conflict resolution strategies through mediation without taking sides or assigning blame. The DOJ's Community Relations Service provides mediation, facilitation, training, and consulting services to help communities resolve conflicts and improve communication about tension and conflict. The DOJ's Community Relations Service offers services to help communities resolve conflicts and improve communication. At the national level, DOJ convenes experts to discuss important issues, such as constitutional policing and police recruiting. DOJ also operates grant programs to support law enforcement agencies. The DOJ operates grant programs like COPS and JAG to assist law enforcement agencies in addressing crime. COPS grants aim to advance community policing nationwide, while JAG provides funding for various criminal justice initiatives. The DOJ operates grant programs like COPS and JAG to assist law enforcement agencies in addressing crime. These programs cover various purpose areas such as law enforcement, prosecution, prevention, corrections, drug treatment, planning, evaluation, technology improvement, crime victim support, and mental health programs. Policymakers can consider options like conditioning federal funding, collecting data on use of force, promoting body-worn cameras, and taking steps to improve police-community relations and accountability. Congress can influence state and local law enforcement policies by placing conditions on grant programs like the JAG program, which provides funding for law enforcement purposes. This can include reducing funding or making it contingent upon adopting certain policies. The JAG program provides funding for various law enforcement programs, as well as other activities like prosecution, courts, public defense, prevention, education, corrections, crime victims services, and drug treatment. If Congress reduces a state or local government's allocation for not adopting a certain policy change, it could lead to cuts in non-law enforcement funding and a shift towards law enforcement to compensate for the reduced federal funding. Compensating for reduced federal funding could incentivize states and local governments to adopt policy changes to avoid losing funding for law enforcement and other programs. However, this approach may penalize agencies that have no control over law enforcement decisions. Some allocations may not be sufficient to convince law enforcement agencies to comply, especially if the costs outweigh the funding. Policymakers could also consider making law enforcement agencies ineligible for competitive grant programs funding. Making law enforcement agencies ineligible for competitive grant programs funding could be an effective way to bring about policy changes at the state and local level. This approach would require agencies to comply with certain conditions to access federal funding, potentially leading to policy reforms. Unlike formula grant programs, competitive grants allow agencies to apply for funding based on their specific needs, providing more flexibility in funding allocation. Policymakers may be interested in collecting more comprehensive data on law enforcement officers' use of force to understand patterns and develop effective policies. Detailed data could reveal if excessive force is a systemic issue or caused by a few individuals. This information could help agencies establish best practices for the use of force in different situations. The federal government may need to expand data collection efforts on law enforcement officers' use of force. Policymakers are considering how much data should be collected, whether only in cases of officer-involved deaths or all use of force incidents. Defining use of force poses challenges, with the option of focusing on fatal incidents being easier but excluding other important data. The federal government may need to expand data collection efforts on police use of force. A researcher highlighted that most people shot by police survive, and there is a need to track all incidents, not just fatal ones. Congress could require the FBI to collect data on use of force incidents, but participation in the UCR is voluntary, affecting data reliability. The FBI announced voluntary collection of use of force data, lacking legal authority to mandate submission. Congress could make data submission a condition for federal funding. States must report certain deaths or risk losing funding. However, only deaths in custody are required, not all use of force incidents. Questions remain about data reliability if submission becomes mandatory for funding. To ensure reliable data for federal funding, Congress may require agencies to submit accurate use of force data. Verification by the FBI could be a challenge, leading some agencies to opt out of funding. States could play a role in data collection to reduce the burden on DOJ. State agencies could potentially collect more complete data on police-involved shootings, but may still miss instances of force used by law enforcement. Requiring BJS to conduct an annual survey of law enforcement agencies for use of force data could be a less coercive option than tying federal funding to state action. Body-worn cameras (BWCs) are used by law enforcement officers to record their interactions, funded by a $67.5 million grant program. They are believed to reduce citizen complaints, use of force, and assaults on officers. Research on body-worn cameras (BWCs) suggests they lead to fewer citizen complaints and less use of force by officers. However, the Center for Evidence-Based Crime Policy at George Mason University refrains from drawing definitive conclusions due to limited studies. Recent studies on BWCs' impact on police use of force and citizen complaints provide mixed evidence. The LVMPD study compared officers wearing BWCs to those who did not. Results showed a 14% decrease in citizen complaints and a 12.5% decrease in reported use of force. However, no significant difference was found in documented complaints or use of force incidents. A suggestion was made for Congress to consider a grant program for law enforcement agencies to purchase BWCs. The Matching Grant Program for Armor Vests provides grants to help purchase armor vests for law enforcement officers. Grants cover up to 50% of the cost. Data shows that 47% of police departments have acquired BWCs, with an average of 29 BWCs per 100 officers in use. The data shows that 47% of police departments have acquired body-worn cameras (BWCs), with an average of 29 BWCs per 100 officers in use. There are costs beyond purchasing BWCs, including maintenance, replacement, and data management. Should all law enforcement officers be required to wear BWCs, or should funding be allocated based on jurisdiction size and crime rates? Congress may need to provide grant funding to cover these additional costs. The use of body-worn cameras (BWCs) by law enforcement agencies raises concerns about privacy and funding. The American Civil Liberties Union supports BWCs but emphasizes the need for strong policies to prevent them from becoming a form of public surveillance. Agencies may need to assess privacy impacts, determine recording policies, storage duration, access control, and video distribution. The Center for Evidence-Based Crime Policy raises concerns about the lack of research on body-worn cameras (BWCs) in law enforcement agencies. They question the impact of BWCs on bias, compliance with Fourth Amendment requirements, and proactive policing. The Center for Evidence-Based Crime Policy raises concerns about the lack of research on body-worn cameras (BWCs) in law enforcement agencies, questioning their impact on bias, compliance with Fourth Amendment requirements, proactive policing, citizen cooperation, privacy, investigation facilitation, training improvement, and police accountability. The researchers highlight the lack of research on how body-worn cameras (BWCs) in law enforcement agencies may impact court proceedings, prosecutorial behaviors, evidentiary issues, and legal effects. They suggest that more research is needed before investing millions of dollars to expand BWC use nationwide. The grand jury system's failure to indict police officers in high-profile cases like Michael Brown and Eric Garner's deaths has raised concerns about police accountability. One proposed solution is amending federal law to allow prosecution of officers for reckless disregard of civil rights, not just intentional violations. One option to promote police accountability is to allow prosecution of officers for reckless disregard of civil rights, in addition to intentional violations. This could lead to more investigations and prosecutions by the DOJ, reducing the perception of bias. However, concerns about state sovereignty may arise. Another option is to require states to use special prosecutors for police-related fatalities as a condition for receiving federal funding. Congress may consider appointing a special prosecutor in police-involved shootings to ensure impartial investigations. Policy questions include when to trigger the appointment, whether states should be required to appoint a special prosecutor in all cases, and how special prosecutors would be chosen. Congress may grapple with questions on how to choose special prosecutors for police-involved shootings and promote police accountability through community policing programs like the COPS program. The COPS program aims to deploy new law enforcement officers for community-oriented policing, but faces challenges due to the lack of a clear definition of community policing. Critics argue that the concept is vague and difficult to measure, while the COPS Office defines it as a philosophy promoting partnerships and problem-solving to address public safety issues. Some critics argue that community policing is vague and difficult to measure, while policymakers need to clarify what it entails before providing grants to law enforcement agencies. The COPS Office awarded billions in grants for community policing in the 1990s, but there was also a growth in the use of SWAT teams during that time. Research on SWAT teams suggests that law enforcement agencies view them as crucial for community policing strategies. Scholars argue that community policing is more about transforming the image of the police rather than changing their actual work. The majority of police recruits undergo stress-based military-style training in academies, emphasizing crime-fighting and action-oriented policing. Research suggests that law enforcement agencies may not be recruiting candidates well-suited for community policing, as recruits often prioritize honing skills in shooting and defensive tactics over acquiring knowledge about crime causation and diversity. Even if recruits receive formal training in community policing skills, informal lessons learned during academy or early service years may overshadow these efforts. Scholars emphasize the importance of integrating community policing philosophy into police agencies' operating environments and organizational goals. Congress could support this by funding COPS hiring grants, but there are limitations to their influence. Policymakers should consider clearer expectations for how grant-funded officers are utilized, or impose limitations on their activities. Additional funding for the COPS Office could also enhance community policing efforts. Congress could consider providing funding to the COPS Office for training and seminars on community policing practices to build trust between police and citizens. Policymakers could use non-legislative influence to address police-community relations through hearings, speeches, and meetings with local officials and communities. To improve law enforcement services, policymakers could meet with community groups to gather their views on necessary reforms and keep them engaged in promoting change. Non-legislative congressional influence can help keep police-community relations in the national spotlight and pressure state and local law enforcement agencies to enhance their relationships with the public. Efforts to change how law enforcement officers interact with citizens may require grassroots movements within law enforcement agencies, supported by Congress to maintain awareness of citizens' trust in the police."
