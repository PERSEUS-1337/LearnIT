The Act of 1997, titled the \"Less Pollution Through Technology Act,\" highlights the importance of developing new environmental technologies, especially for monitoring compliance. Current monitoring requirements by the Environmental Protection Agency hinder the adoption of more accurate and cost-effective technologies due to rigid regulations. The Agency is assessing barriers to implementing innovative monitoring methods. The Act aims to facilitate the development and use of new environmental monitoring technologies by transitioning to a performance-based measurement system. It establishes a deadline for the Agency to implement this system for all environmental monitoring. The Act defines key terms such as \"Agency\" and \"Administrator\" as related to the Environmental Protection Agency. It also defines \"environmental monitoring technologies\" and \"performance-based measurement system\" in the context of ensuring data quality assurance objectives are met without prescribing specific procedures. The Administrator will establish a performance-based measurement system for new environmental monitoring technologies within 18 months of the Act's enactment. Existing analytical methods will remain acceptable until deemed otherwise. The Act does not allow for favoritism towards specific technologies or instruments. The Act establishes a performance-based measurement system for new environmental monitoring technologies, equivalent to existing analytical methods for compliance with environmental statutes and regulations. The Act establishes a performance-based measurement system for new environmental monitoring technologies, equivalent to existing analytical methods for compliance with environmental statutes and regulations. Additionally, a Performance-Based Measurement System Advisory Committee is established. The Administrator will establish a Performance-Based Measurement System Advisory Committee within 90 days of the Act's enactment. The committee will assist in developing a plan for implementing a performance-based measurement system, advise on using Agency policies for implementation, and help in creating the required report. The committee will consist of 12 members representing various interested parties, including the analytical instruments industry and environmental testing. The Performance-Based Measurement System Advisory Committee will convene at least twice a year, submit recommendations to the Administrator, and have necessary staff support. The duration of the committee is exempt from the Federal Advisory Committee Act. The Administrator will submit a report to Congress within 6 months of the Act's enactment, outlining a plan for a performance-based measurement system approval process as per section 4."
