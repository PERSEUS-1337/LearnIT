    "content": "The Organic Foods Production Act of 1990 (OFPA) sets national standards for organic products, requiring them to be produced without synthetic substances and in accordance with an organic plan. Products meeting these standards can be labeled as \"organic\" and bear a USDA seal. The Act establishes a National Organic Standards Board (NOSB) to develop a National List of Allowed and Prohibited Substances. The Organic Foods Production Act of 1990 (OFPA) sets national standards for organic products, requiring them to be produced without synthetic substances. The Act also mandates the inclusion of substances on the National List and the promulgation of regulations by the Secretary. The National Organic Program Final Rule (Final Rule) was published in December 2000, effective on October 21, 2002, establishing a four-tier labeling system for organic foods based on the percentage of organic ingredients. In October 2002, Mr. Arthur Harvey filed a suit against the USDA, alleging inconsistencies with the OFPA and the Administrative Procedures Act. The district court ruled in favor of the USDA on all counts, but the First Circuit sided with Harvey on three counts and remanded the case for further action. The court found issues with nonorganic ingredients not commercially available in organic form used in production. The court found that nonorganic ingredients not commercially available in organic form used in production must have individual reviews for organic labeling. Synthetic substances are prohibited in processing organic products, and dairy herds converting to organic production cannot be fed feed that is only 80% organic for the first nine months. The court's ruling affected the implementation of the National Organic Program, leading to a two-year timeframe for the Secretary of Agriculture to create and enforce new rules in compliance with the court's decision. The court's ruling affected the National Organic Program, requiring the Secretary of Agriculture to issue new regulations within a year and start enforcing them within two years. The USDA published revised final rules based on the court's decision and amendments to the OFPA. The court ruled that a provision of the Final Rule was inconsistent with the OFPA and discussed the effect of the appropriations act. Plaintiff challenged a portion of the regulation allowing nonorganically produced agricultural products in processed products labeled as \"organic.\" The USDA's latest regulatory action addressed this issue. The court found a disagreement between Harvey and the USDA regarding the interpretation of \u00a7205.606, with Harvey claiming a blanket exemption while the USDA argued for specific product use. The court remanded the case for a declaratory judgment consistent with the National List requirements of the OFPA. The USDA issued a Notice in compliance with the court order clarifying the regulation on nonorganic agricultural products not commercially available. The clarified meaning of \u00a7205.606 will not be enforceable until June 9, 2007. Congress amended the law to allow the Secretary of the USDA to develop emergency procedures for listing unavailable organic products for up to 12 months. The Secretary has the authority to define \"emergency procedure\" and select substances for it. An expedited petition process for unavailable organic products was created, but it doesn't change existing rules. Synthetic substances can be used in organic products under certain conditions. The court found that the use of synthetic substances as processing aids in organic products contradicted the Organic Foods Production Act. The circuit court reversed the district court's decision and ordered the Secretary of the USDA to take action. The district court ordered the Secretary of the USDA to publish new rules implementing the circuit court's judgment within one year. The FY2006 agriculture appropriations act amended provisions regarding the use of synthetics in organic products. The amendment removed a provision that required exempted substances on the National List to be nonsynthetic, potentially making the First Circuit's ruling on the use of synthetics in organic products moot. The USDA decided not to revise the relevant section in response to this change. The USDA determined no need to revise \u00a7205.600(b) and \u00a7205.605(b) due to legislative changes addressing contradictions. Plaintiff challenged the exception in the Final Rule for dairy herds transitioning to organic production. The court found a discrepancy between the OFPA's requirement for 12 months of organic handling and the Final Rule's 80-20 rule for transitioning dairy herds. The court found the Final Rule's exception for dairy herds transitioning to organic production conflicted with the OFPA's requirement for 12 months of organic handling. The court deemed the regulation invalid and ordered the USDA to implement new regulations within one year. The new provision \"Transition Guideline\" allows dairy farms in their third year of organic management to feed their animals crops and forage from transitioning land before selling organic milk. This amendment does not permit the use of prohibited substances or genetically modified organisms in feed for dairy cows. Congress' amendment likely rendered a court ruling on count seven irrelevant. The Secretary revised 7 C.F.R. \u00a7205.236 to allow for two exceptions regarding the source of milk labeled as \"organic.\" The exceptions include animals consuming crops and forage from land in the third year of organic management and producers transitioning entire herds to organic production. This transition period must be completed by June 9, 2007, in accordance with a court order."
