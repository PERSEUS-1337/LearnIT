    "content": "Since 2007, the Supreme Court has ruled twice that the Clean Air Act allows the EPA to regulate greenhouse gas emissions. In Massachusetts v. EPA, the Court determined that GHGs are air pollutants under the Act and must be regulated if they endanger public health. In American Electric Power, Inc. v. Connecticut, the Court stated that corporations cannot be sued for GHG emissions under federal common law as the Clean Air Act delegates the regulation of GHGs to the EPA. In 2009, legislation was passed to limit EPA's authority over greenhouse gas emissions, focusing on cap-and-trade systems. Congress has not made serious efforts to revive the legislation since then. EPA has taken action using its Clean Air Act authority to regulate emissions. In April 2010, EPA under Lisa Jackson's administration signed regulations to limit GHG emissions from new MY 2012-2016 vehicles. EPA also required major stationary sources to undergo pre-construction review for GHG emissions and obtain permits for BACT installation. Existing stationary sources were also required to obtain operating permits for GHG emissions under Title V of the Clean Air Act. In September 2011, EPA established GHG emission standards for medium- and heavy-duty trucks for MY2014-2018. In October 2012, a second round of standards was set for cars and light trucks for MY2017-2025. In July 2015, proposed standards for medium- and heavy-duty trucks for MY2021-2027 were introduced. Additionally, in August 2015, emission standards were promulgated for fossil-fueled electric generating units under the Clean Air Act. Congressional opposition to EPA's GHG regulations has been ongoing, with bills introduced to limit the agency's authority. In response to concerns from Congress and stakeholders, the EPA clarified its actions regarding greenhouse gas regulations. The agency delayed the start of stationary source permit requirements until January 2, 2011, and implemented a phasing-in approach with the GHG \"Tailoring\" Rule in May 2010. The EPA implemented the GHG \"Tailoring\" Rule in May 2010 to phase in permitting requirements for large sources of greenhouse gas emissions. EPA provided guidance to assist in implementing PSD and Title V permitting for GHGs. Despite expressing a preference for congressional action, EPA stated it must regulate GHG emissions due to the Supreme Court decision in Massachusetts v. EPA. EPA proceeded with regulations to control GHG emissions under the Clean Air Act, leading to a collision with Congress. The President has directed EPA to propose standards for new and existing power plants to address climate change. The EPA finalized power plant rules in August 2015, prompting Congress to consider potential responses. This report outlines options for Congress, including resolutions of disapproval, freestanding legislation, appropriations bills, and amendments to the Clean Air Act to address greenhouse gas emissions. It also provides background on GHG pollution sources and the Clean Air Act requirements. The report discusses the EPA's regulations on greenhouse gas emissions from power plants, with challenges to these rules in the U.S. Court of Appeals. Stationary sources are the main contributors to GHG emissions in the U.S. The EPA's efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions focus on stationary sources like power plants, which are more cost-effective to regulate compared to mobile sources like cars and trucks. This approach is crucial for effective policy implementation due to the significant emissions from a small number of stationary sources. EPA lacks the legal authority to impose stricter standards on mobile sources. The EPA focuses on reducing greenhouse gas emissions from stationary sources like power plants, which are easier to regulate than mobile sources like cars and trucks. New vehicles will need to reduce emissions by 50% by 2025, but the full impact won't be felt until 2040 or later. Existing power plants can switch fuel sources, improve efficiency, and modify power demand to reduce emissions. EPA has authority under the Clean Air Act to impose performance standards on stationary sources. The EPA has authority under the Clean Air Act to impose performance standards on stationary sources of air pollution, including power plants, through new source performance standards (NSPS) for new or modified sources and through states for existing sources. This regulation aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from these sources, which are significant contributors to air pollution. The EPA has flexibility in establishing standards for regulating greenhouse gas emissions from stationary sources under Section 111 of the Clean Air Act. This includes determining the source categories, size of sources, gases regulated, timing of regulations, and control systems deemed \"adequately demonstrated\" by the Administrator. The EPA has flexibility in setting standards for greenhouse gas emissions from stationary sources under Section 111 of the Clean Air Act. The agency proposed NSPS for fossil-fueled electric generating units in 2012, withdrew it in 2014, and finalized new rules in 2015. The standards for new sources limit GHG emissions from coal-fired and natural-gas-fired EGUs. Gas-fired plants can meet the standard without add-on controls, while coal-fired plants require additional measures. Coal-fired plants would need to reduce CO2 emissions by roughly 20% to meet the NSPS standard, requiring the installation of expensive carbon capture and storage systems. This technology is not yet commercially demonstrated on a large scale in the US, leading many to believe that the rule effectively prohibits the construction of new coal-fired power plants. Many in Congress are interested in blocking the EPA's Clean Power Plan, which sets state-specific goals for CO2 emissions from power generation. The plan includes goals based on improved efficiency at coal-fired power plants, substitution of natural gas for coal, and zero-emission power generation. States must develop plans to reach these goals, with a focus on reducing emissions from coal-fired power plants. The Congressional Review Act (CRA) provides options for Congress to change the EPA's course on GHG controls, including the Clean Power Plan. The CRA allows Congress to disapprove regulatory rules issued by federal agencies before they take effect. The Congressional Review Act (CRA) allows Congress to disapprove regulatory rules issued by federal agencies. If Congress passes a joint resolution disapproving the rule, it cannot take effect. The CRA has been discussed as a tool for overturning EPA's regulatory actions on GHG emissions. In the 111th Congress, resolutions were introduced to disapprove EPA's GHG rules, but only one proceeded to a vote and was not taken up by the Senate. The path to enacting a CRA resolution is difficult, with only one resolution ever enacted in nearly two decades. If the President opposes a resolution, like those disapproving EPA rules on GHG emissions, it faces a steep path due to potential veto. The advantage of the Congressional Review Act lies in the expedited Senate procedure for considering a disapproval resolution within 60 days of the rule being published. The expedited Senate procedure for considering a disapproval resolution under the Congressional Review Act allows for a resolution to be discharged if not reported within 20 days, with a motion to proceed being non-debatable once on the Senate Calendar. The Congressional Review Act allows for expedited consideration of disapproval resolutions in the Senate, limiting debate to 10 hours and prohibiting amendments. There is no deadline for final congressional action on a resolution, so it could still be brought to the Senate floor even after the expedited procedures deadline. Resolutions can also reach the House floor through normal procedures, such as being reported by the committee of jurisdiction. The Congressional Review Act allows for expedited consideration of disapproval resolutions in the Senate, limiting debate to 10 hours and prohibiting amendments. If the committee of jurisdiction does not report a disapproval resolution submitted in the House, it could still reach the floor through various procedures like a special rule reported by the Committee on Rules, a motion to suspend the rules and pass it, or discharge of the committee. The CRA does not establish an expedited procedure for further congressional action on a disapproval resolution if the President vetoes it. Congress would need to attempt an override of a veto using its normal procedures for considering vetoed bills. The President vetoed resolutions disapproving emission guidelines for power plants in December 2015. Congress has not attempted to override the vetoes. Members have introduced legislation to address greenhouse gas regulations. The House passed H.R. 2042, the Ratepayer Protection Act of 2015, which would delay compliance with GHG emission standards for existing EGUs. A Senate bill, S. 1324, was reported by the Environment and Public Works Committee. S. 1324, reported by the Environment and Public Works Committee, would prohibit EPA from regulating certain existing sources under Section 111(d) and revoke the Clean Power Plan and NSPS for power plants. It aims to establish separate categories for coal-fired and natural-gas-fired units and delay GHG emission standards until compliance is demonstrated by representative power plants. The bill aims to prevent EPA from setting emission standards for power plants based on compliance with carbon capture projects funded by the government. It would effectively block the EPA from implementing New Source Performance Standards for greenhouse gas emissions from power plants, as the current standards are unattainable for coal-fired plants without financial assistance from the Department of Energy. The Senate bill requires the Administrator to submit a report to Congress before implementing a GHG emission rule for power plants. Other bills in Congress address GHG regulations, including excluding GHGs from the CAA definition of \"air pollutant\" and imposing cost-benefit analysis requirements. In the 113th Congress, multiple bills were introduced regarding EPA's GHG regulatory authority. H.R. 3826, the Electricity Security and Affordability Act, passed the House in March 2014 and was included in House-passed H.R. 2. It addressed EPA's New Source Performance Standards and required a demonstrated system of emission reduction before promulgating standards. The bill did not progress in the Senate. In the 112th Congress, attention was on bills delaying EPA action under the Clean Air Act for stationary sources. In the 112th Congress, bills were introduced to delay EPA action under the Clean Air Act for stationary sources. Legislation introduced by Chairman Upton and Senator Inhofe aimed to permanently remove EPA's authority to regulate greenhouse gases, but did not receive enough support. The bill proposed in the 112th Congress aimed to repeal several EPA greenhouse gas regulations, redefine \"air pollutant\" to exclude greenhouse gases, and restrict EPA from regulating or considering greenhouse gas emissions for climate change. It would not affect federal research programs but would prohibit future mobile source rules for GHG emissions and California waivers for greenhouse gas controls. In comparison to a CRA resolution of disapproval or freestanding legislation, addressing the issue through an amendment to the EPA appropriation bill may be considered easier. This approach has been considered in every session of Congress since 2010, with House appropriations riders prohibiting EPA from proposing or promulgating New Source Performance Standards for GHG emissions from electric generating units. The EPA appropriation bill amendments have consistently prohibited regulations on GHG emissions from various sources, including electric generating units, refineries, motor vehicles, livestock, and manure management systems. Riders enacted in FY2016 focused on potential regulation of agricultural GHG sources. The FY2016 appropriation bill and previous EPA appropriations have included provisions prohibiting regulations on GHG emissions from agricultural sources, including livestock and manure management systems. Congress could amend the Clean Air Act to change EPA's regulatory authority on GHGs. In the 111th Congress, the House passed H.R. 2454 and the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee reported S. 1733, both bills aimed to establish cap-and-trade programs for GHGs and HFCs, while preserving EPA's authority to regulate GHG emissions from mobile sources. The bills also required setting New Source Performance Standards for uncapped major sources of GHGs. The bills in the 111th Congress aimed to establish cap-and-trade programs for GHGs and HFCs while preserving EPA's authority to regulate GHG emissions from mobile sources. They differed in their exemptions from permitting requirements, with H.R. 2454 preventing new sources from coming under certain programs solely based on GHG emissions, while the Senate bill raised the threshold for regulation. H.R. 2454 aimed to prevent sources from needing state permits solely for emitting GHGs, unlike the Senate bill which had a threshold of 25,000 metric tons. Crafting a bill acceptable to a majority on EPA's greenhouse gas regulations would be challenging. EPA's actions on GHGs are similar to past pollutant regulations under the Clean Air Act. The EPA was given broad authority by Congress to regulate pollutants that may endanger public health or welfare. This authority has been used to regulate six criteria pollutants and other pollutants under various sections of the Clean Air Act. GHGs are regulated similarly to past pollutant regulations. Greenhouse gases (GHGs) are global pollutants regulated under the Clean Air Act. Reductions in U.S. emissions alone may not fully solve the problems they cause. Many in Congress are trying to prevent EPA from controlling GHG emissions due to their pervasive nature and potential economic impacts. Opponents have not succeeded in overturning the regulations in the courts or Congress so far. The Supreme Court has stayed EPA's Clean Power Plan implementation pending court challenges. EPA's early GHG-related actions survived challenges in the D.C. Circuit. The Supreme Court ruled in 2014 that EPA could require permitting for GHG emitters subject to permit requirements for other pollutants. Petitioners may have better chances in ongoing litigation. The Supreme Court's unprecedented stay of the Clean Power Plan in February 2016 suggests petitioners may have better chances in litigation against EPA's rules for power plants. Congressional opposition to EPA's GHG actions faces obstacles like the filibuster rule and presidential vetoes, but riders to appropriation bills are seen as having the best odds of success in overturning the regulations."
