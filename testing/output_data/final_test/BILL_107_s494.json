    "content": "The Act titled \"Zimbabwe Democracy and Economic Recovery Act of 2001\" supports peaceful, democratic change, economic growth, and the rule of law in Zimbabwe. SEC. 4. SUPPORT FOR DEMOCRATIC TRANSITION AND ECONOMIC RECOVERY. The term \"international financial institutions\" includes multilateral development banks and the International Monetary Fund. Multilateral development banks consist of various institutions such as the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the African Development Bank. Congress acknowledges the need for democratic transition and economic recovery in Zimbabwe. The Government of Zimbabwe has made itself ineligible for International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and International Monetary Fund programs due to economic mismanagement and undemocratic practices. This has deprived the people of Zimbabwe of much-needed resources for economic recovery and modernization. IMF suspended its support for economic adjustment and reform in Zimbabwe in September 1999, followed by the International Development Association suspending all support in October 1999. The International Development Association (IDA) suspended all financial support to the Government of Zimbabwe, including loans and disbursements for ongoing projects. The Secretary of the Treasury will review the possibility of restructuring or eliminating Zimbabwe's sovereign debt held by the US government upon certification of democratic transition and economic recovery. Upon certification of democratic transition and economic recovery, the Secretary of the Treasury should direct multilateral development banks to review restructuring or eliminating Zimbabwe's sovereign debt. Additionally, international financial institutions should provide financial and technical support to promote Zimbabwe's economic recovery and development. The US government restricts multilateral financing to Zimbabwe until certain conditions are met, including the stabilization of the Zimbabwean dollar and the viability of democratic institutions. The Secretary of the Treasury is instructed to oppose any financial support to the Zimbabwean government until a presidential certification is made. The President must certify to Congress that the rule of law has been restored in Zimbabwe, including respect for property rights and freedom of speech, and that a free and fair presidential election has taken place for multilateral financing to be allowed. The Government of Zimbabwe must meet pre-election conditions, demonstrate commitment to equitable land reform, and fulfill agreements to receive multilateral financing. The Government of Zimbabwe is making efforts to fulfill the terms of the Lusaka agreement on ending the war in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The Zimbabwean Armed Forces and National Police serve the elected civilian government. The President may waive certain provisions if it is in the national interest. Assistance is authorized to support independent media in Zimbabwe. In 2002, funds were authorized to support an independent press and electronic media, land reform, and democracy programs in Zimbabwe. $20,000,000 was allocated for land reform and $6,000,000 for democracy and governance programs. The authority in this section supersedes any other provision of law. Congress urges the President to consult with foreign governments to identify individuals responsible for violence in Zimbabwe, impose sanctions, and consider removing or amending them eventually. The curr_chunk is about the roles of the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the Vice President of the United States as President of the Senate."
