    "content": "The title of the Act is \"Advancing the Global Opportunities for Biotechnology in Agriculture Act of 2000\". Congress finds that biotechnology in agriculture offers substantial benefits to mankind in critical areas such as enhanced crop yields to feed a growing world population, healthier bio-engineered foods to combat diseases in developing countries, and pest and disease resistant crops to improve the environment by reducing the need for herbicides and pesticides. Additionally, greater agricultural yields will help preserve the environment by minimizing the need for additional farmland. Biotechnology in agriculture offers benefits like enhanced crop yields to feed the growing population and healthier bio-engineered foods. Sharing scientific information and regulatory framework globally is crucial for managing this technology and should be part of US foreign assistance programs. International educational programs are essential for sharing scientific information and regulatory frameworks globally, especially in the field of biotechnology in agriculture. $6,000,000 is authorized for international educational programs on biotechnology in agriculture, focusing on regulatory procedures and encouraging acceptance of US-approved products or adoption of science-based approval processes in developing countries. The Agency for International Development will conduct technical exchange programs for foreign officials and US biotechnology experts to educate them on the scientific process and regulatory approval system for biotechnology products. The Agency for International Development sends US biotechnology experts to foreign capitals to educate officials on the scientific process and regulatory approval system for biotechnology in agriculture, addressing safety concerns. The Agency for International Development will establish a group of experts to carry out biotechnology programs, drawing on expertise from regulatory officials in various agencies. The President will establish an interagency process for executive branch agencies to coordinate efforts in promoting agricultural biotechnology. US policies will emphasize science-based decision-making and advocate for this approach in international organizations. Standards for Food Aid: The Agency for International Development and the United States Department of Agriculture should ensure that food and grain products meeting US health and safety requirements are accepted by foreign countries in food aid programs. The Congress believes the Secretary of State should collaborate with US embassies to garner foreign government support for science-based trading regimes in multilateral forums."
