The Act titled \"Environmental Priorities Act of 2003\" allows for the recapture of savings from retail electricity competition. It will take effect in each State once retail electric service choice is established, with providers contributing to the fiscal agent for the Environmental. The State will contribute 10 percent of total consumer savings to the Environmental Priorities Board. Consumer savings are defined as the potential rate minus the current rate, multiplied by total consumption. The term \"current rate\" refers to the average kilowatt-hour rate paid by customers of a provider in a specific consumer sector in a State for the 12 months following the effective date of the Act, recalculated annually. The term \"potential rate\" for any provider of retail electric services in a State and consumer sector means the average kilowatt-hour rate paid by the provider's customers in that sector during the 12-month period before retail electric service choice was established. The Secretary of Energy will adjust the average kilowatt-hour rate for inflation annually. For sectors not serviced by the provider, the Secretary of Energy will estimate or measure the average rate. Regulations will be established for phased-in retail choice to determine the potential rate fairly. The Secretary of Energy will establish regulations to determine the potential rate for sectors where a provider did not serve for the full 12-month period preceding the establishment of retail electric service choice. SEC. 3. USE OF CONTRIBUTIONS FOR ENVIRONMENTAL PRIORITIES. The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency will establish a National Environmental Priorities Board composed of 3 federal officers and 4 State commissioners. Within 180 days, rules and procedures for the Board will be established, with oversight by the Administrator. The National Environmental Priorities Board will establish regulations for an Environmental Priorities Program within 90 days of the Administrator's rules. This program will support State projects such as lowering borrowing costs for wastewater treatment plants and increasing the use of filter strips and riparian buffers. The National Environmental Priorities Board will establish an Environmental Priorities Program to support state projects like riparian buffers for river protection, mitigating electricity production's impact on air quality, preserving open space for conservation and wildlife, and other national environmental priorities. The Board will work with a non-Federal fiscal agent to manage contributions and disburse funds for public purpose programs in states with retail electric service choice. The National Environmental Priorities Board will establish an Environmental Priorities Program for state projects, with matching funding available for eligible programs. States have the option to participate and are not required to fund specific projects. A fiscal agent will distribute contributions received under the program. The National Environmental Priorities Board will distribute contributions to States for eligible environmental priorities programs. States must apply for matching funds before each calendar year and certify the use of funds for eligible public purpose programs. The National Environmental Priorities Board will distribute matching funds to States for eligible environmental programs based on State requests. The Board will calculate the necessary funds to match the projected State funds and communicate this amount to the fiscal agent. Expenditures by the fiscal agent cannot exceed the total balance available. The fiscal agent will distribute matching funds to States for eligible environmental programs designated by the State. Funds distributed will be used solely for the designated programs."
