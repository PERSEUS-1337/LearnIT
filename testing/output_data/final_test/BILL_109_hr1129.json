    "content": "The \"Pitkin County Land Exchange Act of 2006\" authorizes the exchange of land between the United States, Pitkin County, Colorado, and the Aspen Valley Land Trust, a nonprofit organization. The Act defines key terms such as Aspen Valley Land Trust, County, and Federal land. The \"Pitkin County Land Exchange Act of 2006\" defines \"Federal land\" as National Forest System and Bureau of Land Management land in Pitkin County, totaling approximately 51.42 acres. \"Non-Federal land\" is also defined in the Act. The \"Pitkin County Land Exchange Act of 2006\" defines \"non-Federal land\" as approximately 35 acres in the County and 18.2 acres on Smuggler Mountain. The Secretary of Agriculture is referred to as the \"Secretary.\" If the County offers acceptable non-Federal land to the United States, the Secretary and the Secretary of the Interior will accept the offer. The Pitkin County Land Exchange Act of 2006 requires the exchange of Federal land for non-Federal land within a year of enactment. The exchange must be of equal value as determined by appraisals conducted by the Secretary. The Secretary determines land values through appraisals following specific standards. If non-Federal land value exceeds Federal land, the County donates the excess value to the United States. If Federal land value exceeds non-Federal land, the value difference can be adjusted as determined by the Secretary and County. The County can equalize land with the Secretary by making a cash payment, conveying land, or using a combination of both methods. Any cash payment received will be deposited in the fund established by the Sisk Act for use as determined. The Secretary can use deposited funds for acquiring land in Colorado for the National Forest System. The County must ensure public access and restrict usage of the conveyed land for recreational and conservation purposes. The Secretary can acquire land in Colorado for the National Forest System, with conditions on usage and public access. The acquired land will become part of the White River National Forest and be managed according to laws. The White River National Forest land acquisition under this Act will be managed according to applicable laws. Public orders withdrawing Federal land are revoked to allow for disposal, and any land not already withdrawn will be segregated from entry and appropriation. The Federal land acquired under this Act is withdrawn until conveyed to the County, while the non-Federal land becomes permanently withdrawn from appropriation and disposal. Boundary adjustments may be made by agreement between the Secretary, Secretary of the Interior, and the County. Modifications or deletions of parcels and mining claim remnants on Smuggler Mountain for exchange. The curr_chunk is about the roles of the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the Vice President of the United States as President of the Senate."
