    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Historically Black Colleges and Universities Historic Building Restoration and Preservation Act.\" It defines historically black colleges and universities and historic buildings and structures. Historically black colleges and universities have played a significant role in providing equal opportunity in education for African-American, low-income, and educationally disadvantaged individuals. These institutions have faced discrimination in funding, leading them to rely on private support. This support has resulted in historically significant and architecturally unique buildings on their campuses. Many structures at historically black colleges and universities are architecturally unique and considered national treasures worth preserving for future generations. Preservation and restoration grants are available for historic buildings at historically black colleges and universities. In fiscal years 1995 through 1998, the Secretary of the Interior will provide grants to historically black colleges and universities for preserving and restoring historic buildings on campus. Grantees must agree to not alter the property without the Secretary's approval and allow public access for educational purposes. The Federal share of a grant for a building or structure listed on the National Register of Historic Places is limited to 50% of the project cost, unless waived by the Secretary in cases of extreme emergency or public interest. Grants are funded from amounts available under the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966. The National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 limits grants for historic buildings to $20 million in fiscal year 1995, with $5 million for Fisk University and $10 million for historically black colleges and universities. The Black College and University Historic Preservation Initiative allocates up to $15 million for grants in fiscal years 1996, 1997, and 1998. The Secretary will develop regulations to implement this Act."
