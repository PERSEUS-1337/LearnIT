The Congress recognizes the unique historical and legal relationship with American Indian and Alaska Native people, based on treaties, statutes, and court decisions. There are 558 federally recognized Indian tribes in the US, with a significant number in Alaska. Indian tribes have the primary responsibility for their lands, people, and education, including providing adequate educational facilities for their students. Indian schools should be eligible for funding under this Act to discontinue the use of offensive names and symbols that are disrespectful to Native Americans. Over 1,200 schools nationwide use such offensive names, which often become mascots at athletic events. Federal funding should assist schools in ending the use of these offensive terms. Indian schools can receive funding to stop using offensive names and symbols on equipment and apparel, including team jerseys, signs, stationery, walls, fields, and gymnasium floors. Indian schools can receive grants to eliminate offensive names and symbols on equipment and apparel. During a 1-year period, the Secretary of Education can provide grants to eligible schools to stop using derogatory or discriminatory names or depictions on team names, mascots, or nicknames. The grants must be used for replacing uniforms or materials with the offensive names or depictions. The Secretary of Education can provide grants to eligible schools to remove derogatory or discriminatory names or depictions. Grants can be used for altering facilities and for school construction or renovation. Consultation with Indian tribes is required before making any grant. To apply for a grant under this section, the applicant must submit an application with required information as specified by the Secretary. SEC. 4. COMMITTEE ON INDIAN RELATIONS. The Secretary shall establish the Committee on Indian Relations within the Department of Education to address derogatory or discriminatory names and depictions in schools, provide assistance to schools identified with such names, and assist in making grants under the Act. The Committee on Indian Relations within the Department of Education will assist in making grants under the Act and provide cultural proficiency training at schools to address derogatory names or depictions. The Committee will have a Director appointed by the Secretary and may appoint staff as needed. The Committee will terminate at the end of fiscal year 2007. SEC. 5. DEROGATORY OR DISCRIMINATORY NAMES AND DEPICTIONS. Names like Indians, Redskins, Braves, and Chiefs are considered derogatory. The Committee can designate other names as derogatory based on race, ethnicity, nationality, or tribal affiliation. SEC. 6. REPORTS.\n\nNot later than 1 year after enactment of this Act, the Secretary will submit annual reports to the House Committee on Resources and the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs. Reports will summarize activities conducted to carry out the Act and include recommendations for necessary legislation.\n\nSEC. 7. DEFINITIONS. The Act defines key terms such as \"Committee\" as the Committee on Indian Relations, \"school\" as an elementary, secondary, or higher education institution, and \"Indian school\" as a school operated by the Bureau of Indian Affairs or an Indian tribe. The term \"Indian tribe\" refers to a tribe recognized under the Indian Self-Determination Act or the Tribally Controlled Schools Act of 1988.
