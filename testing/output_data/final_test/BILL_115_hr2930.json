    "content": "The \"Drone Innovation Act of 2017\" may be cited as such. Definitions are provided in the Act. The \"Drone Innovation Act of 2017\" provides definitions for terms such as civil aircraft, local government, local operation, and small unmanned aircraft. Civil aircraft refers to unmanned aircraft not classified as public aircraft. Local government is a subdivision of a State. Local operation pertains to flights up to 200 feet above ground level within government jurisdiction. Small unmanned aircraft have a specific definition in the Act. The term \"aircraft\" is defined in the FAA Reform and Modernization Act of 2012. \"State\" refers to States, the District of Columbia, and U.S. territories. \"Tribal Government\" is the governing body of an Indian Tribe as per the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act. The Civil Unmanned Aircraft Policy Framework is outlined in Section 3. The Secretary of Transportation will publish a civil unmanned aircraft local operation policy framework within 6 months of the Act's enactment. The framework will provide guidelines for States, local, and Tribal governments on limitations and restrictions for unmanned aircraft operations, considering economic and non-economic benefits. The Secretary of Transportation will publish a civil unmanned aircraft local operation policy framework to aid governments in creating an innovation-friendly environment and adopting technologies for managing unmanned aircraft operations. The framework will define the preemptive effect of any future regulations related to civil unmanned aircraft systems. The Secretary of Transportation will publish regulations and standards for civil unmanned aircraft systems to ensure safety and efficiency in the national airspace system. The regulations will protect public safety, personal privacy, property rights, manage land use, and restrict nuisances and noise pollution. The Secretary will abide by fundamental principles to maintain the safe use of unmanned aircraft. The regulations for civil unmanned aircraft systems aim to ensure safety and efficiency in the national airspace system while protecting public safety, privacy, and property rights. Innovation and competition in the small unmanned aircraft industry should be supported without creating unreasonable burdens on commerce. States, local, and Tribal governments have the authority to regulate the time, manner, and place of unmanned aircraft operations to foster innovation. State, local, and Tribal officials have the authority to make judgments and issue limitations around events and locations, balancing the need for innovation with public safety concerns. They are best positioned to regulate unmanned aircraft activity that is local in nature. The economic and non-economic benefits of small and civil unmanned aircraft operations can be maximized by empowering State, local, and Tribal governments to foster innovation and competition in the industry. The Department of Transportation should recognize that issues common to these governments do not necessarily require Federal intervention, as they can effectively address them on their own. The Department of Transportation should provide timely information and assistance to State, local, and Tribal governments regarding small unmanned aircraft systems policies to ensure collaboration. The pilot program on federal partnerships is outlined in Section 4. The Secretary of Transportation will establish pilot programs with 20-30 State, local, or Tribal governments to regulate small unmanned aircraft systems using the latest technologies for traffic management and situational awareness. The selection will include governments of varying sizes and approaches. The Secretary will coordinate with NASA to involve participants in pilot programs for small unmanned aircraft systems in developing the traffic management system. The Secretary will coordinate with pilot program participants to submit a report to Congress and the public identifying best practices for regulating small unmanned aircraft systems. SEC. 5. PRESERVATION. In regulations for unmanned aircraft systems, the Secretary cannot allow operation over private property with a reasonable expectation of privacy without owner permission. This section does not override existing rights for civil relief or criminal penalties, including actions for personal injury or property damage. The Secretary cannot issue rules impeding State, local, or Tribal authority over private airspace. No legal action can be taken solely for unmanned aircraft transit over private property unless it substantially interferes with the owner's use or enjoyment. The legislation prohibits State or local governments from unreasonably impeding civil unmanned aircraft from accessing navigable airspace, including bans on overflights and excessive restrictions that make flight nearly impossible within their jurisdiction. The legislation prohibits state or local governments from unreasonably impeding civil unmanned aircraft from accessing navigable airspace, including restrictions that make flight nearly impossible. Operators can still fly over their own property, right of way, easement, lands, or waters. SEC. 6. STATUTORY CONSTRUCTION. Judicial review is available for actions taken by the Secretary of Transportation under specific sections. The Act does not change civil or criminal jurisdiction between Tribal Governments and State or local governments. The Act does not impact manned aircraft operations or the authority of the FAA, nor does it affect the FAA's ability to take emergency action. The Act does not affect the FAA's right to issue temporary flight restrictions, enforce actions against unsafe unmanned aircraft operators, or impede first responders' access to airspace during emergencies."
