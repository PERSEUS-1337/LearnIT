    "content": "The \"Second-Stage Small Business Development Act of 2005\" establishes a four-year pilot program to identify second-stage small businesses with growth potential, provide peer learning opportunities for business growth and job creation, utilize small business development centers for access to these opportunities, and assist businesses owned by minority individuals, service-disabled veterans, and women. The Administrator will establish a pilot program to provide grants to eligible entities for peer learning opportunities for second-stage small business concerns. The Administrator will select 2 eligible entities from each of the 10 regions to receive grants. Eligible entities must be able to receive funding under section 21 of the Small Business Act and submit an application with a plan. The pilot program will provide grants to eligible entities for peer learning opportunities for second-stage small business concerns. The Administrator will evaluate and select eligible entities based on the merit of their plans. Regions for the program include Maine, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire. Regions for the pilot program are divided as follows:\n(A) Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Connecticut, Vermont, Rhode Island.\n(B) New York, New Jersey, Puerto Rico, Virgin Islands.\n(C) Pennsylvania, Maryland, West Virginia, Virginia, District of Columbia, Delaware.\n(D) Georgia, Alabama, North Carolina, South Carolina, Mississippi, Florida, Kentucky, Tennessee.\n(E) Illinois, Ohio, Michigan, Indiana, Wisconsin, Minnesota.\n(F) Texas, New Mexico, Arkansas, Oklahoma, Louisiana.\n(G) Missouri, Iowa, Nebraska, Kansas.\n(H) Colorado, Wyoming, North Dakota, South Dakota, Montana, Utah. The Administrator shall consult with small business development centers forming an association and consider their recommendations in selecting grant recipients within 60 days of promulgating regulations. Eligible entities receiving grants must use funds appropriately. An eligible entity receiving a grant under the pilot program must use the funds to identify and support second-stage small businesses in their service areas through peer learning opportunities. The grant amount is determined based on the population of the state where the entity is located. The pilot program grants must be at least $50,000 and require a matching amount from non-Federal sources, equal to the grant amount or 50% for certain eligible entities. The matching amount must be at least 50% cash and not more than 50% indirect costs and in-kind contributions. Each eligible entity receiving a grant under the pilot program must submit a quarterly report to the Administrator. The report should include a summary of peer learning opportunities, the number of second-stage small businesses assisted, and any measurable economic impact data from the peer learning opportunities. The eligible entities must submit quarterly reports on peer learning opportunities and economic impact data resulting from grant-funded programs. The Administrator acts as a data repository and clearinghouse for information. An annual report evaluating the pilot program's success is due by November 1 each year. The report to Congress evaluates the pilot program's success, detailing peer learning opportunities, assistance to small businesses, economic impact data, and transition to non-government funding. Small business development centers must adhere to privacy requirements. Small business development centers must adhere to privacy requirements, prohibiting the disclosure of personal information without consent unless ordered by a court or for financial audit purposes. The privacy requirements for small business development centers limit disclosure to necessary audit information. The Administrator can access program data and use client information for surveys. The Comptroller General will evaluate the pilot program and report to Congress on whether it should be extended. The pilot program, without modification, should be extended to include all small business development centers. It will terminate on September 30, 2009. SEC. 4.
