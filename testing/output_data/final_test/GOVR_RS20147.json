It originated during the time of the Stuarts in England to discuss taxation and avoid espionage by the Crown. The House of Commons still maintains the tradition of secrecy during Committee meetings. The Committee of the Whole in the House of Representatives has evolved since 1789, originally used to outline major legislation before passing it. Historian Ralph Volney Harlow praised it as a forum for discussing legislation in detail. The Committee of the Whole in the House of Representatives has evolved over time, with standing committees replacing temporary select committees. It now serves as the main forum for discussing and amending legislation, offering more flexibility than formal sessions. The Committee of the Whole in the House of Representatives is more flexible than formal sessions, with rituals marking the transformation when the House resolves into it. The mace is moved to a lower pedestal, symbolizing the shift in authority, and the Speaker designates a colleague to take over. During Committee of the Whole meetings in the House of Representatives, the Speaker designates a colleague to act as chairman, responsible for maintaining order and recognizing members. Measures involving revenue or appropriations must be considered in the Committee of the Whole, which is initiated in three ways by the House. During Committee of the Whole meetings in the House of Representatives, the Speaker designates a colleague to act as chairman, responsible for maintaining order and recognizing members. The House can agree to resolve itself into the Committee of the Whole in three ways: by unanimous consent, by adopting a motion, or by a \"special rule\" authorizing the Speaker to declare the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole for considering a specific measure. This process limits general debate time, controls amendments, and observes House rules during the debate and amendment of the measure. In the Committee of the Whole, only 100 members are needed to constitute a quorum, compared to 218 in the House of Representatives. The chairman has discretion on quorum calls and can end proceedings once 100 members respond, without needing the full 15-minute period. The chairman in the Committee of the Whole has discretion on quorum calls during general debate. Once a quorum is established, the chairman does not need to entertain a quorum call unless a pending question is put to a vote. Debate in the House follows the \"one-hour\" rule, where each Member gets one hour divided between majority and minority sides. In the Committee of the Whole, the \"five-minute\" rule governs debate on amendments. The \"five-minute\" rule governs debate on amendments in the Committee of the Whole. Supporters and opponents of amendments each receive five minutes of debate time. Members can gain additional debate time by offering nonsubstantive amendments or seeking unanimous consent.

Alternatively, a motion to close or limit debate time can be offered, allowing for debate and possible refinement through amendment. Members may still offer filed amendments even after debate is closed. In the Committee of the Whole, Members can offer filed amendments without debate. If amendments were printed in advance in the Congressional Record, Members are guaranteed 10 minutes of debate. A \"special rule\" can override this protection. A smaller number of Members is needed to support a recorded vote in the Committee compared to the House. In the House, one-fifth of those present can trigger a recorded vote, while in Committee, 25 Members are needed. In the Committee of the Whole, 25 Members are needed to support a recorded vote. The Committee dissolves itself by \"rising\" and may resume consideration of a measure later. The chairman reports adopted amendments and recommendations to the House. The Committee of the Whole reports adopted amendments and recommendations to the House for formal agreement. The House may vote on all amendments together or separately, following the order in the bill, not the order of request. Amendments adopted by the Committee could still be defeated by the House. The House considers final passage of the measure after adopting amendments in the bill, not in the order of request."
