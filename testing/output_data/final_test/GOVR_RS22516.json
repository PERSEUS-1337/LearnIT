    "content": "The Patent Act of 1952, found in Title 35 of the United States Code, outlines current patent law. Section 101 states that an invention must be new, useful, and nonobvious to be patentable. Utility requires the invention to be operable and beneficial, novelty means it must not be fully anticipated, and nonobviousness means it must not have been readily achievable by an ordinary artisan. The invention must also be fully described. When the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) issues a patent, the owner gains the right to exclude others from using the patented invention. The term of a patent is typically 20 years from the filing date. In a 2013 Supreme Court decision, it was ruled that genomic DNA cannot be patented under the \"product of nature\" doctrine, unless significant artificial changes are made to it. The USPTO issued over 50,000 patents related to DNA, including human genes, but experts argued that genes should not be patented as they are products of nature. The Supreme Court decision in Myriad reflected this view, with a lawsuit filed against the USPTO, Myriad Genetics, Inc., and the University of Utah Research Foundation challenging gene patents. The plaintiffs challenged Myriad's gene patents on BRCA1 and BRCA2, claiming human genes are naturally occurring and not patentable. The U.S. District Court ruled in favor of the plaintiffs, stating that Myriad's isolated DNA was not significantly different from native DNA and therefore not patentable. The Federal Circuit reversed the ruling that isolated DNA could not be patented, stating that it has been chemically manipulated to be different from natural DNA. The Supreme Court vacated the judgment and remanded the case back to the Federal Circuit for reconsideration. The Federal Circuit once again held that isolated DNA and cDNA were patent eligible. The Supreme Court then granted certiorari and Justice Thomas observed that Myriad had not created or altered the genetic information in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. Myriad did not create or alter the genetic information in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. The Supreme Court found that isolating DNA did not constitute an act of invention, as it did not involve chemical changes. However, the Court viewed cDNA more favorably, noting that it retains naturally occurring exons but is distinct from the original DNA. Justice Thomas concluded that cDNA, while retaining naturally occurring exons of DNA, is distinct from the original DNA and therefore can be patented. The Myriad opinion did not involve innovative gene manipulation methods or altered DNA sequences, but rather focused on the patent eligibility of isolated genes and the information they encode. Seven colleagues joined Justice Thomas in this opinion, with Justice Scalia providing a brief concurring statement. Scalia concurred with the Court's judgment on gene patenting, except for detailed molecular biology aspects. He believed isolated genomic DNA was natural and cDNA could be patented as synthetic. After the ruling, Myriad Genetics sued genetic testing providers for patent infringement. Despite invalidating Myriad's genomic DNA claims, other genetic technology claims were pursued. The litigation surrounding gene patenting, particularly in relation to the BRCA1 gene, may impact the patentability of gene-related inventions post the Supreme Court's decision. The decision is expected to make it challenging for inventors to protect early gene-related discoveries through the patent system. The courts' application of the decision to other biologic products like antisense DNA, microRNA, proteins, and stem cells is yet to be seen. However, the Supreme Court seems to approve of patent claims for chemically modified naturally occurring substances, suggesting even slightly altered genes could be considered patentable subject matter. The USPTO clarified that naturally occurring nucleic acids are not patent eligible, but altered genes, like cDNA or man-made variants, remain eligible. Firms using cDNA for therapeutic proteins may benefit from the Myriad case. The Myriad case impacts the patent eligibility of novel therapeutic proteins. The Court's decision distinguishes between genomic DNA and cDNA, stating that while DNA is not patentable, cDNA may be patented. This ruling is in line with the earlier Mayo v. Prometheus case, which emphasized that conventional or obvious pre-solution activities do not make a law of nature patent-eligible. The debate over gene patents continues, with the USPTO allowing patents for altered genes like cDNA or man-made variants. The debate on gene patents remains active, with concerns about outsiders owning genetic makeup without consent. Gene patents can hinder access to testing procedures and research, as holders can control the use of genes. Opponents of gene patents argue that patents on specific genetic information limit medical research and testing options. However, some experts believe that individuals do not own tissues or cells once they are outside the body, and there is no evidence of patients being unable to access genetic tests due to patents. The debate on gene patents continues, with concerns about ownership of genetic material without consent. Professor Iain Cockburn argues that patents do not have a negative impact on scientific research, as they provide an economic incentive for companies to invest in R&D and commercialization. Companies that control their investments through patents are more likely to engage in research activities. Research funding covers about a quarter of the costs of bringing a new product to market. According to The Economist, patent ownership encourages investment in new products, especially for small businesses. Universities use patents to motivate licensing to the private sector for commercialization. Patents are crucial in the pharmaceutical industry for protecting innovation. Patents are crucial in the pharmaceutical sector, with research showing they are the most effective means of protecting innovations, especially in biotechnology. Studies also highlight differences in patent importance between health-related sectors and software/internet fields. Studies have shown that patents are crucial in the pharmaceutical sector, with 65% of pharmaceutical inventions relying on patent protection for market entry. This is in contrast to only 8% of innovations in other industries. Patents are particularly important in this sector due to the ease of replicating pharmaceutical products compared to other industries. The perception of patents' effectiveness is positively correlated with the increase in duplication costs and time associated with patents. Costs associated with imitating a product are low compared to the innovator's costs for discovering and developing a new compound. Patents have a significant impact on costs in certain industries, such as the pharmaceutical sector (40%), major new chemical products (30%), and typical chemical goods (25%). However, in industries like electronics, patents have a smaller impact on imitation costs (7%-15%). Opponents of gene patents argue that they hinder additional research by requiring licensing fees for patented genes. Some experts argue that gene patents can hinder research by requiring licensing fees, particularly in the biomedical research community. Ownership of research tools may also lead to delayed innovation and potential litigation, according to Professors Rebecca Eisenberg and Richard Nelson. Patents can impede research by others, especially with broad claims on early discoveries essential to emerging fields of knowledge. In the context of gene patents hindering research and ownership of research tools leading to delayed innovation, Professor Arti Rai emphasizes the importance of fundamental research platforms for advancing science. While patent protection may stimulate private investment, patents on research tools could restrict access to valuable discoveries that should be widely disseminated for the greatest social benefit. F. Scott Kieff, a visiting faculty member at Northwestern University School of Law, argues against the idea of a \"norm\" favoring open scientific access over intellectual property protection in basic biological science. He believes that patents do not hinder research and actually contribute to the success of the biotechnology community. Bendekgey and Hamlet-Cox also find no evidence that gene patents have impeded research in the biomedical field or gene therapies. Scientists are able to continue research by licensing, inventing around patents, going offshore, using public databases and research tools, court challenges, and infringing on technology without a license. Private sector owners of patents allow infringement in academia to increase the value of patented technology. Patents do not substantially impact basic biomedical research, with very few academics reporting stopping a project due to another's patent. The U.S. system of research, development, and commercialization has had a clear impact on the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries. Policies related to funding for R&D, intellectual property protection, and cooperative ventures have been crucial for economic success. Patent ownership incentivizes companies to commercialize research results. Ownership through patents incentivizes companies to invest in research and development, particularly in the pharmaceutical industry where patents are crucial for innovation. The recent decision in Myriad may impact research and development in healthcare."
