    "content": "The \"Agriculture Data Act of 2018\" is cited as the short title. It amends the Food Security Act of 1985 by adding a section on data related to conservation practices. The section aims to study the impact of conservation practices on farm profitability by analyzing data. It defines \"covered conservation practice\" as methods that protect soil health and productivity while enhancing crop yields sustainably. The Department of Agriculture, through various officials, will annually review and summarize research on the effects of conservation practices on crop yields, soil health, and farm profitability. The Department of Agriculture will review data on the impacts of conservation practices on crop yields, soil health, and farm profitability, including data from various agencies like the Farm Service Agency and the Natural Resources Conservation Service. Additional producer data will also be collected to assess the benefits of conservation practices on farm and ranch profitability. The Department of Agriculture will collect producer data in a compatible format at the field- and farm-level to reduce risk and improve farm profitability. Producers can voluntarily provide additional research and supplemental data for conservation practices. The Department of Agriculture will collect producer data to analyze the impacts of conservation practices on crop yields, soil health, and farm profitability. Data will be integrated, analyzed, and linked with external sources to establish a conservation and farm productivity data warehouse for academic use. The Department of Agriculture will collaborate with academic institutions and researchers to widely disseminate research and data on the impacts of conservation practices on crop yields, soil health, and farm profitability. This information will be easily used and implemented by producers and stakeholders. The Department of Agriculture will collaborate with academic institutions and researchers to provide technical assistance, expertise, and access to data for developing a data warehouse. Producers can voluntarily participate in additional research to analyze the impacts of conservation practices on crop yields, soil health, and farm profitability. The Department of Agriculture will collaborate with academic institutions and researchers to provide technical assistance, expertise, and access to data for developing a data warehouse. Producers can voluntarily participate in additional research to analyze the impacts of conservation practices on crop yields, soil health, and farm profitability. Procedures will be established to protect the integrity and confidentiality of proprietary producer data, including prohibiting the sale of individual producer data and requiring published research to release only aggregated data. The Secretary will provide producer tools within three years of the enactment of this section. The Secretary will provide technical assistance, including internet-based tools, to help producers improve sustainable production practices and increase yields. The tools will offer confidential farm-specific data and general information on the benefits of conservation practices for crop yields, soil health, and farm profitability. The Secretary will provide technical assistance to improve sustainable production practices and increase yields, including confidential farm-specific data and information on conservation practices for improving farm profitability. The section also outlines the reporting requirements to be submitted annually to relevant committees. The Secretary will provide technical assistance for sustainable production practices and yield improvement. The annual report will include a summary of analysis, number of producers providing information, planned activities for the next fiscal year, and status of implementation of activities."
