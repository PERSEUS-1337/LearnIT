    "title": "SB 39",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 5205.5 of the Vehicle Code is amended to provide distinctive identifiers for vehicles meeting specific emission standards, with fees to cover costs incurred by the department. The Department of Transportation may remove HOV lane access for vehicles meeting specific emission standards if the lane exceeds a certain level of congestion. The department must inform vehicle owners of these provisions on registration renewal notices. The State Air Resources Board maintains a listing of eligible vehicles for programs in HOV lanes to reduce congestion. The Department of the California Highway Patrol, in consultation with the Department of Transportation, will design and specify the placement of unique decals for vehicles in HOV lane programs. These decals will be distinguishable based on vehicle type and a limit of 85,000 decals will be issued by the department. The Department of the California Highway Patrol, in consultation with the Department of Transportation, will issue distinctive decals for vehicles in HOV lane programs. The decals will be for vehicles specified in paragraph (3) of subdivision (a) and limited to 85,000. The department may issue decals for vehicles meeting specific conditions, including being of a certain type and owned by the owner of a previously issued decal for a nonrepairable or total loss salvage vehicle. The owner of a vehicle can apply for a decal within six months of the vehicle being declared nonrepairable or a total loss salvage. The Metropolitan Transportation Commission must grant toll-free passage to vehicles with specific identifiers issued by the department. Vehicles with specific identifiers issued by the department can receive toll-free or reduced-rate passage in high-occupancy toll lanes, except for toll roads or highways not designated as such. This exemption does not apply to tolls on lanes designated for tolls under a federal program for State Highway Route 10 or 110 before March 1, 2014. The Director of Transportation may submit a notice to the Secretary of State if federal law does not allow vehicles with specific identifiers to use high-occupancy lanes. The section will be inoperative on January 1, 2019, or upon expiration of federal authorization under Section 166 of Title 23 of the United States Code, or upon notice to the Secretary of State as per subdivision (i). It will be repealed on January 1, 2019, unless a later statute extends the dates. This act is an urgency statute for public peace, health, or safety and will take immediate effect. To ensure immediate eligibility for new owners of qualifying clean alternative fuel vehicles and provide long-term incentives, this act must take effect immediately."
