    "content": "The federal government spends over $50 billion annually on biomedical research, primarily through agencies within the Department of Health and Human Services. The FDA reviews biomedical research for products like drugs and medical devices to ensure scientific rigor and lack of bias, with a focus on conflicts of interest. Financial conflicts of interest can potentially undermine research integrity, as researchers may feel pressured to favor certain outcomes to benefit their personal interests. This can lead to biased or less credible research findings. To prevent such conflicts, measures need to be in place. The report provides a legal overview of federal requirements regarding financial conflicts of interest in biomedical research funded or regulated by the government. It focuses on HHS requirements but also discusses regulations from other agencies like the FDA, NSF, and Department of Defense. The report concludes with an overview of current developments in the law governing financial conflicts of interest (FCOIs) in biomedical research. Federal funding for biomedical research primarily comes from HHS, specifically the United States Public Health Service (PHS). Regulations issued by HHS ensure that federally funded biomedical research is objective and serves the public welfare. Institutions seeking grants from PHS agencies must establish procedures to address FCOIs. The PHS regulations require institutions receiving grants to establish procedures to ensure research is free from bias due to conflicts of interest. Many universities have adopted similar policies, making the PHS regulations widely applicable to biomedical research. The regulations apply to FCOIs of Investigators. The PHS objectivity regulations apply to Investigators in institutions receiving PHS research funding. Institutions must gather information on Investigators' financial interests, assess for conflicts of interest, manage bias, report findings to the funding agency, and monitor Investigators annually. Institutions must have a written FCOI policy, ensure Investigators are informed, and provide training on the policy before engagement in research. Institutions must require Investigators to complete training on the policy before PHS-funded research. Institutions can set stricter disclosure requirements than federal rules. Some agencies have their own systems for FCOI information submission. For example, NIH's eRA Commons allows institutions to manage FCOI reporting for grant applications. Each grant may have unique FCOI requirements, but eRA Commons helps ensure compliance with PHS regulations. Investigators must disclose their \"significant financial interests\" to the Institution's designated official by the date of application for funds. A financial interest is considered \"significant\" if it exceeds the minimum threshold and appears related to the Investigator's institutional responsibilities. The threshold value for significance varies based on the source of the financial interest, such as remuneration and equity interest from publicly traded entities exceeding $5,000 in aggregate over the past 12 months. Other thresholds include remuneration from non-publicly traded entities exceeding $5,000 or any equity interest, income from intellectual property rights, and travel expenses related to institutional responsibilities. Investigators must disclose significant financial interests to the designated official, including the purpose, sponsor, destination, and duration of trips. Exclusions from significant financial interests include salaries, royalties, income from investment funds not directly controlled by the Investigator, income from seminars or teaching engagements, and income from advisory committees. These exclusions apply when the funding and employing institutions are the same. If a for-profit company applies for a PHS-funded research grant, an Investigator working for the company may not need to disclose his retirement fund to his employer for certification. Financial interests above a threshold amount must be disclosed if they reasonably appear related to an Investigator's institutional responsibilities. The Institution must establish a policy to guide disclosure decisions. Institutional responsibilities may include research, teaching, or committee memberships. The Investigator has the initial burden of disclosure. The Investigator has the initial burden of disclosure, and the decision about which interests require disclosure is left to them. The scope of an Institution's policy will determine which interests must be disclosed. Federal regulations have no threshold amount for travel expenses related to an Investigator's institutional responsibilities, so if it reasonably appears related, it must be disclosed according to the university's FCOI policy. The university requires disclosure of expenses related to an individual's field of expertise. Any interest resulting from professional activities must be disclosed, such as travel expenses for presenting at a conference. The institutional official must determine if disclosed interests are related to funded research and if they constitute a financial conflict of interest. The university requires disclosure of expenses related to an individual's field of expertise, including travel expenses for conferences. The institutional official must determine if disclosed interests are related to funded research and if they constitute a financial conflict of interest. Institutions are responsible for developing guidelines to determine conflicts of interest, such as the University of Louisville's Conflicts Review Board. The University of Louisville's criteria for determining conflicts of interest in funded research involve assessing the likelihood of conflict, oversight mechanisms, importance of the research, involvement of human subjects, and available alternatives to avoid conflict. The regulations suggest two distinct steps in reviewing financial interests for conflicts of interest, with a focus on whether the financial interest relates to the specific research being funded. The institutional official must determine if a financial interest could influence research findings or if the entity providing the interest stands to gain financially. For example, holding stock in a company that could benefit from research results would be considered related to the research. Disclosure is required even if the interest is not directly related to the funded research. The professor must disclose financial interests related to NIH-funded research on MS, even if not directly related. If the interest could significantly affect the research, disclosure is required. The professor's small financial interest of $100 from a pharmaceutical company may not directly impact the research on MS funded by NIH. The link between the financial interest and the research is not significant enough to amount to a FCOI. When a FCOI is determined, the agency must follow five steps, including developing a management plan to address it. This can involve disclosing the conflict, appointing an independent monitor, modifying the research plan, changing personnel, reducing the financial interest, or severing the relationship. New potential conflicts from Investigators must also be evaluated and managed. An Institution must comply with ongoing monitoring and reporting requirements for conflicts of interest. Reports must be submitted before expending any funds for conflicts not entirely eliminated under the management plan. Any new conflicts discovered must be reported within 60 days, with a detailed explanation of the management plan implemented. Each report must detail the conflicting interest and explain its impact on the funded research. An Institution must submit an annual FCOI report detailing the status of conflicts of interest and any changes to the management plan. Records of disclosures, responses, and actions taken must be maintained for three years. Enforcement mechanisms should be in place to ensure compliance with the FCOI policy. An Institution must be prepared to use \"employee sanctions or other administrative actions\" to ensure Investigator compliance with FCOI policy. Certification for funding requires an up-to-date FCOI policy, enforcement against Investigators, management of discovered FCOIs, and prompt compliance with disclosure requests from HHS. PHS funding agencies have the authority to take corrective actions for noncompliance, ranging from recommendations for resolution to funding suspension. By following these steps, an Institution can effectively manage and control FCOIs to prevent conflicts. The university can manage and control a FCOI to prevent bias in federally supported biomedical research. For example, they can require disclosure of potential conflicts, prohibit certain actions, and enforce compliance through sanctions. Compliance with PHS regulations is essential in managing FCOIs effectively. The university must comply with PHS FCOI reporting policies for the professor's conflict in research projects involving human subjects. The HHS Common Rule provides regulations for managing conflicts of interest in biomedical research, including human subject testing. Protection for human subjects in medical research is based on the Nuremberg Code. The Nuremberg Code and the National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research have contributed to ethical principles in medical research. The Belmont Report established key ethical principles leading to the HHS Common Rule, which applies to federally regulated research involving human subjects. The HHS Common Rule regulates research activities, with the FDA overseeing the development of new human drugs. Private company research not subject to HHS Common Rule unless directly related to agency regulations. Certain exemptions exist for human subject research, such as educational testing, publicly available data research, program evaluations, and food quality evaluations. The Common Rule, implemented through Institutional Review Boards (IRBs), ensures compliance for research supported by federal agencies. IRBs must have diverse, qualified members to review research proposals. Conflicts of interest disqualify members from participating in reviews. Financial disclosure requirements are not specified by the Common Rule. The Common Rule does not specify financial disclosure requirements for IRB members with potential conflicts of interest. Universities may have additional criteria for disclosing conflicts. IRB assurance for government-funded research must comply with HHS Common Rule safeguards. The HHS Common Rule outlines IRB responsibilities, including reviewing research projects to minimize harm to subjects and ensure informed consent. While not explicitly requiring disclosure of individual researchers' conflicts of interest, IRBs must certify that risks are reasonable and subject selection is equitable. The HHS Common Rule outlines IRB responsibilities, including reviewing research projects to minimize harm to subjects and ensure informed consent. While not explicitly requiring disclosure of individual researchers' conflicts of interest, IRBs must certify that risks are reasonable and subject selection is equitable. Institutions regulate FCOIs and human subject testing, with IRBs having discretionary authority over FCOIs. The FDA has its own rules governing human subject research and takes a different approach to FCOIs due to its role as a \"gatekeeper\" for product approval. The FDA's version of the Common Rule differs from the HHS Common Rule in scope, applying to all clinical investigations related to investigational drugs and devices, including privately funded trials. Both rules largely mirror each other in regulating federally supported and privately funded clinical research. The FDA regulations on human subject testing, like the HHS Common Rule, bar IRB members with conflicting interests from project reviews. The FDA defers to IRBs to monitor FCOIs, prompted by an Inspector General report in 1991 highlighting the need for FDA regulations on financial conflicts of interest among clinical investigators. The FDA regulations require submission of financial information for marketing applications involving clinical tests on FDA-covered products. Institutions have less authority in reviewing financial conflicts of interest compared to PHS requirements. Applicants must disclose financial interests for FDA review. The FDA requires disclosure of financial interests in clinical studies for market approval. Investigators must certify no financial arrangements or disclose any existing ones, such as compensation tied to study outcomes or significant equity in the sponsor. The FDA requires disclosure of financial interests in clinical studies for market approval. Investigators must certify no financial arrangements or disclose any existing ones, such as compensation tied to study outcomes or significant equity in the sponsor. Significant financial interests include non-public entities with values that cannot be readily established, public entities with interests exceeding $50,000, proprietary interests in the product, and payments from the sponsor exceeding $25,000 not for funding the trial. The FDA evaluates these interests for their impact on trial reliability, study design, and integrity of data. The FDA requires disclosure of financial interests in clinical studies for market approval, with investigators certifying no financial arrangements or disclosing existing ones. The FDA can audit investigators, request further analysis, independent studies, or discredit results. The National Science Foundation (NSF) has a similar FCOI policy for funded research, requiring disclosure of significant financial interests by investigators. The NSF defines a significant financial interest as anything with a monetary value over $10,000, excluding certain types of financial interests such as remuneration from the grantee institution, ownership interests in specific programs, income from teaching or speaking engagements, and aggregated interests not exceeding $10,000. The NSF requires institutions to determine if disclosed significant financial interests could impact funded research or educational activities. If a conflict is found, conditions or restrictions must be imposed to manage it. Unlike the PHS policy, NSF allows reviewers to consider the benefit of the research when deciding on restrictions. Additionally, the government does not need to be continually informed on how conflicts are managed under NSF rules. The NSF rules require institutions to report FCOIs that have not been satisfactorily managed. The DOD provides funding opportunities for biomedical research through CDMRP, including grants for various research areas. DOD FCOI policy mandates disclosure of all individuals with potential conflicts of interest during the application process. The DOD's funding application instructions require applicants to disclose potential conflicts of interest, referring them back to their institution's policy. This policy extends to all research conducted by the institution's employees, potentially imposing stricter requirements than PHS regulations. The DOD has adopted the HHS Common Rule for human subject research, while the PHS revised its objectivity rules in 2011, including lowering financial interest reporting thresholds. The PHS revised its financial conflict rules in 2011, which included lowering reporting thresholds and expanding obligations for institutions receiving federal funds. While these revisions aimed to increase clarity and transparency, the administration of FCOI processes still primarily falls on grantee institutions. This decentralized approach may lead to compliance issues, especially for investigators working with multiple institutions that have varying processes for adhering to federal rules. Some argue that oversight at individual institutions may lead to compliance issues due to varying financial conflict policies. There are concerns about vague FCOI policies and a call for a uniform federal policy. However, others caution against a one-size-fits-all approach. The debate over federal FCOI regulations in biomedical research continues, with recent updates to PHS objectivity rules. HHS and FDA are looking to modernize the Common Rule to address FCOI issues. The current version of the Common Rule has a problem with ensuring human test subjects are informed about financial relationships between researchers and study sponsors. HHS is considering amending the Common Rule to require institutions to disclose this information in consent forms. Additionally, there are suggestions to expand the scope of the Common Rule to cover all research activities at institutions receiving funding from Common Rule agencies and to harmonize federal rules on human subject testing across adopting agencies. This could potentially impact FCOI management in biomedical research. HHS has not issued new final rules amending the Common Rule since soliciting public comments in July 2011. FDA released draft guidance on human subject testing in July 2014, recommending disclosure of financial relationships to subjects. Proposed legislation has urged HHS to expand Common Rule regulations on managing potential FCOIs in human subject testing, but no recent changes have been enacted into law."
