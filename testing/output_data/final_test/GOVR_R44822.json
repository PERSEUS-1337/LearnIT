    "content": "The Cuban Commission for Human Rights reported a significant decline in short-term detentions for political reasons in 2018, with 2,873 detentions, a 45% decrease from 2017. Cuba's National Assembly approved a draft constitution without provisions for same-sex marriage, following public opposition. President Trump signed the 2018 farm bill into law on December 20, 2018. The 2018 farm bill, P.L. 115-334 (H.R. 2), allows funding for export promotion programs for U.S. agricultural products in Cuba. Major League Baseball reached an agreement with the Cuban Baseball Federation to allow players from Cuba to sign contracts without defecting. The Trump Administration updated its list of restricted Cuban entities, with 205 entities currently on the list. On November 1, 2018, National Security Adviser John Bolton criticized the Cuban government on human rights in Miami, FL. The Administration was considering suspending Title III of the LIBERTAD Act to allow lawsuits in U.S. federal court against those involved in confiscated property in Cuba, potentially increasing sanctions. The United Nations General Assembly approved a resolution opposing the U.S. embargo on Cuba, with a vote of 189-2. On October 26, 2018, U.S. media reports highlighted a TV Mart\u00ed program that disparaged George Soros with anti-Semitic language and conspiracy theories. The program was pulled from the website by the Office of Cuba Broadcasting, and the U.S. Agency for Global Media CEO stated it was against professional standards. On October 15, 2018, Cuban political activist Tom\u00e1s N\u00fa\u00f1ez Magdariaga was released from prison after a hunger strike. The State Department had called for his release, citing false charges and a sham trial. President Trump signed the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018, which included provisions on Cuban airport security and air charter flights between the U.S. and Cuba. Developments in Cuba and U.S. policy towards the island nation have been significant congressional concerns for many years. Congress has played an active role in shaping U.S. policy towards Cuba, enacting measures such as the Cuban Democracy Act of 1992 and the Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act of 1996. These measures strengthened economic sanctions on Cuba but also provided roadmaps for normalization of relations. Congress modified its sanctions-based policy with the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000, allowing for U.S. agricultural exports to Cuba. In 2009, Congress eased restrictions on family travel and marketing of agricultural exports to Cuba. The Obama Administration further lifted restrictions on family travel, cash remittances, educational and religious travel, and donative remittances. In 2014, President Obama shifted U.S. policy towards Cuba from sanctions to engagement and normalization. The shift in U.S. policy towards Cuba in 2014 moved from sanctions to engagement and normalization, leading to the restoration of diplomatic relations and easing of travel and commerce restrictions. Congressional reactions were mixed, with some supporting the change and others opposing it. Legislation in the 114th Congress reflected this divide, with bills introduced to either ease sanctions or block the policy shift. The report examines U.S. policy towards Cuba in the 115th Congress, focusing on Cuba's political and economic environment, U.S. policy, and selected issues in U.S.-Cuban relations. The report discusses U.S.-Cuban relations, including travel and trade restrictions, funding for democracy and human rights projects, migration, antidrug cooperation, U.S. property claims, and U.S. fugitives from justice in Cuba. Legislative initiatives in the 115th Congress are highlighted, with links to U.S. government information and reports on Cuba provided in the appendices. For more information on Cuba, readers can refer to various CRS reports listed in the report. Cuba became an independent nation in 1902 after being a Spanish colony until the Spanish-American War in 1898. The country was a major sugar producer in the 19th century, with African slaves working on sugar plantations. After gaining independence in 1902, Cuba was influenced by the United States, which intervened multiple times to maintain stability. The Platt Amendment allowed the US to intervene in Cuban affairs until its repeal in 1934. Cuba's political system often saw authoritarian leaders like Gerardo Machado (1925-1933). After gaining independence in 1902, Cuba was influenced by the United States, with authoritarian leaders like Gerardo Machado (1925-1933) and military dominance. Fulgencio Batista's presidency in 1940 was followed by a period of corruption and political violence. Batista seized power in 1952, leading to popular unrest and Fidel Castro's rise to power through the 26th of July Movement. Castro's failed attack in 1953 led to his exile in Mexico before returning to Cuba in 1956 to overthrow Batista's brutal dictatorship. Fidel Castro returned to Cuba in 1956 with the 26th of July Movement to overthrow the Batista dictatorship. Batista fled in 1959, leading to Castro's 47-year rule until he stepped down in 2006 due to poor health. He consolidated power, repressed dissent, and aligned with the Soviet Union, worsening relations with the United States. After overthrowing the Batista dictatorship in 1959, Fidel Castro declared the Cuban revolution as socialist and later proclaimed himself a Marxist-Leninist. Cuba became a close ally of the Soviet Union until its dissolution in 1991. Castro ruled by decree until 1976 when a new Constitution established the Cuban Communist Party as the leading force in the country. Legislative authority now rests with the National Assembly of People's Power. The National Assembly of People's Power in Cuba has permanent commissions that work year-round. A Council of State, elected by the Assembly, acts on its behalf when not in session. The president of the Council of State serves as the country's head of state and government. Executive power is vested in a Council of Ministers, also led by the president of the Council of State. Fidel Castro held the position of head of state and government from 1976 until February 2008, despite temporarily stepping down in 2006 due to poor health. He was re-elected to the National Assembly in January 2008. Fidel Castro was re-elected to the National Assembly in January 2008 but declined the position as president of the Council of State in February 2008, leading to Ra\u00fal Castro becoming president. Fidel continued to influence Cuban politics through essays and reportedly slowed economic reforms. His death in November 2016 marked a generational change in the Cuban government. Current President Miguel D\u00edaz-Canel Berm\u00fadez succeeded Ra\u00fal Castro in April 2018 after serving as first vice president since 2013. Ra\u00fal Castro will remain as first secretary of the PCC until 2021. Cuba's president is selected by the National Assembly of People's Power, not through direct elections. Ra\u00fal Castro took over from his brother Fidel in 2006 and served two five-year terms as president. Ra\u00fal Castro served as Cuba's president for two five-year terms, implementing gradual economic policy changes. Elections for the National Assembly were postponed from January to March 2018 due to damage from Hurricane Irma. The electoral process was tightly controlled by the government. President D\u00edaz-Canel, a trained engineer, was appointed as Cuba's president after serving as first vice president since 2013. His promotion signaled a shift towards generational change in the country's political system. Despite tight government control over the electoral process, D\u00edaz-Canel's rise to power was seen as a significant development. President D\u00edaz-Canel, a trained engineer, was appointed as Cuba's president after serving as first vice president since 2013. His promotion signaled a shift towards generational change in the country's political system. Although initially seen as a moderate open to reform, a leaked video showed him strongly criticizing dissidents, independent voices, and the expansion of Cuba's private sector. Some believe his rhetoric was aimed at gaining acceptance from hard-liners in Cuba's political system. This marks the first time since the 1959 revolution that a Castro is not leading the government. Ra\u00fal Castro's departure marks a generational leadership change in Cuba, with Miguel D\u00edaz-Canel taking over as president. The separation of government and party leadership roles could shift power dynamics. Salvador Vald\u00e9s Mesa, the new First Vice President, represents a departure from the historical revolutionary period. Miguel D\u00edaz-Canel, the new president of Cuba, faces challenges in reforming the economy and addressing calls for greater freedom. The Council of State has seen significant changes, with 45% new members, 48% women, and 45% Afro-Cuban or mixed race. Despite some older leaders remaining, the average age of members is 54, with most born after the 1959 revolution. Ra\u00fal Castro's economic reforms have been slow, leading to stagnant growth and discontent among the population. The slow pace of economic reform in Cuba has hindered growth and disappointed those seeking more economic freedom. The government has faced challenges in moving forward with reforms and is under pressure to address calls for political reform and freedom of expression. Despite some liberalization of individual freedoms under Ra\u00fal Castro, tight control over the political system is expected to continue in the short to medium term. The increasing demand for access to information and social/political expression in Cuba, driven by technological advancements, raises concerns about the government's repression of dissidents and activists. The role of Castro and other revolutionary figures in shaping government policy remains uncertain, with Ra\u00fal expected to maintain influence until 2021. President D\u00edaz-Canel's Cabinet includes many ministers from the Castro era, indicating continuity in key ministries. President D\u00edaz-Canel's Cabinet includes mostly ministers from the Castro era, with only 9 out of 26 being new, including 2 vice presidents and 7 new ministers. Despite initial observations of little change, D\u00edaz-Canel showed independence by making decisions responsive to public concerns. In December, he eased harsh regulations on the private sector and backed away from implementing a controversial decree on artistic expression. Decree 349, issued in July 2018 to regulate artistic expression, faced criticism from Cuba's artistic community. The government announced a gradual implementation with consensus, but it remains to be seen if this will satisfy the artists. In December, a proposed constitutional change allowing same-sex marriage was eliminated after public backlash. Cuba is currently in the process of rewriting its 1976 constitution, with a referendum scheduled for February 2019. In 2018, proposed changes to Cuba's constitution underwent public debate and revisions by the National Assembly. A new version was approved in December, with voters scheduled to approve it in February 2019. One controversial change was the removal of a provision for gender-neutral marriage, which faced opposition from evangelical churches and Cuban bishops. The proposed constitution now remains silent on defining matrimony. The proposed constitution in Cuba remains silent on defining matrimony and includes provisions such as an appointed prime minister, age limit for presidency, right to own private property, state control over the economy, and the Communist Party as the only recognized party. The Cuban government has a poor human rights record, restricting freedoms of expression and harassing dissident organizations. The Cuban government continues to harass human rights and dissident organizations, including the Ladies in White and the Patriotic Union of Cuba. Several political prisoners have conducted hunger strikes, resulting in the deaths of two individuals. Arbitrary imprisonments and lack of respect for the government have led to tragic outcomes for members of these organizations. In June 2016, a Cuban prisoner accused of lack of respect for the government died in prison. Despite poor human rights conditions, Cuba has made progress in recent years, including lifting restrictions on Cubans staying in hotels and eliminating the exit permit requirement for travel abroad. The government has also expanded internet connectivity through hotspots and cellphone capabilities. In late 2018, internet capability on cellphones improved. Short-term detentions for political reasons decreased significantly in 2017 and 2018. The Senate approved S.Res. 224 (Durbin) in April 2018, calling for an investigation into the death of democracy activist Oswaldo Pay\u00e1 in 2012 and urging the Cuban government to respect human rights and provide democratic freedoms to its citizens. Pay\u00e1 founded the Christian Liberation Movement in 1988, advocating for peaceful democratic change and human rights. In 1996, Pay\u00e1 founded the Varela Project, collecting signatures for political reform in Cuba. Resolutions in 2018 aimed to honor Las Damas de Blanco and call for democratic freedoms in Cuba. The State Department highlighted Cuba's political prisoners in October 2018, despite disruptions from Cuban diplomats. In December 2018, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo asked Cuba for an explanation regarding the detention of political prisoners. The Cuban Commission for Human Rights estimated around 130-140 political prisoners in the country. The list included opponents of the regime and individuals accused of planning violence. According to the State Department's human rights report on Cuba in 2017, there were an estimated 65 to 100 political prisoners. The government's lack of transparency and systematic violations of due process rights allowed for the prosecution of peaceful activists. Dr. Eduardo Cardet, a political activist designated as a \"prisoner of conscience\" by Amnesty International, has been imprisoned since. Dr. Eduardo Cardet, a \"prisoner of conscience\" designated by Amnesty International, has been imprisoned since November 2016 for criticizing Fidel Castro. He was sentenced to three years in prison for peacefully exercising his freedom of expression. Amnesty International called for his immediate release and issued urgent action notices in January and June 2018 due to attacks and suspension of family visiting rights. Another prisoner of conscience, Dr. Ariel Ruiz Urquiola, was sentenced to a year in prison for disrespecting authority in May 2018. In May 2018, Dr. Ariel Ruiz Urquiola was sentenced to a year in prison for disrespecting authority by referring to Cuban government forest rangers as \"rural guards.\" Amnesty International called for his release, and he was conditionally released in July 2018 after a hunger strike. In October 2018, UNPACU activist Tom\u00e1s N\u00fa\u00f1ez Magdariaga was released from prison after a 62-day hunger strike following a sham trial where he was falsely charged with making threats to a security agent. Amnesty International expressed concern for the health of a Cuban political prisoner and called for public evidence against him. The Cuban government has released numerous political prisoners over the past decade, including some prominent cases like the \"group of 75\" in 2010 and 2011. In 2017, several prisoners of conscience were released, including graffiti artist Danilo Maldonado Machado. Short-term detentions for political reasons in Cuba increased significantly from 2010 to 2016, reaching a peak of 9,940 detentions in 2016. However, since 2017, there has been a notable decline in short-term detentions, with only 2,873 reported in 2018, marking a 45% decrease from the previous year. In 2018, there were 2,873 reported short-term detentions in Cuba, a 45% decline from 2017 and the lowest level since 2010. Cuban bloggers like Yoani S\u00e1nchez have gained international attention for their critical commentary on the government. The Catholic Church has been active in social and economic issues, providing services like soup kitchens, job training, and college coursework. Estado de SATS, founded by Antonio Rodiles in 2010, aims to promote open debate on cultural, social, and political issues in Cuba. The group has faced government harassment, similar to its founder. Other notable online forums and independent media outlets in Cuba include Cuba Posible, Periodismo del Barrio, El Toque, and OnCuba. Cuba was placed on the Tier 2 Watch List in the 2018 Trafficking in Persons Report, marking the fourth consecutive year on the list. Cuba was placed on the Tier 2 Watch List in the 2018 Trafficking in Persons Report, after previously having Tier 3 status. Tier 2 Watch List status indicates that the government is making significant efforts but still has some specific problems. Cuba received a waiver in 2017 to remain on the Tier 2 Watch List due to its commitment to take additional antitrafficking steps. In 2017, Cuba received a waiver to stay on the Tier 2 Watch List for the fourth year in a row, despite the limit of two years for waivers. The State Department upgraded Cuba from Tier 3 to Tier 2 in 2015 due to progress in addressing sex trafficking. Cuba remained on the Tier 2 Watch List in 2016 for efforts in prosecuting sex trafficking and providing services to victims. The 2017 TIP report maintained that Cuba remained on the Tier 2 Watch List for the second consecutive year due to lack of improvement in antitrafficking efforts. Despite efforts to address sex trafficking, including prosecution and victim services, the Cuban government did not prohibit forced labor or recognize it as an issue in medical missions abroad. Multiple government ministries were engaged in antitrafficking efforts, and the government funded child protection and guidance centers for crime victims. In its 2017 and 2018 TIP reports, the State Department acknowledged Cuba's efforts in prosecuting sex traffickers and providing services to victims. However, it noted that the Cuban penal code did not criminalize all forms of trafficking, did not prohibit forced labor, and did not recognize forced labor in medical missions abroad. The Cuban government made significant efforts in prosecuting traffickers, creating a directorate for child victims of crime, and publishing an antitrafficking plan for 2017-2020. The State Department acknowledged Cuba's efforts in prosecuting sex traffickers and providing services to victims. However, it noted that the Cuban government did not criminalize most forms of forced labor or sex trafficking for children ages 16 or 17, and did not provide specialized services to identified victims. Recommendations were made for Cuba to enact a comprehensive antitrafficking law and increase efforts to combat trafficking. Engagement between U.S. and Cuban officials on antitrafficking issues has increased in recent years. The United States and Cuba signed a memorandum of understanding on law enforcement cooperation to address human trafficking. Efforts to combat trafficking in persons were discussed in meetings between State Department, Department of Homeland Security, and Cuban officials. Cuba's economy is largely state-controlled, with key sectors including export of professional services, tourism, and nickel mining. In 2018, Cuba had 4.75 million tourists visit, a joint nickel mining project with Canada's Sherritt International, a thriving biotechnology and pharmaceutical sector, and $3 billion in remittances from the US. The sugar industry has declined significantly, with the 2017-2018 harvest dropping by almost 44%. Cuba's 2018-2019 sugar harvest is expected to improve by almost 50%. Cuba has depended heavily on Venezuela for over 15 years. Cuba produced 8.4 million MT of sugar and has relied on Venezuela for oil for over 15 years. A preferential oil agreement provided Cuba with 90,000-100,000 barrels per day, but setbacks in offshore drilling and Venezuela's economic troubles have led Cuba to seek oil from other suppliers like Russia and Algeria. In June through August, Venezuela resumed exporting a key crude oil to Cuba that had been suspended in 2017. The government of Ra\u00fal Castro made some economic policy changes, but more far-reaching reforms were desired by economists. Cuba's economists urge the government to embrace competition, criticize reliance on central planning, and the monopoly on foreign trade. Cuba experienced severe economic contraction from 1990 to 1993 after the collapse of the Soviet Union. Cuba's economy saw significant growth after the collapse of the Soviet Union, with GDP increasing by 35% to 50%. The economy benefited from market-oriented reforms, strong growth in the tourism, nickel, and oil sectors, as well as support from Venezuela and China. However, the economy faced challenges in 2008 due to hurricanes and the global financial crisis in 2009, leading to austerity measures. From 2010 to 2015, Cuba experienced low to moderate economic growth, ranging from 1% to 4.4%. In 2016, the economy grew by just 0.5% due to lower export earnings and reduced support from Venezuela. In 2017, Hurricane Irma caused damage to infrastructure, agriculture, and tourism in Cuba. Despite this, the economy grew by 1.8% in 2017 and an estimated 1.2% in 2018. Austerity measures initiated in 2016 will continue in 2019, with a predicted growth of 1.5%. Reduced support from Venezuela and the end of Cuba's medical program in Brazil have impacted the economy. The Cuban economy is facing challenges with the end of the medical program in Brazil and reduced support from Venezuela. The Economist Intelligence Unit predicts slow economic growth in 2019 and 2020, with a focus on the private sector's development to aid in economic performance. The government has allowed more private-sector activities, with a significant increase in self-employed individuals. The Cuban government initially supported the development of the private sector by expanding authorized activities and providing credit to small businesses. However, starting in mid-2017, the government began restricting private-sector growth by halting new licenses for various occupations and imposing regulations to increase state control over businesses. These actions were taken to improve the functioning of the private sector and combat illicit activities. The Cuban government imposed regulations in July 2018 to increase state control over the private sector, limit business licenses, and control wealth concentration. President D\u00edaz-Canel reversed some aspects of the regulations just before they were to take effect in December 2018. In December 2018, President D\u00edaz-Canel reversed some regulations to ease restrictions on the private sector in Cuba. Changes included allowing individuals to engage in multiple licensed activities, removing seat limits for restaurants and bars, and reducing bank account balance requirements. This move was seen as a response to public opinion and a signal that the government supports the growth of the private sector. The lack of money in circulation remains a challenge for small businesses in Cuba due to the existence of two official currencies. Cuba has two official currencies, Cuban pesos (CUPs) and Cuban convertible pesos (CUCs), with an exchange rate of CUP24/CUC1 for personal transactions. The average monthly wage in Cuba is 700 CUPs ($29), which is insufficient for a reasonable standard of living. The government announced plans to end the dual-currency system in 2013 but has not fully implemented the change yet. Currency reform in Cuba has been delayed for years, with plans to move towards monetary unification. The reform is expected to improve productivity and the business climate, but winners and losers will emerge. Ra\u00fal Castro urged for a single currency at the PCC's April 2016 Congress. EU officials offered assistance in January 2018. However, economists believe reform may be postponed due to deep economic issues and ongoing constitutional changes. The agricultural sector, a focus under Ra\u00fal Castro, is crucial as Cuba imports 70%-80% of its food. The Cuban government has made efforts to boost food production by giving farmers more control over their land and supplies. However, overall food production has been below targets, with a 10-15% decrease in the first six months of 2018 compared to 2017. A new foreign investment law was adopted in 2014 to attract more foreign capital, offering tax cuts and exemptions to companies. The Cuban government adopted a new foreign investment law in 2014 to attract foreign capital, offering tax cuts and exemptions to companies. The law also eliminates employment or labor taxes, streamlines approval processes for small projects, and improves transparency for larger investments. The Mariel Special Development Zone (ZED Mariel) near the port of Mariel has approved 43 investment projects, with Rimco becoming the first U.S. company to be located there in 2017. In September 2018, Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center of Buffalo, NY, announced a joint venture with Cuba's Center for Molecular Immunology in ZED Mariel for cancer therapy development. Cuba has signed over 200 investment projects worth $5.5 billion since changing its investment law in 2014, with $1.5 billion in 2018. The Cuban government updated its wish list for foreign investment in November 2018, with 525 projects totaling $11.6 billion in high-priority areas like tourism, agriculture, oil, industry, and biotechnology. After the Cold War and the loss of Soviet support, Cuba had to abandon its revolutionary activities abroad. To cope with the economic impact, Cuba diversified its trading partners, with Venezuela becoming a key ally for oil imports. In 2017, Venezuela accounted for 18.1% of Cuba's imports, down from 40% in 2014. Cuba's leading import sources by value were Venezuela (18.1%), China (16.3%), and Spain (10.8%). The top destinations for Cuban exports were Canada (19.4%), Venezuela (15.6%), China (5.2%), and Spain (8.6%). Relations with Russia have strengthened in recent years, with Cuban President D\u00edaz-Canel visiting Russia in 2018. Russia's interest in Latin America and the Caribbean has increased in response to U.S. actions in Georgia and Ukraine. Russia aims to demonstrate its global power in the region. In 2014, Russian President Putin wrote off 90% of Cuba's $32 billion debt, with $3.5 billion to be repaid over 10 years for Russian investment projects. Reports suggested Russia would reopen a signals intelligence facility in Cuba, but Putin denied it. Trade between Russia and Cuba increased in 2017, reaching $290 million, less than 2% of Cuba's total trade. In 2017, Russia's imports from Cuba totaled nearly $14 million, with pharmaceutical products and rum leading the way. Meanwhile, Russia's exports to Cuba reached almost $277 million, with motor vehicles and oil being the main exports. Russian energy companies have been involved in oil exploration in Cuba, with Gazprom and Zarubezhneft being key players in various drilling projects. In 2017, Rosneft started shipping oil to Cuba to help diversify its foreign oil sources due to Venezuela's reduced capacity. Russian officials supported improved U.S.-Cuban relations under the Obama Administration, despite concerns about Russian influence in the region. In December 2016, a bilateral cooperation agreement was signed for Russia to assist Cuba in modernizing its defense sector until 2020. In October 2016, a Russian military official mentioned reconsidering a military presence in Cuba, but Cuba's stance on this is unclear. In June 2017, President Trump announced a partial rollback of U.S. engagement with Cuba, leading to criticism from Russia. Russia has been increasing ties with Cuba through high-level meetings and economic, military, and cultural engagement. A deepening of relations with Russia could benefit Cuba economically and serve as a counterbalance to the U.S. policy change. President D\u00edaz-Canel's trip to Russia in November 2018 did not yield significant results. Cuba received a $50 million credit line for Russian military purchases and contracts worth over $260 million to modernize power plants, a metal processing plant, and upgrade the railway system. The U.S. Southern Command expressed concern about Russia's increased presence in Cuba, Nicaragua, and Venezuela, citing expanded port access for maritime intelligence collection and force projection in the Western Hemisphere. The Defense Intelligence Agency is required to submit a report on security cooperation between Russia and Cuba, Nicaragua, and Venezuela, including military and intelligence infrastructure developed by Russia in these countries. Cuba has strengthened its relations with China over the past 15 years, leading to increased trade between the two countries. Cuba's relations with China have grown closer over the past 15 years, with notable visits by Chinese leaders and economic cooperation agreements signed. Ra\u00fal Castro and Chinese leaders have exchanged visits, focusing on trade and investment issues. In January 2018, Castro met with a special envoy of President Xi Jinping to strengthen ties. Cuban President D\u00edaz-Canel also visited China in early November 2018. Cuban President D\u00edaz-Canel visited China in early November 2018. President Xi called for a long-term plan to promote China-Cuba ties and welcomed Cuba's participation in the Belt and Road Initiative. Both countries were urged to enhance cooperation in trade, energy, agriculture, tourism, and biopharmaceutical manufacturing. Total Cuba-China trade in 2017 was valued at almost $2 billion, with a 21% drop from 2016. In 2017, Cuba's total trade with China was valued at almost $2 billion, a 21% drop from 2016. Cuba's imports from China decreased by almost 30% due to the country's economic challenges. In contrast, Cuba's exports to China increased by about 42%, with sugar, nickel, and fish being the main exports. China's imports from Cuba included electrical machinery, motor vehicles, and machinery. China has increased investment in Cuba in recent years, with projects including setting up Wi-Fi hotspots, assembling laptops and tablets, modernizing a port, and planned investments in pharmaceuticals, tourism, and infrastructure. The European Union and Cuba reached a cooperation agreement after several rounds of talks covering political, trade, and development issues. The European Union and Cuba reached a cooperation agreement in March 2016, signed in December 2016, and endorsed by the European Parliament in July 2017. The agreement focuses on political, trade, and development issues, emphasizing human rights dialogue. It replaces the EU's 1996 Common Position on Cuba, aiming for a transition to pluralist democracy and respect for human rights. The agreement will enter into full force after ratification by all EU member states, with provisional application starting in November 2017. The EU and Cuba cooperation agreement signed in 2016 emphasizes human rights dialogue and includes provisions on democracy and good governance. The first human rights dialogue under the agreement took place in October 2018, addressing various rights issues. EU officials offered technical assistance to Cuba on currency unification. Venezuela has been a significant supporter of Cuba for over 15 years. Since 2000, Venezuela has been a key supporter of Cuba, providing subsidized oil and investment. However, concerns have arisen due to the decline in oil imports from Venezuela, leading to austerity measures in Cuba. Approximately 40,000 Cuban professionals, mainly healthcare workers, are in Venezuela, but the future of this support is uncertain. The roughly 30,000 healthcare personnel in Venezuela include doctors and nurses, along with teachers, sports instructors, military advisers, and intelligence operatives from Cuba. The number of Cuban military and intelligence advisers in Venezuela varies from hundreds to thousands, coordinated by Cuba's military attach\u00e9. The level of Cuban personnel in Venezuela may have decreased due to the economic crisis and declining oil exports. Cuba's involvement in Latin America extends beyond Venezuela, as a member of the Bolivarian Alliance for the Americas. Cuba's economic and political decline led to missed payments to Brazil's development bank for the port of Mariel. In 2013, Cuba deployed doctors to rural Brazil in a program called Mais M\u00e9dicos, earning hard currency. Brazil's new president, Jair Bolsonaro, criticized the program and threatened to break diplomatic relations with Cuba. Cuba ended its medical program in Brazil after a dispute over payment and conditions for Cuban doctors. The program, called Mais M\u00e9dicos, was criticized by Brazil's president Bolsonaro as \"slave labor.\" Cuba has a history of sending medical personnel overseas and is active in international organizations like the United Nations. Cuba is a member of various international organizations like UNESCO, ECLAC, and the U.N. General Assembly, which annually criticizes the U.S. embargo on Cuba. ECLAC's Executive Secretary highlighted the impact of the embargo, costing Cuba over $130 billion. Cuba is a founding member of the World Trade Organization and signed a memorandum of understanding with the Development Bank of Latin America in 2016. Despite being excluded from the Organization of American States in 1962, there is a possibility of reentry in accordance with OAS principles. Cuba welcomed the OAS vote to overturn the 1962 resolution suspending its participation but stated it would not return. In 2017, Cuba denied entry to OAS Secretary-General Luis Almagro. Cuba is a member of the Rio Group and CELAC, established for regional cooperation without the US or Canada. Cuba hosted the group's second summit in 2014. In the early 1960s, U.S.-Cuban relations deteriorated sharply as Fidel Castro built a repressive communist dictatorship and aligned with the Soviet Union. Tensions included U.S. covert operations, the Bay of Pigs invasion, the 1962 missile crisis, Cuban support for insurgencies, the Mariel boatlift, and the 1994 exodus of Cubans. The 1994 exodus of more than 30,000 Cubans who were interdicted and housed at U.S. facilities in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and Panama; and the 1996 shootdown by Cuban fighter jets of two U.S. civilian planes operated by the Cuban-American group Brothers to the Rescue, resulting in the deaths of four U.S. crew members. U.S. policy towards Cuba since the early 1960s consisted of isolating the nation through economic sanctions, including a trade embargo proclaimed by President Kennedy in 1962. The Cuban Assets Control Regulations (CACR) were implemented in July 1963 to replace the Cuban Import Regulations, under the Trading with the Enemy Act (TWEA). Administered by the Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), the CACR prohibit financial and trade transactions with Cuba, requiring all exports to Cuba to be licensed. The Cuban Assets Control Regulations (CACR) require all exports to Cuba to be licensed by the Department of Commerce, Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS). Congress strengthened sanctions on Cuba with the Cuban Democracy Act of 1992, the Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act of 1996, and the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000. The Cuban Democracy Act prohibits U.S. foreign subsidiaries from trading with Cuba and restricts entry into the U.S. for vessels involved in Cuban trade within the previous 180 days. The LIBERTAD Act, enacted in 1996 after Cuba shot down two U.S. planes, increased pressure on Cuba and made the embargo permanent law. The President cannot lift the embargo without congressional approval until certain democratic conditions are met. The LIBERTAD Act of 1996 made the embargo on Cuba permanent law, with provisions such as holding those trafficking in U.S. property confiscated by the Cuban government liable for monetary damages in U.S. federal court. The implementation of Title III has been suspended by all Administrations, including the Trump Administration, at six-month intervals. National Security Adviser John Bolton stated in November 2018 that the Administration was considering whether to continue suspending Title III or allow lawsuits to proceed. The act allows U.S. commercial agricultural exports to Cuba but includes restrictions on U.S. assistance and private financing. The U.S. embargo on Cuba, established by the LIBERTAD Act of 1996, requires advance payment or third-country financing for exports and prohibits tourist travel to Cuba. Congress has imposed various sanctions on Cuba over the years, including trade restrictions and designating Cuba as a state sponsor of terrorism. U.S. policy also includes support for the Cuban people through humanitarian donations, medical exports, democracy-building efforts, and broadcasting. The enactment of the TSRA by the 106th Congress further impacted relations with Cuba. The TSRA enacted by the 106th Congress led to the US becoming a major supplier of agricultural products to Cuba. Despite strained relations, bilateral cooperation occurred in areas like migrant interdiction, counternarcotics, and oil spill prevention. The Obama Administration maintained a dual-track policy approach towards Cuba. The Obama Administration maintained a dual-track policy approach towards Cuba, which included economic sanctions and support for the Cuban people. In 2009, President Obama lifted restrictions on family travel and remittances, seeking a new beginning with Cuba. The Obama Administration aimed to engage with the Cuban government on various issues, including drugs, migration, and human rights. Efforts to improve relations were hindered by the imprisonment of Alan Gross in 2009. Despite this, President Obama announced significant developments in U.S.-Cuban relations in 2014. On December 17, 2014, President Obama announced a new policy approach towards Cuba, including the release of Alan Gross and a shift towards engagement with Cuba, moving away from a sanctions-based policy. President Obama announced steps towards normalization with Cuba, including a review of Cuba's designation as a state sponsor of terrorism, reestablishment of diplomatic relations, and increased travel and commerce. Following a review by the State Department, Cuba's designation as a state sponsor of terrorism was rescinded in May 2015. This paved the way for the normalization of diplomatic relations between the U.S. and Cuba, with amendments made to U.S. regulations to reflect this change. In July 2015, the U.S. amended the Export Administration Regulations. Diplomatic relations between the U.S. and Cuba were reestablished in July 2015, leading to the reopening of embassies in Havana and Washington. Government engagement increased significantly, with officials holding Bilateral Commission meetings to advance the normalization process. Numerous bilateral agreements were negotiated. Efforts to advance normalization process led to negotiation of numerous bilateral agreements in various areas such as marine protected areas, environmental cooperation, civil aviation, agriculture, health cooperation, counternarcotics, cancer research, seismology, wildlife conservation, law enforcement, and search and rescue between the United States and Cuba. Additionally, a bilateral treaty was signed in January 2017 delimiting their maritime boundary in the eastern Gulf. In January 2017, the United States and Cuba signed a bilateral treaty delimiting their maritime boundary in the eastern Gulf of Mexico. President Obama visited Cuba in March 2016 to build on progress towards normalizing relations and express support for human rights, including the right of the Cuban people to decide their own future. He emphasized the importance of democracy and freedom of speech. President Obama emphasized the importance of democracy, freedom of speech, and human rights in his speech to the Cuban nation. In October 2016, he issued a directive outlining the Administration's vision for normalization of relations with Cuba, including objectives such as government interaction, expanded commerce, and respect for universal human rights. The directive also detailed the roles of various U.S. departments and agencies in moving the normalization process forward. The Obama Administration issued a directive in October 2016 to lift the embargo and normalize economic relations with Cuba. This directive aimed to continue progress towards normalization and protect changes made in U.S. policy towards Cuba. President Trump later issued a new policy in June 2017. The Treasury and Commerce Departments made amendments to regulations to increase travel, commerce, and information flow to and from Cuba. The Treasury and Commerce Department amended regulations in 2015 and 2016 to ease restrictions on travel, trade, telecommunications, and financial services with Cuba. Certain U.S. entities were authorized to have a physical presence in Cuba. These changes were made under the President's discretionary licensing authority. President Obama acknowledged he lacked authority to lift the embargo due to permanent laws like the LIBERTAD Act. Trump promised to reverse Obama's Cuba policy unless political and religious freedoms improved. Trump called Fidel Castro a \"brutal dictator\" after his death in 2016. Trump referred to Castro as a \"brutal dictator\" and threatened to terminate the deal with Cuba if it doesn't benefit the people. The Trump Administration conducted a review of U.S. policy towards Cuba, emphasizing human rights. President Trump also celebrated the anniversary of Cuban independence with a statement to the Cuban American community. President Trump criticized the Cuban government and emphasized the importance of democratic values, economic liberties, religious freedoms, and human rights. His statement was met with controversy in Cuba, with state television describing it as \"ridiculous.\" Trump's policy on Cuba, unveiled in 2017, rolled back some of the Obama Administration's efforts to normalize relations with the country. President Trump replaced Obama's Cuba policy with restrictions on financial transactions, while keeping most of the previous policy changes intact, including diplomatic relations and eased sanctions. The new policy also maintains the end of the wet foot/dry foot policy for Cuban migrants. President Trump's NSPM included restrictions on financial transactions with Cuban military-controlled companies and eliminated individual people-to-people travel. The Treasury and Commerce Departments issued amended regulations to implement the new policy, with complementary actions taken by the State Department in November 2017 and 2018. National Security Adviser John Bolton criticized the Cuban government on human rights in a speech in Miami on November 1, 2018. In a speech in Miami, John Bolton criticized Cuba, Venezuela, and Nicaragua as a \"troika of tyranny\" and the \"cause of immense human suffering.\" He referred to their leaders as \"three stooges of socialism\" and hinted at increasing sanctions on Cuba. Since the enactment of the LIBERTAD Act in 1996, all Administrations have suspended the right to file lawsuits every six months. Restrictions on transactions with the Cuban military were implemented, targeting entities controlled by the Cuban military, intelligence, or security services. The Grupo de Administraci\u00f3n Empresarial S.A. (GAESA), a holding company of the Cuban military involved in various sectors, was specifically identified. The State Department issued a list of \"restricted entities\" in November 2017 and updated it in November 2018. The Treasury Department has a list of 205 entities in Cuba, including ministries, holding companies, hotels, tourist agencies, marinas, stores, and entities in defense and security sectors. Financial transactions with these entities are forbidden, with some exceptions. The new prohibitions limit U.S. economic engagement with Cuba, especially in travel and potential investment opportunities. People-to-people travel restrictions have also been imposed. The Treasury Department amended the CACR to require people-to-people educational travel in Cuba to be organized by specialized organizations, with travelers accompanied by a representative. Individual travel is no longer authorized, leading to a decrease in U.S. travel to Cuba. The Cuban government criticized President Trump's policy changes in June 2017. The Cuban government criticized President Trump's policy changes in June 2017, calling it a grotesque spectacle from the Cold War. Despite this, they expressed willingness to continue respectful dialogue with the U.S. on mutual interests, without compromising sovereignty. President Ra\u00fal Castro also criticized the new policy as a setback to bilateral relations but reiterated Cuba's willingness to negotiate outstanding issues with the U.S. and promote cooperation. President Trump canceled the previous administration's Cuba policy, calling it a misguided deal with the Castro regime. He criticized the outcome as leading to more repression and a crackdown on the peaceful democratic movement. Despite poor human rights conditions, President Obama continued to advocate for human rights in Cuba. In June 2017, President Trump called for Cuba to end abuse of dissidents, release political prisoners, and stop jailing innocent people. He stated that changes in the US-Cuba relationship depend on progress in these areas. The Trump Administration also cited human rights concerns in its vote against the UNGA resolution condemning the US embargo in November 2017. In October 2016, the United States abstained for the first time on a resolution regarding Cuba's poor human rights record. Trump Administration officials, including Vice President Mike Pence and National Security Adviser John Bolton, continued to speak out on Cuba's human rights situation in 2018. Pence criticized the Cuban government as the \"longest-surviving dictatorship in the Western Hemisphere\" and expressed support for the Cuban people's fight for freedom. Adviser John Bolton criticized Cuba's human rights record in a speech in Miami in November 2018. The State Department has consistently called for democratic reforms, the release of political prisoners, and an end to arbitrary detention in Cuba. In June 2018, the U.S. reiterated its call for the release of all political prisoners, including Dr. Eduardo Cardet and Dr. Ariel Ruiz Urquiola. In October 2018, the State Department called for the release of UNPACU activist Tom\u00e1s N\u00fa\u00f1ez Magdariaga, who had been on a hunger strike since August; the Cuban government subsequently released him on October 15, 2018. The U.S. Mission to the United Nations launched a campaign to call attention to Cuba's \"estimated 130 political prisoners.\" Secretary of State Mike Pompeo criticized Cuban diplomats for disrupting the event. Pompeo later wrote an open letter to Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez in December 2018 asking for evidence against political prisoners. In January 2018, the State Department announced the establishment of a Cuba Internet Task Force. The Cuba Internet Task Force, composed of U.S. and non-U.S. government representatives, was established to address technological challenges and opportunities for expanding internet access and independent media in Cuba. The task force, formed in response to President Trump's NSPM on Cuba, has two subcommittees focusing on media freedom and internet access. Cuban state media criticized the task force, claiming it aimed to disrupt Cuba's internal order. The State Department will review the subcommittees' recommendations and prepare a final report within a year. Cuba's foreign ministry protested the task force's establishment, calling for respect of Cuba's sovereignty. The U.S. government and Cuba have maintained bilateral engagement through meetings and dialogues, including semiannual migration talks and Bilateral Commission meetings. The most recent talks were held in July 2018, focusing on areas for engagement. Cuba's sovereignty was emphasized during these discussions. During the June 2018 meeting between the U.S. State Department and Cuba's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, areas for engagement were reviewed, including trafficking in persons, civil aviation safety, law enforcement, agriculture, maritime safety, and search and rescue. The U.S. reiterated the need to identify and stop \"attacks\" on diplomats, expressed concerns about the detention of journalists and human rights defenders, and urged Cuba to accept more returnees. Cuba criticized U.S. policies such as the embargo and political manipulation. The U.S. and Cuba engaged in professional exchanges on various topics, including search and rescue, law enforcement dialogues on fugitives and the return of Cuban nationals, and meetings on cybersecurity, counternarcotics, and counterterrorism in 2018. The U.S. Coast Guard and Cuban Border Guard also participated in exchanges. In 2018, Cuba cooperated with the U.S. on various issues including anti-money laundering, trafficking in persons, search and rescue, and agriculture. Cuba has returned wanted fugitives to the U.S. on a case-by-case basis for over a decade. In February 2018, Cuba prosecuted a Cuban national for the murder of a Florida doctor with U.S. law enforcement assistance. In September 2017, nonemergency personnel and their families were ordered to leave the U.S. Embassy in Havana due to unexplained injuries suffered by embassy personnel since November 2016. Since November 2016, a series of unexplained injuries at the U.S. Embassy in Havana led to a reduction in staffing levels. U.S. government personnel experienced health effects from unknown attacks, with symptoms including ear complaints, hearing loss, and cognitive issues. The cause, source, and motive behind these incidents remain unknown, with 26 Americans affected by the incidents. In May 2018, 26 cases of unexplained injuries at the U.S. Embassy in Havana were confirmed. In October 2017, the State Department ordered the departure of Cuban diplomats due to Cuba's failure to protect U.S. diplomats. The U.S. Embassy in Havana began operating as an \"unaccompanied post\" in March 2018. The U.S. Embassy in Havana is operating as an \"unaccompanied post\" due to a staffing plan change. Speculation surrounds the cause of injuries to U.S. personnel, with some pointing to Cuba's security services or a third country like Russia. Some speculate on the cause of injuries to U.S. personnel in Havana, with doubts about the involvement of a third country or a rogue Cuban security faction. Questions remain about the symptoms and the use of a sonic device, with experts casting doubt on the feasibility of ultrasound causing harm. Some scientists question the potential effects of an ultrasound weapon on human health, citing limited data. A study in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) found brain injuries in U.S. Embassy personnel in Havana without a clear cause. Experts caution against drawing conclusions from the study. Some experts cautioned against drawing conclusions from a study on brain injuries in U.S. Embassy personnel in Havana, conducted an average of 203 days after symptoms onset. Questions were raised about the study's findings, including the possibility of mass psychogenic illness. Another report suggested that the recorded sounds in Cuba could have been caused by eavesdropping devices placed close together, potentially without malicious intent. In December 2018, doctors from the University of Miami and the University of Pittsburgh published a study suggesting that diplomats with symptoms suffered from ear damage, not brain injury. In January 2019, biologists from the University of California Berkeley and the University of Lincoln studied sounds heard by U.S. Embassy employees, concluding it matched a Caribbean cricket call. In April 2018, the Canadian government changed its embassy designation in Havana due to similar symptoms reported by 13 Canadians. Canadian medical specialists raised concerns about a possible new type of acquired brain injury in November 2018, with symptoms including headaches, dizziness, nausea, and difficulty concentrating. The State Department convened an Accountability Review Board in January 2018 to examine unexplained injuries in Cuba, finding that security procedures were adequate. The cause of the incidents remains unknown, and the Canadian government maintains that there is no evidence of risk to Canadian travelers in Cuba. The Accountability Review Board found that security systems were adequate but there were staffing vacancies and communication challenges. They issued 30 recommendations to the State Department, which were all accepted. In May 2018, a U.S. government employee in China experienced a health incident similar to those in Havana, leading to the establishment of a Health Incidents Response Task Force by Secretary of State Michael Pompeo. The Health Incidents Response Task Force was established to coordinate State Department and interagency activities related to identifying and treating affected personnel and family members abroad, investigating and mitigating risks, messaging, and diplomatic outreach. The United States and Cuba are both party to the Vienna Conventions, which outline obligations to protect diplomats. The Cuban government denies responsibility for the injuries of U.S. personnel, stating it would never allow its territory to be used against diplomats. Cuba protested the U.S. action, claiming it was politically motivated and ongoing investigations have not reached conclusions on the incidents or health problems. Cuba allowed U.S. investigators to visit and reiterated its cooperation. Cuba permitted U.S. investigators to visit and expressed willingness to cooperate. Cuban Foreign Minister Rodr\u00edguez urged the U.S. to stop politicizing the issue, stating it could harm bilateral relations. Cuba maintains there is no evidence of the alleged incidents affecting U.S. diplomats. In 2018, Cuban scientists visited the U.S. and met with various officials. Dr. Vald\u00e9s-Sosa suggested possible reasons for diplomats' illnesses but denied high-tech weapon use. The Cuban delegation criticized the lack of medical data sharing by U.S. officials. Dr. Vald\u00e9s-Sosa coauthored a letter questioning speculation on the health issues' causes. The State Department issued a travel warning in September 2017 for U.S. citizens in Cuba due to health issues affecting diplomats. The warning advised against travel to Cuba and recommended avoiding certain hotels. In January 2018, the State Department revamped its travel advisory system, setting Cuba's advisory at Level 3, suggesting travelers reconsider their plans. The State Department eased its travel advisory for Cuba to Level 2, advising increased caution and avoiding specific hotels where injuries occurred. The U.S. Embassy in Havana has reduced staff, impacting visa processing and bilateral relations. The suspension of visa processing in Havana has made it difficult and costly for Cubans to visit the United States for family visits or business purposes. Musicians, dancers, and artists are also affected as they may need to travel to a third country to apply for a visa to perform in the U.S. Multiple entry visas granted in 2013 are expiring, requiring Cubans to travel elsewhere for visa applications. The United States has struggled to meet its commitment of issuing 20,000 travel documents annually to Cubans due to staff reductions at the U.S. Embassy in Havana. In FY2018, only 4,060 travel documents were issued, causing Cubans to travel to a third country for visa applications. The State Department and DHS are working on alternative processing arrangements. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is making arrangements to continue processing applications under the Cuban Family Reunification Parole Program (CFRP) despite the closure of USCIS offices in Havana. The CFRP was established in 2007 to meet U.S. obligations under the U.S.-Cuba migration accord. Around 75% of immigrant travel documents issued for Cuban nationals annually were under the CFRP. State Department officials have indicated collaboration with DHS to ensure the program's operation, but no plans have been announced. The closure of USCIS offices in Havana has made it difficult for the United States to reach the annual 20,000 target level for Cuban refugee admissions. The U.S. Embassy in Havana has also reduced staff, leading to the closure of the Refugee Section and halting new applications and refugee case processing. In FY2017, 177 Cubans were admitted as refugees, but in FY2018, no Cubans were admitted. The embassy staff reduction has also impacted coverage of economic and political developments in Cuba. The reduction of staff at the U.S. Embassy in Havana has made it challenging to cover economic and political developments in Cuba, including outreach to civil society and human rights activists. The Political Section now only has one U.S. official covering these issues, impacting the embassy's ability to reach its annual target for Cuban refugee admissions. Despite overall agreement on the objectives of U.S. policy toward Cuba, there are differing opinions on how to achieve democracy and respect for human rights on the island. Some advocate for maintaining pressure on the Cuban government while supporting the Cuban people, while others support a more engaging approach with Cuba. Efforts in Congress dating back to 2000 have aimed to ease U.S. sanctions on Cuba, with some success in 2009 when restrictions on travel to Cuba were eased. There are differing opinions on U.S. policy towards Cuba, with some advocating for maintaining pressure on the Cuban government while others support a more engaging approach. The Obama Administration's shift in U.S. policy towards Cuba in 2014 from isolation to engagement sparked divisions in Congress. Some members supported the change as beneficial for the U.S. and a way to support change in Cuba, while others criticized the President for not securing concessions from Cuba. Some Members in Congress support normalizing relations with Cuba, while others oppose it. The Trump Administration's policy changes highlight divisions over Cuba policy, with some supporting the President's actions due to Cuba's human rights record, and others opposing it for potential negative effects on the Cuban people and U.S. business interests. Public opinion polls show majority of Americans support normalization, but Cuban American community in South Florida has mixed views. In a 2018 poll by Florida International University, 51% of Cuban Americans in South Florida favored continuing the U.S. embargo on Cuba, contrasting with 63% in 2016 who favored ending it. Advocates for easing sanctions argue that increased travel, trade, and dialogue could lead to peaceful change in Cuba and prevent a mass exodus to the United States. Advocates for easing sanctions argue for a pragmatic approach to bring about change in Cuba, citing international support for lifting the embargo, missed business opportunities, and increased suffering of the Cuban people. They emphasize consistency in policies towards communist governments like China and Vietnam. On the other hand, opponents believe isolating Cuba while supporting its people is the best strategy for political change. Advocates for easing sanctions argue that the LIBERTAD Act outlines steps for Cuba to normalize relations with the U.S., and softening policies without Cuban reforms strengthens the communist regime. Critics of loosening sanctions believe in maintaining a commitment to democracy and human rights in Cuba, with sustained sanctions as a viable strategy. Congress has been actively involved in U.S. policy towards Cuba, including economic sanctions and oversight on various issues. Restrictions on travel to Cuba have been a contentious issue for over 50 years, with changes occurring over time. Enforcement falls under the CACR, administered by the Department of the Treasury's OFAC. The George W. Bush Administration played a role in enforcing U.S. policies towards Cuba. Under the Obama Administration, restrictions on Cuba travel were eased, including allowing family travel and travel related to U.S. agricultural and medical sales. Additional changes in 2011 increased purposeful travel for religious, educational, and journalistic activities, and allowed U.S. international airports to service licensed charter flights to and from Cuba. Under the Obama Administration, restrictions on Cuba travel were eased, including allowing family travel and travel related to U.S. agricultural and medical sales. In 2015, OFAC amended the CACR to include general licenses for 12 categories of travel to Cuba, such as family visits, official business, journalistic activity, educational activities, and religious activities. Under the Obama Administration, restrictions on Cuba travel were eased, including allowing family travel and travel related to U.S. agricultural and medical sales. In 2015, OFAC amended the CACR to include general licenses for 12 categories of travel to Cuba, such as family visits, official business, journalistic activity, educational activities, and religious activities. The new regulations now allow travel agents and airlines to provide services for travel to Cuba without the need for a specific license. Authorized travelers no longer have a per diem limit for expenditures and can bring back goods from Cuba for personal use. In January 2016, the Department of the Treasury made changes to travel regulations for Cuba, allowing for professional media or artistic productions, professional meetings, public performances, clinics, workshops, athletic and nonathletic competitions, and exhibitions. Travel to Cuba solely for tourist activities remains prohibited under Section 910(b) of TSRA. The Department of the Treasury amended travel regulations in March 2016 to allow individual people-to-people educational travel to Cuba. However, President Trump directed the Department of the Treasury in June 2017 to eliminate this authorization for individuals. As of November 9, 2017, people-to-people educational travel must be organized by a specialized organization, with travelers accompanied by a representative. The number of U.S. travelers to Cuba increased from 91,254 in 2014 to 619,523 in 2017, in addition to Cuban Americans visiting family in Cuba. In 2017, almost 454,000 Cubans living outside the country visited Cuba, with the majority from the United States. The number of U.S. visitors slowed due to Hurricane Irma, tighter restrictions on travel, and health warnings. In the first half of 2018, U.S. visitors declined by 24%, but by the end of the year, travel to Cuba had recovered with a 1% growth, driven by a 48% increase in cruise ship arrivals. The recovery in travel to Cuba in 2018 was driven by a 48% increase in cruise ship arrivals and a change in the U.S. travel advisory from Level 3 to Level 2. Regular air service between the U.S. and Cuba was established in February 2016, allowing up to 110 daily round-trip flights. In June 2016, the Department of Transportation authorized six U.S. airlines to operate up to 90 daily flights between five U.S. cities and nine Cuban cities. JetBlue was the first to start regular flights in August 2016. In November 2016, American Airlines began direct flights to Havana from Miami. In November 2016, the first airline to start regular direct flights to Havana from Miami was American Airlines. Four other U.S. airlines that had flights to Cuba have ended their service due to competition and low demand. In March 2018, the Department of Transportation awarded flights to Havana to five U.S. airlines already serving Cuba. FedEx, a U.S. air cargo company, canceled its plans to begin operations to Cuba in December 2018. In May 2016, a hearing was held on potential security risks from the resumption of flights from Cuba. In September 2016, an aviation-security agreement was finalized between the United States and Cuba for the deployment of U.S. In-Flight Security Officers on certain flights to and from Cuba. This came after concerns were raised in a hearing about Cuba's airport security practices and the rush to establish regular air service to Cuba. Officials from the Department of Homeland Security testified about their efforts to ensure the security of increased air travelers from Cuba. The Carnival cruise ship company began direct cruises to Cuba from the United States in May 2016 using smaller ships, accommodating about 700 passengers, under its cruise brand Fathom. Fathom cruises stopped in May 2017, but Carnival began using a larger ship for cruises to Cuba in June 2017. Other cruise ship companies like Royal Caribbean, Norwegian, and Holland America Line also started offering cruises to Cuba from the United States. Ferry services between the United States and Cuba have been considered since 2015, but Cuban approval and facilities are still needed. Pro/Con Arguments for lifting the Cuba travel ban include abridging rights of Americans, influencing conditions in Cuba, and aiding the Cuban government. Supporters argue Americans can travel to other authoritarian countries. Arguments against lifting the ban include supporting the Cuban government financially, existing provisions for humanitarian travel, and the President's authority to restrict travel for foreign policy reasons. In the 115th Congress, six bills were introduced to lift remaining travel restrictions. In the 115th Congress, six bills were introduced to lift remaining restrictions on travel to Cuba. H.R. 351, H.R. 572, H.R. 574, H.R. 2966, S. 1287, and S. 1699 aimed to lift travel restrictions and the economic embargo on Cuba. Additionally, H.R. 3328, the Cuban Airport Security Act of 2017, required a congressional briefing on security measures at Cuban airports and prohibited U.S. air carriers from employing Cuban nationals in Cuba. The bill aimed to restrict U.S. air carriers from hiring Cuban nationals recruited, hired, or trained by Cuban government entities. A similar bill was introduced in the Senate. Congress later passed the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018, which included a provision related to this issue. The FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018, known as P.L. 115-254 (H.R. 302), requires the TSA to provide Congress with briefings on security measures at Cuban airports with service to the U.S. It also mandates the TSA Administrator to track public charter flights between the two countries more effectively, following a GAO recommendation on Cuban aviation security. The Cuban Democracy Act of 1992 and the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000 have authorized U.S. commercial medical and agricultural exports to Cuba with restrictions and licensing requirements. Medical exports require on-site verification, while agricultural exports have one-year export licenses but no financial assistance. Transactions must be conducted in cash in advance. U.S. exports to Cuba have fluctuated over the years, reaching a high of $712 million in 2008 due to increased food needs after natural disasters. Despite a decline in exports from 2009 to 2015, there was a slight increase in 2016 and 2017, totaling $283 million. Transactions with Cuba must be conducted in cash in advance or with financing from third countries. U.S. exports to Cuba increased to $245 million in 2016 and $283 million in 2017, with a 15% increase in 2017. In the first three quarters of 2018, exports amounted to almost $229 million, similar to 2017. Leading products include poultry, soybean oilcake, soybeans, corn, and soybean oil. Other growing categories are parts for steam turbines, pesticides, pharmaceutical products, and civilian aircraft. President Obama's policy changes aimed to facilitate commercial transactions. Changes made to the CACR and EAR aimed to facilitate commercial exports to Cuba, allowing U.S. financial institutions to open correspondent accounts at Cuban financial institutions. Private export financing is permitted for authorized trade, except for agricultural goods under TSRA. The definition of cash in advance for U.S. exports to Cuba was revised to specify payment before transfer of title. OFAC clarified in 2005 that payment must be received before goods are shipped from a U.S. port. This regulatory change allows payment before export shipment reaches Cuba, rather than before leaving a U.S. port. Certain commercial exports to Cuba are authorized before the shipment leaves a U.S. port, including goods for private residential construction, items for private-sector Cuban entrepreneurs, and agricultural equipment for small farmers. Licenses for specific categories of exports are approved under certain conditions, such as exports for civil aviation, telecommunications, human rights organizations, environmental protection, and agricultural inputs. Licenses for exports to state-owned enterprises will be considered on a case-by-case basis. Certain commercial exports to Cuba are authorized before the shipment leaves a U.S. port, including goods for private residential construction, items for private-sector Cuban entrepreneurs, and agricultural equipment for small farmers. Licenses for specific categories of exports are approved under certain conditions. Export licenses for exports to state-owned enterprises will be considered on a case-by-case basis, including items that directly benefit the Cuban people. In November 2017, export licenses for exports to state-owned enterprises associated with the Cuban military, police, intelligence, or security services will generally be denied. However, the commercial export of certain communication devices, software, applications, hardware, and services is authorized. Additionally, exports for telecommunications, internet access, infrastructure, and upgrades are also allowed. Companies exporting authorized goods to Cuba can have a physical presence in Cuba, and U.S. persons can enter into contingent contracts for transactions. In June 2015, the USDA reported a decline in the U.S. market share in Cuba due to competitors offering better credit terms. The report suggested that lifting restrictions on travel and capital flow to Cuba would benefit market development and credit guarantee programs. The USDA reported in June 2015 a decline in the U.S. market share in Cuba due to competitors offering better credit terms. Lifting restrictions on travel and capital flow to Cuba would benefit market development and credit guarantee programs, enabling increased U.S. agricultural exports to Cuba. The USITC has issued reports examining the effects of U.S. restrictions on trade with Cuba, with the most recent report in April 2016. The USITC's 2016 report highlighted how U.S. restrictions on trade and travel have hindered American suppliers from accessing the Cuban market. Key restrictions include the inability to offer credit, travel, or invest in Cuba, limiting U.S. exports and investment opportunities. Cuban government control, legal limits on foreign investment, and politically motivated decision-making also pose challenges. Without these restrictions, U.S. exports could see short-term growth, with potential for larger increases in the long term. In the short term, U.S. exports to Cuba could increase with potential for larger growth in the long term if Cuban import barriers were lowered. Legislative activity in the 115th Congress included provisions for funding U.S. agricultural export promotion programs and bills to lift restrictions on U.S. exports to Cuba. If U.S. restrictions were removed and Cuban barriers lowered, U.S. exports could reach $2.2 billion annually. The provision in the farm bill allows funding for U.S. export promotion programs for agricultural products in Cuba, with restrictions to comply with President Trump's memorandum on transactions with certain Cuban entities. Legislation proposed to repeal trade restrictions with Cuba, including provisions in the CDA, LIBERTAD Act, and TSRA. The bills proposed to repeal restrictions on private financing for Cuba in TSRA, while still prohibiting U.S. government support for foreign assistance or financial assistance to Cuba. The federal government would be prohibited from promoting trade with Cuba, but certain federal commodity promotion programs would be allowed. H.R. 525 would allow U.S. government assistance for agricultural exports to Cuba, private financing of agricultural commodity sales, and investment in agricultural businesses in Cuba not controlled by the Cuban government. The bills aimed to facilitate private financing for agricultural exports to Cuba and promote trade by allowing direct transfers between Cuban and U.S. financial institutions. Additionally, they sought to establish an export-promotion program for U.S. agricultural exports to Cuba and repeal certain requirements for medical exports under the CDA. The bills proposed lifting the economic embargo on Cuba, including export restrictions, and repealing various trade restrictions. The US has imposed a trademark sanction related to Cuba for over 15 years, preventing payment for trademark registrations linked to confiscated assets in Cuba without the original owner's consent. The US has imposed a trademark sanction related to Cuba for over 15 years, prohibiting general licenses for transactions or payments for trademarks linked to confiscated assets without the original owner's consent. This measure stemmed from a dispute between Pernod Ricard and Bacardi Limited over the Havana Club trademark rights. Pernod Ricard registered Havana Club in 1976 and seeks to protect its distribution rights in case the US trade embargo is lifted. The EU filed a WTO dispute in 2000, arguing that US law violated TRIPS. In 2002, WTO ruled against the US, which agreed to comply by 2003 but failed to do so. In 2005, the EU and US reached an understanding not to pursue further action. In 2006, the US denied Cubaexport's renewal of the Havana Club trademark due to OFAC's refusal to grant a specific license for payment. The State Department supported this decision, citing non-recognition of trademark rights linked to confiscated property and denying resources to the Cuban government. In January 2016, OFAC finally issued a specific ruling on the matter. In January 2016, OFAC issued a specific license to Cubaexport for the renewal of the Havana Club trademark registration until 2026. The State Department considered U.S. policy shifts towards Cuba and trademark rights in evaluating the case. The renewal does not resolve the trademark dispute, with federal court proceedings pending. The State Department notes that federal court proceedings are pending in a trademark dispute between Bacardi and Cubaexport over the Havana Club trademark ownership in the United States. Legislative activity in Congress involves debates on amending or repealing Section 211 to comply with WTO rulings on trademarks confiscated by Cuba. The House Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on Courts, Intellectual Property, and the Internet held a hearing in February 2016 on the trademark issue and confiscated property in Cuba. Legislative actions in the 115th Congress included bills to address trademark sanctions on all nationals and broader bills to repeal Section 211. Two FY2018 House appropriations bills proposed new sanctions related to Cuba and trademarks but were not included in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018. Two FY2018 House appropriations bills proposed new sanctions related to Cuba and trademarks, but they were not included in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 (P.L. 115-141). These provisions aimed to prohibit funds for approving the registration or renewal of marks, trade names, or commercial names connected to assets confiscated by the Cuban government without the original owner's consent. Similar provisions were also included in the House-passed version of a FY2018 omnibus appropriations measure, H.R. 3354. In FY2019, two House Appropriations bills, H.R. 5952 and H.R. 6258 / H.R. 6147, included provisions related to Cuba and trademarks similar to those in FY2018 bills. H.R. 5952 aimed to prohibit funds from being used for approving the registration of marks confiscated in Cuba without the original owner's consent. H.R. 6258 / H.R. 6147 aimed to prevent funds from authorizing licenses for marks similar to those confiscated by the Cuban government without the original owner's consent. The 115th Congress did not finalize action on these appropriations measures. Since 1996, the United States has provided assistance to increase information on democracy, human rights, and free enterprise to Cuba through USAID, the State Department, and the National Endowment for Democracy. Congress has appropriated $344 million for these efforts from FY1996 to FY2018, with $20 million allocated annually from FY2014 to FY2018. The Trump Administration did not request democracy and human rights assistance funding for Cuba in FY2018, but Congress provided $20 million. For FY2019, the Trump Administration requested $10 million for democracy and civil society assistance for Cuba. The State Department has been allocated more funding than USAID in recent years and transfers a portion of the assistance to NED, a U.S. government-funded NGO. NED's Cuba program is funded by Congress and the State Department. USAID's Cuba program supports U.S.-based NGOs to promote democracy, civil society, and human rights in Cuba. NED's democratization assistance for Cuba is funded through the State Department, with funding totaling $15.9 million from FY2014 to FY2017. The Obama Administration requested $15 million in FY2017 for democracy and human rights programs in Cuba, supporting civil society initiatives promoting freedoms of expression and association. In the 114th Congress, the House version of the FY2017 State Department appropriations bill would have provided $30 million for democracy promotion in Cuba, doubling the Administration's request. The bill aimed to support civil society, reduce dependence on the Cuban state, and promote uncensored information flow. The Senate version recommended fully funding the Administration's request. The 115th Congress enacted the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017, providing $20 million in democracy assistance for Cuba, $5 million more than requested. The FY2018 appropriations faced opposition from some Members of Congress due to the Trump Administration's proposal to cut all aid for democracy promotion. The House Appropriations Committee's version of the FY2018 State Department and Foreign Operations appropriations bill, H.R. 3362, proposed $30 million in democracy assistance for Cuba but prohibited funds for non-democracy-building activities. The Senate Appropriations Committee's version, S. 1780, allocated $15 million for democracy programs in Cuba. In March 2018, Congress allocated $20 million for democracy programs in Cuba without specific directives from previous bills. The Trump Administration requested $10 million for democracy and civil society assistance in FY2019, while the House Appropriations Committee proposed $30 million for promoting democracy and strengthening civil society in Cuba. The report (H.Rept. 115-829) allocated $8 million for the National Endowment for Democracy, with restrictions on fund usage. The Senate's version of the bill (S. 3108) proposed $15 million for democracy programs in Cuba. The 115th Congress did not finalize FY2019 appropriations, leaving it to the 116th Congress. The GAO has conducted oversight on U.S. Democracy Assistance to Cuba since 2006. The GAO has issued reports on USAID and State Department democracy programs for Cuba since 2006. In 2013, GAO found improvements in USAID's financial monitoring but gaps in the State Department's monitoring. Both agencies are working to enhance financial oversight. In 2014, investigative reports raised concerns about U.S. democracy promotion efforts in Cuba, including the establishment of a \"Cuban Twitter\" by USAID to undermine the Cuban government. The USAID project in Cuba, known as ZunZuneo, lasted over two years until 2012. USAID defended the program, stating it was not covert but maintained a discreet profile for safety. Some Members of Congress criticized USAID for lack of transparency, while others supported the agency. In 2014, a U.S.-funded democracy program sent youth from Latin American countries to Cuba for civic programs. In 2011, USAID sent individuals to Cuba for civic programs, including an HIV-prevention workshop, with the alleged goal of recruiting young Cubans for anti-government activism. USAID defended the program, stating it aimed to support civil society programs. In 2015, a report by USAID's Office of Inspector General highlighted management control issues and recommended a screening policy to address intelligence threats. The U.S. Agency for Global Media (USAGM) oversees Radio and TV Mart\u00ed, managed by the Office of Cuba Broadcasting (OCB) in Miami, FL. The Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG) was rebranded as USAGM in August 2018, merging functions from the United States Information Agency (USIA) into the Department of State in FY2000. Radio and TV Mart\u00ed, along with the Mart\u00ednoticiaas.com website and its social media platforms, reach 11.1% of Cubans weekly through various audio, video, and digital content delivery methods. Radio Mart\u00ed and TV Mart\u00ed have the largest audiences, reaching 8% and 6.8% of Cubans respectively, while online content reaches 5.3%. The Office of Cuba Broadcasting also operates a shortwave transmitting station in Greenville, NC, with newer transmitters helping to increase Radio Mart\u00ed's presence in Cuba. Congress has appropriated about $882 million for broadcasting to Cuba from FY1984 through FY2018. In recent years, Congress has allocated around $27-$29 million annually for broadcasting to Cuba. The Trump Administration's FY2019 request is for almost $13.7 million. The Obama Administration requested $27.1 million for FY2017. There was a proposal to establish a new Spanish-language media organization funded by the BBG. The House version of the FY2017 appropriations bill had a provision to block this proposal. The FY2017 appropriations bill allocated $28.938 million for the Office of Cuba Broadcasting, $1 million more than requested. The Senate version of the bill provided $27.4 million for the OCB, $300,000 more than the Administration's request. The funding prohibition pertained to the merger of the OCB and the Voice of America Latin America Division. The 115th Congress completed final action on FY2017 appropriations in early May 2017 through enactment of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017 (P.L. 115-31). The Trump Administration requested $23.656 million for the Office of Cuba Broadcasting in FY2018, $4.4 million less than the amount allocated in FY2017. The funding reduction would be covered by various measures including a reduction in contractor support and elimination of vacant staff positions. The House Appropriations Committee's version of the FY2018 State Department and Foreign Operations appropriations bill proposed $28.1 million for broadcasting to Cuba, $4.4 million above the Administration's request. In FY2018, the Trump Administration requested $23.656 million for the Office of Cuba Broadcasting, $4.4 million less than the previous year. The House Appropriations Committee proposed $28.1 million for broadcasting to Cuba. In FY2019, the Administration requested $13.656 million for the OCB, citing efficiencies with Voice of America's Latin American division as the reason for the funding cut. The Senate Appropriations Committee's version of the FY2018 State Department and Foreign Operations appropriations bill would have provided $28.6 million for broadcasting to Cuba, while the final amount allocated was $28.936 million in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018. The House bill, H.R. 6385, proposed $29.1 million for Cuba broadcasting, while the Senate bill, S. 3108, proposed $29.2 million. The Senate bill also called for a State Department report on Internet access and telecommunications technology impact. The 115th Congress did not finalize FY2019 appropriations, leading to continuing resolutions. Radio and TV Mart\u00ed have faced controversies over broadcast standards. From 1990 through 2011, there were numerous government studies and audits of the Office of Cuba Broadcasting (OCB), including investigations by the GAO, a 1994 Advisory Panel on Radio and TV Mart\u00ed, and the State Department Office Inspector General. In 2009, the GAO reported on low audience levels for Radio and TV Mart\u00ed, as well as concerns about adherence to domestic and international standards. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee's 2010 staff report highlighted issues with broadcast standards, audience size, and Cuban government interference. Recommendations included relocating OCB to Washington, DC. The report recommended relocating OCB to Washington, DC and integrating it fully into the Voice of America. In 2018, concerns were raised about a TV Mart\u00ed program that made anti-Semitic remarks about George Soros. Senator Jeff Flake criticized the program as \"taxpayer-funded anti-Semitism.\" Senator Flake criticized a TV Mart\u00ed program for containing \"taxpayer-funded anti-Semitism\" and called for an investigation into its production and approval process. OCB Director Regalado pulled the program from the website, acknowledging its lack of balance. USAGM CEO Lansing took further action by issuing a statement about the program's content regarding George Soros. USAGM CEO Lansing took action on October 29, 2018, stating that the Soros program violated professional standards. He placed those responsible on leave for misconduct, ordered a content audit, and mandated ethics training for OCB journalists. Lansing apologized to Soros for the offensive and biased program, directing its removal from TV Mart\u00ed's platforms and hiring a standards editor. The audit of reporting at the network uncovered offensive content about Soros and anti-Muslim opinions, leading to employees being placed on leave or fired. TV Mart\u00ed's adherence to broadcast standards and intended audience are in question. The CEO took action by removing the offensive program and hiring a standards editor. The U.S. law mandates that television broadcasting to Cuba must adhere to Voice of America standards, ensuring objective, accurate, and balanced programs. VOA broadcasts must be a reliable source of news, represent America comprehensively, and present U.S. policies clearly. These principles are outlined in 22 U.S.C. 6202. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee approved an amendment to the U.S. Agency for Global Media Reform Act in response to an anti-Semitic program broadcast by TV Mart\u00ed. The amendment, offered by Senator Jeff Flake, aimed to hold USAGM accountable by requiring the CEO to report on any employee suspended for content inconsistent with the agency's mission. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee approved an amendment to the U.S. Agency for Global Media Reform Act in response to an anti-Semitic program broadcast by TV Mart\u00ed. The amendment required the CEO to report on any employee suspended for content inconsistent with the agency's mission. In its final days, the Obama Administration ended the \"wet foot/dry foot\" policy for Cuban migrants entering the U.S. illegally. The Obama Administration ended the \"wet foot/dry foot\" policy for Cuban migrants entering the U.S. illegally. Cuban nationals not qualifying for humanitarian relief are now subject to removal, and the Cuban government agreed to accept the return of Cuban migrants ordered to be removed. Additionally, the special Cuban Medical Professional Parole program allowing Cuban medical professionals in third countries to enter the U.S. has been terminated. This decision was made in response to previous migration accords between Cuba and the United States to prevent mass exodus of Cubans to the U.S. following the 1980 Mariel boatlift. In August 1994, President Clinton changed U.S. immigration policy for Cubans fleeing their homeland, directing the Coast Guard and Navy to take rescued Cubans to Guantanamo Bay. Despite the policy change, Cubans continued to flee in large numbers, leading to talks between Cuba and the U.S. resulting in a bilateral agreement on September 9, 1994, to regulate Cuban migration to the U.S. in a safe and orderly manner. In May 1995, the United States agreed to parole over 30,000 Cubans from Guantanamo into the U.S. while intercepting future Cuban migrants at sea and returning them to Cuba. Both countries pledged to cooperate in this effort and ensure no action would be taken against those returned to Cuba for attempting illegal immigration. The last of 32,000 Cubans housed at Guantanamo have left the U.S. naval station, most paroled into the United States. The U.S. Coast Guard has interdicted thousands of Cubans at sea since 1995, returning them to Cuba. Cubans who reached U.S. shore could apply for permanent resident status, while most interdictions resulted in return to Cuba. The wet foot/dry foot policy was criticized for encouraging risky migration and alien smuggling, opposed by Cuba for promoting illegal migration. The number of Cubans interdicted at sea by the U.S. Coast Guard fluctuated annually, influenced by economic situations in Cuba and the United States. Interdictions rose from 666 in FY2002 to 2,868 in FY2007, then declined to 422 by FY2010 due to factors like the U.S. economic downturn and more efficient coastal patrolling. However, from FY2011 to FY2016, interdictions increased each year, reaching 5,230 in FY2016. The flow of maritime migrants from Cuba increased in 2015 and 2016 due to concerns about changes in U.S. immigration policy. However, after the policy change in January 2017, the number of Cubans interdicted by the Coast Guard significantly decreased. In FY2017, 2,109 Cubans were interdicted, mostly before the policy change, and in FY2018, 200 Cubans were interdicted at sea. The number of undocumented Cubans entering the U.S. rose from around 8,170 in FY2010 to 58,269 in FY2016, with a shift towards land-based routes starting around FY2013. Since the change in U.S. immigration policy in early 2017, Cuban migrants have increasingly favored land-based routes to enter the United States, particularly through the southwestern border. The number of undocumented Cubans entering by land has significantly risen, with 20,955 entering in FY2017, but dropping to 6,044 in FY2018. This marks a 70% decline from the previous year. The flow of maritime migrants from Cuba has decreased, with only 200 Cubans interdicted at sea in FY2018. Cuba's susceptibility to narcotics-smuggling operations due to its extensive shoreline and geographic location has led to drugs entering the market through onshore wash-ups and smuggling operations from Jamaica. The Cuban government has implemented measures to combat the drug problem, including legislation to increase penalties for traffickers and cooperation with other countries on antidrug efforts. Operation Hatchet, initiated in 1999, focuses on maritime and air interdiction to address drug trafficking. Cuba's Operation Hatchet, started in 1999, focuses on maritime and air interdiction and recovering narcotics washed up on Cuban shores. Cuba has also implemented an internal enforcement program against its drug market since 2003, with a nationwide drug prevention campaign. U.S.-Cuban cooperation on antidrug efforts has varied over the years, with increased cooperation since 1999. Cuba and the U.S. have increased antidrug cooperation since reestablishing diplomatic relations in 2015. This includes dialogues, exchanges, and talks on counternarcotics issues. In December 2015, officials discussed ways to stop the illegal flow of narcotics, and in April 2016, Cuban security officials visited the U.S. Joint Interagency Task Force South in Key West, FL. In July 2016, Cuba and the United States signed a counternarcotics arrangement to enhance cooperation and information sharing. Cuba has 40 bilateral agreements for antidrug cooperation with countries worldwide, including the U.S. Coast Guard sharing tactical information with Cuban authorities. The U.S. Coast Guard and Cuban authorities share tactical information on vessels suspected of trafficking in Cuban waters. The DEA and Cuban counterparts have established direct communications since July 2016, leading to cooperation on drug investigations and the arrest of a fugitive. Cuba has assisted U.S. prosecutions by providing evidence and information, showing a willingness to cooperate on law enforcement matters. Cooperation between the United States, international partners, and Cuba in real-time information-sharing could increase interdictions of illegal drug trafficking. Cuba reported seizing 2.72 metric tons of illicit drugs in 2016, compared to 906 kilograms in 2015. An issue in normalizing relations is Cuba's compensation for expropriated U.S. properties valued at $8 billion. In 1972, the FCSC certified 5,911 claims of U.S. citizens and companies for property confiscated by the Cuban government through April 1967. In 2006, two additional claims were certified for property confiscated after April 1967. Many original claimant companies have changed ownership. Resolving the outstanding claims would require negotiation and cooperation between the two governments. Cuba does not recognize the FCSC valuation of claims or accrued interest, proposing a valuation based on declared taxable value instead. Cuba disputes the $1.9 billion valuation of expropriated U.S. properties by the FCSC, claiming losses of $134.5 billion from U.S. sanctions. U.S. law prohibits benefits until Cuba returns properties or provides compensation to U.S. citizens. The LIBERTAD Act allows the President to waive restrictions on property claims issue in Cuba if deemed necessary for U.S. interests. The Act links transition government determinations to the suspension and termination of the economic embargo on Cuba, considering progress in returning expropriated properties to U.S. citizens. The LIBERTAD Act prohibits U.S. persons from financing transactions involving confiscated property in Cuba owned by U.S. nationals. Sanctions can be suspended under a transition government and terminated under a democratically elected government. Congressional hearings have focused on property claims in Cuba. Since the reestablishment of diplomatic relations with Cuba in 2015, U.S. and Cuban officials have held three meetings on claims issues. Discussions included FCSC-certified claims of U.S. nationals, unsatisfied U.S. court judgments against Cuba, and some claims of the U.S. government. The Cuban delegation also raised claims against the United States related to the U.S. embargo. A second claims meeting in July 2016 allowed for an exchange of views on historical claims-settlement practices and processes. The talks in Havana in January 2017 discussed historical claims-settlement practices. Title III of the LIBERTAD Act holds accountable those who traffic in U.S. confiscated property. The right to file lawsuits is suspended every six months, with the latest suspension effective from August 1, 2018, through January 2019. National Security Adviser John Bolton mentioned in November 2018 that the Administration was considering whether to continue. Title III of the LIBERTAD Act allows U.S. nationals to file lawsuits against those trafficking in confiscated Cuban properties, with potential claims estimated to be in the tens of billions of dollars. The intent of Title III was to prevent foreign investment in confiscated properties, but some U.S. companies have engaged in transactions with Cuban entities in recent years. National Security Adviser John Bolton mentioned in a press interview the Administration's consideration of whether to continue suspending the right to file lawsuits under Title III. The potential lifting of the suspension of the right to file lawsuits under Title III of the LIBERTAD Act could impact foreign companies doing business in Cuba. Foreign governments like Canada, the EU, and Mexico have objected to this act in the past and may take countermeasures. The EU could potentially revive a WTO dispute against the LIBERTAD Act if the right to file lawsuits is not continued to be suspended. The 2014 terrorism report highlighted Cuba's harboring of fugitives wanted in the United States, providing them with support like housing and medical care. The United States have discussed this issue in law enforcement dialogues following the resumption of diplomatic relations with Cuba. U.S. fugitives in Cuba include convicted murderers and hijackers, such as Joanne Chesimard. Joanne Chesimard, also known as Assata Shakur, was added to the FBI's Most Wanted Terrorist list in 2013 for the 1973 murder of a New Jersey State Police officer. She was part of the Black Liberation Army and escaped from prison in 1979, living underground before fleeing to Cuba in 1984. Another fugitive, William \"Guillermo\" Morales, a member of the Armed Forces of National Liberation, has been in Cuba since 1988 after being imprisoned in Mexico. In recent years, U.S. fugitives wanted for various crimes, including Medicare and insurance fraud, have fled to Cuba. Despite an extradition treaty dating back to 1905, Cuba has not consistently utilized it. However, Cuba has returned wanted fugitives to the U.S. on a case-by-case basis. Examples include a couple wanted for murder in New Jersey in 2011, a Florida couple accused of kidnapping their children in 2013, and a U.S. fugitive wanted for ecoterrorism in 2018. In November 2018, Cuba returned a New Jersey man wanted on murder charges to the United States. Cuba has cooperated with U.S. law enforcement in some cases, such as successfully prosecuting a Cuban national who fled to Cuba after murdering a doctor in Florida in 2015. However, Cuba has refused to extradite fugitives judged as \"political\" by Cuba, citing concerns about fair trials in the U.S. President Trump called for the return of U.S. fugitives, including Joanne Chesimard, in his 2017 Cuba policy announcement. In the 115th Congress, the Consolidated Appropriations Act directed the Secretary of State to engage with Cuba to resolve cases of fugitives from justice, including Joanne Chesimard. Resolutions were introduced calling for the extradition of fugitives in Cuba, while another initiative required a report on the matter. In the 115th Congress, the Consolidated Appropriations Act directed the Secretary of State to engage with Cuba to resolve cases of fugitives from justice, including Joanne Chesimard. H.R. 1744 called for a report on fugitives from U.S. justice in Cuba. Miguel D\u00edaz-Canel succeeded Ra\u00fal Castro as president in April 2018, but significant changes to Cuba's political system are unlikely. Cuba is rewriting its constitution with planned reforms, including a new prime minister, age and term limits on the president, and some market-oriented economic changes. However, the Communist Party will still dominate the political system. Ra\u00fal Castro remains as first secretary. Miguel D\u00edaz-Canel succeeded Ra\u00fal Castro as president in April 2018, marking a generational change in Cuba's government. While Ra\u00fal Castro initiated economic policy changes towards a mixed economy, D\u00edaz-Canel has shown responsiveness to public concerns by reversing regulations that would have impacted the private sector and artistic expression. President D\u00edaz-Canel's actions show responsiveness to public concerns and independence from the previous Castro government. Economic reforms and desires for greater freedom are key challenges he faces. The Obama Administration's policy shift towards Cuba increased economic linkages, but President Trump's rollback and new sanctions have limited opportunities for U.S. business engagement and led to a decline in American travel to Cuba. In late 2017 and early 2018, travel to Cuba declined, with a notable increase in cruise ship visitors. The downsizing of the U.S. Embassy in Havana due to unexplained injuries to diplomatic staff led to visa processing suspension and hindered bilateral engagement. Debate over U.S. policy towards Cuba continued in Congress, particularly regarding economic sanctions. The 2018 farm bill included a provision allowing funding for U.S. agricultural export programs in Cuba. The 115th Congress took action to ease U.S. economic sanctions on Cuba by providing funding for agricultural export promotion programs. The human rights situation in Cuba remained a key concern for Congress, with diverse views on how to influence the Cuban government. Legislative initiatives in the 115th Congress included the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017 (H.R. 244), which passed with bipartisan support. The 115th Congress passed the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017, easing U.S. economic sanctions on Cuba. The act included provisions prohibiting the closure of the U.S. Naval Station in Guantanamo Bay and continued restrictions on direct funding for the Cuban government. Additionally, it allocated $20 million for democracy assistance in Cuba and $28.056 million for the Office of Cuba Broadcasting. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018 allocated $5 million more than requested for Cuba and $28.056 million for the Office of Cuba Broadcasting. The act includes provisions to prohibit the closure of the U.S. Naval Station in Guantanamo Bay and restricts funding for the Cuban government. Section 1026 of the act continues a provision from the previous year's NDAA to prevent any changes to the 1934 treaty between the United States and Cuba regarding Guantanamo Bay. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018 allocated funds for Cuba and the Office of Cuba Broadcasting. It includes provisions to prohibit the closure of the U.S. Naval Station in Guantanamo Bay and restrict funding for the Cuban government. Section 1036 of the act prohibits any material modification to the 1934 treaty between the United States and Cuba regarding Guantanamo Bay. The House and Senate approved the conference report on November 14 and 16, 2017, respectively. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 (P.L. 115-141) was signed into law on December 12, 2017. Originally introduced as the Targeted Rewards for the Global Eradication of Human Trafficking Act, it became the vehicle for the FY2018 omnibus appropriations measure. The bill passed through the House and Senate with amendments in March 2018, and President signed it into law on March 23, 2018. The final measure did not include certain policy provisions from previous House appropriations bills. Division C (Department of Defense), Section 8123, prohibits the use of funds for the closure or realignment of the U.S. Naval Station, Guantanamo Bay. Division J (Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies), Section 128, also prohibits the use of funds for the closure or realignment of the U.S. Naval Station, Guantanamo Bay. Division K (State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs), Section 7007, prohibits direct funding for the government of Cuba. Section 7015(f) prohibits the obligation or expenditure of funds. The explanatory statement to H.R. 1625, Division K, provided $28.936 million for Cuba broadcasting, $5.28 million more than requested. $20 million was allocated for democracy programs in Cuba, compared to the Administration's zeroing out of the assistance. The House appropriations bill would have provided $30 million in democracy assistance and the Senate bill would have provided $15 million. The John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019 includes provisions related to Cuba, such as engaging with the Cuban government to resolve cases of fugitives from justice. The Act also extends the prohibition on closing or relinquishing control of the U.S. Naval Station at Guantanamo Bay. The John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019 includes provisions related to Cuba, such as extending the prohibition on closing or relinquishing control of the U.S. Naval Station at Guantanamo Bay. Section 1027 requires a report on security cooperation between Russia and Cuba, Nicaragua, and Venezuela. The conference report expressed concern about Russian military and intelligence activity in the Western Hemisphere. The Energy and Water, Legislative Branch, and Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Act, 2019 (P.L. 115-244) includes provisions related to security cooperation between Russia and Cuba, Nicaragua, and Venezuela. It prohibits funding for the closure or realignment of the U.S. Naval Station at Guantanamo Bay. The bill was passed by the House and Senate in June 2018, with a conference report filed in September 2018. In September 2018, the Senate and House agreed to a conference report and signed into law a funding prohibition for FY2019 regarding the closure or realignment of the naval station. This was part of the Department of Defense and Labor, Health, and Human Services, and Education Appropriations Act, 2019. In September 2018, the Senate and House agreed to a funding prohibition for FY2019 regarding the closure or realignment of the U.S. Naval Station, Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba. This was part of the Department of Defense and Labor, Health, and Human Services, and Education Appropriations Act, 2019. The bill, known as P.L. 115-334 (H.R. 2), became the legislative vehicle for the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018 in September 2018. It includes a provision requiring the TSA Administrator to direct public charters to provide updated flight data for tracking operations between the US and Cuba.
