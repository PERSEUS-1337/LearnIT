    "content": "SECTION 1. FINDINGS. The Congress acknowledges the need to increase domestic energy supply for economic prosperity. Currently, the US heavily relies on foreign energy imports and carbon fuels for electricity. Hydropower contributes 10% of US electricity generation, with significant untapped potential in existing dams. Hydropower has approximately 21,300 megawatts of undeveloped capacity at existing dams. New technology allows for utilization with little environmental impact by adding new turbines and improving efficiency. It produces electricity without hazardous waste or air pollutants, avoiding annual emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrous oxide. Hydropower is a renewable energy source available perpetually due to the natural hydrologic cycle. The Act is based on Congress's authority under the Constitution to make necessary laws. It includes incentives for hydroelectric production. The Act provides incentive payments to owners or operators of qualified hydroelectric facilities for energy generated and sold during the incentive period. Payments are subject to availability of appropriations and are determined based on application eligibility and requirements set by the Secretary of Energy. Definitions for qualified hydroelectric facilities are outlined in the section. A qualified hydroelectric facility is a turbine or generating device owned by a non-Federal entity that generates hydroelectric energy for sale and is added to an existing dam or conduit. An existing dam or conduit is one that was completed before the enactment of this section and does not require construction or enlargement of impoundment or diversion structures. The terms defined in this subsection apply regardless of other factors. The terms defined in this subsection apply without regard to the hydroelectric kilowatt capacity of the facility, ownership of the dam, or the facility's operation start date. Payments for electric energy from a qualified hydroelectric facility can be made within a 10-year eligibility window starting from the enactment of the Act. The facility can receive payments for a 10-year incentive period starting from the fiscal year it becomes eligible for payments. Payments for electric energy from a qualified hydroelectric facility are based on the number of kilowatt hours generated during the incentive period. The payment amount is 1.5 cents per kilowatt hour, with adjustments for inflation each fiscal year. Facilities cannot receive more than $1,000,000 in one calendar year. In 2005, payments to qualified hydroelectric facilities were based on the Internal Revenue Code provisions. No payments could be made after 20 fiscal years or after 10 fiscal years of payment. $50,000,000 was authorized for each fiscal year from 2006 to 2015. SEC. 4. HYDROELECTRIC EFFICIENCY IMPROVEMENT. The Secretary of Energy will provide incentive payments to improve efficiency at existing hydroelectric facilities by at least 3%. Payments cannot exceed 10% of improvement costs or $1,000,000 per facility. Up to $50,000,000 can be appropriated annually for this purpose. SEC. 5. SMALL HYDROELECTRIC POWER PROJECTS. Amends the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 by changing the date. SEC. 6. INCREASED HYDROELECTRIC GENERATION AT EXISTING FEDERAL FACILITIES. The Secretary of Energy, in consultation with the Secretary of the Interior and Secretary of the Army, will conduct studies on cost-effective opportunities to increase hydropower generation at existing federally-owned water facilities. Studies must be completed within two years and submitted to specific committees. Each study will focus on improving hydropower efficiency through mechanical, structural, or operational changes in the nation's principal river basins. Opportunities to enhance water use efficiency in Federal projects for increased hydropower generation or reduced energy consumption. Potential for additional hydropower capacity through various means like new facilities, uprating generators, and pumped storage. Preliminary assessment of costs and environmental impacts. The Secretary of Energy may choose not to perform new studies and incorporate existing information into required studies. Authorization for necessary funds to carry out the purposes of this section. SEC. 7. RENEWABLE ENERGY PRODUCTION INCENTIVES PROGRAM. Amends the Energy Policy Act of 1992 to include small hydroelectric power projects in the incentives program."
