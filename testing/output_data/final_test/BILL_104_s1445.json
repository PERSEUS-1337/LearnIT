    "content": "The National Science Foundation Authorization Act of 1995 establishes definitions for terms used in the Act, such as \"Director\" referring to the head of the Foundation, \"Foundation\" as the National Science Foundation, and \"United States\" encompassing various territories. The Act also authorizes appropriations for the National Science Foundation. The Congress finds that the programs of the National Science Foundation are crucial for strengthening basic research and developing human resources in science and engineering. The Foundation's primary mission is to support basic scientific research, science education, and engineering fundamental research. Efforts to enhance the economic competitiveness of the United States should align with this mission. It is also important to encourage all states and regions, including rural areas, to participate in federal science initiatives. For fiscal years 1996, 1997, and 1998, the National Science Foundation is authorized to receive appropriations for Research and Related Activities, Education and Human Resources Activities, Major Research Equipment, and Academic Research Facilities Modernization. Total amounts authorized are $2,294,000,000, $599,000,000, $70,000,000, and $100,000,000 respectively. The National Science Foundation is authorized to receive appropriations for various activities, including Academic Research Facilities Modernization at $100,000,000, Salaries and Expenses at $127,310,000, Office of Inspector General at $4,500,000, and Headquarters Relocation at $5,200,000. SEC. 102. PILOT PROGRAM TO ENCOURAGE PARTNERSHIPS FOR RESEARCH. For fiscal years 1996, 1997, and 1998, $10 million is authorized for a pilot program at the Foundation to fund science research and outreach grants. The program aims to encourage consortia of research institutions, including EPSCoR institutions, to collaborate with non-EPSCoR institutions for various research and education activities. Grants will be awarded competitively by the Foundation, with preference given to peer-reviewed proposals. The Foundation will consider proposals with contributions from non-federal sources, without requiring cost-sharing. Grants must be administered by a consortium member from an EPSCoR State, with primary responsibility for oversight. The pilot program aims to enhance research groups and institutions in collaboration with EPSCoR and non-EPSCoR institutions. The pilot program aims to enhance research groups and institutions in rural and sparsely populated States to contribute to the federal research enterprise. Projects can be funded for up to three years with a potential two-year extension. The Foundation will provide a strategic plan for the implementation of the program to Congress. The National Science Foundation will implement a pilot program to support computing activities at tribal colleges by establishing interactive telecommunications systems. Additionally, a limited amount of funds can be used for consultation and representation expenses as determined by the Director. SEC. 105 allows the Director to transfer funds within Research and Related Activities subcategories, with limits on amounts. Transfers exceeding $500,000 require written explanation to specific committees. The National Science Foundation Act of 1950 is amended to require the Foundation to provide an annual report to the President and Congress, including a strategic plan for a three-year period outlining goals for each major activity. The National Science Foundation Act of 1950 is amended to require the Foundation to provide an annual report to the President and Congress, including a strategic plan for a three-year period outlining goals for each major activity in science and technology. The report must identify criteria, describe assessment procedures, review past activities, summarize planned initiatives, make recommendations, and provide information on patents. SEC. 202 of the National Science Foundation Act of 1950 is amended to redesignate subsection (k) as subsection (l) and replace \"Atomic Energy Commission\" with \"Secretary of Energy.\" Additionally, Section 6(a) of the National Science Foundation Authorization Act, 1976 is amended by removing \"social,\" and a technical amendment repeals the second subsection (g) of section 3. SEC. 203 of the National Science Foundation Act of 1950 states that temporary employees at the Foundation must comply with financial disclosure requirements like permanent employees in equivalent positions."
