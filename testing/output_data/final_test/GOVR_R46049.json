    "content": "Space weather refers to dynamic conditions in Earth's outer space environment, including solar flares, coronal mass ejections, high-speed solar wind streams, and solar energetic particles. Hazardous space weather events are rare but can cause geomagnetic disturbances that affect global areas, posing risks to space and ground-based systems vulnerable to electromagnetic interference and radiation exposure. The 1859 \"Carrington event\" caused auroras as far south as Central America and disrupted telegraph communications. In 1972, a GMD knocked out long-distance telephone service in Illinois. In 1989, another GMD caused a nine-hour blackout in Quebec and melted power transformers in New Jersey. In 2005, X-rays from a solar storm disrupted GPS signals briefly. This report outlines federal government policy on space weather hazards and the roles of relevant departments and agencies. The federal government has shown increased interest in space weather hazards over the past few decades. In 1995, the National Space Weather Program (NSWP) was established to coordinate federal space weather strategy development. In 2010, Congress directed the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) to improve national preparedness for space weather events. The White House took over federal space weather policy leadership in 2014 through the SWORM Working Group. The NSWP Council was deactivated in 2015 after the publication of the \"National Space Weather Strategy.\" President Obama signed E.O. 13744 in 2016 to coordinate federal space weather preparedness activities. An updated national space weather strategy was released in 2019 by the SWORM Working Group. In 2019, an updated national space weather strategy titled \"The National Space Weather Strategy and Action Plan\" was released. President Trump signed E.O. 13865, directing the federal government to improve national resilience to electromagnetic pulses. The 2019 Plan prioritizes investment in critical infrastructure resilience initiatives and focuses on protection of assets, space weather forecasting, and planning for space weather events. E.O. 13865 directs federal agencies to identify regulatory and cost-recovery measures. E.O. 13865 directs federal agencies to identify regulatory and cost-recovery mechanisms for private-sector investments in resilience for space weather and manmade electromagnetic hazards. Ambiguity arises in distinguishing between natural and manmade hazards, impacting preparedness scenarios and exercises. The federal agencies are responsible for early warning, forecasting, research, risk assessment, and response to space weather-related emergencies. Different administrations may have conflicting priorities, leading to ambiguity in policy implementation. This section focuses on federal agencies designated as the lead for specific objectives or requirements, excluding those with limited roles. It includes summaries of agency missions, relevant authorities, and provisions of executive orders. Information on implementing programs and activities is also provided, excluding provisions for manmade EMP threats. The 2019 Plan is referenced when applicable. The 2019 Plan is referenced in cases where executive orders do not provide specific guidance to federal entities. The Secretary of Commerce delegated space weather responsibilities to NOAA in 2016 and 2019 under E.O. 13744 and E.O. 13865. NOAA's work on space weather primarily focuses on improving services and partnering with stakeholders. NOAA's space weather work falls under two line offices: National Weather Service (NWS) and National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service (NESDIS). NWS operates observing systems for space weather forecasting, including the Global Oscillation Network Group. NESDIS maintains space weather data and satellite programs like GOES. The FY2018 NDAA codified the directive for DOD to provide space weather forecasts and products to support military operations. E.O. 13865 reiterates this requirement and directs DOD to take further steps related to EMP characterization and warning systems. The U.S. Air Force leads DOD and IC space weather information, supporting operations with space environmental data. The 557th Weather Wing at Offutt AFB conducts DOD's space weather activities using ground-based and space-based observing systems. $24 million was allocated to space weather activities in FY2019, primarily by the Air Force. The Solar Electro-optical Observing Network (SEON) provides 24-hour coverage of solar phenomena through ground-based and space-based observations. The Army and Naval Research Laboratory contribute to space weather activities, including the Wide-field Imager for Solar Probe Plus (WISPR) launched in August 2018. The Department of Energy (DOE) monitors and assesses potential disruptions. The Department of Energy (DOE) is responsible for monitoring and assessing potential disruptions to energy infrastructure from space weather. It is also tasked with coordinating electricity restoration during grid emergencies associated with geomagnetic disturbances. DOE's Office of Cybersecurity, Energy Security, and Emergency Response (CESER) leads relevant programs for energy infrastructure protection and threat mitigation. The Department of Energy (DOE) established CESER to enhance energy infrastructure security against various hazards, including geomagnetic disturbances (GMDs) and electromagnetic pulses (EMPs). CESER's divisions focus on Infrastructure Security and Energy Response, as well as Cybersecurity for Energy Delivery Systems. In collaboration with FERC, NERC, and DOE's national laboratories, CESER aims to protect the U.S. electricity grid and facilitate recovery from disruptions. The DOE's CESER was established to enhance energy infrastructure security against GMDs and EMPs. Prior to reorganization, DOE's OE collaborated with EPRI to develop strategies and action plans for EMP resilience. The documents focus on human-made nuclear threats and categorize GMDs separately from EMPs. FERC is an independent agency involved in grid protection efforts. FERC, part of DOE, oversees bulk-power system reliability and wholesale power market. EPAct05 authorized ERO to set and enforce reliability standards for critical infrastructure protection. FERC can approve or remand standards, with fines for noncompliance. In 2018, FERC issued a rule for GMDs, directing NERC to develop corrective action plans. The final rule authorizes time extensions for implementing corrective action plans to mitigate GMD vulnerabilities. NERC, certified as the ERO in 2006, collaborates with electric utilities to enforce FERC-approved standards and reduce risks to the bulk-power system. NERC's task force, created in response to E.O. 13865, focuses on EMP vulnerabilities, particularly nuclear threats. DOE oversees national laboratories like Los Alamos, studying EMP and GMD effects on critical infrastructure. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is leading a study on EMP and GMD effects on critical infrastructure in four phases. Executive orders assign DHS roles in early warning, response, and recovery for space weather and EMPs. DHS is also tasked with incorporating EMP scenarios into preparedness exercises, conducting R&D for EMP hazards, and enhancing infrastructure resilience. Relevant programs are managed by DHS's Science and Technology Directorate and operational components. DHS, through its Science and Technology Directorate, Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, and Federal Emergency Management Agency, uses an all-hazards risk management approach for space weather resilience. S&T partners with federal agencies and national labs to develop tools for utilities to predict localized space weather effects and enhance grid resilience. CISA administers public-private partnership programs for training and risk assessments. CISA, DOE, and other partners are creating guidance for electric utilities on mitigating electromagnetic hazards, including space weather. CISA offers risk guidance and real-time space weather advisories to industry stakeholders. FEMA develops plans to coordinate national resources for space weather events. FEMA incorporates space weather scenarios into education, training, and exercises. In 2018, FEMA conducted a space weather exercise for senior federal officials. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) is responsible for enhancing understanding of Earth's magnetic field variations related to EMPs. The USGS conducts space weather-related activities through the Geomagnetism program, collecting data about Earth's magnetic field at 11 observatories. This data is used by federal agencies, oil drilling services companies, and the electric-power industry. Congress appropriated $1.9 million to the Geomagnetism program in FY2019. The Department of State (DOS) is the lead foreign affairs agency responsible for negotiating international norms and practices with respect to outer space. The Department of State (DOS) plays a key role in promoting American prosperity through advancing bilateral relationships and leveraging international institutions in outer space. E.O. 13744 and E.O. 13865 direct the Secretary of State to lead diplomatic efforts to enhance the international community's capacity to respond to space weather events and engage with allies to enhance resilience to EMPs. DOS's Bureau of Oceans and International Environmental and Scientific Affairs is responsible for diplomatic engagement in these areas. The Office of Space and Advanced Technology within the Department of State is involved in building international partnerships to strengthen resilience to extreme events, including space weather. They lead U.S. delegations to the United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space and participated in a workshop on the International Space Weather Initiative in 2017. The initiative aims to advance space weather science through data collection, analysis, and communication of results to the public. The workshop focused on strengthening the international framework for space weather services through improving observation infrastructure, sharing best practices for risk assessment, increasing coordination on forecasting services, and developing mitigation plans. These efforts align with DOS's responsibilities and ongoing progress by COPUOS. NASA is tasked with scientific research on the \"Sun-Earth connection\" and is directed to support these initiatives. NASA's E.O. 13744 directs the agency to implement a national research program to understand the Sun and its interactions with Earth, advance space weather modeling, develop research missions and models, and support technology transition. The Heliophysics Division receives $720 million in funding, with $264 million allocated to space weather activities in FY2019. The Heliophysics Division of NASA funds research and operates spacecraft to study the sun, solar wind, and their interaction with Earth and the Solar System. NASA provides research data to NOAA for space weather prediction. NASA has operational concerns for spacecraft beyond Earth's magnetosphere. NASA's Heliophysics Division funds research and operates spacecraft to study the sun and its interaction with Earth and the Solar System. Spacecraft outside Earth's magnetosphere require additional radiation shielding. NSF supports space weather research to address societal needs. The National Science Foundation (NSF) funds space weather research through two divisions: Atmospheric and Geospace Sciences (AGS) and Mathematical and Physical Sciences (MPS), including the Astronomical Sciences division (AST). In FY2018, NSF allocated approximately $105 million for space weather, with $45 million for AST. NSF primarily provides grants for research institutions to study space weather impacts and dynamics. The AGS division supports basic sciences research and observational facilities to improve understanding of the sun, Earth's atmosphere, and near-space environment. The National Science Foundation (NSF) funds space weather research through two divisions: Atmospheric and Geospace Sciences (AGS) and Mathematical and Physical Sciences (MPS), including the Astronomical Sciences division (AST). NSF supports basic sciences research and observational facilities to improve understanding of the sun, Earth's atmosphere, and near-space environment. NSF also supports the development of numerical models of the space weather chain, including the sun, solar wind, and geospace. E.O. 13744 directs NSF to identify mechanisms for advancing space weather observations, models, and predictions. The National Science Foundation (NSF) funds space weather research to advance understanding of solar storms and their impact on near-Earth space. Total federal agency spending on space weather activities is not fully accounted for. In FY2019, the Space Weather Program and the Space Weather Operations, Research, and Mitigation Working Group allocated nearly $350 million to space weather activities, with NASA receiving the majority of $264 million. Federal agency allocations for space weather activities can vary annually. The 116th Congress passed legislation related to space weather research, forecasting, preparedness, response, and recovery, including the 2020 NDAA which amended Sections 320 and 707 of the Homeland Security Act of 2002. The 2020 NDAA amended Sections 320 and 707 of the Homeland Security Act of 2002, repealing a section related to electromagnetic pulse attacks. The Congressional EMP Commission played a role in developing E.O. 13865, which implements their recommendations. The 2020 NDAA amended sections related to electromagnetic pulse attacks and cited E.O. 13865. Provisions in the bill require the National Guard to report on readiness for EMP events. Bills introduced by Senator Gary Peters and Representative Ed Perlmutter aim to improve forecasting and mitigation of space weather effects. They establish an interagency working group and address federal agency roles, R&D, and data sharing. S. 881 and H.R. 5260 address critical infrastructure protection and data sharing. S. 881 was ordered to be reported without amendment by the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation in April 2019, while H.R. 5260 was referred to House committees for consideration in November 2019. Previous versions of these bills were introduced in the 114th and 115th Congresses."
