    "content": "Congress established the Office of Technology Assessment (OTA) in 1972 with the passage of P.L. 92-484. OTA was mandated to assess the consequences of technology application by preparing comprehensive reports on policy options. The agency provided Congress with objective analysis of scientific and technical issues to aid in policymaking, facilitating access to expertise and allowing legislators to consider information from various sources. OTA conducted technology assessments from 1973 to 1995, requested by committee chairmen or the Technology Assessment Board. The Office of Technology Assessment (OTA) was established in 1972 to provide Congress with objective analysis of scientific and technical issues. It had equal representation from House and Senate members and both parties, with peak funding of over $20 million annually in the early 1990s. OTA was effectively eliminated in 1995 due to lack of funding, with reasons including difficulty meeting congressional schedules and alleged bias towards liberal solutions. Its reports are available online. Some suggest Congress can rely on The National Academies, GAO, and CRS for science and technology information. Former OTA staff and analysts advocate for OTA funding or a similar legislative organization. OTA's absence may have hindered Congress in making crucial decisions. In the 107th and 108th Congress, Representative Rush Holt introduced legislation to re-establish the Office of Technology Assessment (OTA) with funding of $20 million annually. However, no further action was taken on these bills. Representative Holt also attempted to secure funding for OTA in 2002 and 2003 through amendments to legislative branch appropriations bills. In 2003, attempts were made to amend the FY2004 Legislative Branch Appropriations bill to fund the Office of Technology Assessment (OTA) at $7 million, but the amendment was ruled not in order. Proposals have been made since 2001 to create an OTA-like office in the legislative branch. Senator John F. Kerry introduced a bill in 2001 to create a Science and Technology Assessment Service within the legislative branch, which would provide independent science and technology advice. The proposed Service would conduct assessments with experts selected in consultation with the National Research Council. OTA focused on providing information about technology's impacts, while the proposed Service would provide ongoing advice. The proposed Science and Technology Assessment Service within the legislative branch would have developed information on the uses and applications of technology to address national science and technology policy issues. It would have incorporated features of OTA, such as a bipartisan congressional board and a Director to manage activities, but would have used NRC to select experts for assessments. It would not have OTA's Deputy Director or Technology Assessment Advisory Council. The Service would have had authority to contract and use personnel, but with less specific authority than OTA. The proposed Science and Technology Assessment Service within the legislative branch would have had authority to contract and use personnel, but with less specific authority than OTA. Language to create an Assessment Service was included in S. 1766, which was incorporated into S. 517. Senator John McCain submitted an amendment to delete the language, but later withdrew it. The Senate incorporated S. 517 into H.R. 4, passing the bill, but the conference committee did not complete action. During the first session of the 108th Congress, the Senate could not reach agreement on energy legislation (S. 14) and acted on a substitute amendment to the energy bill passed in the House (H.R. 6), which included the creation of the Science and Technology Assessment Service. H.R. 4670, introduced in June 2004 by Mr. Holt, proposed the creation of a center with a Technical Assessment Board consisting of 12 bipartisan Members of Congress, the Comptroller General, and non-voting members. The center would be operated by a director and deputy director with the authority to hire staff and enter contracts for assessments. Advisory panels would be established for each assessment, and any Member of Congress could make use of the center. The bill proposed the creation of a center for technical assessment with a board consisting of bipartisan Members of Congress. Requests for assessments would have priority based on bipartisan and bicameral support. Each assessment report would undergo external peer review before delivery to the director for release approval. $30 million annually was authorized for the center for fiscal years 2005 to 2007. Legislation was introduced to make a technology assessment pilot project permanent or authorize an assessment office in GAO. The provision, sponsored by Senator Jeff Bingaman, focused on a study by The National Academies and possible funding for a small OTA-like organization. The enacted Legislative Branch Appropriations bill did not include this language. The conference report did not specify an assessment topic, but three Senators requested GAO to assess technologies for U.S. border control. Six House Members supported the pilot technology assessment project. GAO agreed to assess biometric technologies and convened meetings with external experts. The resulting report was issued in November 2002. The FY2003 Senate legislative branch appropriations report provided $1 million for three studies. The GAO received $1 million for three studies to maintain assessment capability in the legislative branch and evaluate the GAO pilot process. Despite not receiving funds for a study, GAO conducted a technology assessment on cybersecurity for critical infrastructure protection. The House Appropriations Committee directed GAO to allocate funding for three technology assessment studies relevant to Congress's work in FY2004. The Senate incorporated S. 1383 in H.R. 2657, recommending $1 million for assessments in FY2004. GAO's evaluation showed that a technology assessment capability would benefit congressional committees. GAO was directed to report on the impact of assuming a technology assessment role on its mission and resources by December 15, 2003. The bill P.L. 108-83 established a technology assessment capability for GAO, requesting funding for new positions and contract support. GAO initiated assessments on cargo/port security and wildland communication in response to congressional directives. In 2005, Representative Holt proposed adding $30 million to GAO's account for a Center for S&T Assessment, but the House rejected the amendment. The Senate Appropriations Committee supported GAO doing technology assessments but did not allocate specific funding. Senator Bingaman introduced a bill to establish a technology assessment capability in GAO. The bill proposed mandating the Comptroller General to conduct technology assessment studies and establish procedures for assessments. It would have authorized $2 million annually for assessments but no further action was taken. The House Science Committee held hearings on providing scientific advice to Congress in July 2006. Considerations for evaluating technology assessment proposals include the analysis of the need for more. When evaluating alternative technology assessment proposals, key considerations include the need for more information and advice, political support for enhancing legislative capabilities, funding availability, timing, utility of assessments for decision-making, pros and cons of locating assessment centers within GAO, and the benefits and costs of establishing an independent legislative technology assessment function."
