    "content": "The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 (RCRA) authorizes the EPA to regulate hazardous wastes through stringent waste management procedures. The regulatory program, known as \"cradle-to-grave\" management, applies to hazardous waste generators, transporters, and treatment facilities. Congress left the designation of hazardous wastes to the EPA, excluding certain high-volume industrial waste from Subtitle C requirements in 1980 amendments. The Bevill and Bentsen amendments excluded high-volume industrial waste from Subtitle C requirements in 1980. These exclusions include waste from oil and gas exploration, cement kiln dust, mining waste, and waste from coal combustion at power plants. The reason for exclusion was the large amounts of Bevill-Bentsen wastes generated compared to other regulated hazardous waste. In 2011, 16,447 industrial waste generators produced 34.3 million tons of regulated hazardous waste, while 589 coal-fired power plants in the US generated around 130 million tons of waste. EPA studied Bevill-Bentsen waste and determined that regulation under Subtitle C was not needed for most wastes. Exceptions were made between 1988 and 2002. Additional information gathered since then includes changes in waste volume and hazardous characteristics, as well as risks and damages from improper waste management. One notable incident was the breach at TVA's Kingston, TN, power plant releasing 1.1 billion gallons of coal ash slurry. After the Kingston release, EPA revisited its regulatory determination on CCW management. In June 2010, EPA proposed two options to regulate the waste: one under Subtitle C with tailored TSDF requirements, and the other under Subtitle D relying on states or citizens for enforcement. EPA's focus was on establishing national standards for addressing risks associated with CCW management. EPA's 2010 regulatory proposal suggests potential authorities for regulating Bevill waste and Bentsen waste, with concerns raised by stakeholders and Members of Congress. The report aims to identify EPA's existing authorities to regulate the waste without additional direction from Congress, providing background on the Bevill and Bentsen amendments and EPA's regulatory powers. Specific examples of recent issues related to the waste are discussed, highlighting the need for EPA's attention. The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) is the primary federal law governing solid and hazardous waste management. It was enacted in 1976 and established the federal hazardous waste management program under Subtitle C. EPA has the authority to implement this program, and most states have chosen to do so. RCRA also prohibits open dumping of waste under Subtitle D. EPA lacks direct enforcement authority for regulations under Subtitle C. Under Subtitle C of RCRA, EPA has the authority to regulate hazardous waste from generation to disposal. States have primary authority to regulate solid waste under Subtitle D. Regulations under Subtitle C apply to hazardous waste management, including criteria for identifying hazardous waste characteristics. EPA lacks direct enforcement authority for Subtitle D regulations. EPA developed criteria for identifying hazardous waste characteristics and listing hazardous waste, considering factors like toxicity, persistence, and potential for accumulation. In 1978, EPA proposed Hazardous Waste Guidelines and Regulations, identifying specific solid wastes for deferred application of Subtitle C standards due to limited information on their hazards and large volumes. In 1980, EPA proposed limited Subtitle C standards for owners and operators of TSDFs receiving special wastes. Concerns raised by Congress included industry costs, conflicts with other laws like the Clean Water Act, and setting precedents. The Solid Waste Disposal Act Amendments of 1980 (P.L. 96-482) included provisions known as the Bentsen and Bevill amendments, named after their sponsors. These amendments excluded certain wastes from Subtitle C requirements, such as drilling fluids, produced waters, and other wastes related to oil, gas, or geothermal energy exploration. The Bevill amendment also excluded fly ash, bottom ash, slag waste, and flue gas emissions. The Bentsen and Bevill amendments excluded certain wastes from Subtitle C requirements, such as fly ash waste, bottom ash waste, slag waste, and flue gas emission control waste generated from the combustion of coal or other fossil fuels. The waste is subject only to regulation under other applicable state or federal law, with exemptions pending further study by EPA. EPA was required to report its findings to Congress and determine whether regulation under Subtitle C was warranted. EPA determined over the next 20 years that regulation under Subtitle C was not warranted for each waste excluded under the Bevill and Bentsen amendments. Regulation under Subtitle C was not deemed necessary for waste excluded under the Bevill and Bentsen amendments. EPA identified hazardous constituents in the waste and proper waste management practices. Exemption from Subtitle C does not mean the waste is unregulated, as it is subject to other state or federal requirements. State and federal regulatory requirements, including those under the Clean Water Act (CWA) and Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA), apply to the management of Bevill-Bentsen waste. CWA mandates permits for pollutant discharges to surface waters, while SDWA regulates subsurface injection of fluids. The management of Bevill-Bentsen waste is subject to state and federal regulatory requirements, including those under the Clean Water Act and Safe Drinking Water Act. Stakeholders have debated the risks posed by the waste and the adequacy of existing regulations to address these risks. EPA determined that regulation under Subtitle C was not necessary. In recent years, issues have been raised regarding the Bentsen exclusion for waste generated from natural gas exploration and production (E&P waste) and the Bevill exclusion for coal combustion waste (CCW). The increase in hydraulic fracturing for shale gas extraction has led to a significant rise in associated wastewater generation. EPA did not consider the volume or nature of this wastewater in its 1988 regulatory determination for E&P waste. The debate continues on whether Subtitle C regulations are suitable for managing this type of waste. The current approach to managing coal combustion waste (CCW) has drawn national attention due to incidents like the 2008 Tennessee Valley Authority spill. EPA highlighted the risks of toxic constituents leaching from CCW, such as arsenic, selenium, and lead. EPA proposed measures in June 2010 to address these risks. In June 2010, EPA proposed two regulatory options to manage coal combustion waste (CCW) containing toxic constituents like arsenic, selenium, and lead. Stakeholders from various sectors reacted strongly to the proposal, expressing concerns over the potential impact on industry, state regulatory agencies, the economy, energy prices, and recycling opportunities. Some stakeholders are concerned about the potential impacts of EPA's regulatory options for managing coal combustion waste on industry, state regulatory agencies, the economy, energy prices, and recycling opportunities. There are worries about the risks associated with improper waste management and the need for enforceable national standards to protect human health and the environment. Concerns also exist about the burden on industry and the potential for citizen suits under RCRA if industry is subjected to regulation. EPA's authority to regulate Bevill-Bentsen waste under Subtitle C is subject to limitations specified in the amendments. Subtitle C, subject to limitations specified in the Bevill and Bentsen amendments, allows EPA to develop regulations for solid waste disposal facilities receiving Bevill-Bentsen waste under Subtitle D authorities. EPA's authority under Subtitle C could reverse previous regulatory determinations for Bentsen-Bevill waste, with regulations needing approval from Congress under the Bentsen amendment. The Bevill amendment does not require separate congressional approval for regulations under Subtitle C. The Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 amended RCRA in key ways. The Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 (HSWA) amended RCRA to strengthen federal standards for hazardous waste treatment facilities. Subsection 3004(x) added regulations for TSDFs receiving \"mining and other special waste,\" allowing EPA to modify requirements for landfills and surface impoundments. EPA could modify TSDF requirements for landfills and surface impoundments receiving waste, tailoring regulations for Bevill waste under Section 3004(x). Uncertainty remains on reversing Bevill determinations for hazardous waste regulation. EPA's challenges in regulating excluded waste like CCW are evident from past regulatory determinations submitted to OMB. The improper management of CCW warrants regulation according to national standards established under Subtitle C. Draft recommendations in 2000 and 2010 were revised after OMB review, with the 2010 proposal including a Subtitle D option. Regulations for Bentsen waste would require an act of Congress to take effect, as EPA is not explicitly authorized to tailor regulations for it. Solid waste not meeting the hazardous waste definition is regulated under RCRA Subtitle D. EPA's authority under RCRA Subtitle D is limited to regulating the disposal of solid waste, not transportation, storage, or treatment. State and local governments are primarily responsible for managing solid waste, with EPA focusing on promulgating landfill criteria to prevent open dumping. EPA may use Subtitle D authorities to establish requirements for facilities receiving specific Bevill-Bentsen waste. The EPA's authority under RCRA Subtitle D is limited to regulating solid waste disposal to prevent open dumping. States have primary authority to enforce federal standards for waste management activities. EPA can encourage states to adopt federal requirements as enforceable standards, but cannot compel them to do so. Any new federal Subtitle D standards established by EPA would be enforceable by states. The EPA's proposed Subtitle D regulations are designed to be self-implementing, allowing facilities to comply without regulatory agency interaction. Compliance with the standards is required to avoid citizen suits, as Subtitle D heavily relies on citizen enforcement. Facilities would need to make compliance-related information publicly available. The EPA may promulgate Subtitle D regulations for Bevill-Bentsen waste, including cement kiln dust and CCW. Hazardous constituents and exposure pathways have been identified, with potential enforcement under RCRA Section 7003. Compliance with standards is crucial to avoid citizen suits, as facilities must make information publicly available. The EPA can take action under various federal statutes, such as RCRA Section 7003 and CERCLA, to address imminent hazards to human health or the environment from solid waste handling. Other statutes like the CWA and SDWA also allow EPA to respond to threats like pollutant discharges into water sources or contamination of public water systems. EPA's authority to address imminent hazards is not a substitute for compliance with regulations. The EPA's authority to respond to imminent hazards from solid waste is limited under statutes like RCRA and CERCLA. Congress established federal waste management standards in 1976 to prevent costly and complex corrective actions. EPA's waste management requirements aim to prevent contamination rather than remediate it after discovery. Subtitle C of RCRA establishes requirements to prevent releases of hazardous constituents in regulated hazardous waste, representing a proactive approach to environmental protection. It only regulates materials meeting the definition of hazardous waste, with exemptions not indicating nonhazardous status. Improperly managed waste may still pose risks. In contrast, CERCLA and related laws focus on reactive cleanup and enforcement actions in response to hazardous substance releases. EPA's information collection informs these actions. The EPA may need national standards for managing Bevill-Bentsen waste, but it could be challenging to establish new RCRA requirements for these wastes due to past opposition. Citizen suits against waste disposal facilities could also complicate the promulgation of regulations under Subtitle D. The EPA may face challenges in establishing new RCRA requirements for managing Bevill-Bentsen waste. Citizen suits against waste disposal facilities could complicate the promulgation of regulations under Subtitle D. EPA may use Section 7003 authorities to address risks associated with improper waste management."
