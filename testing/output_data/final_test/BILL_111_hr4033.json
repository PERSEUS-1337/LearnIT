The Commission, in consultation with the Board, will establish a system to demonstrate administration practices that ensure voting rights, improve voter access, and secure election integrity. States will collect data to analyze the effectiveness of election administration for Federal office. Each State must submit data to grantee under subsection (e). The Commission will promulgate regulations for data submission and standardization of election data to support the American Democracy Index. Statistical analysis may involve selecting precincts on a sample basis to gather necessary information. The Office may use information from paragraph (1) to form statistical conclusions on election administration in a State, appending sample data to State-provided election information. The Commission will make payments to States to help meet data submission requirements, and regulations under Section 209 do not apply to this process. The Commission will establish an independent Board of Advisors to consult on developing the American Democracy Index and data collection.
