    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Consumer Energy Commission Act of 2001\". Congress finds that there has been a sharp increase in the price of gasoline, home heating oil, natural gas, and propane in the United States. Electricity prices are expected to rise further due to high natural gas prices, leading to price spikes in certain regions. These spikes make it difficult for low-income families, the elderly, and small businesses to afford essential energy services. The Department of Energy believes that stable energy prices would benefit the economy, and price spikes can be caused by various factors such as supply disruptions and over-regulation. The impact of price spikes on consumers and small businesses includes higher energy costs, limited options, and the need to examine responses to price spikes. The Consumer Energy Commission is established. The Consumer Energy Commission is established with 11 members appointed by the Senate, House, and President to represent consumer groups, the energy industry, and various energy-related agencies. The Federal Trade Commission appoints members within 30 days of the Act's enactment for the life of the Commission. The initial meeting must be held within 20 days of all appointments. The Commission selects a Chairperson and Vice Chairperson from its members and receives necessary information and administrative expenses from specified federal agencies. The Commission's duties include conducting studies. The Commission is mandated to conduct a nationwide study on significant price spikes in major US consumer energy products over the past 10 years, including electricity, gasoline, home heating oil, natural gas, and propane. The study will focus on the causes of price spikes such as insufficient inventories, supply disruptions, and refinery capacity limits. The Commission will investigate causes of price spikes in energy products, including supply disruptions, refinery capacity limits, market concentration, misuse of market power, and other relevant market failures. A report will be submitted to Congress within 180 days of the Act's enactment. The Commission will submit a report to Congress within 180 days of the Act's enactment, containing detailed findings, conclusions, and recommendations for legislation to protect consumers from future price spikes in consumer energy products."
