King Cove, Alaska is a remote community on the Alaska Peninsula with a population of around 800 residents, mostly indigenous Native peoples of Aleut ancestry. Access to King Cove is limited to small aircraft or fishing boats due to severe and unpredictable weather conditions, making it one of the most challenging places in the United States to reach. The State of Alaska is assessing transportation improvements for King Cove, including a road between King Cove and Cold Bay that requires a legislative easement through the Izembek National Wildlife Refuge. The State of Alaska is considering a one-lane unpaved road through Izembek National Wildlife Refuge to connect King Cove and Cold Bay, which have around 250 vehicles combined. The Act aims to establish a surface transportation easement across Federal lands within the Refuge and transfer 664 acres of high value habitat lands to the Federal Government as new wilderness lands in exchange for redesignating a narrow corridor of land as nonwilderness lands. The King Cove Corporation offers to transfer land to the United States in exchange for a right-of-way for utility fixtures and a public road. The transferred lands will be managed as wilderness under the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act.
