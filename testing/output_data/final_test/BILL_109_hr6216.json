SEC. 3. CRITERIA FOR ELIGIBILITY. An individual is eligible to serve as a Fellow under the Program if they meet criteria such as having a juris doctor degree, exceptional academic achievement, a commitment to public service, and professional knowledge.

The number of Fellows in House offices must not be less than Senate offices, and the number in offices affiliated with the majority party of a House must be equal. The number of Fellows in House offices affiliated with the majority party must be equal to the number in offices affiliated with the minority party.

For the Program, a \"participating office\" includes any House or Senate office that agrees to participate. The Fellow's affiliation with the minority party is determined by the office they are assigned to. SEC. 5 states that the employment and salary of a Fellow by a House or Senate office will not affect the office's existing personnel or allowances. SEC. 6 outlines the joint administration of the Program by the House Administration Committee and the Senate Rules and Administration Committee. SEC. 7 authorizes appropriations for the Program.
