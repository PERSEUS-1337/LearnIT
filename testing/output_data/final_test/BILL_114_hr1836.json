    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Monuments Protection Act\". It includes findings related to monument protection. Congress finds that public land in the United States, including the National Park System, National Wildlife Refuge System, and National Forest System, is managed for the benefit of present and future generations. During a federal government shutdown, using funds from States to manage public lands like national parks, wildlife refuges, and forests is in line with their established values. Restricting public access to these areas without budgetary constraints or mitigation efforts is considered a violation of their purpose. Federal agencies managing national monuments, parks, and wildlife refuges are entrusted to prioritize public access, even during funding lapses. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, the term \"covered unit\" includes public lands, National Park System units, National Wildlife Refuge System units, federally owned monuments and memorials, National Forest System units, and federally owned roads and off ramps on specified land. The term \"public lands\" is defined as in the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of the Interior for land under their jurisdiction. The term \"eligible entity\" includes several States, the District of Columbia, federally recognized Indian tribes, territories and possessions of the United States, and political subdivisions thereof. SEC. 4. AGREEMENT TO OPERATE AND MANAGE COVERED UNIT DURING GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN. The Secretary shall enter into an agreement with eligible entities to resume operations and public access to covered units during a lapse in Federal funds or insufficient funds. The agreements only apply to specific covered units. The agreement with eligible entities for covered units during funding lapses is limited to specific units, can cover all or part of a unit, lasts up to 5 years, and is in effect when the Secretary cannot operate units normally. Copies of agreements must be kept. Under this section, agreements must be kept by the Secretary, eligible entity, and other agencies, available for Congress to inspect. The Secretary will reimburse eligible entities for costs incurred during activities funded by appropriations. The Secretary may restrict access to covered units for national security reasons. If the Secretary does not enter into an agreement after an offer, a report must be submitted to specified committees detailing the offer and reasons for not entering into an agreement."
