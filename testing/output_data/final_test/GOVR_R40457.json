    "content": "During his first official visit to China in November 2009, President Obama released a Joint Statement with PRC President Hu Jintao. The Dalai Lama's U.S. visit in October did not include a meeting with President Obama, which was postponed until after Obama's trip to China. PRC Premier Wen Jiabao visited North Korea, and the PRC celebrated its 60th anniversary with a military parade. Beijing also announced easing restrictions on foreign investments in the culture industry. The Obama Administration inherited a smoother but complex relationship with China from the Bush Administration. Cooperation on various issues like anti-terror initiatives, Six Party Talks, and military relations continued. Obama sought greater cooperation with China on global issues like the financial crisis and climate change. Beijing also eased restrictions on foreign investments in the culture industry. During Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's first official trip to China in February 2009, key issues discussed included the financial crisis, global climate change, and security interests. Ongoing challenges for U.S. policymakers with China include disputes over Taiwan, intellectual property rights, economic policies, and product safety. Concerns also arise from China's assertive foreign policy and military development, prompting calls for a reassessment of U.S. policies towards China. Many U.S. observers are concerned about China's growing economic and political reach, known as \"China's rise,\" and its impact on global U.S. interests. The debate revolves around whether China's power is a threat that needs to be countered or an inevitable phenomenon that needs to be managed. Globalization has tightly linked U.S. and China's interests, making unilateral actions risky. The 111th Congress faces recurring issues on how to best address these challenges. The policy debate surrounding China's rise revolves around whether to accommodate or counter its growing power. Some believe that China's economic interdependence with the international community will lead to stable international relationships and a more conservative society. This view suggests that China's wealth will result in a better-off, educated populace. Some proponents argue that China's growing power will lead to a more conservative society, with the populace pushing for political pluralism and transparency. They suggest that the US should work closely with China to benefit from cooperation on global issues, rather than viewing China as a threat. Some proponents argue that viewing China as a threat could have disastrous consequences, including military conflict, increased Chinese nationalism, and a breakdown in governance. They stress the competitive challenges of China's growing power and the potential impact on U.S. global interests. Beijing officials are determined to increase their nation's wealth and power in a competitive environment. Some observers believe that China is using its economic ties to gain political power, potentially eroding U.S. influence globally. They suggest that the U.S. should counter China's growing power by strengthening alliances, expanding investments, and maintaining a strong military presence. Some American policy analysts view China's growing power as a threat to U.S. international power and influence. They believe that Beijing aims to weaken U.S. alliances, create economic ties with U.S. allies, and support U.S. enemies, despite outwardly supporting anti-terrorism efforts. These analysts argue that China's authoritarian regime contributes to strengthening nations that harbor global terrorists. Some American policy analysts believe that China's authoritarian regime strengthens nations that harbor global terrorists. They argue that the US should focus on changing China's political system from within to improve relations, while also being vigilant in containing China's foreign policy actions and economic relationships that threaten US interests. US-China relations involve a mix of bilateral and multilateral issues, ranging from key irritants to areas of cooperation and competition. President Barack Obama's state visit to China in 2009 resulted in a U.S.-China Joint Statement highlighting key accomplishments and areas for further cooperation, including educational exchanges, global economic recovery, and climate change. Some officials were frustrated by the lack of positive press coverage, while human rights activists criticized the focus on economic issues. During President Obama's visit to China in 2009, the discussion agenda focused on economic and financial issues, with some mention of human rights concerns. The White House imposed increased tariffs on Chinese tires following a recommendation from the International Trade Commission. The Obama administration approved import relief for the United Steel, Paper and Forestry, Rubber, Manufacturing, Energy, Allied Industrial and Service Workers International Union, despite previous denials by the Bush administration. China requested consultations with the US under the WTO's Dispute Settlement Understanding. China's significant foreign exchange reserves and purchases of US debt position them to play a crucial role in addressing US economic problems. China's significant foreign exchange reserves position them to be a major purchaser of new U.S. government debt, raising concerns among U.S. policymakers about economic and political risks. Premier Wen Jiabao stated that China will decide on purchasing U.S. Treasuries based on its own needs, prompting worries about potential shifts in China's policy. The PRC's new sovereign wealth fund and $586 billion stimulus package raise concerns about changing investment strategies and potential corruption. Party elders are pushing for oversight of the recovery spending program. U.S. officials face complications as they seek Chinese capital while also urging Beijing to stimulate domestic consumption. The global financial crisis has led to a shift in economic decision-making towards the G20 countries, including China. President Hu Jintao has been actively participating in G20 meetings to discuss the crisis and shape a new international financial system. China's role in global economic policy remains uncertain despite increasing demands for its involvement. The PRC government maintains repressive security measures in Xinjiang-Uighur Autonomous Region, targeting the Uighur Muslim minority. The government justifies these policies as part of the global anti-terrorism campaign. U.S. officials warn against using anti-terror measures to persecute minorities with political grievances. The U.S. listed the East Turkestan Islamic Movement as a terrorist group, leading to a serious confrontation with the Uighur minority. The Chinese confrontation with its Uighur minority began on July 5, 2009, when peaceful protests turned violent in Xinjiang's capital, Urumchi. The protests were sparked by ethnic tensions following an incident in Guangdong Province. The clashes resulted in 156 deaths and 1,000 injuries, with reports of armed Han Chinese vigilantes seeking revenge. The PRC authorities responded aggressively to quell the unrest. PRC authorities have aggressively countered demonstrations and unrest in response to the July 2009 protests in Urumchi. Over a thousand people have been arrested, curfews imposed, and Internet access cut. President Hu Jintao cancelled plans to attend the G-8 summit in Italy and returned to China, raising concerns about political decision-making and civilian control of the military. Tensions between the Han Chinese majority and ethnic Uighur minorities are highlighted by the protests. The PRC imposes restrictive policies in Xinjiang, leading to tensions with ethnic minorities like the Uighurs who seek greater autonomy. This includes limits on religious practice, Chinese language education, and perceived economic advantages for Han Chinese immigrants. Han Chinese view minorities as receiving unfair benefits like affirmative action in education and housing. The United States has expressed concerns about China's military budget, lack of transparency, attempts to gain military secrets, and assistance to rogue states. Despite some high-level dialogue, this aspect of the relationship remains marked by a lack of trust. In 2009, the Pentagon reported aggressive actions by PRC ships towards US Navy surveillance ships in the South China Sea, near Hainan Island. The PRC ships approached within 25 feet of the USNS Impeccable, forcing an emergency stop and dropping pieces of wood in its path, just a week after military negotiations with China. The US lodged a protest with China over the harassment of the USNS Impeccable in international waters. The Pentagon sent the USS Chung-Hoon to escort the USNS Impeccable in the South China Sea. The incident occurred after successful military negotiations with China. The USNS Impeccable was operating in the EEZ when China claimed its activities violated the U.N. Convention. Director of National Intelligence testified about China's aggressive claims in the EEZ. The Pentagon reported China's increasing military modernization and potential dangers in areas where US military operates. The People's Republic of China has significantly increased its military budget in recent years, focusing on acquiring advanced foreign weapons, investing in domestic defense industries, and implementing organizational and doctrinal reforms. This build-up is seen as a long-term threat to Taiwan and the U.S. military presence in Asia, with a particular focus on strategies to deny access to third-party military forces, especially the United States, in the event of a conflict over Taiwan. The People's Republic of China has increased its military budget, focusing on acquiring advanced weapons and implementing reforms. The U.S. has concerns about the PRC's military capabilities, highlighted by a successful anti-satellite test in 2007. China's ASAT test in 2007 caught U.S. officials off guard, showcasing China's ambitious space program. China has sent manned flights into space, becoming the third country to do so after Russia and the United States. Their official space plans include a lunar program with potential military implications. China's official space plans involve a three-stage lunar program, with the goal of landing a rover on the moon by 2012 and conducting a manned lunar mission by 2020. China's space activities serve various purposes such as national security, science and technological innovation, generating high-tech jobs, and enhancing diplomatic relations. The country is also emerging as a competitor in the satellite market and has been recognized as part of a comprehensive drive to achieve \"great power status.\" During President Barack Obama's state visit to China in November 2009, discussions on space science cooperation and human space flight were initiated. Economic and trade issues, including the U.S.-China trade deficit and intellectual property rights protection, remain contentious in bilateral relations. The U.S. Treasury Department released a report on international exchange in April 2009. The U.S. Treasury Department released its latest semi-annual report on international exchange rates, noting China's imbalanced economy but refraining from labeling them as a currency manipulator. This marked a shift from previous statements by Treasury officials. The report highlighted China's efforts to stimulate domestic consumption and address concerns about its exchange rate policies. The PRC previously pegged its currency to the U.S. dollar, causing concerns about undervaluation. In 2005, the PRC allowed the RMB to float within a range, resulting in a 22% appreciation. U.S. congressional concerns persisted despite this change. The Senate Finance Committee and the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee have addressed currency exchange rate issues. U.S. allegations of unfair subsidies by China have led to trade disputes. The U.S. Trade Representative filed a case against China in the WTO for export subsidies. In 2007, countervailing duties were applied to Chinese companies exporting glossy paper to the U.S., breaking a 23-year policy. In 2007, countervailing duties were applied to Chinese companies exporting glossy paper to the U.S. due to unfair subsidies. This move signaled a new U.S. willingness to challenge China's trade policies, particularly regarding intellectual property rights (IPR) violations. China's failure to uphold WTO commitments on IPR protection has cost U.S. firms billions in lost sales, with a high piracy rate for software products in China. The Motion Pictures Association of America accused China of blocking American film imports, leading to increased piracy. The U.S. Trade Representative reported counterfeit products from China, including pharmaceuticals and electronics, as a threat to consumers. China faced complaints about failing to comply with WTO agreements on intellectual property rights and market access. Reports of tainted food and unsafe products from China emerged, with concerns about PRC-made drywall emitting corrosive gases in 2009. In March 2009, concerns arose about PRC-made drywall emitting corrosive gases. In September 2008, tainted infant formula in China led to public outcry and government crackdown on suspect producers. The PRC government imposed limits on melamine in food products and banned 17 additional food additives in December 2008. Officials conducted nationwide inspections and arrested those violating product safety standards. In December 2008, the PRC government banned 17 additional food additives, including lye, boric acid, and formaldehyde, to address concerns about product safety. This followed previous incidents such as tainted pet food exports in 2007 linked to pet deaths in the United States. Bilateral efforts on Chinese exports' quality to the US have been ongoing since 2004. In 2004, the CPSC and China's AQSIQ signed an MOU to enhance public safety of consumer products. They held biennial CPSS meetings in Beijing and Washington in 2005 and 2007. The FDA opened offices in China in 2008. The third CPSS meeting was planned for October 2009. In 2009, on the anniversary of the Tibetan National Uprising, the PRC increased security in Tibetan regions and restricted tourist travel to Tibet. The Dalai Lama criticized the PRC for turning Tibet into a \"hell on earth\" and endangering Tibetan culture and identity. The 111th Congress may review U.S. policy toward Tibet in light of these events. In 2009, the anniversary year was used to review U.S. policy towards Tibet and Sino-Tibetan relations. Congress is concerned about Tibet's status within China, the role of the Dalai Lama, and the impact of Chinese control on Tibetan culture. The U.S. government recognizes Tibet as part of China, but the Dalai Lama has strong supporters in Congress pushing for protection of Tibetan culture. This led to the creation of the Special Coordinator for Tibetan issues in 1997. The Special Coordinator for Tibetan issues was created in 1997 to address concerns about Tibet's status within China and the impact of Chinese control on Tibetan culture. Paula Dobriansky served as the highest-ranking U.S. official in this position during the Bush Administration. The Obama Administration had not yet named a new Special Coordinator. Increased PRC security presence in Tibet since March 2008 was in response to confrontations during the 49th anniversary of the 1959 uprising, leading to clashes between Tibetan protestors and Chinese riot police. On April 1, 2009, during the G-20 Financial Summit in London, President Obama and China's President Hu Jintao announced the establishment of the U.S.-China Strategic and Economic Dialogue (S&ED). This annual dialogue focuses on economic, security, and other issues, bringing together senior officials from both countries to discuss various topics including trade relations, security, climate change, energy, and public health. The dialogue has two tracks - a \"Strategic Track\" led by U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Chinese State Councilor Dai Bingguo, and an \"Economic Track\" led by U.S. Treasury Secretary. The U.S.-China Strategic and Economic Dialogue (S&ED) was established in 2009 during the G-20 Financial Summit in London. It consists of two tracks - a \"Strategic Track\" led by U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Chinese State Councilor Dai Bingguo, and an \"Economic Track\" co-chaired by U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner and Chinese Vice Premier Wang Qishan. The dialogue involves senior officials from various departments discussing trade relations, security, climate change, energy, and public health. The split coordination between the State and Treasury Departments aims to enhance diplomatic prestige but may lead to rivalries and overlapping responsibilities. The U.S. State and Treasury Departments have appointed S&ED coordinators, with officials coordinating approaches to various issues. There is a lack of joint coordination on the PRC side, leading to stove-piped bureaucracies. The SED process allowed for interaction among PRC ministers across departments. At the July 2009 S&ED meeting, U.S. and Chinese officials signed a memorandum of understanding to cooperate on climate change and reform the governance of the IMF and World Bank. Admiral Timothy Keating announced the resumption of military contacts between the two countries. Critics noted modest achievements from the meeting, emphasizing the groundwork laid for future dialogues. The new S&ED meeting between U.S. and Chinese officials resulted in modest outcomes, with substantial time and effort put into coordination. The S&ED is one of many recurring U.S.-China dialogues, including the JCCT, JEC, and JCM, which have been held regularly since the late 1970s and early 1980s. The U.S.-China dialogues include the JCM, State-NDRC Dialogue, EPD, GIF, and HCF, involving various government agencies from both countries. The U.S.-China military dialogue process has been lacking compared to other dialogues between the two countries. The Defense Consultative Talks have been sporadic and of questionable value, with talks being suspended in the past due to perceived offenses. Admiral William Fallon expressed concerns about the decline in U.S.-China military ties in recent years. In 2006, Admiral William Fallon mentioned the significant decline in U.S.-China military ties, stating he was \"starting from virtually zero\" to rebuild contacts. Despite this, there have been agreements and understandings with the PRC military, including a Military Maritime Consultative Agreement in 1998, a military \"hotline\" established in November 2007, joint search-and-rescue exercises, and plans for joint military exercises in July 2008. Under the Obama Administration, there has been a commitment to improving Sino-U.S. military relations, with high-level military exchanges taking place. In June 2009, high-level military exchanges resumed between the U.S. and China, discussing arms sales to Taiwan, anti-terrorism efforts, North Korea nuclear issue, security in Asia-Pacific, and U.S. military activities in China's exclusive economic zone. They agreed to address sea military security issues in Beijing and announced the resumption of routine military contacts in July 2009. Taiwan remains a sensitive issue in their relations. The Taiwan issue is a sensitive and complex issue in Sino-U.S. relations, with Beijing claiming sovereignty over Taiwan and threatening to use force if Taiwan declares independence. China has deployed missiles opposite Taiwan's coast and continues military modernization based on a \"Taiwan scenario.\" The potential for conflict has been a concern due to Taiwan's unpredictable political environment. In Taiwan, the political power balance shifted in 2008 when Ma Ying-jeou of the KMT Party was elected president, easing fears of cross-strait contention. Ma's victory followed the KMT's success in legislative elections and was seen as a rejection of former President Chen Shui-bian's governance. President Ma focused on improving cross-strait relations. Improvements in cross-strait relations were made under the Ma administration, with official talks reopening in 2008 resulting in agreements for direct charter flights, opening offices in each other's territories, and boosting PRC tourism to Taiwan. Subsequent rounds of talks in 2008 and 2009 produced agreements on food safety, transportation, postal links, and mainland investment in Taiwan. Speculation arose on U.S. policy toward Taiwan under the Obama Administration. The Obama Administration faces potential policy challenges regarding Taiwan, including revisiting the U.S. policy framework, supporting Taiwan's democracy, and addressing concerns about closer relations with the PRC. Other challenges include decisions on arms sales, visits by Taiwanese officials, economic ties, and Washington's role in cross-strait relations. The George W. Bush Administration notified Congress of a $6.4 billion defense package for Taiwan in 2008, ending a period of no arms sales. Barack Obama supported this decision, indicating continuity in U.S. arms sales policies. In 2009, Taiwan's defense needs were addressed by the WHO including Taiwan in the International Health Regulations. Taiwan was invited to attend the 2009 World Health Assembly meeting as an observer, marking the first time since losing its U.N. seat to the PRC. Taiwan was invited to participate in a U.N. specialized agency activity in 2009, marking the first time since losing its U.N. seat to the PRC in 1971. The invitation was attributed to Taiwan President Ma Ying-jeou's approach towards Beijing. The WHO Director-General Margaret Chan invited Taiwan's Department of Health, leading to a 15-member delegation attending the meeting. Taiwan's bid for meaningful participation in U.N. organizations, including the WHO, faced objections from the PRC in 2008. On September 19, 2008, a U.N. subcommittee decided not to include Taiwan's request for \"meaningful participation\" in U.N. activities on the agenda for the 63rd General Assembly. Taiwan had faced objections from the PRC in its bid for U.N. membership and participation in organizations like the WHO. Taiwan's previous attempts for U.N. membership had been unsuccessful. The U.S. government has been vocal in opposing Taiwan's past U.N. membership applications, stating that Taiwan is not recognized as a state in the international community. However, the U.S. has supported Taiwan's participation in organizations like the WHO. The United States has long supported Taiwan's participation in the WHO, including observer status at the WHA. Taiwan's President Ma Ying-jeou aimed to reduce tensions with China by adopting a \"three no's\" approach and promoting a diplomatic truce. In 2008, Taiwan collaborated with China on disaster relief after the Sichuan earthquake, signaling a new cross-strait approach. In late May 2008, Taiwan resumed official talks with China for the first time since 1998. The KMT chairman met with PRC President Hu Jintao, leading to three rounds of direct talks and agreements on various issues such as transportation and crime fighting. Taiwan has taken unilateral initiatives to promote mainland investment, including financial liberalization measures and easing investment restrictions with China. This includes allowing RMB conversion, secondary listings for Chinese companies on Taiwan's stock exchange, and PRC-backed mutual funds to invest in Taiwan's stock market. Additionally, Taiwan has allowed two major PRC media outlets to station reporters in Taiwan and plans to raise the cap on Taiwan companies' investment in China from 40% to 60%. Taiwan is considering raising the cap on investment in China from 40% to 60%, lifting restrictions on sensitive sectors, and allowing military contacts as proposed by PRC President Hu Jintao in 2008. China and Taiwan may have military contacts to establish mutual trust and explore ending hostility. China's increased international engagement has sparked American debate on its motivations and implications for soft power projection worldwide. China's foreign policy objectives include promoting economic development, separating Taiwan from official relationships, and increasing international stature to compete with the US. This has led to China forming bilateral agreements, joining multilateral organizations, and establishing new institutions. China's foreign policy approach, with competitive advantages over the United States, includes unrestricted overseas loans and investments attractive to foreign governments seeking swift solutions. Beijing's state-owned companies can afford short-term losses for long-term gains, but face limitations in tackling difficult issues. Acquiring an international presence brings new complications for China. China's international presence presents new complications for the PRC, including opportunities for misunderstanding and cultural backlash. China lacks a substantial private-sector investment presence overseas, unlike the United States. However, China is increasingly competing with the US economically and politically on the international stage, as seen in its participation in the East Asia Summit. China's international presence is expanding, with a focus on economic and security arrangements in Central Asia through the Shanghai Cooperation Organization. China is also increasing its influence in the Middle East, particularly in energy ties with Saudi Arabia and trade with the Gulf Cooperation Council countries. The PRC is becoming a competitor to the United States in these regions. In recent years, China's trade with Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries has grown, reaching $32 billion in 2005. China has shown willingness to improve cooperation with Arab nations, including efforts to resolve conflicts. Additionally, China deployed navy task forces in 2008 to protect commercial ships from Somali pirate attacks in the Gulf of Aden, marking the first operational mission for its navy. China's relations with \"bad actor\" countries have posed challenges for U.S. policy. China has also focused on energy-related development in resource-rich African nations like Sudan and Angola. China's growing international outreach includes energy-related development in resource-rich African nations like Sudan and Angola, despite U.S. pressure on Beijing to address humanitarian crises. The PRC's relations with Iran are seen as problematic by U.S. officials, hindering efforts against Iran's nuclear program. China has also been courting the European Union intensively, with Premier Wen Jiabao visiting six European countries in 2009. China's expanding international relations include strengthening ties with the European Union and Latin American countries. This includes signing Free Trade Agreements with Chile and Peru, becoming their largest trading partner. China's economic growth and energy needs drive its engagement with resource-rich nations like Haiti in the Western Hemisphere. China's economic development, driven by its need for energy resources, is significantly impacting the environment. China's heavy reliance on soft coal has made it one of the world's largest contributors to CO2 emissions. Efforts to address environmental issues have been made, including the establishment of the State Environmental Protection Administration in 1998 and the implementation of environmental laws and regulations. Despite China's efforts to adopt environmental laws and convert government vehicles to non-polluting fuels, the country struggles to combat worsening pollution due to economic development. The push for cleaner hydro-power technology has led to massive dam construction projects like the Three Gorges Dam, criticized for contributing to desertification and flood damage. China's hydro-power development programs are impacting neighboring countries as rivers originating in Tibet are affected. The United States and China collaborate to reduce carbon emissions through the FutureGen International Partnership. The United States and China collaborate in the FutureGen International Partnership to reduce carbon emissions and promote clean energy technology. The third SED in 2007 resulted in an agreement to explore cooperation in energy and environmental fields. China's internal political and institutional development has not kept pace with its economic growth, leading to social and economic inequities and strains in its political and societal fabric. China faces internal strains and deficiencies, with a divide between advocates of sustainable development and the wealthy benefiting from economic liberalism. Civil society is restricted, and the press faces constraints. Beijing is concerned about the social and political implications of these issues, leading to ongoing debates and maneuvering. Grievances from Uighurs and Tibetans, along with events like the 2008 Sichuan earthquake and the global financial crisis, have fueled public dissatisfaction with the government. The PRC government is addressing rising unemployment among China's rural migrant workforce and shoddy construction issues. Economic changes have caused discontent among various social groups, with peasants facing heavy tax burdens and land confiscation by officials for development. This has led to protests, as seen in the Dongzhou incident in 2005. In December 2005, paramilitary forces in Dongzhou, China, fired on villagers protesting land confiscation for a power plant, leading to casualties. The government proposed the \"2005 Number 1 Document\" to address rural complaints by reducing taxes, increasing farm subsidies, and bridging the urban-rural income gap. Rising labor unrest in northern cities challenges Beijing's communist ideals, impacting the credibility of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions. In October 2008, new measures were introduced to support farmers. In October 2008, the Chinese government issued new measures allowing farmers to lease, transfer, or sell rights to their land to strengthen their control. The global financial crisis has led to factory closures and unemployment, increasing social unrest in China. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton faced controversy in 2009 for downplaying human rights issues in U.S.-China relations. The Bush Administration favored selective pressure on human rights issues in China, but it has had little impact on PRC policies. China continues to crack down on unauthorized religious groups and restrict ethnic communities seeking autonomy. Reports suggest state persecution of religious groups persists. The U.S. Department of State's annual International Religious Freedom Report on China highlights ongoing state persecution of religious and spiritual groups, particularly Tibetan Buddhists and Uighur Muslims. The Chinese Communist Party's control over religious practices remains strict, with churches required to register with the government. The Chinese government requires churches to register, making unregistered house churches technically illegal. Treatment of unregistered churches varies by locality, with some officials repressive and others tolerant. Communist Party officials emphasize that religious belief is incompatible with Party membership. US funding for family planning practices in China is prohibited due to allegations of coercion. Restrictions also apply to international family planning programs in China. The House-passed version of H.R. 3081 prohibits funds for a UNFPA country program in China and requires a dollar-for-dollar deduction of U.S. contributions if UNFPA proceeds with a program in China. The Obama Administration aims to restore these UNFPA contributions despite China's one-child policy. China's government is reportedly reconsidering this policy due to demographic trends and economic implications. In October 2004, Beijing considered scrapping the one-child policy due to low birth rates and economic implications for supporting the aging population. In January 2005, China planned to make it illegal to selectively abort female fetuses. There were reports of public protests in Guangxi Province in May 2007 over the harsh enforcement of family planning policies. Revision of the one-child policy has been discussed. The Sichuan earthquake of May 12, 2008, led to the revision of the \"one-child\" policy as many parents lost their only child due to the destruction of schools. H.R. 2647 / S. 1390 (Skelton/Levin) required the Department of Defense to report on the value of rare earth materials, including China's importance in the U.S. defense supply chain. Introduced in June 2009, the bill passed the House on June 29. The House and Senate passed a bill in June 2009 requiring a report on rare earth materials and Taiwan's air force. However, the final version signed into law omitted these provisions but included expanded reporting requirements on military developments in China. The House and Senate passed a bill in June 2009, which became P.L. 111-84 on October 28, 2009. The bill prohibits poultry imports from the PRC. It went through various stages of approval in both chambers before becoming law. The House and Senate passed a bill in June 2009, which became P.L. 111-84 on October 28, 2009, containing a poultry import prohibition. Additionally, H.R. 471 limits the President's discretion under the Trade Act of 1974, H.R. 2312 authorizes grants for U.S.-China energy cooperation, and H.R. 2410 deals with foreign relations authorization for FY2010 and FY2011. H.R. 2410 (Berman) Foreign Relations Authorization Act, FY2010 and FY2011, includes provisions related to Tibet, such as coordinating U.S. policy on Tibet among Executive Branch Agencies dealing with China and establishing a Tibet section within the U.S Embassy in Beijing. The bill also requires the Secretary of State to seek to establish a U.S. consulate in Lhasa. Introduced in May 2009, the bill passed the House in June 2009 and was referred to the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations. The American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009 requires an annual report on China and India's greenhouse gas emissions standards. The bill was introduced in May 2009, passed by the House in June 2009, and received in the Senate in July 2009. H.R. 3012, The Trade Act of 2009, calls for a review of existing trade agreements. H.R. 3081, Department of State, Foreign Operations, was also introduced in June 2009. H.R. 3081 (Lowey) Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2010 authorizes funds for expenses related to China and Tibet, including support for projects preserving Tibet's culture and environment. It also prohibits funds for export licenses for U.S. satellites to be launched in China without prior notification and imposes funding restrictions on activities of the People's Liberation Army. The House passed H.R. 3237 on July 9, 2009, requiring certification before any agreement with China on space programs. The bill was introduced on July 16, 2009, and referred to the House Committee on the Judiciary. H.R. 4094 (Melancon) Drywall Victims Insurance Protection Act of 2009 prohibits insurers from cancelling homeowners insurance for homes with toxic Chinese drywall. Introduced on November 17, 2009, and referred to the House Committee on Financial Services. H.Con.Res. 18 (Linder) expresses Congress's desire to resume diplomatic relations with Taiwan and abandon the \"One-China Policy.\" Introduced on January 9, 2009, and referred to the House Foreign Affairs Committee. H.Con.Res. 55 (Berkley) recognizes the 30th anniversary of the Taiwan Relations Act. Introduced on February 23, 2009, and referred to the House Foreign Affairs Committee and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. The House passed several resolutions in 2009 condemning actions by the People's Republic of China, including incidents in the South China Sea and criticizing their business practices. These resolutions were referred to the House Foreign Affairs Committee. Several resolutions were introduced in 2009 by the House Foreign Affairs Committee, condemning China's actions and calling for transparency and freedom of expression on the Internet. The House Foreign Affairs Committee introduced resolutions in 2009 condemning China's actions and calling for transparency and freedom of expression on the Internet. One resolution urges non-participating countries, including China, to cooperate with U.N. Security Council resolutions to prevent dangerous exports from North Korea. Another resolution calls on China to adhere to its Human Rights Action Plan and expresses support for Chinese activists seeking answers for parents of children killed in the Sichuan earthquake. The Secretary of the Treasury and the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development were tasked with addressing issues related to Chinese drywall. President Obama's state visit to China began on 11/15/09. The Dalai Lama visited the US without meeting President Obama, as their meeting was postponed until after the President's trip to China. Premier Wen Jiabao visited North Korea on 10/04/09, while the PRC celebrated its 60th anniversary on 10/01/09 with a military parade. Beijing announced easing restrictions on foreign investments in the culture industry on 09/26/09. On 09/25/09, Taiwan denied a visa for Uighur activist Rebiya Kadeer, citing fears of terrorist links.
