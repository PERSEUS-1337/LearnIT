    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 42356 of the Public Resources Code is amended to include definitions related to ASTM standards for compostable and biodegradable plastics. ASTM stands for ASTM International, formerly known as the American Society for Testing and Materials. The ASTM standard specifications listed include D6400 for compostable plastics, D7081 for non-floating biodegradable plastics in the marine environment, and D6868 for biodegradable plastics used as coatings on paper and other compostable substrates. The curr_chunk provides definitions related to ASTM standards for compostable and biodegradable plastics, including definitions for terms such as \"Department,\" \"Manufacturer,\" and \"Plastic product.\" It also defines \"OK home compost\" as conformity with a specific certification. The curr_chunk provides definitions related to consumer products, packaging components, plastic products, suppliers, and Vincotte certification. It also amends Section 42357 of the Public Resources Code. Section 42357 of the Public Resources Code is amended to restrict the sale of plastic products labeled as \"compostable,\" \"home compostable,\" or \"marine degradable\" in California unless they meet specific ASTM standards or Vincotte OK Compost HOME certification. Compliance with only a portion of an ASTM standard does not qualify. Exceptions are allowed if the product meets relevant standards adopted by the department. Plastic products labeled as \"home compostable\" must hold a Vincotte OK Compost HOME certificate, unless ASTM standard is adopted or department standard is met. In California, it is prohibited to sell plastic products labeled as \"biodegradable,\" \"degradable,\" or \"decomposable,\" implying they will break down in a landfill. Manufacturers must provide compliance information to the public upon request. Compliance with this regulation does not automatically mean compliance with other marketing requirements. The director may adopt an ASTM standard for aerobically biodegradable plastics in soil environment. Commercial agricultural mulch film labeled as \"soil biodegradable\" must meet the adopted ASTM standard. Commercial agricultural mulch film refers to plastic film used in commercial farming."
