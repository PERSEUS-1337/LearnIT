    "content": "The federal government utilizes various policy tools to promote innovative clean energy technologies, such as clean energy mandates, carbon taxes, cap and trade, environmental regulations, loan guarantees, grants, and tax expenditures. Legislation in 2005 and 2009 expanded the Department of Energy's loan guarantee authority for clean energy projects. The bankruptcy of Solyndra in 2011 led to scrutiny of the loan guarantee program. The report analyzes goals and concerns regarding the use of loan guarantees to support clean energy technologies. Loan guarantees reduce lender's risk by federal government pledging to repay in case of borrower default. Various policy options for Congress to consider are discussed. 14 federal agencies manage 68 loan guarantee accounts with $1.9 trillion in outstanding loans in 2010. In 2010, there were $1.9 trillion in outstanding primary guaranteed loans, including home purchase loan guarantees designed to be actuarially sound by charging insurance fees to cover operating costs and probable losses. Loan guarantees have been used for higher risk borrowers like students or low-income families, with the government bearing a portion of the default risk. The Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 (FCRA) mandated an accrual accounting approach for budget reporting of loan guarantees, requiring the net present value of subsidy costs to be reported. This was in response to concerns about budgetary reporting accuracy and the need to account for expected losses associated with loan guarantee programs. The Office of Management and Budget provides guidance for calculating credit subsidy costs for loan guarantee programs, which have been used for large energy and infrastructure projects. These programs may not be actuarially sound due to limited project pools, leading to credit subsidy costs being covered by federally appropriated funds. Congress controls federal loan guarantee programs by appropriating funds for credit subsidy costs. Congress can appropriate funds to pay for credit subsidy costs, limiting federally supported loan guarantees once the appropriation is exhausted. Additionally, Congress can set volume limits for loan guarantee programs, such as capping the total value of loans at $20 billion. Loan guarantee authorizations for alternative energy technologies date back to the 1970s, with laws like the Geothermal Energy Research, Development, and Demonstration Act of 1974 and the Energy Security Act of 1980 authorizing funds for demonstration facilities. The Energy Security Act of 1980 (P.L. 96-294) authorized $20 billion for a domestic synthetic fuels industry through loans, loan guarantees, and joint ventures. The U.S. Synthetic Fuels Corporation (SFC) was established to oversee the projects, including the Great Plains coal gasification project in North Dakota, which received a $2.02 billion federal loan guarantee. However, due to energy price declines in the mid-1980s, the project faced financial challenges. The Great Plains project defaulted on its loan in August 1985 and was sold to Basin Electric for $85 million. Basin Electric now operates the facility through its subsidiary, Dakota Gasification Company. The Energy Security Act of 1980 created the Office of Alcohol Fuels, which guaranteed loans for alcohol fuel projects totaling $265 million. The DOE loan guarantee programs were established to support innovative clean energy technologies, with some projects facing challenges such as refinancing, technology complications, and ceasing operations. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 led to the creation of DOE's Loan Programs Office (LPO) to administer these initiatives. Loan guarantees for clean energy technologies are a small but growing part of federal loans and guarantees. Title XVII of EPACT 2005 established a loan guarantee program for innovative energy technologies, including renewable energy systems, advanced fossil energy technologies, and advanced nuclear technologies. The Department of Energy can provide loan guarantees for projects that are not yet commercially available, with costs covered by appropriated funds or the borrower. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 modified Title XVII of EPACT 2005 by establishing a temporary loan guarantee program for renewable energy and electricity transmission systems. It included a $6 billion appropriation to pay for subsidy costs, which was later reduced to $2.435 billion. The Department of Energy established the Loan Programs Office (LPO) to administer federal credit programs for innovative energy technologies. LPO offers loan guarantees for clean energy technologies with varying degrees of technology risk and direct loans to support advanced technology vehicles. As of December 2011, LPO has finalized loan guarantee commitments for 27 projects under the Section 1705 program totaling $16.15 billion, and issued conditional loan guarantee commitments for four projects under the Section 1703 program totaling $10.6 billion. The Section 1705 loan guarantee program has a total loan guarantee value of approximately $10.6 billion. Two types of financing activities can be supported: new technology deployment and project finance. New technology deployment projects involve building new manufacturing facilities for innovative energy technologies, while project finance projects use established technologies to generate electricity for third parties. New technology deployment projects are considered higher risk due to external factors, while project finance projects typically have lower risk. The Section 1705 loan guarantee program supports new technology deployment and project finance projects in the clean energy sector. Project finance projects have lower risk profiles due to contractual mechanisms, but their financial risk can vary based on technology type and other factors. The program aims to provide access to low-cost capital for projects that may face technology and market risks, with the goal of achieving certain policy objectives. The Section 1705 loan guarantee program supports clean energy technology deployment and project finance projects. Federal incentives can support various stages of technology commercialization, but the focus is on system scale-up and commercial deployment due to high risks and capital requirements. Loan guarantees can provide low-cost capital to support the commercialization of new renewable energy technologies, especially during the costly system scale-up and commercial deployment stages. This financial support helps bridge the gap known as the \"valley of death\" that new technologies face as they move from demonstration to market. Global renewable energy use is expected to grow, with the International Energy Agency estimating that electricity generation from renewable sources will increase from 3% in 2009 to around 15% by 2035. To achieve this, an estimated $6 trillion investment in renewable electricity generation is needed by 2035. Loan guarantees for renewable energy technology manufacturers could provide low-cost financial capital to incentivize the build-out of U.S. renewable energy manufacturing capacity. Loan guarantees for renewable energy technology manufacturers could lead to the expansion of U.S. renewable energy manufacturing capacity, potentially creating job opportunities. The DOE's Loan Programs Office estimates that fully committed Section 1705 loan guarantees could result in approximately 14,300 construction jobs and 2,400 permanent jobs. These jobs are essential for operating projects over their lifetimes and could contribute to the growth of new industries in the global marketplace. The DOE's Loan Programs Office estimates that loan guarantees for renewable energy projects could create job opportunities, with potential job growth in new industries. The deployment of clean energy technologies could support greenhouse gas reduction goals by increasing electricity generation from low carbon sources. Direct emission reductions from DOE-supported projects may be modest due to the scale of the U.S. energy industry, but indirect reductions could be significant if clean energy projects are successful. The DOE's Loan Programs Office provides loan guarantees for large-scale clean energy projects, supporting the development of domestic supply chains for clean energy technologies. This may help U.S. companies compete in the global clean energy market. However, there are concerns about the effectiveness of federal loan guarantees as an incentive for clean energy projects. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) released a background paper in 1978 on concerns about loan guarantees for new energy technologies. Companies using federal government-backed loans must repay principal and interest based on a defined schedule, with conditions requiring minimum cash levels. Managing cash flow is crucial for development stage companies to survive and operate effectively. The use of loans to finance new technology deployment in development-stage companies can lead to increased cash flow demands and liquidity challenges, potentially resulting in a high risk of loan default. These companies often lack an established commercial presence and spend significant amounts on developing core business operations, including sales force, marketing, and distribution channels. Additionally, they may sell products at a loss to achieve production economies of scale. Using a loan to finance a corporate asset like a manufacturing facility during the development phase can increase cash flow demand and the risk of default. Loan guarantees may push companies towards debt funding instead of equity investments, as seen with Solyndra's high cash flow demands and operating losses from 2005 to 2009. Solar market conditions further worsened their cash flow situation after finalizing a loan guarantee agreement in September 2009. The example of Solyndra's default in 2010 due to cash flow issues highlights the challenges faced by development stage companies in servicing debt obligations during market uncertainty. Financing renewable electricity projects with loan guarantees may be less risky due to long-term contracts providing stable revenue and positive cash flow. Some critics question the need for federal loan guarantees for clean energy projects with stable revenue and positive cash flow. Default risk exists due to technology and operational costs. Federally guaranteed loans may require less cash than commercial loans, but can still burden early-stage companies. The federal government's role differs from corporate entities like banks and private equity firms. Loan guarantees are federal commitments to repay certain loans if the borrower defaults, with the government risking an amount equal to the loan's principal. Consideration of how such policies benefit the federal government, the country, and citizens is important when using taxpayer dollars for financial incentive programs. The federal government risks an amount equal to the loan's principal in loan guarantees, with potential financial return being essentially zero. The loan may be issued by a commercial debt provider or the Federal Financing Bank, with low interest rates. The government may use interest received from federally guaranteed loans to pay down Treasury debt. Potential benefits like job creation, a larger tax base, and increased exports are not accounted for in financial return calculations. The federal government assumes all risks associated with loan defaults under the Section 1705 Loan Guarantee Program for renewable energy projects, with a payback period of 20-30 years. Charging \"credit subsidy costs\" to projects helps mitigate risks, but under Section 1705, all costs are covered by appropriated funds. The benefits of the project are difficult to quantify accurately and are not included in this analysis. The borrower typically has a payback period of 20-30 years for loans with periodic principal and interest payments. Loan guarantees can cover the entire loan duration, especially for corporate finance supporting new technology projects. Innovation in renewable energy technology is rapidly evolving through venture capital investments and government programs like the Department of Energy's SunShot Initiative aiming to decrease solar energy costs by 75%. Future innovations could make current technologies obsolete. Energy technology innovations could potentially render current technologies obsolete, leading to commercial viability risks and technology obsolescence in renewable energy markets. This poses a challenge for long-term loan guarantee commitments for renewable energy projects, increasing the government's risk of principal losses from loan defaults. Federally managed loan guarantee programs for clean energy projects must perform banking-like functions, including financial and market analysis, to ensure sound financing decisions. Government-managed loan guarantee programs face challenges due to temporary nature, project evaluation delays, and lack of control over project finance variables. Pre-defined deadlines and a desire for quick funding may lead to supporting projects that are not the best choices. Government-managed loan guarantee programs may not always support the best projects due to project evaluation delays and a rush for quick funding. If Congress debates the use of loan guarantees for clean energy deployment, various policy options could be considered. One option is to provide grants for innovative clean energy technologies to incentivize their commercialization and deployment. Instead of using loan guarantees, Congress could fund a grant program to support the commercialization of new energy technologies. This program could require projects to secure all necessary funding before receiving grants. Tax incentives like production and investment tax credits could also be used to encourage the deployment of clean energy technologies without repayment obligations. In practice, different incentive mechanisms may be more useful depending on market characteristics and the financial credit environment. Using grants and tax expenditures as incentives could limit the federal government's exposure to project failures. Congress could explore setting up a structure for the government to assume equity positions in innovative clean energy technologies and projects, which may be more appropriate than loans for high-risk technology deployment. Equity positions in clean energy technologies could be more suitable than loans for technology commercialization. They can help manage cash flow demands and allow the government to benefit from successful projects. This approach would require the government to operate like a venture capital firm, taking on high-risk investments with the goal of overall success outweighing failures. Congress could establish a clean energy venture capital entity to invest in innovative technologies. The federal government's potential involvement in investing in clean energy technologies raises concerns about assuming a venture capital-like function and controlling industry. However, equity positions are not unprecedented, as seen in financial support provided to auto companies and banks. If Congress continues using loan guarantees for clean energy deployment, flexible financial management tools may be considered. Financial management tools like warrants and portfolio management could be used by federal loan programs to balance risk and recover credit subsidy costs. These tools aim to ensure that gains from successful projects offset losses from others, particularly in innovative clean energy technology loan guarantees. Innovative clean energy technology loan guarantees could benefit from a portfolio management approach and financial tools like warrants to reduce financial risk. Congress could also consider using convertible preferred equity to fund projects, where the government receives a controlling equity position initially and converts it to debt once the project generates positive cash flow for repayment. The federal government could convert preferred equity into debt for projects to ensure adequate debt service and management control during start-up. This approach incentivizes positive cash flow, offers a reasonable repayment schedule, and may reduce cash flow demand initially. However, concerns about government control exist. Creating an organization to manage federal financial support for clean energy technologies could be a policy option to consider. A new organization could be established within an existing federal agency or as an independent body to manage clean energy deployment investments. The Department of Energy or the U.S. Treasury could be considered as potential locations for this organization. The Clean Energy Financing Act of 2011 proposes the creation of a Clean Energy Deployment program. The Clean Energy Financing Act of 2011 (S. 1510) proposes creating a Clean Energy Deployment Administration (CEDA) within the Department of Energy. CEDA would use financial tools like direct loans, loan guarantees, and insurance to support clean energy technology. The bill allows for portfolio management and alternative fee arrangements to manage financial risk and reduce upfront cash fees."
