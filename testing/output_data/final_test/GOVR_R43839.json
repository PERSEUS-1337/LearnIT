    "content": "In the mid-1990s, six states challenged the federal government's failure to control illegal immigration, resulting in losses for the states in court. The courts discussed various constitutional and statutory claims, including those based on the U.S. Constitution's clauses and the Tenth Amendment. Several states argued that the federal government's alleged failure to enforce immigration laws was unconstitutional. Several states claimed that the federal government's failure to enforce immigration laws imposed disproportionate costs on them, which the government was obligated to reimburse under the Naturalization Clause. This clause grants Congress the power to establish a uniform rule of naturalization. The states argued that if the effects of immigration are not uniform, the government has a duty to compensate disproportionately affected states. However, the U.S. Courts of Appeals found that Congress's power over immigration may not be co-extensive with its power over naturalization. The U.S. Courts of Appeals for the Second, Third, and Ninth Circuits ruled that the federal government is not obligated to reimburse states for costs related to unauthorized aliens or protect them from harm by non-governmental third parties. The courts also rejected claims that the government violated the Guarantee Clause by not compensating states for immigration-related expenditures. The states argued that the federal government deprived them of a republican form of government by making them spend money on unauthorized aliens. However, this argument was rejected by multiple Circuits, citing that Guarantee Clause violations are nonjusticiable political questions. The courts also noted that the state's form of government remained unchanged despite the expenditures. The courts rejected claims that the federal government's alleged failure to enforce immigration laws violated the Invasion Clause, stating that the legislative and executive branches are responsible for enforcement. They also found that the states were not threatened by incursions, making the Invasion Clause inapplicable. The federal government's alleged violation of the Tenth Amendment by \"forcing\" states to provide public benefits to unauthorized aliens was uniformly rejected by multiple Circuits. Courts found that conditions for Medicaid spending were permissible under Congress's spending power, and the costs of incarcerating unauthorized aliens were incurred under state law. The courts rejected claims of commandeering by the federal government in regards to providing public benefits to unauthorized aliens. They found that states were obligated to provide education to unauthorized alien children based on the Constitution, not federal commands. Additionally, the states' claims of federal officials violating specific provisions of the INA were unsuccessful. The provisions in support of claims regarding immigration control include Section 103(a)(5) of the INA, former Section 1252(a)(2)(A) of Title 8, former Section 1252(c) of Title 8, former Section 1252(l) of Title 8, and Section 276 of the INA, which establishes criminal penalties. Section 276 of the INA establishes criminal penalties for \"illegal reentry\" into the United States after removal, and Section 1365 of Title 8 provides for reimbursement of costs incurred by states for imprisoning unauthorized aliens or Cuban nationals convicted of felonies. States' claims were deemed not reviewable by courts as matters of agency discretion, with statutes using the word \"shall\" without appellate court clarification on its mandatory nature. The appellate court found that federal officials' alleged failure to enforce immigration laws did not constitute an \"abdication\" of their responsibilities, citing the Supreme Court's 1985 decision in Heckler v. Chaney which allows for judicial review in cases of extreme nonenforcement policies. The federal courts of appeals did not consider the federal government's immigration enforcement policies in the mid-1990s as an abdication of duty, as they believed the states were questioning the effectiveness of these policies. Arizona later challenged the federal government's alleged failure to enforce immigration laws in 2011 during litigation over S.B. 1070. Arizona passed S.B. 1070 to prevent aliens from settling by requiring state and local police to check immigration status. The federal government tried to stop enforcement, leading to Arizona alleging violations of the Constitution and federal law. Arizona alleged that federal officials failed to comply with mandates regarding operational control of the Arizona-Mexico border, removal of unauthorized aliens, and reimbursement for detaining criminal aliens. The federal government challenged Arizona's standing, but the court presumed standing based on the influence of federal policies on unauthorized aliens crossing into Arizona. The federal court found that Arizona's claims regarding federal policies influencing unauthorized aliens crossing into Arizona were precluded or settled in favor of the federal government. Arizona's constitutional claim alleging a violation of the Domestic Violence Clause was also dismissed based on Ninth Circuit precedent. The court deemed the Domestic Violence Clause to involve nonjusticiable political questions. The federal district court found that Arizona's statutory claims were not reviewable as they involved actions committed to agency discretion by law, specifically related to immigration law provisions directing the Secretary of Homeland Security to maintain operational control over the U.S. border and prioritize the incarceration of unauthorized \"criminal aliens.\" The court concluded that provisions related to immigration law involve actions committed to agency discretion by law, citing instances where statutes grant federal officials substantial discretion in determining actions such as building fencing and developing programs to prevent illegal immigration. The court did not address the use of \"shall\" in the statutes or whether it indicated mandatory action. Arizona's challenged actions were deemed not an abdication of Executive responsibilities as federal officials continued to enforce immigration laws based on federal priorities. Arizona's disagreement with these priorities did not constitute abdication. In 2012, Mississippi joined a challenge against the Obama Administration's DACA initiative, claiming it violated the Take Care Clause and impinged on Congress's legislative powers.ICE agents and Mississippi argued that the initiative contradicted certain provisions in the INA and the APA. The ICE agents and Mississippi challenged the DACA initiative, alleging violations of the APA and certain provisions in the INA. They argued that DACA, which provided deferred action to unauthorized aliens brought to the US as children, went against key INA provisions regarding admission and inspection of aliens. The court found that ICE agents lacked jurisdiction over their claims regarding the INA provisions. The Fifth Circuit suggested that Section 235 of the INA may not prevent the Executive from granting deferred action to unauthorized aliens. Mississippi was found to lack standing due to its alleged injury being deemed too speculative. The federal government argued that Mississippi lacked standing to sue over the costs associated with unauthorized aliens due to DACA and Obama Administration guidance on prosecutorial discretion. The district court agreed, stating Mississippi's evidence was based on outdated information and lacked sufficient proof of causation. The Fifth Circuit affirmed the district court's decision on Mississippi's standing regarding DACA. Mississippi's alleged injury was deemed \"purely speculative\" as there was no evidence showing increased costs. A concurring opinion stated that concrete evidence of injury is not necessary for standing in certain claims. Over 25 states challenged the expansion of the DACA program in December 2014. The DACA program expansion and creation of a DAPA program for unauthorized alien parents of U.S. citizens/LPRs are being challenged by states for violating constitutional principles, federal immigration law, and APA requirements. The federal government argues against these claims, stating lack of standing and enforcement discretion immunity. A court decision in February 2015 allowed states to challenge the programs and imposed a preliminary nationwide ban on their implementation. The court imposed a preliminary nationwide ban on the DACA program expansion and creation of a DAPA program after finding that the memorandum establishing the programs was issued without proper notice-and-comment procedures. The federal government's motion to stay the injunction was denied, and the Fifth Circuit rejected their request for a stay pending appeal. The Fifth Circuit rejected the federal government's request for a stay on the preliminary nationwide ban of the DACA program expansion and DAPA program. The court found that the states have standing to challenge the programs, they are subject to judicial review, and their establishment should have gone through notice-and-comment rulemaking. The Fifth Circuit rejected the federal government's request for a stay on the preliminary nationwide ban of the DACA program expansion and DAPA program. The Supreme Court affirmed the Fifth Circuit's decision without providing an opinion or voting alignment, keeping the ban in place for now. The district court is still considering whether to permanently enjoin the implementation of these programs. The Fifth Circuit affirmed the district court's decision on standing, reviewability, and rulemaking for the DACA and DAPA programs. Texas met the requirements for constitutional and prudential standing, with the court noting the state's potential concrete injury if DAPA is implemented. The Fifth Circuit affirmed the district court's decision on standing, reviewability, and rulemaking for the DACA and DAPA programs. Texas's interest in denying public benefits to \"illegal aliens\" falls within the \"zone of interests\" regulated by the INA. The majority concluded that it can review DAPA and the DACA expansion. The dissent raised separation of powers concerns regarding the court's authority to review these programs. The Fifth Circuit affirmed the district court's decision on standing, reviewability, and rulemaking for the DACA and DAPA programs. The majority concluded that it can review DAPA and the DACA expansion to determine if the Executive exceeded its statutory powers by granting lawful presence and work authorization to aliens in violation of immigration laws. The dissent disagreed, arguing that deferred action beneficiaries' ability to apply for work authorization is not solely due to DAPA. The majority also upheld the district court's ruling that DAPA and the DACA expansion should have undergone notice-and-comment rulemaking. The majority affirmed the district court's decision on standing, reviewability, and rulemaking for the DACA and DAPA programs. It found that DAPA and the DACA expansion violate the APA substantively and procedurally, as they exceed statutory authority and are not in accordance with the law. The majority affirmed the district court's decision that DAPA and the DACA expansion violate the APA substantively and procedurally, as they exceed statutory authority and are not in accordance with the law. The majority noted Fifth Circuit precedent allowing affirmation of a judgment on any supported grounds and found that Congress has spoken on the issues of lawful entry, relief from removal, and work authorization, precluding DAPA and DACA expansion. The majority found that DAPA and DACA expansion violate the APA as they exceed statutory authority and are not in accordance with the law. They noted that Congress has spoken on lawful entry, relief from removal, and work authorization, precluding DAPA and DACA expansion. The Executive's interpretation was deemed \"unreasonable\" and \"manifestly contrary\" to INA provisions. The majority found that DAPA and DACA expansion violate the APA as they exceed statutory authority and are not in accordance with the law. They noted the \"major policy\" exception to Chevron deference and rejected the argument that historical practices justify DAPA and DACA expansion. The dissenting judge disagreed with reaching the question of APA violation. The Supreme Court's 4-4 split in United States v. Texas upholds the Fifth Circuit decision on a preliminary nationwide ban on DAPA and DACA implementation. The 2015 litigation in Texas marked the first time a state obtained a court order directing the federal government to delay implementing DAPA and DACA expansion. This decision could complicate future executive actions on immigration, limiting states' ability to challenge federal enforcement failures. The 2015 Texas litigation presented unique circumstances that allowed Texas to challenge DAPA and DACA expansion based on the costs of issuing driver's licenses to beneficiaries. This could limit the relevance of the decision for future state challenges to federal immigration enforcement. The costs in the 2015 Texas litigation were argued to be due to state law or the Constitution, not the federal government's actions. Mississippi's injury in the Crane litigation was deemed inadequate for standing as it did not show increased costs from DACA. Claims in the mid-1990s failed because states incurred costs from grant conditions, state laws, or constitutional requirements, not federal government dictates. The federal government's alleged failure to enforce immigration laws in 2015 involved granting deferred action to certain unauthorized individuals. The district court and the majority of the Fifth Circuit found that granting deferred action to certain unauthorized aliens could make them eligible for benefits like work authorization and Social Security numbers. They emphasized that this form of nonenforcement of immigration laws is subject to judicial review as it involves affirmative action by the Executive, not just enforcement priorities. The courts stated that enforcement priorities and nonenforcement as to individuals are within the Executive's discretion and not subject to judicial review. The court suggested that immigration officials could designate potential DAPA beneficiaries as \"low priorities\" for removal by providing them with written documentation, as long as it does not involve granting deferred action."
