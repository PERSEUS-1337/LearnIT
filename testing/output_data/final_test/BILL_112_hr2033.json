    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Psoriasis and Psoriatic Arthritis Research, Cure, and Care Act of 2011\". Psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis are chronic, inflammatory diseases affecting approximately 7.5 million individuals in the United States. Despite their impact on quality of life, they are often overlooked and misunderstood. Psoriasis is often misunderstood and categorized as a cosmetic issue rather than a medically necessary one. It is linked to an increased risk of serious conditions such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, stroke, cancer, atherosclerosis, COPD, Crohn's disease, lymphoma, metabolic syndrome, liver disease, and psoriatic arthritis. The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) funded a study showing that psoriasis can lead to significant physical and mental disability, comparable to major chronic diseases like cancer, arthritis, and depression. Psoriasis is linked to higher rates of depression, anxiety, and suicidality, with individuals being twice as likely to have suicidal thoughts. Severe psoriasis increases the risk of premature death by 50%, resulting in individuals with severe psoriasis dying four years earlier on average. The economic impact of psoriasis is significant, with total healthcare costs estimated at $11.25 billion. People with psoriasis have higher healthcare utilization and costs compared to the general population. Early diagnosis and treatment of psoriatic arthritis can help prevent joint damage. Treating psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis is important. Treating psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis is challenging due to varying treatment success and side effects. Despite recent breakthroughs, many patients still struggle with ineffective or inaccessible treatments. Psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis are significant health issues that require comprehensive care. Psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis are significant national health issues that require a comprehensive and coordinated response from States and the Federal Government, involving healthcare providers, patients, and public health communities. SEC. 3. NATIONAL PSORIASIS AND PSORIATIC ARTHRITIS DATA COLLECTION. The Secretary of Health and Human Services can collect data on psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, including prevalence, age of onset, quality of life, healthcare utilization, disease burden, costs, and health disparities. The Secretary of Health and Human Services can collect data on psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, including demographics, comorbidities, and the development of a patient registry. $1,500,000 is authorized for each fiscal year from 2012 to 2017 for this purpose. Sense of Congress for collaborative interdisciplinary research on psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, and comorbid conditions. The Congress acknowledges the progress in psoriasis research, praises the planning of a scientific meeting in 2012, and encourages continued collaboration with the National Institutes of Health. The Congress acknowledges progress in psoriasis research and encourages collaboration with the National Institutes of Health. Stakeholders should disseminate findings and recommendations from scientific meetings to relevant entities for future research directions. The Congress encourages the development of a virtual Center of Excellence for Collaborative Discovery in Psoriasis and Comorbid Research to share and leverage public and private sector findings on psoriasis and its related conditions."
