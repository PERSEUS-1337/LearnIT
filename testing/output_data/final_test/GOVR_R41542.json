    "content": "Federal campaign finance law has a long history of regulating money in elections to prevent corruption and inform voters. Restrictions on private money, including large contributions, have been a consistent theme. The roles of corporations, unions, interest groups, and individuals in funding campaigns have been closely monitored. Congress has required public disclosure of campaign financial transactions. Three key principles\u2014limits on funding sources, contribution limits, and financial disclosure\u2014have shaped federal campaign finance policy. Legislation has been periodically enacted throughout the 20th century. Since the 1990s, momentum on federal campaign finance policy has increased, with major legislative action remaining rare. The Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act (BCRA) in 2002 largely banned unregulated soft money in federal elections and restricted funding sources for pre-election broadcast advertising. Regulatory developments at the Federal Election Commission (FEC) and court cases have stirred controversy and renewed attention to campaign finance issues. Congress has explored legislative options and made minor amendments to campaign finance law, with notable changes in 2014. In 2014, Congress made significant changes to campaign finance law, eliminating public financing for presidential nominating conventions and increasing contribution limits to political parties. Recent notable developments in campaign finance have also occurred at the Supreme Court, including the landmark Citizens United ruling in 2010 and the SpeechNow.org v. FEC decision allowing for the formation of \"super PACs.\" The report provides an overview of major policy issues facing Congress related to campaign finance, including the impact of significant litigation such as Citizens United and SpeechNow.org v. FEC. It highlights the rarity of major changes in campaign finance law despite numerous bills introduced since the 1970s. The report will be periodically updated as events warrant. Major changes in campaign finance law have been rare since the 1970s, with the Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA) and BCRA being the most prominent statutes. Anti-corruption themes have been consistently evident in federal campaign finance law, aiming to limit corruption and increase voter information through limiting sources and amounts of financial contributions and requiring disclosure about contributions and expenditures. Modern campaign finance law, shaped in the 1970s through the Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA), allows candidates and political committees to spend unlimited amounts on campaigns, as long as funds are not coordinated with others. FECA, enacted in 1971 and amended in subsequent years, remains the foundation of the nation's campaign finance law, mandating reporting requirements similar to those in place today. The 1974 amendments to the Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA), enacted in response to the Watergate scandal, placed contribution and spending limits on campaigns and established the FEC. The landmark Buckley v. Valeo (1976) ruling declared mandatory spending limits unconstitutional and led to the reconstitution of the FEC and new contribution limits through the 1976 FECA amendments. The 1976 FECA amendments established new contribution limits, simplified reporting requirements, and addressed PAC and presidential public financing issues. The 1970s focused on setting limits on contributions and expenditures, creating a disclosure regime, and forming the FEC. In the 1980s and 1990s, debates centered on interest groups, especially PACs, and later shifted to loopholes in FECA, such as soft money and issue advocacy. Before the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act (BCRA), debates in the 1980s and 1990s focused on interest groups, PACs, and loopholes in FECA like soft money and issue advocacy. Soft money, unregulated by campaign finance laws, came from prohibited sources and went to party committees for activities indirectly supporting elections. Issue advocacy, outside FECA regulation, praised or criticized candidates without explicitly calling for their election or defeat. BCRA banned raising soft money in federal elections and implemented other reforms. The Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act (BCRA) banned raising soft money in federal elections, increased contribution limits, and restricted pre-election issue advocacy. The act's electioneering communications provision prohibited corporations and unions from airing broadcast ads referring to federal candidates within specific timeframes. After BCRA, federal campaign finance policy issues shifted to the FEC and courts, with notable events including the Supreme Court upholding most provisions in McConnell v. FEC and subsequent rulings declaring aspects unconstitutional in specific circumstances. The FEC has undertaken rulemakings related to BCRA and other topics since 2002, with some being lengthy and controversial. Congress enacted additional amendments to campaign finance law, including the 2007 Honest Leadership and Open Government Act (HLOGA) which placed new disclosure requirements on lobbyists' campaign contributions and restricted campaign travel aboard private aircraft. In 2014, Congress raised limits for contributions to political parties. The discussion focuses on enduring topics in the current policy environment, starting with changes influenced by Citizens United. The Supreme Court's 2010 decision in Citizens United v. FEC allowed corporations and unions to use treasury funds for political advertisements and related purchases supporting or opposing candidates. The DISCLOSE Act was considered by Congress following the Citizens United decision, aiming to increase transparency in corporate and union spending on political advertising. The House passed H.R. 5175, but the Senate did not invoke cloture on the companion bill. The DISCLOSE Act was considered by Congress in 2010, with the House passing H.R. 5175 but the Senate failing to invoke cloture on companion bill S. 3628. Despite some progress in the 111th Congress, subsequent versions of the bill in later Congresses did not advance significantly. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia ruled in SpeechNow.org v. FEC that super PACs can accept unlimited contributions for independent expenditures. Existing reporting requirements apply to super PACs, and other forms of unlimited fundraising were also permitted after Citizens United and SpeechNow. After the SpeechNow ruling, nonconnected PACs can accept unlimited contributions for independent expenditures by keeping the funds in a separate bank account. Super PACs remain influential in politics due to restrictions on traditional PACs qualifying for unlimited fundraising exemptions. The FEC issued advisory opinions to implement the Citizens United and SpeechNow decisions. After the SpeechNow ruling, nonconnected PACs can accept unlimited contributions for independent expenditures. The FEC issued advisory opinions within months of recognizing corporate independent expenditures and super PACs. Despite progress, final rules on post-Citizens United AOs took years to agree upon. In 2014, the commission approved rules to remove invalidated spending prohibitions without requiring additional disclosure on independent spending. The Supreme Court invalidated aggregate contribution limits in McCutcheon v. FEC on April 2, 2014. Individual contribution limits were capped at $123,200 for 2013-2014, with $48,600 going to candidates and $74,600 to parties and PACs. Following McCutcheon, individuals can contribute to as many candidates as they wish as long as they adhere to base contribution limits. Congress raised the statutory limit on some campaign contributions in December 2014. In December 2014, Congress raised contribution limits to national political party committees under the FY2015 omnibus appropriations law, P.L. 113-235. Individuals could contribute at least $813,600 annually to a national party committee in 2017-2018, with PACs also able to make larger contributions. New accounts were established for party conventions, facilities, and legal matters. Contributions to multicandidate PACs increased significantly, with contributions to national parties rising from $45,000 to at least $360,000 annually. Public financing for presidential nominating conventions was terminated in 2014, leading to the 2016 conventions being funded entirely by private money. A Supreme Court decision in 2011 also had implications for state-level and federal candidates. The Supreme Court issued a 5-4 opinion invalidating portions of Arizona's public financing program for state-level candidates. The decision, authored by Chief Justice Roberts, found that the state's use of matching funds unconstitutionally burdened privately financed candidates' free speech. This ruling has implications for state-level public financing programs and may impact future federal proposals for restructuring presidential and congressional public financing programs. The Office of Law Revision Counsel moved FECA and other federal election laws to Title 52 of the U.S. Code in 2014. Congress amended FECA in 2019 to require Senate political committees to file campaign finance reports with the FEC. This change does not mandate electronic filing but affects the filing location. The Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA) requires all political committee reports to be filed electronically with the FEC, except for those with less than $50,000 of annual activity. Corporations and unions are still prohibited from making contributions in federal elections, but PACs affiliated with them can contribute to candidates, parties, and other PACs. Additionally, corporations and unions can use their treasury funds for electioneering communications and independent expenditures, which are not considered contributions under FECA. The ban on using soft money in federal elections, including large contributions to national party committees for \"party building\" activities, remains in effect. In December 2014, Congress enacted legislation (P.L. 113-235) allowing larger contributions to political parties, subject to contribution limits and disclosure requirements. Some argue these contributions resemble soft money, while others see them as necessary for parties to compete with super PACs. Despite Citizens United's impact on independent expenditures, the ban on corporate and union treasury contributions in federal campaigns remains in place. The FEC has not issued rules regarding super PACs, but in July 2011, it stated that federal candidates and party officials could solicit funds for super PACs within FECA limits. Nonconnected PACs can raise unlimited funds for independent expenditures if kept in a separate bank account. Post-McCutcheon, aggregate contribution limits no longer apply. Post-McCutcheon, aggregate contribution limits no longer apply, allowing individuals to contribute more than $2,700 per candidate, per election during the 2018 cycle. Disclosure requirements under FECA and BCRA remain intact, requiring political committees to report information on receipts, expenditures, contributions exceeding $200, and expenses purpose. Independent expenditures and electioneering communications must also be disclosed. Independent expenditures and electioneering communications by party committees and PACs have additional reporting obligations. Expenditures over $10,000 must be reported within 48 hours, while those over $1,000 require 24-hour reporting before elections. Donor information is required for expenditures over $200 or $1,000 for communications. 501(c) or 527 organizations must report these activities to the FEC. The 115th Congress changed the filing format for Senate political committees. The 115th Congress changed the filing format for Senate political committees, but did not substantially alter campaign finance law. Enacted appropriations measures also impacted campaign finance policy. H.R. 133 would terminate the presidential public financing program and transfer remaining funds to a pediatric research fund and the U.S. Treasury for deficit reduction. H.R. 634 was also ordered favorably by the Committee on House Administration. The 115th Congress made changes to Senate political committee filing formats but did not significantly alter campaign finance laws. H.R. 634, ordered favorably by the Committee on House Administration, would terminate the Election Assistance Commission and transfer some election administration functions to the Federal Election Commission. Appropriations legislation during the 115th Congress continued prohibitions on certain political contribution reporting requirements and campaign finance disclosure to the Securities and Exchange Commission. The 114th Congress did not make major changes to campaign finance laws but addressed issues related to foreign influence in U.S. elections. Some Members of Congress and Federal Election Commissioners raised concerns about prohibited foreign funds potentially affecting recent elections and the need for additional safeguards. In September 2018, the FEC reported to Congress about enforcing the FECA ban on foreign funds. The report detailed commission processes for identifying foreign funds and enforcing the ban, without proposing additional action. FECA prohibits personal use of campaign funds, with recent FEC advisory opinions allowing funds for certain security expenses. After the June 14, 2017 attack on Members of Congress, the FEC approved the use of campaign funds for residential security systems in certain circumstances. The systems must be non-structural and not primarily intended to increase home value. The FEC also addressed the FECA ban on corporate funds. The FEC determined that campaigns can accept certain IT services without violating the FECA ban on corporate contributions. Microsoft sought approval to provide enhanced security services to election-sensitive users, which was deemed permissible by the FEC. In May 2018, the FEC allowed a New York congressional candidate to use campaign funds for child care expenses related to her candidacy. Members of Congress supported the decision, and there have been ongoing discussions about FEC enforcement and transparency issues in recent Congresses. Legislation to restructure the agency has been proposed, and there have been hearings on campaign finance law enforcement. The House Administration Committee has requested documents from the FEC on its enforcement practices. The FEC has faced scrutiny over its enforcement practices since November 2011, with ongoing debates and negotiations leading to efforts to approve a new enforcement manual. The issue remains unresolved, with four out of six commissioners still in office. The FEC enforces civil violations of FECA, while the DOJ handles criminal provisions. The FEC enforces civil violations of FECA, and may refer criminal violations to DOJ. The commission's six-member structure sometimes leads to enforcement stalemates. Some argue for more vigorous campaign finance law enforcement by DOJ. Proposals for shareholder protection measures have been made, with debates on their benefits. SEC dropped plans for additional corporate disclosure of political spending in 2013. Some advocates urge SEC for campaign finance regulation despite Congress prohibiting additional disclosure to FEC. In 2010, SEC issued \"pay-to-play\" rules post Citizens United, barring investment advisers from seeking business from municipalities if they made political contributions to officials awarding contracts. Rules have faced controversy and litigation, impacting state-level officeholders seeking federal office. The Obama Administration considered an executive order for more disclosure of government contractors' political spending in 2011, but it was never issued. Congress has also prohibited additional contractor disclosure through recent appropriations bills. Politically active tax-exempt organizations, like 501(c)(4) and 501(c)(6) groups, have been involved in elections since the early 2000s, with some suggesting that Citizens United clarified their permission. The controversy surrounding the involvement of 501(c)(4) social welfare groups and 501(c)(6) trade associations in federal elections has increased post-2010. These organizations, along with unions, have been permitted to make electioneering communications and independent expenditures following the Citizens United decision. Despite not falling under FEC or FECA requirements unless they engage in such activities, many of these groups still influence campaigns. The IRS and the Department of the Treasury announced changes in November 2013. The IRS and the Department of the Treasury announced a proposed rulemaking in November 2013 that could impact tax-exempt organizations' campaign activity. The initial proposal was withdrawn amid controversy, with reports suggesting a new proposal is in development. The issue of campaign finance disclosure, particularly donor identification for electioneering communications and independent expenditures, remains unresolved and contentious. The FEC requires donors giving over $200 for independent expenditures (IEs) to be identified in political committees' disclosure reports. However, some argue that FEC regulations allow donors to avoid disclosure by making unrestricted contributions to electioneering communications (ECs). Representative Van Hollen sued the FEC in 2011 over this issue, leading to court rulings upholding the FEC rules. Another case, CREW v. FEC, is considering the donor-disclosure standard for IEs. In November 2012, CREW filed a complaint with the FEC against Crossroads GPS for failing to disclose donors. In August 2018, a court ruled in CREW's favor, requiring certain groups to disclose donors to the FEC. The FEC issued filing guidance in October 2018. The FEC issued filing guidance on October 4, 2018, with potential changes to reporting requirements. Campaign practitioners have varying interpretations and anticipate possible litigation. FCC's telecommunications law intersects with political advertising transparency, influenced by BCRA and Citizens United. In 2011, the FCC revisited rules on broadcasting political ad information, considering online accessibility. The FCC approved new rules in 2012 requiring TV broadcasters in top markets to post political file info online. This was extended to cable, satellite operators, and radio in 2016, enhancing transparency in ad buy data. Broadcasters must post info online without aggregating costs or using a standard file format. Disclosure of campaign finance information has bipartisan support and aims to reduce conflicts of interest and corruption. However, recent efforts have sparked controversy, such as concerns about fairness in applying legislation to different types of organizations. Revised versions of legislation in subsequent Congresses did not include spending restrictions, but required reporting to the FEC for those airing independent messages. Post-Citizens United, efforts for additional disclosure have focused on the DISCLOSE Act, with some proposing reporting specific spending to agencies like the IRS or SEC. Measures similar to DISCLOSE for 501(c) tax-exempt organizations' spending have emerged, along with litigation and FEC rulemakings on the \"purpose of furthering\" applicability. Additional disclosure requirements from Congress, the FEC, or the IRS could provide clarity on tracking political money flow, but do not guarantee complete information or prevent corruption. Current disclosure rules allow identification of parties involved in transactions, promoting partial transparency. However, they do not reveal motivations or fund origins. Disclosure and disclaimers in online political advertising are key topics. After the Citizens United decision and reports of foreign interference in the 2016 elections, renewed interest in online advertising emerged in Congress and at the FEC. The FEC announced plans to update internet disclaimer rules in 2011 but did not implement new rules. In 2016 and 2017, the FEC reopened the comment period on the proposed rules, with Congress members submitting comments. On November 16, 2017, the FEC voted to draft revised internet disclaimer rules for paid advertising, which may be adopted in the future. Congress has not passed specific legislation on online campaign advertising. The Honest Ads Act was introduced to regulate online ads, and a hearing addressed disclaimers and disclosures for online political advertising. Concerns arise about candidates competing with unlimited expenditures from super PACs, organizations, corporations, or unions. One option is to raise or eliminate contribution limits to provide additional financial resources to candidates and parties. One option to address concerns about unlimited expenditures from super PACs is to raise or eliminate contribution limits. This could provide additional financial resources to candidates and parties, but there are corruption concerns that motivated previous regulations. Another option is to raise or eliminate limits on coordinated party expenditures, which could help parties provide additional resources to campaigns facing increased outside advertising. This may also strengthen parties as institutions. Increasing contribution limits or coordinated party expenditures could provide additional funding for candidates and parties, but concerns about the influence of money in politics may arise. Some may support increased limits as a step towards campaign deregulation, while others may object to the potential drawbacks of adopting party strategies at odds with a campaign's wishes. The FY2016 FSGG bill proposed allowing unlimited coordinated expenditures by parties on behalf of candidates, if the candidate did not control or direct such expenditures. The FY2016 FSGG bill proposed allowing unlimited coordinated expenditures by parties on behalf of candidates, without the candidate controlling or directing the spending. Questions persist about the impact of unlimited independent expenditures on candidate campaigns, especially with the emergence of super PACs and increased activity by 501(c) organizations. Coordination restrictions aim to prevent providing valuable goods or services to campaigns beyond federal contribution limits, but establishing coordination is challenging due to complex regulations. Some Members of Congress and advocacy groups propose a more precise coordination standard for federal campaign finance policy. The enactment of BCRA in 2002 aimed to limit soft money in federal elections and regulate political advertising. Changes in campaign finance law since BCRA, including Citizens United and SpeechNow, have reversed major elements of modern campaign finance policy. The report suggests that campaign finance policy remains a key issue for Congress, with debates surrounding disclosure requirements and political expenditures. There is tension between the need for transparency and concerns about government intrusion. Fundraising, spending, and reporting are central to recent policy debates, but other issues may also require attention. The report highlights ongoing debates in campaign finance policy, including disclosure requirements, political expenditures, fundraising, spending, and reporting. Additional regulation and litigation are expected, along with the perennial debate over the role of money in politics. These themes have been present in campaign finance policy for decades."
