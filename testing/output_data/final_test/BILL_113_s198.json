    "content": "The Act titled \"Boko Haram Terrorist Designation Act of 2013\" requires a report on designating Boko Haram as a foreign terrorist organization. Congress finds that Boko Haram has carried out deadly attacks in Nigeria, including a VBIED explosion at a United Nations facility in Abuja and bombings on Christmas Day in northern Nigeria, resulting in numerous casualties. Boko Haram has a history of targeting civilians and has vowed to continue using terrorist tactics. In 2010, Boko Haram's leader expressed support for al Qaeda and threatened the United States. In 2012, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper warned that Boko Haram posed a global threat and was interested in targeting Western interests. The United States Ambassador to Nigeria also noted an increase in Boko Haram's sophistication and willingness to attack the international community. Boko Haram, described as a terrorist group, is considered the main terrorist threat in Nigeria by the United Kingdom. The Secretary of State is required to submit a report on the group to congressional committees within 30 days. The Secretary of State must submit a detailed report to congressional committees on whether the Nigerian organization Boko Haram meets the criteria for designation as a foreign terrorist organization. The report must be in unclassified form but may include a classified annex if necessary. The Secretary of State must submit a report to appropriate congressional committees regarding the potential designation of Boko Haram as a foreign terrorist organization. The report may include a classified annex if needed. Definitions for \"appropriate congressional committees\" and \"intelligence community\" are provided in the subsection. The term \"intelligence community\" is defined in the National Security Act of 1947. Congress believes Boko Haram should be designated as a foreign terrorist organization. This designation should not interfere with Nigeria's sovereignty in combating militant or terrorist groups within its borders."
