    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 48900 of the Education Code prohibits suspension or expulsion of a pupil unless they have committed specific acts, such as causing physical harm to others or possessing dangerous objects without permission. The Education Code prohibits suspension or expulsion unless a pupil has committed specific acts like possessing or being under the influence of controlled substances, alcohol, or intoxicants, offering to sell them, committing robbery or extortion, causing damage to property, or stealing property. The Education Code prohibits suspension or expulsion for specific acts such as stealing school or private property, using tobacco products, engaging in obscene acts or profanity, possessing drug paraphernalia, and willfully defying school authority. Pupils in kindergarten to grade 3 cannot be suspended for specified acts, including receiving stolen property or possessing an imitation firearm. This provision does not apply to expulsion recommendations for students in these grades. The paragraph will expire on July 1, 2018, unless extended or removed by a later statute. The paragraph outlines prohibited actions by students, including committing sexual assault, harassing witnesses, and selling the prescription drug Soma. Students are prohibited from engaging in hazing, bullying, or selling the prescription drug Soma. Hazing is defined as activities likely to cause harm or degradation, excluding athletic or school-sanctioned events. The definition of \"bullying\" includes severe or pervasive acts directed towards pupils that can cause fear, harm, detrimental effects on physical or mental health, interference with academic performance, or hindrance in benefiting from school services. An \"electronic act\" is defined as the creation or transmission of a communication using an electronic device, such as a phone or computer, including messages, images, or posts on social media websites. Creating a credible impersonation or false profile of another pupil for the purpose of bullying is prohibited. An electronic act will not be considered pervasive solely because it is transmitted or posted on the Internet. A pupil shall not be suspended or expelled for acts unless they are related to school activities or attendance. These acts can include incidents on school grounds, while traveling to or from school, during lunch on or off campus, or during school-sponsored activities. A pupil who aids or abets physical injury during a school-sponsored activity may face suspension. \"School property\" includes electronic files and databases. Alternatives to suspension or expulsion may be provided for disciplined pupils, with the intent of addressing specific misbehavior. This includes truancy, tardiness, or absence from school activities."
