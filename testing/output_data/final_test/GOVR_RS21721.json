    "content": "On February 17, 2008, Kosovo declared independence from Serbia, leading to celebrations among ethnic Albanians. Serbia and Kosovo Serbs opposed the declaration. The United States recognized Kosovo's independence the next day. Kosovo claims recognition from 98 countries, including 22 EU members. Some EU countries, like Greece and Spain, oppose Kosovo's independence due to various reasons. Kosovo joined the IMF and World Bank in 2009. Russia's stance on Kosovo remains unclear. Kosovo's independence is strongly opposed by Russia, hindering its United Nations membership due to Russia's veto power. Kosovo aims to join the EU and NATO, but faces challenges due to non-recognition by some NATO and EU states, poverty, and weak institutions. Kosovo declared independence based on the Comprehensive Proposal for the Kosovo Status Settlement, which prohibits merging with another country. The document outlined provisions to safeguard the rights of ethnic Serbs and other minorities in Kosovo. It proposed giving expanded powers to six Serbian-majority municipalities, allowing them to form associations, receive funding from Belgrade, and have local police reflecting the ethnic mix. Kosovo's constitution and laws must guarantee minority rights, with special laws requiring approval from a majority of minority representatives in parliament. The International Civilian Representative oversaw Kosovo's implementation of a plan to protect Serbian religious and cultural sites. The EU Special Representative provides advice on reforms for EU membership. EULEX monitors and advises Kosovo on rule of law issues, with limited executive powers to ensure effective institutions and intervene in criminal cases. EULEX, a status-neutral organization in Kosovo, faces criticism for its effectiveness in fighting organized crime and corruption. Despite substantial reductions in personnel and funding, EULEX continues to provide assistance on rule-of-law issues to local authorities. Its mandate is set to end in June 2014, with KFOR responsible for overall security in Kosovo. KFOR oversees training of Kosovo Security Force, gradually reducing size due to improved security. Tasks like border guarding handed over to Kosovo police. In January 2013, KFOR had 5,134 troops in Kosovo. In January 2013, KFOR had 5,134 troops in Kosovo, with 773 U.S. soldiers. France proposed replacing KFOR with a smaller, EU-led force in late 2013, but the idea was shelved due to opposition from some NATO member states. NATO countries may reconsider drawdowns if an April 2013 agreement between Kosovo and Serbia shows promise in stabilizing the situation in northern Kosovo. The Kosovo government aims for NATO certification of the Kosovo Security Force's full operational capability this year, with eventual NATO membership in mind. Kosovo seeks NATO membership through the U.S.-led Adriatic Charter. Serbia and Kosovo Serbs reject Kosovo's independence. The U.N. General Assembly referred Kosovo's independence to the ICJ, which ruled it legal in 2010. Kosovo aims for NATO membership despite Serbia's sovereignty claims. After the ICJ ruling, the EU urged Serbia to engage in talks with Kosovo on technical issues, not status. Talks began in March 2011, leading to an agreement on freedom of movement in July. Kosovo blocked Serbian goods over customs stamp disputes, leading to tensions and clashes at border posts. Kosovo police seized control, Serbs erected barricades, and a policeman was killed. KFOR intervened to control the situation. In October 2011, the European Commission recommended that Serbia be given membership candidate status if it re-engages in dialogue with Kosovo and implements agreements already reached. Serbia could start membership negotiations if it further normalizes relations with Kosovo, including respecting regional cooperation principles and Energy Community Treaty provisions. Solutions for telecommunications and mutual acceptance of diplomas are also necessary. In December 2011, the EU Council endorsed recommendations for Serbia's membership candidacy. In March 2012, Serbia was accepted as a membership candidate, pending agreements on energy and telecommunications with Kosovo. In May 2012, Serbia's nationalist Progressive Party and Socialist Party won elections, with a more moderate stance. Prime Minister Ivica Dacic of the Socialist Party has committed to implementing agreements with Kosovo and starting EU membership negotiations. High-level meetings between Dacic and Kosovo Prime Minister Hashim Thaci have become regular, leading to agreements on various issues like free movement of persons and regional cooperation. Implementation of various agreements on integrated border management and regional cooperation has been slow. A technical protocol on border management was established in 2012, with joint Kosovo/Serbia border posts opening. Difficulties persist regarding the status of Serbian-majority municipalities in northern Kosovo, where Belgrade maintains control through parallel institutions. The Kosovo government demands dissolution of parallel institutions in talks with Serbian military and intelligence agencies. International countries call for dismantling of Serbian structures in Kosovo and transparency in funding healthcare and education. EU member states agree on a single institutional setup for Kosovo. Serbia pushes for agreements in EU-mediated dialogue. In the EU-mediated dialogue, Serbia advocated for an association of Serb municipalities in Kosovo with executive powers, which Kosovar leaders opposed fearing de facto partition. Kosovo Serb leaders in northern Kosovo rejected any Kosovo government presence, holding a referendum in 2012. The local referendum in northern Kosovo rejected Kosovo government institutions by a large margin, leading to calls for formal partition. Suggestions include recognizing northern Kosovo as part of Serbia in exchange for ceding Albanian-majority areas in southern Serbia. However, these ideas are strongly opposed by Kosovo government and the international community due to fears of destabilizing the region and potential armed conflicts. Serbian leaders have openly discussed partition in the past but have not made formal proposals. In recent months, discussions on partition have been avoided due to pressure from the United States, Germany, and other EU countries. The EU countries have warned Serbia that pursuing partition could harm its EU membership prospects. In April 2013, Serbian and Kosovo Prime Ministers initialed an agreement for the normalization of relations, including the creation of an \"Association/Community of Serbian-majority municipalities\" in Kosovo. The police in northern Kosovo will be part of Kosovo's unified police force, paid by Pristina. The police commander will be a Kosovo Serb chosen by Pristina from nominees provided by mayors of Serb municipalities. The judicial system in northern and southern Kosovo will operate under Kosovo's legal framework, with a majority of Kosovo Serb judges in the Appellate Court for Kosovo Serb-majority municipalities. New municipal elections in the north are planned for 2013. The agreement in northern Kosovo includes new municipal elections in 2013 under Kosovo law with OSCE assistance. Kosovo's parliament and the Serbian government approved the agreement despite initial opposition. Peaceful demonstrations were held against the accord in Belgrade and northern Kosovo, but the Serbian parliament overwhelmingly supported the government's report on the negotiations with Kosovo. On April 29, the Serbian parliament overwhelmingly supported the government's report on the negotiations with Kosovo by a vote of 173-24. The agreement was also approved by most opposition parties, except for the Democratic Party of Serbia and some members from Kosovo. The European Commission recommended starting EU membership talks with Serbia and initiating talks on a Stabilization and Association Agreement with Kosovo. Despite approving the agreement, Serbia still does not recognize Kosovo as an independent state. Belgrade's position on the \"Association/Community\" of Serbian-majority municipalities in Kosovo is seen as an attempt to create an autonomous entity within another autonomous entity within Serbia. The agreement with Pristina is viewed as Serbia's de facto recognition of Kosovo as an independent country. Implementation of the agreement faces challenges, including opposition from Serb leaders in northern Kosovo. Prime Minister Dacic has stated that pressure may be applied, such as cutting off salaries, to ensure cooperation. Belgrade leaders emphasize the need for progress before the EU Council's decision in June on granting Serbia a date to begin membership talks. Key EU countries are pushing for progress on dismantling Serbian security structures in Kosovo before the EU Council's decision in June on granting Serbia a date to begin membership talks. Serbia demanded that Kosovo pledge not to deploy security forces in northern Kosovo without local consent, with NATO's support mentioned during the talks. Low turnout in upcoming local elections in northern Kosovo may challenge the legitimacy of institutions. KFOR is expected to play a crucial role in implementing the agreement. Kosovo faces challenges as an independent state, with weak institutions and little experience in self-rule. In 2012, a report highlighted issues in Kosovo's judiciary despite some legislative improvements. The report highlighted serious problems in Kosovo's judiciary, including strong executive influence, threats against judges, poor court infrastructure, and security issues. Kosovo's image was tarnished by a report linking Prime Minister Hashim Thaci and others to alleged crimes during the Kosovo Liberation Army's war with Serbia in the 1990s. Thaci and other former KLA leaders deny the charges. An American prosecutor appointed by EULEX is investigating the allegations. An American prosecutor appointed by EULEX is investigating organ trafficking charges in Kosovo, with a focus on high-level government officials. The prosecutor expects to conclude the investigation in 2014. In a separate case, five individuals were convicted in 2013 for organ trafficking at the Medicus clinic in Pristina. There are alleged links between this case and organ trafficking during the 1990s war. Despite differences in recognizing Kosovo's independence, the European Commission recommended opening negotiations for a Stabilization and Association Agreement between Kosovo and the EU. The European Commission recommended negotiations for a Stabilization and Association Agreement (SAA) between Kosovo and the EU, seen as a reward for Kosovo's agreement with Serbia. Kosovar leaders criticized the EU's decision to allow visa-free travel for other countries in the region but not for Kosovo, hindering the country's European integration. In January 2012, the EU initiated a dialogue with Kosovo on visa-free travel. Kosovo's dialogue with the EU on visa-free travel started in January 2012. However, visa-free travel for Kosovo is unlikely in the near future due to the EU's demands for improvements in rule of law and border controls. The EU has threatened to suspend the program due to a surge in asylum-seekers from the region. Kosovo's current government, led by Hashim Thaci of the Democratic Party of Kosovo, was formed in February 2011 and includes a coalition with the New Kosovo Alliance and other minority parties. In February 2011, Pacolli was elected president of Kosovo but resigned in March 2011 after the Constitutional Court ruled his election illegal. Atifete Jahjaga, a non-political figure, was then elected as president in April 2011. The U.S. ambassador's involvement in Jahjaga's election sparked controversy. The acquittal of Ramush Haradinaj in November 2012 led to a closer relationship between his party and the ruling party, providing a more stable political basis. Kosovo may hold early parliamentary elections in 2013, but will likely have to pass electoral reforms acceptable to the international community first. Poverty, unemployment, and lack of economic opportunity are serious problems in Kosovo, one of Europe's poorest countries. 34.5% of Kosovo's population fell below the poverty line in 2009, with poverty particularly severe in rural areas and among ethnic minorities. Unemployment in Kosovo is over 40%. Youth unemployment in Kosovo is around 70%, with 80% of the unemployed without work for a year or more. The country's largest employers are small and inefficient farms, with limited large-scale industry and exports. Kosovo has significant deposits of metals and lignite but needs to improve its investment climate to attract foreign investment. The IMF cut off funding in 2011 due to government overspending and budget deficits. Kosovo has received a new 106.6 million Euro stand-by arrangement in April 2012 and has been dependent on international aid, remittances, and expenditures by international staff. Despite a decline in these sources of income, Kosovo has not been as strongly affected by the global economic crisis due to its low level of integration into the global economy. The IMF predicts GDP growth of 2.9% in 2013 and 4.3% in 2014, with Kosovo slated to receive 71.4 million Euro in aid from the EU in 2013. The EU has allocated 71.4 million Euro in aid for Kosovo under the Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance. The United States recognized Kosovo's independence in 2008 and has urged other countries to do the same. Kosovo also benefits from trade privileges with the US and the EU. Vice President Biden visited Kosovo in 2009, setting the tone for the Obama Administration's Balkans policy. During his visit to Kosovo in May 2009, Vice President Biden declared U.S. support for the success of an independent Kosovo and offered assistance in various areas such as institution-building, fighting crime, and improving relations with ethnic minorities. In Serbia, he emphasized U.S. support for Kosovo's independence but did not require Serbia to recognize it for improved relations. The U.S. plays a significant role in the Serbia-Kosovo talks but is not a direct participant or mediator. The United States plays a significant role in Kosovo's development, with Kosovar leaders seeing the U.S. as a key ally. President Obama praised Kosovo's progress in building a democratic state but urged further work on citizen rights and neighborly relations, especially with Serbia. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton also visited the region to support these efforts. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton visited Kosovo, Bosnia, Serbia, Croatia, and Albania in late 2012, emphasizing solidarity between the U.S. and EU on Balkan policy. She highlighted the importance of good-faith negotiations in EU-brokered talks between Serbia and Kosovo for their integration with the European Union. Clinton reaffirmed the U.S.'s stance on Kosovo's sovereignty and territorial integrity as non-negotiable. On April 19, 2013, Secretary of State John Kerry praised the agreement on northern Kosovo and urged both sides to implement it quickly. He also commended Baroness Ashton for her role in facilitating the talks and reiterated the U.S.'s commitment to seeing Serbia and Kosovo integrate into a peaceful Europe. On April 24, the Subcommittee on Europe, Eurasia, and Emerging Threats of the House Foreign Affairs Committee held a hearing on Kosovo-Serbia relations. Acting Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Jonathan Moore expressed strong Administration support for the April 19 agreement facilitated by Baroness Ashton. Subcommittee Chairman Representative Dana Rohrabacher expressed skepticism about the agreement's viability and proposed referendums in Serb-majority areas of northern Kosovo and ethnic Albanian-majority areas of southern Serbia. Moore reiterated the Administration's opposition to this approach, citing potential for further conflict in the region. U.S. aid to Kosovo has declined significantly. U.S. aid to Kosovo has declined significantly in recent years, with the Administration requesting $57.669 million for FY2013 and $41 million for FY2014. The aid includes funding for political and economic reforms, military training, and support for the Kosovo Police. U.S. aid to Kosovo includes support for the Kosovo Police Service, strengthening the judicial system and local government, providing police officers and judges to EULEX, building government and parliament capacity, improving higher education, promoting Serbian minority integration, and enhancing the Kosovo Security Force's capabilities through FMF and IMET military training aid. NADR assistance aims to boost Kosovo border police capacity to fight proliferation and trafficking."
