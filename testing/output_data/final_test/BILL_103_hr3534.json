The Export Administration Act of 1979 is amended to include a new subsection requiring periodic reviews of export controls on computer equipment and technology to remove outdated requirements for licenses. The Secretary must conduct these reviews within 6 months of enactment and annually thereafter. The Secretary must conduct periodic reviews of export controls on computer equipment and technology to remove outdated license requirements. The reviews must be done within 6 months of enactment and annually thereafter, identifying objectives and performance for each country requiring a validated license. The Secretary must estimate the quantity and performance of computer systems needed by countries with validated license requirements to defeat export control objectives. Evaluation of export controls effectiveness includes assessing availability of computer equipment to controlled destinations. The Secretary must estimate the quantity and performance of computer systems needed by countries with validated license requirements to defeat export control objectives. Evaluation of export controls effectiveness includes assessing availability of computer equipment to controlled destinations, including computer communications, networking equipment, software, and related technology subject to export controls. This includes items sourced from countries without export controls, potential diversion over international networks, export license authorizations from non-US countries, and indigenous production. The Secretary evaluates the economic impact of export controls on companies, including lost sales and administrative overhead. After each review, the Secretary may increase export thresholds based on findings. The review findings warrant the following export control thresholds for computer systems, including performance levels for delivery under distribution licenses, shipping under general licenses, defining 'supercomputers', and requiring validated licenses for exports to controlled countries. The Secretary must provide specific rationale for any recommended increase in computer system performance levels. If a review is not completed by the deadline, performance levels will double after 90 days without requiring regulatory changes. The Secretary must report to Congress and the Computer Systems Technical Advisory Committee. The Computer Systems Technical Advisory Committee must review the Secretary's report and provide a concise statement to Congress within 60 days, stating their agreement or disagreement with the findings. Public hearings must be conducted annually to gather input on the matters addressed in the review. SEC. 3. DE MINIMIS DECONTROL OF COMPUTER SYSTEMS. Section 4 of the Export Administration Act of 1979 is amended to remove the requirement of a validated license for the export or reexport of digital computers valued at less than $5,000 to controlled countries. The 'net value' of a digital computer is defined as the selling price minus transport charges, or the current market price in the United States. There is no limit on the quantity of computer systems that can be exported at any one time. The Export Administration Act of 1979 is amended to remove the requirement of a validated license for exporting digital computers valued at less than $5,000 to controlled countries. There is no limit on the quantity of computer systems that can be exported at any one time. DECONTROL OF MASS-MARKET COMPUTER EQUIPMENT. Section 4 of the Export Administration Act of 1979 is amended to define 'mass-market computer equipment' as any computer system, networking equipment, or peripherals with export controls, exceeding 100,000 units for end-use outside the US. An anticipatory review is required within 6 months of enactment. The Secretary, in consultation with advisory committees and industry groups, will identify computer systems exceeding 100,000 units for export outside the US. Estimates will be based on reliable producer data. The Secretary must take action within 30 days of determining an item. After identifying mass-market computer equipment, the Secretary will either eliminate export controls and publish a notice in the Federal Register or propose the elimination of controls in accordance with export control regime procedures. SEC. 5. IDENTIFICATION OF PROLIFERATION END-USERS. Section 4 of the Export Administration Act of 1979 is amended to include a new subsection (k) regarding the identification of proliferation end-users. A proliferation end-user is defined as an entity involved in the production of weapons of mass destruction located in a country without agreements to limit such activities. The Secretary is required to publish a list of proliferation end-users within 10 days of notifying exporters. The Secretary must publish the name and license requirements for exports to identified proliferation end-users. If not published, the entity is not considered a proliferation end-user. Customer screening for export licenses does not require information on end-user activities unless the country is identified by the Secretary. The Secretary must identify countries engaged in weapons development or with a risk of diversion for exports."
