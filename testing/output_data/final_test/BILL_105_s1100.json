    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands Reform Act\". It includes findings related to the Act. The Congress approved the Covenant to Establish a Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands in Political Union with the United States of America. Concerns about unrestricted immigration led to the exclusion of the Immigration and Naturalization Act initially, with Congress reserving the right to extend it in the future. Following the enactment of the Covenant, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands saw a significant increase in population due to unrestricted immigration policies. This led to a workforce where 91 percent are foreign workers, recruited for low-cost labor without the ability to demand fair wages or safe working conditions. Despite this, the unemployment rate in the Commonwealth remains at 14 percent. The Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands has recruited increasing numbers of foreign workers despite a 14 percent unemployment rate among United States citizens. The Commonwealth's own statistics show a 4.5 percent unemployment rate among foreign workers. The United States Immigration and Naturalization Service reported a lack of reliable records on aliens entering and leaving the Commonwealth. During the Covenant negotiations, concerns were raised about minimum wage provisions. The Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands expressed concern that the minimum wage provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act would disrupt its struggling local economy. In response, section 503(c) of the Covenant exempted the Commonwealth from these provisions initially, with Congress reserving the right to extend them in the future. The economy of the Commonwealth has since grown significantly, with annual gross business revenues reaching $1.5 billion in 1996, a sixfold increase over the past decade. The current minimum wage in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands is $3.05 per hour for various industries. The United States Department of Labor has uncovered labor abuses including involuntary servitude, illegal wage withholding, nonpayment of overtime, illegal deductions, kickbacks, employee lockdowns, and unsafe working conditions. Foreign workers in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands are subjected to oppressive contracts by the Chinese government, which waive rights, forbid religious and political activities, prohibit dating and marriage, impose penalties upon return to China, and allow recruiters to charge a fee of 25% of the worker's pay for two years. The United States Department of Justice has found a major organized crime problem in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands involving immigration document fraud, public corruption, racketeering, drug trafficking, prostitution, pornography, extortion, gambling, smuggling, and other violent crimes.

The Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands is exempt from Federal laws and taxes, allowing for the exploitation of non-US citizens in the garment manufacturing industry. Garments labeled as \"Made in USA\" from the CNMI compete with those made on the mainland by workers subject to federal laws. In 1996, garment manufacturers in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands shipped garments worth $555 million to the Continental United States, a 30% increase from the previous year. Congress allocated $10 million for a three-year initiative to improve labor and immigration policies in the CNMI, but little progress has been made. The CNMI government has been ineffective in controlling immigration, raising wages, and improving living standards for workers. Despite efforts by previous administrations, the situation in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands has deteriorated, with ongoing concerns about labor abuses, immigration policies, and unfair competition from foreign workers. President Clinton notified the Governor in 1997 that Federal laws should be applied to address these issues.

The regulations for admission to Guam of individuals under section 101(a)(15)(H)(ii)(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act apply, with references to United States workers as citizens, nationals, or residents, and references to Guam as the Northern Mariana Islands. The Attorney General must coordinate with state and local law enforcement when deploying personnel to enforce these provisions without compromising immigration officers' functions. The Attorney General will implement a transition period for amendments to section 506(a) of the Covenant, not exceeding 4 years from the effective date. A report on the status of implementation must be submitted within 2 years of the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands Reform Act enactment.
