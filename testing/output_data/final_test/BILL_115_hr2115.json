The Act defines \"in custody of a law enforcement agency\" as being detained, under arrest, en route to incarceration, or incarcerated in various facilities. It also defines \"custodial record\" as the central file of an individual in custody, and includes \"juvenile facility\" as a detention center for youth. The term \"life-threatening event\" refers to a medical situation where immediate treatment is necessary to prevent death, hospitalization is required for a serious medical condition, or when an individual is unconscious and unable to consent to treatment."
