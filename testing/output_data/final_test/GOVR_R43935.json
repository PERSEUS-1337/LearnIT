    "content": "Science and technology policy issues that reach the presidential level typically involve multiple agencies, substantial budgetary, economic, national security, or foreign policy dimensions, controversy, and high visibility to the public. Presidents seek advice from trusted sources for options and implications. Throughout U.S. history, Presidents have obtained S&T advice from federal scientists, engineers, and advisory boards, although these boards lacked permanency due to the lack of a statutory foundation. In the years leading up to World War II, the importance of research and development (R&D) to the nation's economic and military strength became evident. President Franklin D. Roosevelt established the Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD) in 1941, which significantly contributed to the Allied victory in the war and subsequent U.S. industrial strength. President Roosevelt sought recommendations on utilizing research infrastructure in times of peace, leading to the framework outlined in Vannevar Bush's response, \"Science: The Endless Frontier.\" The Bush report, Science: The Endless Frontier, emphasized the importance of scientific progress in meeting national needs. Subsequent Presidents utilized various mechanisms for S&T advice within the EOP, including advisory organizations like the Office of Science and Technology. Interagency coordination was enhanced through organizations like the President's Scientific Research Board. The coordination of science and technology advice within the Executive Office of the President has evolved over time, with various advisory committees and councils established by different Presidents. President Nixon abolished the Office of Science and Technology in 1973, leading to the establishment of the National Science Foundation and the National Security Council taking over its functions. President Ford later created the Office of Science and Technology Policy through legislation. The National Science and Technology Policy, Organization, and Priorities Act of 1976 established the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) and the position of OSTP Director. The President has the authority to appoint advisors, including the OSTP director, to assist in science and technology policy advice. This raised questions about coordination of advice. Appendix A provides a historical compilation of presidential S&T policy advisors and related organizations. The White House houses entities like OSTP, NSTC, and PCAST, each with varying roles and influence. Congress established OSTP within the EOP for science and technology policy. The Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) is an office within the Executive Office of the President (EOP) that provides scientific and technological analysis and advice to the President. Its mission includes providing accurate advice, ensuring policies are based on sound science, and coordinating scientific work for the benefit of society. OSTP aims to maximize the impact of federal investments in science and technology on economic prosperity, public health, environmental quality, and national security. The Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) aims to energize government programs in science and technology, sustain professional relationships with key stakeholders, and generate a core workforce of expertise to provide policy advice to the President. Additionally, OSTP serves as a conduit of information for agency executives seeking to shape policies. The Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) serves as a conduit of information for agency executives seeking to understand, clarify, and shape science and technology-related policy objectives and priorities. It helps agencies coordinate and integrate their S&T strategies, resolve interagency conflicts, and advise the President on scientific and technological considerations at the highest level of government. The Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) advises the President on scientific and technological considerations in areas like the economy, national security, health, and the environment. It evaluates federal efforts in science and technology, assists with budget reviews, and coordinates research and development programs across federal agencies. The President appoints the OSTP Director to lead these efforts. The President appoints the OSTP Director, also known as the President's science advisor, subject to Senate confirmation. The Director is not a Cabinet member and does not have to serve as an assistant to the President. The President can appoint up to four OSTP Associate Directors, each with specific responsibilities. The President appoints the OSTP Director, also known as the President's science advisor, subject to Senate confirmation. The Director is not a Cabinet member and does not have to serve as an assistant to the President. The President can appoint up to four OSTP Associate Directors with discrete areas of responsibility: science, technology and innovation, national security and international affairs, and environment and energy. The number of Associate Director positions has varied under different Presidents. Ted Wackler currently serves as OSTP's Acting Director and leads the NSTC. The President's science advisor, currently Ted Wackler, serves as OSTP's Acting Director and leads the NSTC. The degree of access to the President may vary based on formal positions held by the science advisor. Some Presidents appoint their science advisors as Assistant to the President for Science and Technology (APST) in addition to the OSTP Director role, providing additional status and access to the President. Clinton appointed their OSTP Directors as APST; President George W. Bush did not appoint an APST. The relationship between Congress and the individual serving as the President's science advisor depends on their role as OSTP Director, APST, or both. Congress can require the OSTP Director to testify, while APSTs may choose not to testify based on separation of powers or executive privilege. The authority of Congress to require testimony from someone holding both titles may be ambiguous. The OSTP Director advises the President on policy formulation, appointments, S&T budgets, and the significance of scientific and technical developments. The APST, as the manager of the National Science and Technology Council, coordinates S&T policy across the federal government and provides guidance during special events. They also co-chair the President's Council of Advisors on Science. The APST, as the manager of the National Science and Technology Council, coordinates S&T policy across the federal government and provides guidance during special events. They also co-chair the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology, seeking consensus from the S&T community on Administration issues. The OSTP Director advises the President on national security and emergency preparedness communications policies and priorities, including radio spectrum and wired communications for NS/EP functions. The OSTP Director is responsible for analyzing NS/EP communications annually. They work with OMB in setting R&D priorities and budget proposals for federal agencies. This involves requesting recommendations from agencies and coordinating with interagency groups to determine responsibilities. The final budget decisions are made by the President and OMB Director. The OSTP Director works with agencies to set R&D priorities and budget proposals. Agencies submit budget proposals to OMB, which are reviewed by OSTP and OMB to ensure alignment with Administration plans. OSTP provides guidance to agencies with large R&D budgets and programs crossing agency boundaries. OSTP plays a key role in advising on agency budget proposals and priorities, but final budget decisions are made by the President, OMB Director, and Cabinet. OSTP's budget and staffing levels impact its ability to provide advice and respond to congressional mandates. The President's FY2017 request for OSTP is $5.544 million, with 33 FTE, reflecting a slight decrease from the previous year. In FY2012, Congress reduced funding for OSTP and transferred responsibility for funding PCAST to the Department of Energy. DOE PCAST funding ranged from $217,000 in FY2013 to $751,000 in FY2015, with funding in FY2017 estimated at $230,000. The FY2018 budget does not include a specific request for PCAST funding as the advisory committee has dissolved. Funding supports PCAST salaries, benefits, committee member travel, meeting planning, and related expenses through the DOE Science account. The Science and Technology Policy Institute (STPI) is supported by a federally funded research and development center (FFRDC) and funded through the National Science Foundation appropriation. The President is requesting $4.0 million for STPI for FY2018, with funding for FY2017 at $4.74 million. OSTP funding and staffing levels have varied over time, with funding highest at the end of the George H. W. Bush Administration and lowest during the Reagan Administration. As of July 17, 2017, OSTP had a total of 36 staff members covering its portfolio of work. During the Obama Administration, OSTP had around 30 to 70 detailees, IPAs, and fellows, with funding coming from various sources. OSTP includes relevant funding information in its annual budget requests to Congress and has relied on these staff members for support across multiple presidential administrations. During the G.W. Bush Administration, OSTP had 30-40 detailees per year, increasing to 60 detailees and fellows by the end of the Clinton Administration. President Clinton established the NSTC on November 23, 1993, to coordinate science and technology policy across the federal government. The NSTC includes department and agency heads, selected assistants, and advisors to the President, aiming to ensure consistency with the President's goals and integrate S&T policy agenda. The National Science and Technology Council (NSTC) coordinates science and technology policy across the federal government, advises on R&D budgets, and promotes international cooperation. The President chairs the NSTC, with the Vice President or APST serving as chair in the President's absence. The NSTC rarely meets with Cabinet-level officials, with OSTP staff implementing activities in collaboration with federal agencies. Ted Wackler is the Acting Director of OSTP leading the NSTC. Under President Obama, the NSTC had five committees focusing on various areas of science and technology. The National Science and Technology Council (NSTC) coordinates federal activities on specialized topics such as ocean acidification, national research programs on oceans and human health, and the National Nanotechnology Program. Congress has mandated the NSTC to oversee these responsibilities and report annually on their activities. The NSTC committees consist of lower-ranking staff members, not Cabinet officials, and are responsible for coordinating federal programs and activities in support of science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) education. The NSTC coordinates federal programs in STEM education, advanced manufacturing research, and dissemination of research results. It may also fulfill non-specific congressional mandates, such as establishing a President's Council on Innovation and Competitiveness as directed by the America COMPETES Act. The NSTC, under the direction of President George W. Bush, was assigned the responsibility of serving as the Council on Innovation and Competitiveness. It receives funding from participating agencies to coordinate multi-agency programs, with funding ranging from $12 million to $18 million annually. NSTC staff are assigned by their respective agencies, with the number of assignees varying from 5 to 21 in recent years. President George H. W. Bush created the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST) in 1990, which has been reestablished by Presidents Clinton, George W. Bush, and Obama. President Trump will re-charter PCAST, an advisory board that advises the President on science, technology, and innovation policy. PCAST's members include individuals and representatives from sectors outside the federal government with diverse perspectives and expertise. The President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST) includes 20-25 members from various sectors outside the federal government. The current executive order gives PCAST a broad remit to provide advice on science, technology, innovation, and other policy areas. PCAST also serves as advisory committees for the President. The President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST) was created by the High Performance Computing Act of 1991 and the National Nanotechnology Advisory Panel was created by the 21st Century Nanotechnology Research and Development Act. President Obama directed the Department of Energy to provide funding and support for PCAST in 2011. The Office of Science at the DOE assumed responsibility for funding and supporting PCAST in FY2012, with annual funding requests under $1 million. In FY2017, DOE funding for PCAST is $230,000, a 57.5% decrease from FY2016. The PCAST advisory committee has dissolved, with no plans to reform in FY2018. Congressional policymakers are interested in science and technology policy issues within the White House, including the roles of the President's science advisor and OSTP funding levels. Under President Obama, John Holdren served as both OSTP Director and Assistant to the President for Science and Technology (APST), while under President George W. Bush, John Marburger was only given the title of OSTP Director. Some experts suggest that the OSTP Director should always hold the title of APST or have Cabinet rank. There is a debate on whether the roles and responsibilities of the OSTP Director should be divided among multiple appointees. Presidential discretion plays a significant role in appointing advisors, which may limit Congress's ability to regulate access to key decisionmakers. Presidential science advisors have held various titles. Presidential science advisors have held different titles throughout history. The most common titles have been Science Advisor to the President and Special Assistant to the President. The difference between being the OSTP Director and the APST is significant, with implications for policy issues. Some Members of Congress may want the President's science advisor to testify on OSTP or science and technology policy issues. Some presidential advisors, like the OSTP Director, are required to testify before Congress, while an APST may choose not to testify citing separation of powers or executive privilege. Congress may compel OSTP Directors to testify if necessary. Members of the S&T community argue that APSTs should be allowed to differentiate between advising the President and providing privileged information. Some experts suggest establishing the position of Assistant to the President by statute and requiring Senate confirmation to ensure availability for testimony. Concerns exist about potential confusion if Congress could compel some Administration staff with \"Assistant to the President\" titles to testify but not others. Some in the S&T community want the OSTP Director to have a greater role in shaping Administration policy. Some experts propose designating the OSTP Director as a Cabinet-level position to increase their role and influence in shaping Administration policy. The President would nominate the individual for this position shortly after the election, allowing them to start work immediately. This could help in identifying and recruiting top professionals for S&T policy-related presidential appointments. Some experts believe that giving the OSTP Director Cabinet rank could enhance their authority and influence in decision making. However, others argue that this may not significantly improve their role in EOP activities. The key question is how an Administration utilizes expert S&T advice to support federal decision making. Scientists, engineers, and S&T policy professionals provide input to federal policy decision making in areas such as R&D, regulation, procurement, and standards development. The organization of the White House determines the S&T advisor's status and access to the President. Critics suggest focusing on transparency in Administration operations rather than the advisor's title. The OSTP Director advises Presidents on S&T policy, R&D budget issues, and STEM education. One suggestion is to separate the roles and responsibilities of the OSTP Director and the APST to enhance their effectiveness. Some suggest separating the roles of the OSTP Director and the APST to enhance effectiveness. Concerns exist about potential conflicts and lack of integration if responsibilities are split between the two positions. Splitting the functions of OSTP and assigning them to separate individuals or organizations may be challenging due to budget and staff constraints. Congress could increase funding and staffing levels to support this reorganization. Current statutory authority allows the President flexibility in appointing up to four Associate Directors with specific policy responsibilities. President Obama had four Associate Directors covering science, technology, national security, and environment, while President George W. Bush had two for science and technology. Congress could specify the roles further. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended creating the position of Associate Director for Earth Science and Applications at OSTP to coordinate federal efforts on climate and oceans. Another bill proposed appointing an Associate Director for Societal Dimensions of Nanotechnology. Some suggest increasing funding and staffing levels to support reorganization at OSTP. President Obama made strategic appointments within the S&T community, including joint appointments to the NEC, NSC, DPC, and OMB. He also issued PPD-1 to ensure science and technology issues are included in NSC meetings. The effectiveness of OSTP in fulfilling its duties relies on its budget and staff size, as shown in historical figures. During FY1996 to FY2013, Presidents Clinton, George W. Bush, and Obama requested 32-40 FTE positions for OSTP, but actual staff ranged from 23 to 33. Detailees and fellows supplemented core staffing, with them accounting for half of staff during the Bush Administration and two-thirds during the Clinton Administration. Concerns exist in the S&T community about the need for more career civil service staff and a larger budget at OSTP to maintain institutional knowledge. The need for more career staff at OSTP to maintain institutional knowledge and support political appointees during presidential transitions is highlighted. Additional funding would allow for special analyses on emerging issues currently provided by STPI. Congress may consider enhancing funding and staffing for OSTP. The Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) can receive increased funding and staffing through the appropriations process. Funding for OSTP in FY2017 was $5.5 million, with previous years ranging from $4.5 million to $7.0 million. OSTP and the National Science and Technology Council (NSTC) coordinate and allocate budgets for federal S&T activities. Suggestions have been made to enhance their participation. Tensions and power struggles between OSTP, other EOP offices, presidential administrations, and the science community are not uncommon. Tension arose between OSTP Director D. Allan Bromley and White House officials over federal funding for commercial technology development. Reagan's OSTP Director, George Keyworth, sparked controversy by stating that the OSTP does not represent the scientific community. Carter's OSTP Director, Frank Press, opposed federal subsidies for the solar power industry, advocating for a balance between market demand and scientific discovery. Reports suggest the OSTP Director should play a greater role in coordination, priority-setting, and budget allocation for federal S&T activities. The S&T policy community suggests that the OSTP Director should have a greater role in coordinating federal R&D budget, energy, STEM education, and international S&T policy. They also recommend giving the NSTC equivalent authority to the NSC to enhance its influence in decision-making processes. The NSTC has participated in presidential decision-making processes in different ways in different Administrations, issuing directives during the Clinton Administration. Some experts suggest that the NSTC should issue formal directives rather than contributing input to other entity policy documents. The Obama Administration revitalized the NSTC in 2012, establishing a Committee on STEM Education. They restructured NSTC committees, emphasizing S&T input in public policy. Congress may decide on the roles of the OSTP Director and NSTC in the budget. Congress may choose to alter the roles and authorities of the OSTP Director and NSTC in the budget process, potentially empowering OSTP to review and adjust S&T funding priorities among federal agencies. However, such mandates could face resistance from agencies, leading to unintended consequences like the avoidance of S&T-related programs. Congress may require NSTC or OSTP to review agency budgets to align with multi-agency R&D strategies, increasing transparency but possibly requiring more funding and personnel. This could involve creating dedicated program offices to track and report on cross-cutting funding and efforts. Formalizing the NSTC structure with statutory support could provide Congress with greater insight into its activities. The NSTC could provide Congress with more insight through reporting requirements or regular reports from the OSTP Director. PCAST advises the President on science and technology issues, but its influence has declined according to experts. Presidents have shown varying levels of engagement with PCAST meetings. PCAST advises the President on science and technology issues. Unlike past administrations, President Obama and senior EOP officials had several focused discussions with PCAST co-chairs. Executive Order 13539 directs that PCAST is co-chaired by the APST and one of its members, reducing PCAST's independence. Administration staff are typically ex-officio members, not chairs of federal advisory committees. The APST's role as co-chair of PCAST may impact its independence and ability to provide unbiased advice to the White House. Suggestions to strengthen PCAST include broadening its mandate, enhancing independence, and providing security clearances to all members. President Obama authorized the APST to request changes within PCAST. President Obama authorized the APST to request security clearances for PCAST members to undertake national security studies. Suggestions include creating new advisory committees focused on specific S&T policy issues, but the costs and requirements of the Federal Advisory Committee Act may pose challenges to their establishment. Establishing new presidential advisory committees may be complicated by the requirements of the Federal Advisory Committee Act, including membership justification and ethics rules. Congress could provide additional funding to OSTP for this purpose. OSTP noted that President Obama increased PCAST's role by acting on its recommendations. In response to PCAST recommendations, actions were taken to fund new initiatives such as an influenza vaccine manufacturing improvement initiative, preparation of additional STEM teachers, adoption of Electronic Health Records, establishment of the Advanced Manufacturing Partnership, and a Quadrennial Technology Review at the Department of Energy. OSTP stated that PCAST met six times per year during the Obama Administration. During the Obama Administration, PCAST met more frequently compared to the George W. Bush Administration. OSTP provided PCAST with staff and financial resources to develop reports efficiently. PCAST released more reports during the Obama Administration than the Bush Administration. PCAST released 26 reports through January 2015, including Appendix A on President's Science and Technology Policy Advisors and Appendix B on Historical OSTP Funding."
