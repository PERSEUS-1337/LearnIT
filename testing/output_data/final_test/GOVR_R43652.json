    "content": "The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposed carbon dioxide (CO2) emission guidelines for states under Section 111(d) of the Clean Air Act in June 2014. The rule establishes state-specific CO2 emission rate goals measured in pounds of CO2 emissions per megawatt-hour (MWh) of electricity generation, known as carbon intensity. EPA based these goals on each state's emissions data. The EPA proposed state-specific CO2 emission rate goals for electricity generation, aiming to reduce emissions by 30% compared to 2005 levels by 2030. Goals are based on opportunities for efficiency improvements in coal-fired plants, increased use of natural gas, renewable energy sources, and energy efficiency measures. The EPA proposed state-specific CO2 emission rate goals for electricity generation, aiming to reduce emissions by 30% compared to 2005 levels by 2030. The report discusses the methodology EPA used to establish the state-specific CO2 emission rate goals based on a 2012 baseline year. It explains the process of creating state-specific 2012 emission rate baselines and the four categories of emission reduction opportunities used to determine the interim and 2030 emission rate goals for each state. EPA established state-specific CO2 emission rate goals based on 2012 baselines. The baseline year selection is crucial for states with existing regulations that impact emissions. EPA used 2012 data for accuracy, as it reflected historic performance at the state level. The EPA used data from eGRID and NEEDS to establish state-specific CO2 emission rate goals based on 2012 baselines. The agency considered using average fossil generation and emission rate values over a baseline period but found little variation compared to using 2012 data due to the rate-based nature of the goal. The 2012 state baselines for CO2 emissions from electric generating units (EGUs) are addressed in the proposal. The emission rate goals apply to affected EGUs, which are fossil fuel-fired units with specific criteria including a base load rating greater than 73 MW, combustion of fossil fuel for more than 10% of total annual heat input, and selling a certain amount of electricity to the grid. The EPA defines \"affected EGUs\" as fossil fuel-fired units with a base load rating greater than 73 MW, combustion of fossil fuel for more than 10% of total annual heat input, and selling a specific amount of electricity to a utility distribution system. In 2012, there were over 3,100 affected EGUs at 1,508 facilities in the United States, with varying numbers per state. The affected EGUs were categorized into coal-fired steam generation, oil and gas steam generation, natural gas combined cycle generation, and other fossil sources like IGCC units and combustion turbine units. EPA used CO2 emissions and electricity generation data to establish state baselines for these EGUs. The EPA separated data from \"other\" sources like IGCC units and combustion turbine units, which account for 1% of total U.S. electricity generation and CO2 emissions. To establish state baselines, EPA calculated CO2 emissions from affected EGUs and divided by electricity generated to determine emission rates. This resulted in \"unadjusted\" emission rates, which were then adjusted to establish final 2012 baselines for each state. The EPA adjusted the 2012 baseline emission rate for each state by adding elements like \"at-risk\" nuclear power and renewable energy generation to the equation. They estimated that 5.8% of total U.S. nuclear power capacity was at risk of being retired in the near future, leading to the projection of at-risk nuclear power for each state with operating nuclear units in 2012. The EPA projected outcomes for states based on factors like increasing operation costs, low electricity prices, and capital investments for security. Renewable energy generation was included in state baseline calculations to determine emission rate goals. Different emission rate baselines were calculated for each state, and EPA proposed four categories of CO2 reduction strategies for states to employ. The EPA proposed four strategies, known as \"building blocks,\" to reduce states' CO2 emission rates. These strategies include efficiency improvements at power plants, switching to low-carbon power generation, increasing the use of low-carbon electricity generation, and reducing consumer demand for electricity. The EPA proposed four building blocks to reduce CO2 emission rates, including efficiency improvements at power plants and increasing low-carbon electricity generation. The 2030 emission rate goals equation includes adjustments for mass emission reductions from measures like renewable portfolio standards and energy efficiency improvements. The EPA proposed building block 1 to improve efficiency at coal-fired, steam EGUs to reduce CO2 emissions. This adjustment spreads emissions over a larger energy output, resulting in lower emission rates. The agency is seeking feedback on including heat rate improvements for IGCC units. EPA is considering including heat rate improvements at fossil-fuel EGUs to reduce CO2 emissions. These improvements could lead to a 6% decrease in coal-fired EGU heat rates, resulting in a proportional reduction in CO2 emissions. This would lower the CO2 emissions rate for affected EGUs by as much as 6%. Building block 1 decreases state emission rate goals by 0% to 6%, with higher impacts in states with more coal-fired electricity. Building block 2 shifts electricity generation from coal-fired units to lower-carbon units, reducing CO2 emission rates. Coal steam units emit 2,220 lbs. CO2/MWh, while NGCC units emit 907 lbs. CO2/MWh. As electricity demand fluctuates throughout the day, power plants are dispatched to meet the needs. Coal-fired plants are dispatched before NGCC units due to their slower ramp-up time and lower operating costs. EPA found potential to shift from coal to NGCC units, with NGCC units operating at 46% capacity in 2012, which could be increased to 70%. This increase in NGCC unit utilization is part of a strategy to reduce CO2 emissions. The utilization of NGCC units can be increased to 70% capacity factor to decrease generation from more carbon-intensive EGUs. For example, in Arizona, NGCC generation could increase from 26.8 million MWh to 52.1 million MWh, replacing generation from coal and OG steam EGUs. Building block 2 methodology increases NGCC generation to replace coal and OG steam EGUs, reducing Arizona's emission rate by 42%. Results do not dictate a specific outcome in electricity generation. Building blocks 1-2 impact state emission rate baselines. Building block 3 includes low- or zero-carbon sources in emission rate calculations. Building block 3 projects annual renewable energy increases for each state based on geographic location and power system characteristics. EPA determined a RE 2030 target for each region and calculated an annual growth rate to reach the target. EPA placed states into six regions to account for similarities in renewable energy potential. Table 3 shows the six regions, their targets, and growth rates for reaching specific goals by 2030. Targets range from 10% to 25%, with growth rates between 6% and 17%. The methodology results in varying targets and growth rates, such as the West region with a high target but low growth rate due to California's progress, and the Southeast region with low starting percentages but high growth rates. The Southeast states had low percentages of renewable energy (RE) generation in 2012 (0% to 3%), requiring high growth rates to meet regional targets by 2030. EPA uses region-specific growth rates to estimate annual RE generation from 2017 to 2030. If a state meets its 2030 target, its RE use remains constant. The 2012 RE baseline excludes hydroelectric generation to avoid distorting future development potential. RPS policies focus on new RE generation, often excluding existing hydroelectric facilities. EPA's methodology for regional RE targets does not consider new hydroelectric facilities, but states could increase hydroelectric power generation to reduce emissions. Table 4 shows states' RE levels in 2012 and projected generation in 2030. Half of the states may not reach their goals by 2030, while the other half could meet them, with some states already reaching their targets early on. In 2012, five states - Iowa, Maine, Minnesota, North Dakota, and South Dakota - already met or exceeded their regional renewable energy targets. The impact of building block 3 on states varies significantly, with some increasing their renewable energy generation by 2% while others by over 18%. EPA seeks feedback on whether calculations should include a renewable energy floor based on 2012 generation. The impact of building block 3 on states varies significantly, with some increasing their renewable energy generation by 2% while others by over 18%. EPA includes both \"at-risk\" and \"under construction\" nuclear power in the emission rate equation, which may lead to emission rate increases if states do not maintain their existing nuclear generation. The EPA includes \"at-risk\" and \"under construction\" nuclear power in the emission rate equation, potentially increasing emission rates if states do not maintain existing nuclear generation. At-risk nuclear generation lowered baselines in some states by up to 7%, with a stronger impact than building block 1. EPA identified five under-construction nuclear units in Georgia, South Carolina, and Tennessee, contributing to a significant percentage of total electricity generation in 2012. The EPA includes \"at-risk\" and \"under construction\" nuclear power in the emission rate equation, potentially increasing emission rates if states do not maintain existing nuclear generation. At-risk nuclear generation lowered baselines in some states by up to 7%, with a stronger impact than building block 1. EPA identified five under-construction nuclear units in Georgia, South Carolina, and Tennessee, contributing to a significant percentage of total electricity generation in 2012. Tennessee accounted for approximately 9 million MWh (11% of total electric generation in 2012). Anticipated units in the emission rate equation could lower emission rates, but if not completed, states may struggle to achieve their goals. The fourth building block includes avoided electricity generation from energy efficiency improvements, reducing state emission rates. The EPA identifies demand-side energy efficiency activities as key in reducing electricity generation. States have varying policies, with the most impactful ones driving EE programs and building codes. EPA calculates incremental EE savings based on best practices, representing the reduction in electricity use associated with new activities. This helps estimate avoided electricity generation and contributes to lowering emission rates. The EPA sets a performance target of 1.5% for states based on observed and expected achievements in energy efficiency savings. This target represents the reduction in fossil fuel-fired electricity generation resulting from accelerated energy efficiency policies. The EPA sets a performance target of 1.5% for states based on energy efficiency policies, with calculations starting in 2017 and building on savings achieved in 2012. States must maintain or improve energy efficiency levels to meet emission rate goals. The EPA determined that states would annually increase their energy efficiency (EE) performance by 0.2% starting in 2017, reaching a target of 1.5% by 2025. States are expected to sustain this level through 2030, with cumulative savings being a key factor in measuring EE improvements. The EPA's approach to measuring cumulative energy efficiency (EE) savings involves spreading the decline in savings over 20 years, rather than dropping to zero at year 11. This allows for a longer period of time to realize the overall EE savings. The EPA estimated cumulative energy efficiency savings for each state between 2020 and 2030, projecting reductions in electricity generation of 9% to 12% by 2030. This calculation considered state-specific inputs and regional electricity retail sales estimates. EPA applied annual cumulative reductions to total electricity sold in 2012, adjusting for states that import or export electricity. Some states import close to 50% of their electricity, while others export more than double the amount they use. West Virginia and other states export excess electricity generated in-state. EPA calculates cumulative energy efficiency reductions by adjusting for states that import or export electricity. For net importers like Delaware, reductions are applied to in-state sales. For net exporters, reductions only apply to in-state sales, not total generation. The resulting avoided electricity generation values are factored into the emission rate equation. Building block 4 impacts emission rate equation differently by state, especially in states with high reliance on hydroelectric and nuclear power. States like Washington, Idaho, and Oregon see a greater effect due to their significant hydropower generation. This is the only instance where hydroelectric power is included in the emission rate equation. The EE methodology also has a greater impact in states with high percentages of nuclear power generation. The methodology has a greater impact in states with high percentages of nuclear power generation, such as South Carolina and New Jersey. Building block 4 has less effect in states that export a substantial amount of electricity, like Wyoming, North Dakota, and West Virginia. The impact of the EE building block varies for states depending on their electricity generation sources. States with a high percentage of electricity from hydroelectric or nuclear power may struggle to reduce emission rates compared to other states. They may need to focus on energy efficiency improvements to meet their targets, as existing power sources may not provide sufficient reductions. The impact of building blocks on emission rate baselines varies depending on each state's electricity generation circumstances. Table 6 shows the incremental analysis of applying these blocks to reach the 2030 emission rate goal. Additionally, a state-by-state comparison using EPA's methodology highlights the isolated impacts of each building block. The impact of building blocks on emission rate baselines varies depending on each state's electricity generation circumstances. Table 7 illustrates the relative impacts of the four building blocks for each state. Building block 1 has the smallest impact, decreasing state emission rate goals by a range of 0% to 6%. States without coal-fired EGUs are unaffected by this block, while states with coal-fired units see significant impacts. Building block 2 has the largest incremental impact on emission rates, ranging from 0% to 38% compared to baseline. States with coal-fired EGUs and under-utilized NGCC plants see the greatest changes. Building block 3's nuclear component affects three states significantly, while the RE component reduces emission rate baselines by 9% on average. Impacts from the RE block range from 2% to 33%, with Washington experiencing a 33% reduction. Building block 4, along with block 2, has a significant impact on emission rate baselines, reducing them by an average of 13%. Factors such as in-state electricity generation sources and whether the state is a net importer or exporter of electricity contribute to the range of impacts, which can vary from 4% to 37%. The isolated application of building blocks provides a comparison of their effects. States have the flexibility to combine building blocks to meet emission rate targets, with EPA's goals not predicting specific outcomes in electricity generation profiles."
