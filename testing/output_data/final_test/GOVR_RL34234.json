    "content": "The report provides background on the global nuclear fuel cycle debate, including factors driving interest in nuclear power, the current state of the industry, and the interdependence of fuel cycle stages. Nuclear power in the U.S. is seeing growth, with new reactor license applications and uranium enrichment plant developments. However, there are no current plans for spent fuel reprocessing in the U.S., while other countries offer commercial reprocessing services. Renewed interest in expanding nuclear power has raised concerns about limiting the spread of nuclear weapons-relevant technology. The focus is on the nuclear fuel cycle, which includes facilities for making fuel for reactors or materials for weapons. Concerns have been heightened by cases of subversion of commercial uranium enrichment and reprocessing technologies for military purposes, such as A.Q. Khan selling sensitive technology to states like Libya and Iran. Efforts to control the spread of sensitive nuclear technology, like uranium enrichment, have been proposed by international nonproliferation leaders. Proposals aim to discourage new states from building enrichment facilities by offering alternative ways to guarantee nuclear fuel supplies. These proposals are not new but are variations of ideas from the 1970s, when efforts to limit nuclear fuel cycle technologies faced technical and political challenges. Despite these challenges, many states were deterred from pursuing enrichment and reprocessing. Efforts to limit access to the nuclear fuel cycle face challenges due to technical and financial costs, as well as a slump in the nuclear market. However, recent developments such as concerns about the spread of enrichment technology and the need for alternative energy sources may make these efforts more feasible. The debate revolves around developing proposals that can convince states to forgo their right to develop nuclear technology for peaceful purposes, while also improving the International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards system. The commercialization of nuclear power has faced challenges, with nuclear capacity reaching 372 gigawatts globally, providing 14% of electricity generation. High costs, safety issues, accidents, and waste disposal controversies have hindered further expansion. The worldwide growth of nuclear power was slowed by high operating costs, safety problems, accidents, and controversy over nuclear waste disposal. Reprocessing and fast breeder technology were developed to capture remaining energy in spent nuclear fuel. However, in the 1980s, declining fossil fuel prices and increased uranium supplies led to a standstill in developing fast breeder reactors. The Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear plant accident in March 2011 prompted renewed interest in nuclear power globally. The Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear plant accident in 2011 led to some countries reconsidering their nuclear expansion plans, while others like China continued building reactors. Safety concerns aside, volatile oil and natural gas prices are driving national energy policies, prompting governments to seek alternative energy sources like nuclear power. Nuclear power's potential to substitute for oil and gas is limited due to their low share in electricity generation. Long-term changes in energy-use patterns, especially in transportation, would be needed for nuclear power to significantly impact oil demand. Possibilities include using nuclear power to produce hydrogen for fuel-cell vehicles or recharging all-electric vehicles with nuclear-generated electricity. However, the development and adoption of such technologies would take many years. The development of new vehicles and hydrogen fuel infrastructure would take years to have a significant energy impact. Volatile oil and gas prices affect nuclear power's economic viability. Natural gas is the primary choice for new electrical generation, but higher prices could make nuclear power competitive. Concerns about greenhouse gas emissions have renewed interest in nuclear power's lack of CO2 emissions. President Obama's 2011 State of the Union address included nuclear power. Policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions may indirectly encourage nuclear power expansion due to increased costs of electricity from fossil-fuel-fired power plants. Some support for nuclear power to combat climate change has emerged, but environmental groups raise concerns about nuclear accidents, waste, and weapons proliferation risks outweighing any benefits. The renewed interest in nuclear power is driven by improved performance of existing reactors, leading to lower costs of nuclear-generated electricity. Despite not directly emitting greenhouse gases, nuclear power has indirect emissions through the fuel cycle and plant construction. Critics argue that the risks of proliferation outweigh any greenhouse gas benefits, advocating for investments in energy efficiency and renewable generation instead. Average U.S. reactor operations and maintenance costs have decreased steadily over the years, with nuclear plant operating costs in 2011 averaging about 2.2 cents/kwh. Incentives in the Energy Policy Act of 2005 have further increased interest in nuclear energy in the United States, with tax credits and loan guarantees playing a crucial role in determining the economic viability of new nuclear plants. In the past five years, plans have been announced for about 30 new commercial reactors in the U.S. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has issued early site permits for future reactor construction in Illinois, Mississippi, Virginia, and Georgia. Construction of the Watts Bar 2 reactor in Tennessee resumed in 2007 after a long delay. The NRC issued licenses for four new reactors in Georgia and South Carolina in early 2012. Plans for new reactors in the U.S. and other countries are also being considered. The majority of reactors under construction are in Asia, with few in the rest of the world. Despite recent positive developments, uncertainty remains about nuclear power's prospects due to high construction costs. U.S. nuclear plant construction costs have more than doubled in the past decades, making many plants uneconomic. The construction costs of new U.S. nuclear plants have increased significantly, with estimates exceeding $5,300 per kilowatt. Major reactor vendors believe that new designs and construction methods will lower costs, but the Energy Information Administration (EIA) remains skeptical. Uncertainty surrounds the future of nuclear power, as competing fuel prices, such as natural gas, continue to fluctuate. Support for nuclear power has been undermined due to high-level nuclear waste disposal controversies and accidents like Fukushima Dai-ichi, Three Mile Island, and Chernobyl. New reactor designs aim to improve safety, but concerns remain. There are currently 433 operating commercial nuclear reactors worldwide with a total capacity of 372 gigawatts. Nuclear power has an installed capacity of 372 gigawatts worldwide, with 83% in OECD countries and 13% in Russia and former Soviet bloc nations. In 2009, nuclear power supplied 21.5% of electricity in OECD countries and 4.7% in non-OECD countries. Construction of nuclear plants continues globally, with about 50 reactors starting up since 1996. Asia dominates current reactor construction. Reactor construction is dominated by Asia, with 44 out of 65 reactors under construction in Asia. Nearly 60% of the 483 planned or proposed reactors are also in Asia. The renewed interest in nuclear power has led to potential expansion to non-nuclear nations like Belarus, Egypt, Indonesia, and others. Several non-nuclear power countries, including Bangladesh, Chile, Israel, Malaysia, North Korea, and Saudi Arabia, have proposed building nuclear power plants. Iran began operating its first nuclear power plant in 2012. The International Atomic Energy Agency noted that the Fukushima Daiichi disaster made some developing countries more cautious about nuclear power, but interest in nuclear power remains among countries considering or planning for its introduction. In 2012, 14 non-nuclear power countries were considering a nuclear program, with three having ordered new reactors and six actively preparing for a possible nuclear power program. The possible increase in global nuclear power plant construction has brought new attention to nuclear fuel production. Despite the temporary decrease in demand due to the shutdown of Japanese nuclear plants after the Fukushima disaster, there is a shift towards tightening supplies, leading to higher prices for uranium and enrichment services. Plans for new fuel cycle facilities worldwide are being made, raising concerns about the control of nuclear fuel technology. The nuclear fuel cycle starts with mining uranium ore and processing it into yellowcake to increase the concentration of fissile 235 U for commercial reactors. To produce fuel for commercial reactors, uranium enrichment plants increase the concentration of 235 U above its natural level. Yellowcake is converted to uranium hexafluoride, enriched, and fabricated into fuel assemblies. Commercial enrichment and fabrication services are available globally. The nuclear fuel cycle begins with mining uranium ore, processing it into yellowcake, and then converting it into uranium oxide. The U.S. uranium production involves milling, acid-leaching, and in-situ leaching to extract uranium oxide, which is processed into yellowcake for shipment. The largest U.S. uranium reserves are in several states. In 2011, there were 5 underground mines and 5 in-situ mines operating, with a total of 1,191 person-years employed. 55 million pounds of U3O8 were purchased for U.S. nuclear power reactors in 2011. In 2011, 55 million pounds of U3O8 were purchased for U.S. nuclear power reactors, with 9% being of U.S. origin. The rest was sourced from imported natural uranium and enriched uranium, including downblended highly enriched uranium (HEU). Worldwide, approximately 64,400 metric tons of yellowcake were produced, meeting about 85% of global demand for U3O8. The World Nuclear Association predicts a potential uranium supply shortage by 2023, depending on various factors like downblended weapons HEU and production from new mines. The uranium market is monitored by private organizations like WNFM, TradeTech, and UxC, which provide price indicators for uranium. These indicators are used in market price sales contracts for future uranium delivery. In April 2007, NYMEX partnered with UxC to offer financially settled uranium futures contracts based on the UxC pricing index for yellowcake. Contracts are traded on Chicago Mercantile Exchange Globex and cleared on NYMEX ClearPort, with a size of 250 lb. Prices are quoted in U.S. currency, and the final settlement price is the spot month-end price published by UxC. A standard contract for trading physical uranium is in development, with over 70% of global production in 2011 coming from Kazakhstan, Canada, Australia, and Niger. Since the mid-1980s, world nuclear fuel requirements have been rising while uranium exploration and production have fallen. By 2000, the western world's nuclear fuel requirements were double the level of production, leading to pressure on U.S. spot prices. Commercial stockpiles had been drawn down, causing prices to rise slightly through 2003. Since the mid-1980s, uranium exploration and production have decreased, leading to pressure on U.S. spot prices. Prices rose slightly through 2003 and dramatically in 2007, reaching above $75 per pound. Despite low worldwide exploration expenditures, estimated uranium resources have increased over the long term. The OECD Nuclear Energy Agency states that new uranium resources can be easily identified when prices rise due to tightening supply. The uranium resource base is more than sufficient to meet projected requirements, even in high-case scenarios up to 2035. The NEA states that uranium requirements up to 2035 would consume less than half of the identified resources. Yellowcake is chemically processed into uranium hexafluoride gas, containing isotopes 238U and 235U. The U.S. annual demand for yellowcake conversion is 22,000 MTU, with ConverDyn in the U.S. having a capacity of 15,000 MTU. Five major commercial conversion companies operate globally for uranium enrichment. The enrichment process for uranium involves increasing the concentration of 235U to 3%-5% for use in light water reactors. Major enrichment plants are located in several countries, with most countries relying on enrichment services outside their borders. An enrichment plant to serve a country with only a few reactors may not be economically viable, as a single large enrichment plant can supply up to 25% of the world market. Commercial uranium enrichment uses gaseous diffusion or high-speed centrifuges to increase the concentration of 235U. Gaseous diffusion technology was first developed in the United States. The gaseous diffusion technology, initially developed in the United States, is more energy-intensive than centrifuge enrichment. The Georges Besse 1 plant in France closed in 2012, and the Paducah plant in Kentucky is set to close in 2013. Uranium enrichment services are sold in kilograms or metric tons separative work units (SWU), which measure the work needed to enhance 235U concentration. The number of SWUs required depends on factors like fuel quantity, enrichment level, initial feed enrichment, and tails assay. The price of yellowcake affects enrichment demand, with commercial services offering worldwide capacity of 57,350 metric tons SWU. In 2011, U.S. nuclear plant operators contracted in nine countries for 14,829 metric tons SWU, with 16% provided in the United States. The U.S. DOE had operated gaseous diffusion enrichment plants. The U.S. DOE operated gaseous diffusion enrichment plants in Oak Ridge, TN, Paducah, KY, and Portsmouth, OH, producing high-enriched uranium for nuclear weapons. Later, they produced low-enriched uranium for commercial nuclear power. The Energy Policy Act of 1992 established the United States Enrichment Corporation (USEC) to take over DOE's uranium enrichment services, which was privatized as USEC Inc. in 1998. USEC ceased uranium enrichment operations in Portsmouth in 2001 and consolidated operations in Paducah. In 2004, plans were announced to build the American Centrifuge Plant on the site of the Portsmouth plant, with an annual capacity of 3,800 metric tons SWU. The American Centrifuge Plant, with 11,500 centrifuges and an annual capacity of 3,800 metric tons SWU, had construction suspended in 2009 pending DOE approval of a loan guarantee. DOE funded a demonstration program to prove technical adequacy of USEC centrifuge technology for the loan guarantee. The Continuing Appropriations Resolution for FY2013 included $100 million for the demonstration program. The HEU Agreement with Russia converts highly enriched uranium from dismantled warheads into low-enriched uranium for U.S. nuclear power plants. USEC fulfills half its enrichment contracts with Russian HEU. Urenco, a multinational enrichment consortium, operates plants in Europe and the US, including the Louisiana Energy Services facility in New Mexico. The New Mexico plant is expected to meet 25% of US demand once fully operational in 2013. Urenco estimates it holds a 25% share of the global enrichment services market. Areva also started up a gas centrifuge plant in 2010. Areva started up the gas centrifuge plant Georges Besse II in France in 2010 to replace an older plant. They also applied for a license to build a similar plant in Idaho. Another company, Global Laser Enrichment, is pursuing laser enrichment technology with a plant in North Carolina. Concerns have been raised about the efficiency of laser enrichment technology. Concerns have been raised about the proliferation risk of laser enrichment technology in producing weapons-grade uranium. Fuel fabrication requires strict quality control to prevent fuel failure and leakage during reactor operations. After uranium enrichment, low-enriched uranium hexafluoride is converted to uranium dioxide at a fabrication plant. The UO2 powder is processed, compacted, granulated, and pressed into pellets, which are then sintered to a precise density. The pellets are ground to size and loaded into zirconium alloy tubes. Nuclear fuel rods are made by grinding pellets to the correct size and loading them into zirconium alloy tubes. These tubes are then attached together to form fuel assemblies, which can have square, circular, hexagonal, or triangular arrays. Fuel assemblies are customized to each reactor's specifications and are crucial for reactor operation. Fuel fabrication services for light water reactors are provided by a limited number of suppliers. Fuel fabrication services for light water reactors are offered by about a dozen suppliers in 14 countries at 20 facilities. The oversupply of LWR fuel fabrication capacity has existed for many years, with demand projected to rise to 9,500 tons by 2020. Three LWR fuel fabrication facilities are located in the United States. The final stages of the nuclear fuel cycle involve the splitting of uranium 235 in the reactor, releasing energy and creating fission products. Neutrons from fission reactions create highly radioactive fission products. Some neutrons are absorbed by 238 U to produce plutonium 239. As fuel assemblies age in the reactor, they become depleted in fissile 235 U and are considered spent nuclear fuel. Spent fuel contains 1% 235 U, 1% plutonium, 4% fission products, and the rest is 238 U. Disposal of spent fuel is a contentious issue, with options including deep geologic repositories or reprocessing. Reprocessing spent nuclear fuel involves separating uranium and plutonium for reuse in new fuel. Supporters argue it reduces waste volume and extracts more energy from uranium. However, opponents fear proliferation risks from commercial use of separated plutonium. Reprocessing is done in France, Britain, and Russia, with facilities capable of processing hundreds of metric tons of spent fuel per year. Reprocessing spent nuclear fuel involves separating uranium and plutonium for reuse in new fuel. Countries like Russia, Japan, Britain, France, and India have plants with varying capacities for reprocessing fuel. MOX fuel is used in nuclear power plants, but the benefits are modest. Light water reactors use thermal neutrons to sustain a nuclear chain reaction efficiently. In nuclear fuel reprocessing, low quantities of specific isotopes are needed to sustain a chain reaction using low-enriched uranium. Thermal neutrons are limited in inducing fission in certain isotopes, leading to the buildup of non-fissile plutonium. Fast neutrons, on the other hand, can induce fission in all actinides, including plutonium isotopes. Fast reactors require a higher proportion of fissionable isotopes to sustain a chain reaction, but can fission all actinides efficiently. Fast reactors have the ability to fission all actinides efficiently, including plutonium isotopes. This allows for the separation and reuse of materials from spent fuel, ultimately converting natural uranium into usable nuclear fuel. While reprocessing programs are seen as steps towards a commercial nuclear fuel cycle based on fast reactors, critics argue that commercializing fast reactor technology has been challenging. Opponents and supporters debate the benefits of fast reactors in extending uranium supplies and reducing plutonium in nuclear waste. Opponents and supporters debate the benefits of reprocessing nuclear waste to extract plutonium and extend uranium supplies. While reprocessing can reduce long-term radioactivity, the resulting waste still poses short-term disposal challenges due to high heat levels. Various proposals are being considered to address these issues. Various proposals have been made to separate cesium 137 and strontium 90 from high-level nuclear waste for separate storage and decay over several hundred years, increasing repository capacity. Energy security is a driving force behind nuclear energy development, especially in countries with limited natural resources like France and Japan. Recent oil and gas supply cutoffs worldwide highlight the benefits of nuclear energy as a more stable alternative. In 2007, price disputes caused temporary oil cutoffs to Western and Central Europe. Production shutdowns and instability in various regions raised concerns about oil and gas supplies. Uranium stockpiling offers more assurance against cutoffs, but nuclear electricity is not a direct substitute for oil in transportation. Worldwide uranium resources are considered sufficient for several decades, with a diversified supply chain. Countries like China, India, and Japan are securing long-term uranium contracts to support nuclear expansion goals. Efforts are being made to establish an international nuclear fuel bank for greater certainty in fuel supplies. Developing breeder reactors, reprocessing, and plutonium fuel fabrication could provide complete nuclear energy independence for countries like France, Japan, and Russia. Proposals aim to prevent states from developing their own nuclear fuel production capabilities to avoid an increase in the number of states capable of producing weapons-usable nuclear material. Various proposals focus on providing economically attractive alternatives to address concerns about politically motivated interruptions to fuel supply. IAEA Director General Mohamed El Baradei proposed a three-pronged approach to limit the production of weapons-usable nuclear material in civilian nuclear fuel cycles, including placing enrichment and reprocessing facilities under multinational control and developing proliferation-resistant fuel cycle technologies. El Baradei proposed multinational management of spent fuel and radioactive waste, inclusive of all states, without nonproliferation requirements. He emphasized achieving parity among states without relying on nuclear weapons. An Expert Group report on \"Multilateral Approaches to the Nuclear Fuel Cycle\" was presented in February 2005. The Expert Group report \"Multilateral Approaches to the Nuclear Fuel Cycle\" analyzed ways to secure proliferation-sensitive nuclear fuel cycle activities. Suggestions included reinforcing market mechanisms, converting facilities to multinational ones, and creating jointly owned facilities. Countries will participate based on economic and political incentives. No legal framework exists for requiring states to join supply assurance. The report highlighted the lack of a legal framework for states to join supply assurance arrangements. The IAEA sponsored a conference in 2006 on fuel assurances, with a report presented in 2007 analyzing various proposals. A potential framework for nuclear supply assurances could include existing market arrangements, back-up commitments by suppliers, and a physical LEU material reserve. Participation in these arrangements should be voluntary and progress will be incremental. Many options should be explored to provide consumer states with sufficient choices. President Bush proposed closing a loophole in the NPT to prevent states from acquiring nuclear material for weapons. He suggested that the Nuclear Suppliers Group refuse to sell enrichment and reprocessing equipment to states without full-scale plants. He also called for reliable access to fuel for civilian reactors if states renounce enrichment and reprocessing. Bush's 2004 proposal called for countries to renounce enrichment or reprocessing technologies in exchange for nuclear fuel access, which was controversial. In 2006, Putin proposed the Global Nuclear Power Infrastructure initiative, including international cooperation on uranium enrichment, reprocessing, training staff, and research on proliferation-resistant technology. Fuel cycle centers would be commercial joint ventures with joint ownership and no state financing. Putin's proposal involves commercial joint ventures for co-management of fuel cycle services, with advisory boards including government, industry, and IAEA professionals. The IAEA would have an advisory role but no voting power. Russia has offered Iran a similar arrangement for jointly enriching uranium on Russian territory. Progress has been made in establishing the IUEC and an LEU reserve at Angarsk. Russia has established a center of excellence for nuclear personnel at Obninsk and participates in joint research efforts on fast reactors. In May 2006, six governments proposed a \"Concept for a Multilateral Mechanism for Reliable Access to Nuclear Fuel\" limited to states without enrichment and reprocessing capabilities. The Six Country Concept proposes a backup mechanism for the supply of low enriched uranium (LEU) for nuclear fuel. If a commercial supply relationship is interrupted, the IAEA can be approached for backup supply. The recipient must meet certain qualifications, and the IAEA would facilitate new arrangements with alternative suppliers to ensure a continuous supply. Two mechanisms were proposed to create multiple tiers of assurances for nuclear fuel supply: standard backup provision in commercial contracts and reserves of LEU. The Six Country Concept and the World Nuclear Association outlined longer-term options for reliable access to reprocessing capabilities, multilateral cooperation in fuel fabrication, international enrichment centers, and new fuel cycle technology development. The WNA proposal envisions a system of supply assurances starting with normal market operations. The WNA proposal suggests a system of supply assurances for nuclear fuel, starting with normal market procedures and utilizing a network of suppliers through the IAEA if needed. A backup supply clause in enrichment contracts would be supported by governments and the IAEA, with multiple enrichers sharing the responsibility. Fuel fabrication backup supply system would be more complex. The WNA report highlights the complexity and cost of implementing a backup supply system for fuel fabrication. It emphasizes the need for assurances in the back-end nuclear fuel cycle to prevent proliferation concerns. Japan also presented a complementary proposal at the IAEA in 2006, focusing on reprocessing spent fuel at affordable prices for states without indigenous programs. Japan proposed an \"IAEA Standby Arrangements System\" as an alternative to the Six Country Concept at the IAEA in September 2006. This system would serve as an early warning mechanism to prevent supply disruptions, with an annual updated list of supply capacities and a virtual bank of front-end fuel cycle services. The United Kingdom also suggested a political assurance of non-interference in commercial nuclear contracts. The UK proposed a nuclear fuel assurance (NFA) as a government-to-government agreement with recipient states, ensuring export approvals for nuclear fuel enrichment services only withheld in case of non-proliferation non-compliance. The IAEA would co-sign the agreement. The UK proposed a nuclear fuel assurance agreement with recipient states, ensuring export approvals for enrichment services. The IAEA would make the final decision on export conditions. Fuel reserves aim to provide supply assurance in case of disruptions. Two fuel banks have been approved by the IAEA Board of Governors. The United States announced in 2005 that surplus highly enriched uranium would be downblended to low-enriched uranium for a fuel reserve. This reserve aims to support nuclear power expansion and curb proliferation, providing fuel in case of disruptions. The U.S. announced in 2005 the creation of a fuel reserve to support nuclear power expansion and curb proliferation. The reserve, separate from the IAEA fuel bank, will provide low-enriched uranium to domestic and foreign plants after exhausting other options. Recipients must meet nonproliferation criteria, and stringent U.S. requirements include safeguards, consent for enrichment/reprocessing, and the right of return. Foreign recipients facing supply disruptions would obtain fuel through their U.S. supplier. The price of the uranium would be established accordingly. The Federal Register notice specifies that the price of low enriched uranium (LEU) will be determined at the time of delivery using market indices. The DOE's Fissile Material Disposition program manages the initiative to downblend 17.4 MT of highly enriched uranium (HEU) to produce 290 MT of LEU. WesDyne International, LLC, and Nuclear Fuel Services, Inc., are responsible for downblending and storing the material, with WesDyne selling a small fraction of the resulting LEU to cover project costs. Approximately 230 MT of the LEU will be reserved for reactor core reloads. The downblending of 12.1 MT of HEU to 220 MT of LEU is planned to ensure fuel supply for the MOX program. The LEU will be stored at Westinghouse's Columbia Fuel Fabrication Facility. An IAEA-owned LEU fuel bank was approved to meet fuel fabrication needs for reactors. Access to the bank requires the Director General's approval based on specific conditions. The IAEA fuel bank was established with monetary pledges from donors, with Kazakhstan offering to host it. The location for the reserve is yet to be finalized, and an agreement between the host government and the IAEA is needed. Nonproliferation conditions are placed on the transferred fuel, and the recipient country must pay the IAEA at the current market rate before receiving the LEU. Former Senator Sam Nunn pledged $50 million towards the initiative in September 2006. Sam Nunn, co-chairman of the Nuclear Threat Initiative (NTI), announced a $50 million pledge for a low-enriched uranium stockpile managed by the IAEA. The establishment of the reserve would ensure a non-discriminatory supply of nuclear fuel to recipient states. Additional contributions from various countries and organizations were made towards the initiative. The Union and Kuwait pledged funds for a fuel bank in 2008 and 2009, with no policy conditions set by donor countries. Kazakhstan proposed hosting the fuel bank in 2009. The IAEA presented draft plans for the fuel bank to the Board of Governors in June 2009, along with proposals for Russian and German-hosted banks. Some developing countries opposed negotiating details at the September 2009 Board meeting, citing concerns about potential infringements on their NPT rights. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 authorized $50 million for the International Atomic Energy Agency Nuclear Fuel Bank. Both the House and Senate Energy and Water Appropriations bills recommended funding for an international nuclear fuel bank under the IAEA. The Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2008 also supported the establishment of a fuel bank. The Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2008 allocated $50 million for the creation of a low-enriched uranium stockpile for an International Nuclear Fuel Bank under the International Atomic Energy Agency. The U.S. Secretary of Energy donated nearly $50 million to the IAEA for this purpose. The IAEA received the contribution, which was held in a suspense account until the Board of Governors approved the LEU bank. The IAEA Director General was authorized to sign an agreement with Russia to establish an LEU fuel reserve at Angarsk in November 2009. The IAEA Director General attended the opening of an LEU fuel reserve at Angarsk in December 2010. The reserve, funded by the Russian government, consists of 120 MT of LEU in UF6 form with an enrichment level of 2% to 4.95%. It is available to non-nuclear-weapon state members of the IAEA facing supply disruptions, who must apply to the IAEA for access. The director general assesses eligibility based on safeguards agreements and nuclear material accountability. The IAEA Director General ensures all nuclear material is accounted for, no diversion or safeguards issues exist. Countries can request fuel from Russia at market rates without waiving fuel cycle rights. Proposals include multinational uranium enrichment centers like the IUEC in Russia and Germany's Multilateral Enrichment Sanctuary Program. URENCO demonstrates a commercial model for uranium enrichment. The International Uranium Enrichment Center (IUEC), established by Russia, operates at Angarsk with partners Kazakhstan, Armenia, and Ukraine. Participants receive dividends from profits, with shareholders including Rosatom, Kazatomprom, Ukraine's State Concern Nuclear Fuel, and Armenian NPP. The IUEC offers a multilateral commercial model for uranium enrichment, addressing concerns about nuclear technology rights under the NPT. Germany proposed in May 2007 to build a new enrichment facility under IAEA ownership in an extraterritorial area. An independent management board would run the plant on a commercial basis, with the IAEA deciding on enriched fuel supply based on nonproliferation criteria. This approach aims to provide a commercially viable, politically neutral option for fuel supply and create competition in the world market. The proposal for a new enrichment facility under IAEA ownership aims to provide a commercially viable, politically neutral option for fuel supply and create competition on the world market. Multilateral proposals for the end of the fuel cycle, including on-site storage of spent fuel and reprocessing into mixed-oxide fuel, are being considered to prevent the spread of reprocessing technology for weapons purposes. The debate over uranium enrichment technology continues as countries are hesitant to agree to multilateral approaches that may limit their right to develop this technology for peaceful purposes. International cooperation on advanced reactors and research ventures, such as the Generation IV International Forum (GIF) and IAEA's INPRO, is ongoing. The establishment of an international spent fuel repository, possibly in Russia, is also being considered, although public opposition remains a concern. The International Framework for Nuclear Energy Cooperation (IFNEC) aims to promote collaboration on nuclear energy initiatives. The Global Nuclear Energy Partnership (GNEP) was initiated in 2006 to develop proliferation-resistant reprocessing technology and encourage reprocessing capacity in advanced countries. Representatives of 16 countries signed GNEP's Statement of Principles in 2007. GNEP's domestic activities included the DOE's Advanced Fuel Cycle Initiative (AFCI) to develop spent fuel reprocessing technology. The Obama Administration rejected AFCI's goal of commercializing advanced reprocessing technology quickly. The program was refocused on research and development, renamed Fuel Cycle Research and Development. GNEP became IFNEC in 2010, focusing on international cooperation for peaceful nuclear energy use. The International Framework for Nuclear Energy Cooperation (IFNEC) aims to broaden international participation in exploring key issues related to nuclear energy use worldwide. Initially known as the Global Nuclear Energy Partnership (GNEP), it focused on a consortium of nations providing fuel services and reactors to countries refraining from certain fuel cycle activities. The Global Nuclear Energy Partnership (GNEP) aimed to establish a system for supplier states to take back spent fuel, although public opposition was strong. The concept of a \"cradle to grave\" nuclear fuel management system is still present in IFNEC. Skeptics questioned the nonproliferation benefits of reprocessing technology developed under AFCI. The White House directed Energy Secretary Steven Chu to establish the Blue Ribbon Commission to address these issues. Energy Secretary Steven Chu established the Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future in 2010 to recommend a new national strategy for managing spent nuclear fuel and high-level waste. The Commission's final report in 2012 supported efforts for spent fuel 'take-away' arrangements and research on advanced reactor and fuel cycle technologies, including the UREX+ separations technology. The UREX+ process offers potential nonproliferation benefits over conventional reprocessing methods like PUREX. However, critics argue that UREX+ fuel may not pass the proliferation-resistance test due to its high plutonium content. Richard Garwin highlighted concerns that terrorists could easily divert UREX+ fuel to obtain weapons-grade plutonium. The Obama Administration has shifted focus away from UREX processes in the Fuel Cycle Research and Development program. The DOE FY2011 budget justification states that the Research and Development program has shifted focus from UREX processes to long-term research supporting various technology options. Concerns were raised about how the Global Nuclear Energy Partnership (GNEP) could impact global plutonium stockpiles. Frank Von Hippel criticized GNEP for potentially increasing the global plutonium stockpile through costly recycling programs. GNEP's effectiveness in achieving its goals was also questioned, as it aimed to incentivize the back end of the fuel cycle. GNEP aimed to attract states to participate in fuel supply assurances by offering incentives for the back end of the fuel cycle. Critics doubted the achievability of GNEP's vision due to the need for significant policy changes and commercialization of new technologies. The program marked a departure from the U.S. policy of not encouraging the use of plutonium in civil nuclear fuel cycles. Critics of GNEP questioned the policy of not separating pure plutonium, citing concerns about terrorist interest in acquiring nuclear material. A 2007 study recommended scaling back research on new reprocessing plants and criticized the DOE's timeline for the program. Congress criticized DOE's accelerated schedule for GNEP, expressing concerns over the ambitious timeline for developing fuel cycle demonstration facilities by FY2020. U.S. policy recognizes 10 states with enrichment capability, but defining suppliers and recipients has been challenging. Argentina's Pilcaniyeu plant is under safeguards but has never operated commercially and may not be cost-effective. Brazil's Resende enrichment plant is still in early stages and won't be commercially operational for years. Several countries, including Australia, Canada, South Africa, Ukraine, and South Korea, are considering developing enrichment capabilities for export. South Korea is also interested in building an enrichment plant for its nuclear fleet and fuel exports. Additionally, South Korea aims to become a GNEP/IFNEC supplier state through pyroprocessing technology. The United States has previously rejected South Korea's requests for reprocessing U.S.-origin spent fuel. The Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) has informal restrictions on transferring enrichment, reprocessing, and heavy water technology to states outside the group. After revelations about a covert nuclear technology network, NSG countries tightened restrictions and established criteria for recipient states. In 2011, the NSG made amendments to its guidelines. The NSG amended Sections 6 and 7 of its Guidelines, adding nonproliferation criteria for potential recipients, including being an NPT state-party, having safeguards agreements, no breaches, bilateral agreements with suppliers, commitment to physical protection standards, effective export controls, and adherence to NSG guidelines. Recipient states must have an Additional Protocol or appropriate safeguards agreements with the IAEA. The NSG amended its guidelines to include nonproliferation criteria for potential recipients of nuclear materials, such as being an NPT state-party, having safeguards agreements, and commitment to physical protection standards. Special provisions were made for the transfer of enrichment facilities, equipment, and technology, with suppliers required to prevent replication of transferred technology. Safety and regulatory information should be shared without divulging enabling technology. Discussions also included subjective criteria like general stability conditions. The NSG amended its guidelines to include nonproliferation criteria for potential recipients of nuclear materials, with special provisions for the transfer of enrichment facilities. Controversial subjective criteria were also considered, leading to revisions in June 2011. Turkey raised objections to certain criteria during the 2010 NSG plenary meeting. Argentina, Brazil, and South Africa had previously objected to the Additional Protocol as a condition. Brazil and South Africa objected to the Additional Protocol as a condition of supply, which could exempt them from the requirement. Developing countries are cautious of additional obstacles to accessing nuclear technology. Some suggest fuel assurance proposals or commercial arrangements could address the issue without changing NSG rules. Only South Korea is actively seeking enrichment or reprocessing capability. New enrichment plants have been built based on a \"black box\" model. The Group of Eight (G-8) Nations have made joint policy statements on the transfer of enrichment equipment, facilities, and technology. They announced a suspension of transfers from 2004 to 2007 and agreed on conditions for future transfers in 2008. In 2010, they reaffirmed their commitment to reducing proliferation. The 2010 G-8 Summit reaffirmed the commitment to reduce proliferation risks associated with enrichment and reprocessing facilities. They welcomed progress made by the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) on strengthening controls on transfers of such items and technology. Despite lack of consensus, they agreed to implement proposals from the NSG's \"clean text\" on a national basis. They urged the NSG to reach consensus for global implementation of a strengthened mechanism on transfers. The 2010 G-8 Summit reaffirmed the commitment to reduce proliferation risks associated with enrichment and reprocessing facilities. Various proposals have been made since the 1940s to restrict sensitive nuclear fuel technology development, with the International Atomic Energy Agency established in 1957 to address proliferation concerns. In the 1970s and 1980s, there were numerous proposals to address nuclear proliferation issues, including the idea of regional nuclear fuel cycle centers. However, factors such as low uranium prices, a slump in the nuclear industry, and U.S. opposition to reprocessing hindered its success. The International Fuel Cycle Evaluation (INFCE) project involving 60 countries suggested a multi-tiered assurance of supply mechanism. Discussions on international plutonium storage in the late 1970s and early 1980s did not lead to a consensus on defining excess material. The success of current proposals for nuclear energy revival globally depends on significant support through policy, price supports, and incentives. Factors that may improve nuclear energy's position include higher prices for other sources, improved reactor designs, regulatory improvements, and waste disposal solutions. Fuel recipient states' willingness to participate in international enrichment centers and confidence in fuel supply assurance mechanisms will largely determine the outcome. The success of nuclear energy revival globally depends on support through policy, price supports, and incentives. Participation in international fuel supply assurance mechanisms will determine the prevention of further spread of enrichment and reprocessing technologies. Recipient states express concerns about their right to peaceful nuclear energy technology. Incentives beyond cost-effectiveness may be necessary to discourage countries from developing their own fuel enrichment programs. The success of nuclear energy revival globally depends on policy support and incentives. Iran's experience with nuclear enrichment services on Russian soil has not been successful, highlighting the need for broader trade incentives. Non-nuclear-weapon states are closely watching how the situation with Iran unfolds. Congress plays a significant role in overseeing funding for U.S. nuclear energy programs and international supply assurance measures. The United States must consider guarantees for providing fuel assurances in exchange for assistance. The Six Country Concept includes a fuel bank option without requiring participants to give up enrichment and reprocessing. Policy issues may arise with the International Framework for Nuclear Energy Cooperation, questioning its nonproliferation benefits and alignment with other programs like the IAEA. The new mission statement emphasizes retaining rights under the NPT for peaceful nuclear energy use. Policymakers may need to assess if the program encourages states enough to refrain from enrichment and reprocessing, a key goal of the original GNEP. Some observers believe that further restrictions on non-nuclear-weapon states party to the NPT are untenable without substantial disarmament commitments by nuclear weapon states. Non-nuclear-weapon states are skeptical of the sincerity of nuclear weapon states in disarmament efforts. President Obama called for the eventual elimination of nuclear weapons in 2009. Non-nuclear-weapon states may not accept limits on NPT Article IV rights without progress on disarmament under Article VI. Amending the NPT is considered unattainable. The IAEA experts report highlighted the importance of a ban on producing fissile material for nuclear weapons. The Obama Administration plans to negotiate a treaty with verification provisions, requiring Senate approval. Congress also plays a role in approving nuclear cooperation agreements, with potential controversies over fuel cycle facilities. The United States signed a memorandum of understanding with the United Arab Emirates for civilian nuclear cooperation, which includes a commitment to forgo domestic enrichment and reprocessing capabilities. The agreement allows the US to end cooperation if the UAE acquires such facilities, and there is proposed legislation to require this commitment in all nuclear cooperation agreements."
