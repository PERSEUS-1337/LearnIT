    "content": "The HOME Investment Partnerships Program, established by the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act of 1990, is a federal block grant program administered by HUD. It provides funding for affordable housing activities to states and localities, allowing them to support rental and homeownership housing activities for low-income households. The program's history, allowable uses of funds, program requirements, funding information, and concerns about the nation's housing in the late 1980s are discussed in this report. In the late 1980s, there was growing concern about the state of the nation's housing, including issues like homelessness, sub-standard housing, and decreasing homeownership opportunities. A National Housing Task Force was created to address these issues, and in March 1988, they reported a diminishing supply of affordable housing for low-income households. Some members of the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs suggested that federal funding for housing programs was inadequate to meet the identified needs. The Housing Task Force identified a lack of affordable housing and argued for increased federal funding dedicated to affordable housing. Existing programs were limited in their flexibility and funding allocation for affordable housing needs. The Housing Task Force advocated for increased federal funding for affordable housing, leading to the passage of the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act in 1990. This law aimed to improve housing conditions for all Americans and introduced new programs like the HOME Investment Partnerships Program. The HOME program is a block grant program under the NAHA that provides funding for affordable housing for low-income households. It allows states and localities flexibility in achieving their housing goals and can be used for rental and owner-occupied housing. The program aims to leverage federal funding to attract other investments in affordable housing and strengthen the capacity of government and nonprofit organizations to meet local housing needs. HUD issued a final rule in July 2013, making significant revisions to certain program requirements. The HOME program, a block grant program under NAHA, provides funding for affordable housing for low-income households. HUD made significant revisions to program requirements in 2013, the first changes since 1996. This section outlines the structure of the HOME program, including eligibility requirements for states and localities, uses of program funds, and housing quality standards. The \"HOME Program Funding\" section explains how funds are allocated, with 40% going to states and 60% to eligible localities based on a formula. Congress appropriates funding annually, and HUD uses a formula to distribute funds. Localities must meet specific funding thresholds to become participating jurisdictions and receive HOME funds. They need to qualify for a minimum amount of funding under the formula, usually $500,000, and dedicate at least $750,000 to affordable housing activities. Localities that do not meet requirements to become participating jurisdictions may form consortia with other localities to reach funding thresholds. States without local allocations receive increased grant amounts. Eligible states or localities must submit a Consolidated Plan to HUD for approval before receiving HOME funds. Once designated a PJ, they remain eligible for funding. A participating jurisdiction (PJ) can receive HOME funds unless its designation is revoked by the Secretary of HUD for non-compliance. PJs can administer funds themselves or designate a subrecipient. Funds can be distributed to various organizations for specific projects, including developers, CHDOs, and private entities. To receive HOME funding, a state or locality must submit a Consolidated Plan to HUD, covering a three- to five-year period and detailing housing needs and how funds will be used. The plan also outlines leveraging HOME funds to attract other sources of funding for affordable housing and prioritizes projects by type and location. Participating jurisdictions must specify which activities they intend to fund as part of the planning process. PJs submit annual Action Plans describing activities to address housing needs and make progress towards goals in the Consolidated Plan. Community participation, especially by low- and moderate-income individuals, is emphasized in developing the plan. HUD implemented changes to the Consolidated Planning process in 2012, providing additional data. HUD implemented changes to the Consolidated Planning process in 2012, providing additional data and mapping tools for PJs to use. The public can access these tools to be more informed participants in the planning process. Consolidated Plans must now be submitted through a standardized template in IDIS, making it easier for PJs to produce and submit plans. These changes are expected to help PJs better reflect local needs and increase public participation in the planning process. HUD's HOME program allows states and localities flexibility in addressing affordable housing needs through a variety of activities. These activities include rehabilitating owner-occupied housing and providing assistance to home buyers. The program aims to increase the supply of affordable housing for low-income households. The HOME program offers assistance to home buyers, rental housing activities, and tenant-based rental assistance. Funds can be used for acquiring, rehabilitating, or constructing homes. Rental assistance is tenant-based, and up to 10% of funds can be used for administrative purposes. Preference is given to rehabilitating existing units. The HOME program allows participating jurisdictions to use funds for various housing activities, including grants, loans, and equity investments. Certain activities are ineligible for funding, such as modernizing public housing and providing tenant-based rental assistance under the Section 8 program. The HOME program allows jurisdictions to use funds for housing activities to increase affordable housing for low-income households. Funds must meet income targeting requirements and be used for owner-occupied housing. The HOME program requires that funds used for owner-occupied housing or rental assistance benefit households with incomes at or below 80% of area median income. Rental units must be occupied by households with incomes at or below 60% of area median income, ensuring affordability for low-income households in the long term. HOME-assisted units must meet requirements to remain affordable for low-income households. For home buyers, the purchase price must be no more than 95% of the median price in the area, and the buyer must belong to a low-income family using the home as their primary residence. The housing assisted with HOME funds must meet affordability requirements for low-income households. The purchase price after rehabilitation should not exceed 95% of the median price in the area. Home buyer units must remain affordable for 5-15 years, depending on the amount of HOME funds used. Resale or recapture restrictions must be imposed on assisted units, requiring them to be sold to another low-income buyer or return proceeds to cover HOME funds invested. Newly constructed housing must meet energy-efficiency standards. Owner-occupied housing rehabilitated with HOME funds must meet requirements such as belonging to a low-income family and using the proceeds of the sale to cover recapture. Resale and recapture restrictions ensure affordability for low-income buyers and recapture of investment for future HOME-assisted housing. The HOME program requires owner-occupied housing to be occupied by low-income families and limits the value of housing after rehabilitation. Rental housing must also be occupied by low-income households and adhere to HUD's maximum rent limits. The HOME program requires rental units to be occupied by low-income households with rents based on fair market rates or 30% of adjusted income. Additionally, at least 20% of HOME-assisted units must be occupied by families with incomes at or below 50% of the area median income. If current tenants' income increases, vacancies must be filled according to these requirements to remain in compliance. The HOME program requires rental units to meet occupancy requirements based on income levels and fair market rates. Units must comply with energy-efficiency standards for newly constructed housing and be available to Section 8 voucher holders. PJs must repay HOME funds if units are not rented to eligible tenants within 18 months. Restrictions on minimum and maximum HOME fund contributions apply to different housing activities. The HOME program sets limits on subsidy amounts and tenant contributions for owner-occupied and rental housing projects. The maximum per-unit subsidy varies by jurisdiction and is based on FHA mortgage limits. For tenant-based rental assistance, the subsidy is the difference between 30% of the household's income and a rent limit set by the jurisdiction. Minimum tenant contributions are also required. The HOME program requires a minimum tenant contribution for tenant-based rental assistance, which can be a flat dollar amount or a percentage of tenant income. HOME funds can be combined with other federal resources for affordable housing projects through subsidy layering, ensuring that the aggregate amount of federal funds invested is no more than necessary for providing affordable housing. The HOME program requires a minimum tenant contribution for rental assistance, ensuring federal funds invested in housing projects are used efficiently. A portion of HOME funding must be reserved for Community Housing Development Organizations (CHDOs) to support affordable housing projects for low-income households. CHDOs must develop, own, or sponsor affordable housing projects to meet the 15% set-aside requirement. The HOME program regulations require a minimum tenant contribution for rental assistance and reserve a portion of funds for CHDOs to develop affordable housing projects. Changes made in July 2013 clarified CHDO qualifications and activities, increasing oversight of CHDO reservation funds by PJs. The 2013 rule requires PJs to commit HOME funds to CHDOs for specific projects, with CHDOs needing paid staff with relevant experience to undertake affordable housing activities. Consultants or volunteers can assist with project activities, but not in demonstrating capacity. The HOME program allows CHDOs to use consultants to demonstrate development capacity in their first year, as long as the consultants train the CHDO's staff. Funding for HOME includes appropriations history, fund distribution formula, and leveraging funds for affordable housing. Congress appropriates funding to the HOME account annually, with fluctuating amounts from $1 billion to $1.6 billion between FY1992 and FY2011. Since FY1999, appropriations for the HOME program have ranged from $1 billion to $2 billion, with recent years seeing funding at $1 billion or below. Decreased funding reflects fiscal constraints and concerns about oversight. The HOME account primarily funds formula grants to states and localities, but has also supported related affordable housing programs in some years. Since FY2012, the only set-asides funded within the HOME account have been HOME formula grants for the insular areas. Annual appropriations levels for the HOME program from FY1992 to FY2014 are shown in Table 1, including amounts for formula grants and set-asides. HUD distributes funds to participating jurisdictions using a formula. In FY2014, HUD allocated funds to states and localities through the HOME program formula, with 40% going to states and 60% to localities. Insular areas, including Guam and the Virgin Islands, received a set-aside of $2 million. The HOME formula considers six factors, with four factors weighted at 20%. The number of occupied rental units in a jurisdiction built before 1950 and occupied by poor households with housing problems like incomplete kitchen facilities, incomplete plumbing, overcrowding, or high rent costs multiplied by the cost ratio of producing housing locally versus nationally. This is part of the factors considered in the HOME program formula for allocating funds to states and localities. The HOME program formula for allocating funds to states and localities includes factors such as the number of rental units in a jurisdiction where the head of household's income is at or below the poverty line, population multiplied by net per capita income, and deadlines for committing and expending funds. Failure to meet deadlines results in funds reverting to HUD for reallocation. Additionally, the 2013 final rule requires repayment of HOME funds for projects not completed within four years of commitment. In FY2014, every state received a HOME formula grant, with a median grant amount of $6 million and a mean grant close to $8 million. California received the largest allocation at nearly $31 million. Nearly half of the states received less than $5 million, and all but twelve states received less than $10 million. The lower funding in recent years has led to lower median and mean grant amounts compared to previous years. In FY2010 and FY2014, state and local HOME formula grants varied in amount. The median state grant in FY2010 was almost $11 million, with the mean close to $14 million. Ten states received grants under $5 million, while ten received over $20 million. The largest state grant was $62 million in FY2010 and $31 million in FY2014. In FY2014, 587 localities received grants, with a median of almost $580,000 and a mean of over $1 million. New York City received the largest locality grant of close to $60 million. In FY2014, most localities received formula grants of less than $1 million, with the smallest grant awarded to East Orange, NJ, at less than $72,000. Over 250 local jurisdictions received grants of $500,000 or less, including over 100 with grants of less than $335,000. The Obama Administration proposed legislative changes to PJ requirements in FY2014 and FY2015. The Obama Administration proposed changes to PJ requirements in FY2014 and FY2015, including removing the lower funding threshold and ending the practice of allowing localities to remain PJs indefinitely. Localities would now have to qualify every five years to remain a PJ. Appendix B shows the number of participating jurisdictions in each state in FY2014 and the total combined formula grant funding received. The HOME program aims to leverage federal funds for affordable housing by requiring participating jurisdictions to match 25% of HOME funds spent with their own contributions. Matching funds can come from various non-federal sources and must be used for eligible affordable housing activities. The HOME program requires participating jurisdictions to match 25% of HOME funds spent with their own contributions, which can include in-kind contributions like labor, materials, and land. Other contributions such as foregone taxes and infrastructure improvements may also count towards the matching requirement. Matching funds cannot come from federal sources and must be used in the same fiscal year as HOME funds. Excess matching funds can be carried forward to meet requirements in subsequent years, and the match requirement can be reduced or eliminated in cases of fiscal distress. The HOME program requires jurisdictions to match 25% of funds spent, which can include in-kind contributions. Matching funds cannot come from federal sources and must be used in the same fiscal year. The Secretary can reduce or eliminate the match requirement in cases of fiscal distress. Certain uses of funds are exempt from matching, including forgiven loans to CHDOs, administrative expenses, and filling the gap between formula allocation and required contributions. Leveraging allows programs to attract additional funding from non-federal sources, making projects more feasible. The HOME program allows jurisdictions to attract multiple funding sources for affordable housing projects, reducing the need for federal funding. Leveraging statistics show that every dollar of HOME funds attracted $4.16 in non-HOME funds for housing units completed between FY1992 and July 31, 2014. This includes funding from other federal sources, states, local governments, and private entities. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) released a report in 2008 analyzing leverage statistics for HUD and the Department of the Treasury programs. Alternative measures of leverage ratio may offer a more comprehensive view of program effectiveness. For HOME-assisted units completed in FY2006, HUD reported a $4 non-HOME funding to $1 HOME funding leverage ratio. GAO found that for every $1 of HOME funding, units used $1.92 of private spending, $1.33 of other federal spending, and $0.76 of state or local spending. Between FY1992 and July 31, 2014, the HOME program assisted in constructing, rehabilitating, or acquiring nearly 1.2 million affordable housing units and helped over 290,000 families with tenant-based rental assistance. This totals to almost 1.5 million completed units. Since FY1992, the HOME program has assisted in constructing, rehabilitating, or acquiring nearly 1.2 million affordable housing units and helped over 290,000 families with tenant-based rental assistance. This totals to almost 1.5 million completed units, with home buyer units representing the largest share at 42%, followed by rental units at 39%, and homeowner units at 19%. In FY2013 alone, HOME funds contributed to about 21,000 completed housing units and tenant-based rental assistance. Since its inception, the HOME program has funded over $28 billion for completed housing units and rental assistance. Of this amount, $16 billion (55%) was used for rental units or tenant-based rental assistance, $8 billion (27%) for home buyer units, and $5 billion (18%) for homeowner units. Nearly $15 billion (95%) of the rental housing funding was used for developing rental units, with the remaining 5% for tenant-based rental assistance. Eligible uses of HOME funds include owner-occupied housing rehabilitation, assistance to home buyers, and rental housing development. The HOME program has funded over $28 billion for housing units and rental assistance. Nearly 500,000 units (34%) were rehabilitated, 390,000 (26%) were acquired, and 290,000 (20%) were newly constructed. An additional 290,000 households received TBRA. Some activities require a larger investment of funds, leading to a breakdown of total funding used for each activity. The distribution of HOME funding for different activities varies from the number of units completed. For instance, while rehabilitated units make up one-third of completed units using HOME funds, they account for nearly 43% of total funds spent. Acquired units represent over a quarter of completed units but only about 15% of funding. New construction and TBRA each make up about 20% of completed units, with new construction receiving almost 40% of funds and TBRA only 3%. This disparity is illustrated in Figure 5. The average investment of HOME funds required for different activities varies. Newly constructed units cost the most at $38,000, followed by rehabilitating units at $24,000, and acquiring units at $11,000. Most home buyer units use HOME funds for acquisition costs, while a small number use funds for rehabilitation or new construction. PJ's decision on how to use HOME funds depends on the programs they administer and the housing needs they aim to address. Most HOME funds are used for rehabilitation or new construction of home buyer units, while owner-occupied units primarily use funds for rehabilitation. Rental units funded by HOME are mostly rehabilitated or newly constructed, benefiting households with incomes at or below 80% of the area median income. HOME funds for rental activities serve a lower-income population compared to homeowner units. HOME funds for rental activities target a lower-income population compared to homeowner and home buyer units. Nearly 80% of HOME-assisted TBRA households and 44% of occupants of HOME-assisted rental units have incomes at or below 30% of area median income. In contrast, less than one-third of HOME-assisted homeowner units and only 6% of HOME-assisted home buyer units benefit households in this income range. Nearly 30% of HOME-assisted units are occupied by single-parent households, while another 30% are occupied by single, non-elderly households. About 18% each are occupied by elderly households and two-parent households, with 5% categorized as \"other.\" Rental units assisted with HOME funds are most likely to be occupied by single, non-elderly households or elderly households, followed by single-parent households. HOME-assisted home buyer units are most likely to be occupied by single parents or two-parent households, with few occupied by elderly households. The HOME program assists various types of households, with elderly households being more likely to seek funds for repairs. Single-parent households are the most common recipients of HOME-funded TBRA. Oversight of the program involves monitoring processes and outcomes to ensure funds are used appropriately and achieve the goal of providing affordable housing to low-income households. Participating jurisdictions play a significant role in ensuring program success. HUD oversees the HOME program by approving Consolidated Plans from participating jurisdictions (PJs) before granting funds. PJs must demonstrate how HOME funds will be used to meet affordable housing needs. HUD ensures plans are complete and compliant with regulations. After funds are granted, HUD continues oversight to ensure proper fund usage. HUD oversees the HOME program by approving Consolidated Plans from participating jurisdictions (PJs) before granting funds. PJs must demonstrate how HOME funds will be used to meet affordable housing needs. HUD ensures plans are complete and compliant with regulations. PJs report their commitments and expenditures of HOME funds to HUD through the Integrated Disbursement & Information System (IDIS). HUD tracks PJs' fund usage and project progress through this system and publishes related reports on its website. HOME funds not spent in a timely manner or used for eligible housing may need to be repaid to HUD. Uncommitted funds expire after 24 months and are reallocated by formula. PJs must use HOME funds within five years and repay funds for activities not meeting requirements. HUD can penalize PJs for misusing funds. PJs oversee subrecipients and monitor performance to ensure compliance. PJs must monitor performance, comply with record-keeping requirements, and enter into written agreements before disbursing HOME funds. They must review subrecipient and contractor performance annually and conduct on-site inspections of completed projects. Several concerns have been raised about the oversight of HOME-assisted projects by PJs and HUD's monitoring of the use of HOME funds. PJs are required to conduct on-site inspections of completed projects, inspect rental units regularly, and assess the financial viability of larger rental projects annually. Some concerns have been raised about HUD's oversight of PJs' use of HOME funds, including questions about monitoring methodologies, compliance with program rules, and the inclusion of appropriate provisions in projects. OIG reports have highlighted issues with HUD's monitoring and oversight practices. Concerns about HUD's oversight of the HOME program were raised due to alleged mismanagement of funds and delays in rental housing projects. The Washington Post articles highlighted issues with PJs' use of HOME funds, including stalled projects and lack of proper oversight by HUD. HUD faced criticism for not effectively tracking funds and demanding reimbursement for misused funds. HUD defended its oversight of HOME funds, disputing claims of mismanagement and stalled projects. Congress held hearings in 2011 to address concerns about HUD's ability to ensure funds are used effectively. Congress included provisions related to oversight and use of HOME funds in the FY2012 and FY2013 HUD appropriations laws. The 2013 HOME program final rule aimed to ensure proper spending of HOME funds, with provisions similar to those in the appropriations laws. HUD published a proposed rule in 2011 to revise HOME program regulations, with the final rule being promulgated later. The final rule for the HOME program, promulgated in July 2013, made significant changes to the regulations for the first time since 1996. It aimed to address operational challenges, improve understanding of program requirements, update property standards, and enhance accountability for compliance and performance. The rule included oversight measures to strengthen requirements and codify administrative best practices identified by HUD. The 2013 final rule for the HOME program requires PJs to adopt written policies for program oversight, updates property standards, conducts annual financial examinations for rental projects, mandates repayment of funds for unused projects, and provides housing counseling for HOME-assisted home buyers. The 2013 final rule for the HOME program mandates various provisions for PJs, including repayment of HOME funds for incomplete projects, underwriting reviews before fund commitment, renting unsold units, and requiring CHDOs to have paid staff with housing experience. The 2013 final rule for the HOME program mandates provisions for PJs, including repayment of HOME funds for incomplete projects, underwriting reviews before fund commitment, and requiring CHDOs to have paid staff with housing experience. CHDOs cannot use volunteers, donated staff, or consultants to demonstrate capacity for housing development, except in the first year if the consultant trains the CHDO's staff. Additional provisions related to CHDOs were included in the 2013 rule, with most provisions becoming effective on August 23, 2013. These provisions now apply to all HOME funds committed after the effective date, regardless of the year the funds were appropriated. The American Dream Downpayment Initiative (ADDI) was funded in the HOME account from FY2003 through FY2008 but has not been funded since FY2009. Congress chose not to fund ADDI in subsequent years. The program aimed to increase homeownership, especially among low-income and minority populations. The American Dream Downpayment Initiative (ADDI) aimed to increase homeownership among low-income and minority populations by providing funding to states and local jurisdictions for down payment and closing cost assistance for first-time home buyers. States and localities could use ADDI funds to provide up to $10,000 or 6% of a home's purchase price in assistance. Additionally, funds could be used for rehabilitation costs within a year of purchase. Allocation of funds was based on the number of low-income households in the area. The American Dream Downpayment Initiative (ADDI) aimed to increase homeownership by providing funding for down payment and closing cost assistance to low-income and minority populations. To receive ADDI funds, a local jurisdiction needed a population of at least 150,000 or be eligible for a minimum grant of $50,000. Critics argued that ADDI was duplicative as states and localities could use their HOME funds for down payment assistance. ADDI was authorized to receive $200 million annually but never received more than $86 million. Funding for ADDI was not included in subsequent years after 2009. Funding for the American Dream Downpayment Initiative (ADDI) was not continued after 2009. Housing counseling program funding was initially set-aside in the HOME account but was later allocated in its own account starting from FY2009. President Bush had requested separate funding for housing counseling in the 2000s, but Congress continued to fund it within the HOME account until FY2009. The housing counseling program funding was initially set-aside in the HOME account but was later allocated in its own account starting from FY2009.
