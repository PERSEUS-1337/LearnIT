The Act is titled the \"Domestic Violence Screening and Treatment Act of 2002\" and highlights findings on the prevalence of domestic violence, particularly against women. Statistics show a high percentage of women experiencing violent victimizations, with many seeking care for violence-related injuries caused by intimate partners. The Act aims to address the physical and psychological health effects of domestic abuse. Adverse physical health effects of domestic violence on women include arthritis, chronic pain, migraines, vision problems, and STIs. Medical services for abused women cost $857.3 million annually. Approximately 240,000 pregnant women are battered each year, leading to pregnancy complications. Pregnant women are at a higher risk of homicide by intimate partners. Children who witness domestic violence are at higher risk of behavioral and physical health problems, including depression, anxiety, and violence towards peers. They are also more likely to attempt suicide, abuse drugs and alcohol, run away from home, engage in teenage prostitution, and commit sexual assault crimes. Additionally, fifty percent of men who frequently assault their wives also assault their children, indicating a link between domestic violence and child abuse. Only about 10 percent of primary care physicians routinely screen for intimate partner abuse during new patient visits and periodic checkups. Recent clinical studies have shown the effectiveness of a 2-minute screening for early detection of abuse in pregnant women, with a 10-minute intervention proving highly effective in increasing safety. Patients expressed a desire for healthcare providers to ask them privately about intimate partner violence. Research on screening men is lacking. SEC. 2.
