    "content": "This report provides an overview of FY2019 appropriations actions for accounts traditionally funded in the LHHS appropriations bill, which includes discretionary and mandatory appropriations for the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, as well as related agencies like the Social Security Administration. The LHHS bill is a significant source of discretionary funds for domestic nondefense federal programs. The LHHS bill is a major source of discretionary funds for federal programs, particularly in the areas of Labor, Health, Human Services, and Education. It is a controversial bill due to its funding size and social policy issues addressed, such as restrictions on federal funds for abortion and research on human embryos and stem cells. Congressional clients can refer to the LHHS experts list in CRS Report R42638 for information on specific agencies and programs funded in the bill. The LHHS bill provides an overview of FY2019 appropriations, including major congressional actions and funding levels compared to FY2018. The report includes sections on DOL, HHS, ED, and Related Agencies, highlighting key funding differences. Appendix A summarizes budget enforcement activities for FY2019. Appendix A summarizes budget enforcement activities for FY2019, including information on the Budget Control Act of 2011, sequestration, provisional subcommittee spending allocations, and current-year spending levels. Appendix B provides an overview of LHHS-related floor amendments in the Senate for H.R. 6157. The report focuses on appropriations to agencies under the LHHS subcommittees' jurisdiction, excluding funding for other accounts or agencies. The LHHS bill provides appropriations for federal departments and agencies such as the Department of Labor, Department of Health and Human Services (excluding certain agencies funded through other bills), Department of Education, and related agencies like the Social Security Administration and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. The LHHS bill includes discretionary and mandatory budget authority for federal departments and agencies like the Department of Labor, Department of Health and Human Services, Department of Education, and related agencies. Funding totals in the report do not include amounts provided outside the annual appropriations process. Mandatory programs funded through appropriations are known as appropriated entitlements. Appropriated entitlements are controlled by the authorizing statute, with little control by appropriators over funding amounts. Entitled recipients may have legal recourse if Congress fails to appropriate necessary funds. Mandatory spending is typically provided through the program's authorizing statute, not the annual appropriations process. The funding amounts in the report only include funds provided through appropriations acts. The report focuses on discretionary funding, which receives more attention during the appropriations process. Mandatory spending is subject to budget enforcement processes like sequestration. The President's proposed changes to mandatory spending programs are generally excluded from the report. Sequestration involves across-the-board reductions in discretionary or mandatory spending. Budget authority is the amount of money a federal agency can spend. Appropriations bills may include budget authority for the current or future fiscal years. Advance appropriations refer to funds available in future years. Appropriations levels in the report refer to total budget authority provided in a bill. The report breaks out \"current-year\" appropriations, measured against 302(b) allocation ceilings. Scorekeeping adjustments are made by the Congressional Budget Office. Appropriations levels in the report do not reflect additional scorekeeping adjustments. Table 1 provides a timeline of major legislative actions for full-year LHHS proposals. Table 1 outlines key legislative actions for full-year LHHS proposals. On July 1, P.L. 116-26 was signed into law, focusing on humanitarian assistance and security at the southern border. The bill included nearly $2.9 billion in emergency LHHS appropriations for the Refugee and Entrant Assistance account at HHS, primarily for the UAC program. The Office of Management and Budget requested $2.9 billion in supplemental funds for the UAC program to increase shelter capacity for unaccompanied alien children apprehended in the United States. The funds would provide critical child welfare services and high-quality shelter care, with designated amounts for state-licensed shelters, post-release services, child advocates, legal services, federal field specialists, and case management services. The bill allocated funds for additional federal field specialists, case management services, and oversight activities to expedite placing children with sponsors and reduce their stay in HHS custody. Conditions were placed on the use of funds, prioritizing community-based residential care and prohibiting funds for unlicensed facilities except in specific circumstances. The bill imposed conditions on the use of funds for unaccompanied children, prioritizing community-based care and prohibiting placement in unlicensed facilities under certain conditions. It also required HHS to ensure certain vulnerable children are not placed in unlicensed facilities and prohibited DHS from detaining sponsors based on HHS information. The bill included provisions on the use of funds for unaccompanied children, prioritizing community-based care and prohibiting placement in unlicensed facilities under certain conditions. It also required HHS to notify appropriations committees of facility assessments and acquisitions, submit discharge rate improvement plans, provide information on unlicensed facilities, and report on children placed at such facilities. The bill required HHS to provide monthly reports on unaccompanied alien children in their care, submit a spending plan within 30 days of enactment, and consider supplemental appropriations for natural disasters. The President signed into law a supplemental appropriations act for FY2019, P.L. 116-20, which included $611 million in emergency-designated LHHS appropriations for accounts at DOL, HHS, and ED. The funds were directed towards expenses related to natural disasters in 2018 and 2019. $201 million allocated to the Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund at HHS for disaster-related expenses. Additionally, $30 million for Child Care and Development Block Grant, $90 million for Children and Families Services Programs, with specific allocations for Head Start programs, Community Services Block Grant, and Child Welfare Services program. HHS allocated $201 million for disaster-related expenses. HHS directed to transfer funds for behavioral health treatment, federal health centers program, CDC-Wide Activities, and Program Support. The Department of Defense and Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education Appropriations Act, 2019 allocated $165 million for Hurricane Education Recovery at ED to assist in meeting the educational needs of affected individuals. Additionally, the supplemental provided appropriations to the Medicaid program at HHS to support program costs in certain territories. The FY2019 LHHS omnibus appropriations totaled $189.4 billion, with a 1.5% increase from FY2018 and 8.9% more than the President's budget request. The omnibus also included $869.8 billion in mandatory funding, bringing the total LHHS funding to $1.059 trillion. The House Appropriations Committee's LHHS subcommittee approved its draft bill for FY2019 discretionary and mandatory appropriations. The bill would have provided $187.2 billion in discretionary LHHS funds, a 0.3% increase from FY2018 levels, and $869.8 billion in mandatory funding, totaling $1.057 trillion for LHHS. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved the LHHS draft bill on June 28, 2018, with a vote of 30-1. The Senate passed H.R. 6157 on August 23, 2018, containing FY2019 LHHS appropriations. The bill included $189.4 billion in discretionary funds, a 1.5% increase from FY2018. The Senate bill approved $189.4 billion in discretionary funds for FY2019 LHHS appropriations, a 1.5% increase from FY2018 and 8.9% more than the FY2019 President's request. The total combined funding for LHHS was estimated at $1.059 trillion, including mandatory funding. President Trump's FY2019 budget requested $173.9 billion in discretionary funding, a 6.8% decrease from FY2018 levels, and $869.8 billion in annually appropriated mandatory funding, totaling $1.044 trillion for LHHS. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 provided full-year appropriations for all 12 annual appropriations acts, including LHHS. The FY2018 omnibus bill provided $186.5 billion in discretionary appropriations for LHHS, a 7.6% increase from FY2017. The total LHHS budget for FY2018 was $1.004 trillion, including mandatory funding. The FY2019 Senate bill proposed $189.4 billion in discretionary funds for LHHS, a 1.5% increase from FY2018. In FY2019, HHS received the largest share of LHHS appropriations at $899 billion, accounting for 84.9% of the total funding. ED and Related Agencies followed with 7.1% and 6.7% respectively. In FY2019, HHS received the largest share of LHHS appropriations at $899 billion, accounting for 84.9% of the total funding. ED and Related Agencies followed with 7.1% and 6.7% respectively. The majority of ED appropriations are discretionary, while funding for Related Agencies goes towards mandatory payments and administrative costs. HHS accounts for a smaller share of total discretionary appropriations compared to ED. Together, HHS and ED represent the majority of discretionary LHHS appropriations. The Department of Labor (DOL) receives funding through regular LHHS appropriations, excluding mandatory funds for programs like Unemployment Insurance. Dollar and percentage changes are based on unrounded amounts. DOL consists of entities focused on employment, training, worker protection, income security, and contract enforcement. The department's entities mainly cover workforce development and worker protection services. The Department of Labor (DOL) administers workforce employment and training programs, including the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) state formula grant programs, Job Corps, and the Employment Service. They also oversee worker protection services through agencies like OSHA, MSHA, and WHD to ensure worker safety and adherence to wage regulations. Entities focused on worker protection provide services to ensure worker safety, adherence to wage and overtime laws, and contract compliance. The Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics collects data and provides analysis on the labor market. The FY2019 discretionary DOL budget authority decreased compared to FY2018 enacted levels. Approximately 89% of the total funding for DOL is discretionary. The FY2019 enacted and proposed appropriations for selected DOL accounts and programs are compared to FY2018 enacted appropriations. Table 4 shows funding for DOL programs, including the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA). WIOA, signed into law in July 2014, authorizes appropriations through FY2020. Title I of WIOA includes state formula grant programs for Adults, Youth, and Dislocated Workers. The FY2019 LHHS omnibus maintained funding for these programs, while the President's budget proposed reductions. The President's budget proposed reductions in funding for state formula grant programs compared to FY2018 enacted levels. The FY2019 LHHS omnibus provided $221 million for the Dislocated Workers Activities National Reserve, with the Senate keeping funding the same as FY2018. Additionally, $30 million from the DWA National Reserve was directed towards training and employment assistance for workers in specific regions. The FY2019 LHHS omnibus also allocated $160 million for the Apprenticeship Grant program. The FY2019 LHHS omnibus provided $160 million for the Apprenticeship Grant program, a $15 million increase from FY2018. The Native Americans program, Migrant and Seasonal Farmworkers program, CSEOA program, and Workforce Data Quality Initiative received similar funding as FY2018. ILAB received $86 million in funding, the same as FY2018. The Senate-passed bill also allocated $86 million for ILAB. The President's budget and House committee bill proposed a $68 million decrease (-78.5%) for ILAB. The FY2019 LHHS omnibus decreased funding by $68 million (-78.5%) for ILAB, which focuses on promoting workers' rights globally. The reduction was attributed to a shift in priorities towards monitoring and enforcing labor provisions in trade agreements. Annual LHHS appropriations acts include provisions related to labor issues, with the FY2019 omnibus continuing several provisions from previous acts. The FY2019 LHHS omnibus included provisions directing the Secretary of Labor to accept private wage surveys for prevailing wages in the H-2B program, exempting certain insurance claims adjusters from overtime protection after a \"major disaster,\" authorizing funding for apprenticeship programs, allowing the employment of law enforcement officers for protection, and granting authority to dispose of excess property as deemed appropriate. The FY2019 LHHS omnibus included provisions directing the Secretary of Labor to dispose of real property at the Treasure Island Job Corps Center as deemed appropriate. The LHHS bill directs funding to multiple HHS agencies, including the Health Resources and Services Administration, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Institutes of Health, Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, and Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. These agencies support various health-related missions such as healthcare services, medical research, and disease prevention. The LHHS bill provides funding for HHS agencies focused on healthcare services, medical research, disease prevention, social services, and community supports for vulnerable populations. The LHHS bill provides funding for the HHS Office of the Secretary (OS) for various functions. FY2019 funding levels for HHS increased discretionary appropriations by 2.6% compared to FY2018. The House committee bill proposed a 1.3% increase, the Senate proposed a 2.7% increase, while the President requested a 1.6% decrease in discretionary HHS funding. The majority of funding for HHS goes to CMS for Medicaid benefits and health care trust funds. CMS accounts for 88.6% of all enacted appropriations for HHS. ACF and NIH receive about 4.2% each. Discretionary funding for CMS is 4.9% of HHS appropriations, with PHS agencies receiving 63.5% of discretionary funds. NIH receives the largest share of discretionary funding (41.9%), followed by ACF (25.6%). Public health service agencies receive additional support through HHS-specific funding mechanisms like the PHS Evaluation Set-Aside and the Prevention and Public Health Fund. The PHS Evaluation Set-Aside, authorized by the Public Health Service Act, allows for the redistribution of a portion of eligible program appropriations for program evaluation purposes. LHHS appropriations acts have commonly set a higher maximum percentage for the set-aside and allocated specific amounts of funding to selected HHS programs. Since FY2010, the PHS tap has allocated 2.5% of eligible appropriations to selected HHS programs. In FY2019, there were proposals to increase the set-aside to 2.6% and 2.9%. From FY2015 onwards, tap funds have been directed to fewer programs within NIH, SAMHSA, and OS, excluding AHRQ, CDC, and HRSA. This shift has impacted AHRQ, previously reliant on tap transfers for funding. Since FY2015, tap transfers have been directed to fewer programs within NIH, SAMHSA, and OS, excluding AHRQ, CDC, and HRSA. The FY2019 omnibus provided $1.1 billion in tap transfers to NIH, with the House proposing to maintain FY2018 levels and the Senate suggesting an increase. The President's budget aimed to expand PHS tap funding to include Public Health Scientific Services at the CDC while eliminating transfers to some activities. The bill proposed a $95 million increase in transfer funds (+10.3%), while the President's request suggested a $182 million decrease (-19.7%). The ACA authorized and appropriated mandatory funding to support programs within PHS agencies, including the Prevention and Public Health Fund (PPHF). The PPHF was given a permanent annual appropriation for prevention and public health programs. The FY2019 appropriation for PPHF was reduced to $900 million due to subsequent laws, with an additional 6.2% reduction from sequestration. After sequestration, the total PPHF appropriation available for FY2019 was $844 million, with $805 million allocated to CDC, $12 million to SAMHSA, and $28 million to ACL. PPHF funds supplement selected programs' regular appropriations, with provisions directing fund distribution since FY2014. CDC typically receives the largest share of PPHF funds, with a $4 million increase in FY2019. The CDC received $805 million for FY2019, a $4 million increase from FY2018. Both the House committee bill and Senate-passed bill proposed higher allocations for the CDC, while the President's request aimed to eliminate PPHF funding. The discussion includes FY2019 discretionary funding highlights by HHS agency and comparisons to FY2018 levels. Additionally, there are summaries of provisions restricting spending in controversial areas and tables detailing funding levels for HHS. The FY2019 LHHS omnibus provided $6.9 billion in discretionary budget authority for HRSA, which was $107 million more than FY2018. The President's budget proposed cuts to HRSA programs but authorizing law ultimately provided funding for them in FY2019. The FY2019 LHHS omnibus maintained discretionary appropriations at FY2018 levels, including $286 million for Title X Family Planning. The House committee bill proposed eliminating Title X funding, while the Senate-passed bill and President's budget proposed flat funding. The omnibus also increased funding for the Rural Communities Opioids Response program by $20 million (+20.0%) to $120 million. The FY2019 LHHS omnibus provided increased funding for various programs, including $12 million for Healthy Start and $26 million for maternal mortality reduction efforts. CDC received $7.1 billion in discretionary budget authority, which was $117 million less than FY2018 but $1.6 billion more than the President's budget request. Additionally, $805 million in PPHF transfers were allocated to the CDC. The FY2019 LHHS omnibus provided increased funding for various programs, including $12 million for Healthy Start and $26 million for maternal mortality reduction efforts. CDC received $7.1 billion in discretionary budget authority, with $805 million in PPHF transfers allocated to the CDC. Funding was set aside in various CDC accounts to address the opioid crisis, such as $5 million for infectious disease consequences of the opioid epidemic in the HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, Sexually Transmitted Diseases, and Tuberculosis Prevention account. The conference report directed $476 million from the Injury Prevention and Control account for the CDC's Prescription Drug Overdose activities. The FY2019 LHHS omnibus provided $37.9 billion in discretionary budget authority for NIH, an increase of $1.8 billion from FY2018. $10 million in PDO funding was allocated for a nationwide opioid awareness campaign. $15 million was added to the Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities account, with $10 million for monitoring Zika virus and opioid use during pregnancy. In FY2019, PHS tap transfers to NIH increased by $224 million (+24.3%) from FY2018. The tap transfer was allocated to the National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) along with a discretionary appropriation of $1.7 billion. Despite a decrease in discretionary funding, total funding for NIGMS increased by $87 million (+3.1%) from FY2018 when combined with the tap transfer. All NIH accounts in the LHHS bill received increases from FY2018 levels, with the largest percentage increases going to the National Institute on Aging and the Buildings and Facilities account. The FY2019 LHHS omnibus directed NIH to reserve $2.34 billion for Alzheimer's disease research. In FY2019, NIH reserved $2.34 billion for Alzheimer's disease research, marking a $425 million increase from FY2018. This allocation is part of the FY2019 LHHS omnibus, which also included appropriations for the NIH Innovation Account and directed funds to support cancer research, the Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies (BRAIN) Initiative, and other research initiatives. In FY2019, the LHHS omnibus allocated $196 million for the BRAIN Initiative, $186 million for the Precision Medicine Initiative, and $10 million for regenerative medicine research. SAMHSA received $5.6 billion in discretionary budget authority, a $584 million increase from FY2018. State Opioid Response Grants received $1.5 billion, a $500 million increase from FY2018, while STR grants did not receive funding in FY2019. The FY2019 LHHS omnibus included changes in funding for various mental health and substance abuse programs. Certified Community Behavioral Health Centers saw a $50 million increase, while Mental Health PRNS and Substance Abuse Prevention PRNS had reductions. Substance Abuse Treatment PRNS received a $55 million increase. The CMS received $4.4 billion in discretionary budget authority, slightly more than the previous year. $765 million was allocated for the CMS Health Care Fraud and Abuse Control account, with $454 million exempt from budget caps. The LHHS omnibus for FY2019 provided $3.7 billion for the CMS Program Management account, supporting various CMS program operations. This amount was higher than the President's budget (+3.6%) and the House committee bill (+4.8%). $454 million of the funding was exempt from discretionary budget caps. The FY2019 LHHS omnibus provided $23.2 billion in discretionary budget authority for ACF, $357 million more than FY2018. The President's budget would have decreased ACF funding by one-third, mainly by eliminating certain programs. The FY2019 LHHS omnibus proposed reducing funding for certain ACF programs, including LIHEAP, PDG, and CSBG. Funding for Refugee and Entrant Assistance programs increased by $40 million. The majority of the appropriation for Refugee and Entrant Assistance programs was directed towards the UAC program. The FY2019 LHHS omnibus allocated $1.3 billion for the Unaccompanied Alien Children (UAC) program, which provides shelter and care for children apprehended in the US. New provisions included accepting donations for UAC care, reporting on reunification with parents, and allowing Congressional oversight visits. Expectations were set for adherence to specific provisions from the House committee bill. The FY2019 LHHS omnibus allocated $1.3 billion for the Unaccompanied Alien Children (UAC) program, with new directives and reporting requirements included in the conference report. These requirements covered various topics such as medication administration, questioning children about religion, and sharing information on the whereabouts of children and parents. HHS was expected to adhere to the outlined requirements in all reports. The FY2019 LHHS omnibus provided $338 million in discretionary budget authority to AHRQ, a 1.2% increase from FY2018. Funding for AHRQ was maintained as its own operating division, rejecting the proposal to consolidate it into NIH. The omnibus did not direct any PHS tap transfers to AHRQ, in line with recent practices. The President's FY2019 request had proposed zero funding for AHRQ, suggesting funding through a new institute in NIH. The FY2019 LHHS omnibus provided $2.2 billion in discretionary budget authority for ACL, with an additional $28 million in PPHF transfers. The funding was allocated for specific programs like the Alzheimer's Disease Program, Chronic Disease Self-Management, and Elder Falls Prevention. The omnibus did not adopt the President's proposals to consolidate certain programs or eliminate funding for others. The conference report called on ACL to use a portion of the reserved funds for Family Caregiver Support Services for new advisory activities. Caregiver Support Services recommended allocating $300,000 each to the Family Caregiving Advisory Council and the Advisory Council to Support Grandparents Raising Grandchildren. The FY2019 LHHS omnibus proposed a $5 million increase for the Care Corps grants program to support volunteers providing nonmedical care to family caregivers, seniors, and individuals with disabilities. Annual LHHS appropriations regularly include restrictions on controversial issues. Annual LHHS appropriations acts contain broad restrictions related to controversial issues such as abortions, human embryo research, needle exchange programs, and gun control advocacy. These provisions limit the use of federal funds for abortions to cases where the life of the mother is endangered, in cases of rape or incest, and prohibit discrimination against certain programs receiving LHHS funding. The FY2019 LHHS omnibus bill retained existing restrictions on discrimination against health care entities that do not provide or pay for abortions. A proposed provision based on the Conscience Protection Act was not enacted, which aimed to prevent penalizing or discriminating against health care providers who choose not to perform abortions. Additionally, annual LHHS appropriations have included a provision since FY1996 prohibiting the use of funds for human embryo research. The FY2019 LHHS omnibus bill retained restrictions on human embryo research and needle exchange programs. Funds cannot be used for needle purchase, but can support other program aspects if there is a significant increase in hepatitis or HIV infections. The FY2019 LHHS omnibus bill retained restrictions on human embryo research and needle exchange programs. Funds cannot be used for needle purchase, but can support other program aspects if there is a significant increase in hepatitis or HIV infections due to injection drug use. The program must also operate in accordance with state and local law. Gun control provisions have been included in annual LHHS appropriations since FY1997, prohibiting the use of certain funds for activities advocating or promoting gun control. Restrictions on ACA implementation have been included in annual LHHS appropriations since FY2011. The FY2019 House committee bill included provisions limiting HHS from implementing certain aspects of the ACA. It would have prohibited funds for health insurance \"navigator\" programs and implementing any provision of the ACA, with limited exceptions. The Senate bill did not have similar provisions. The U.S. Department of Education (ED) was established in 1980 with a mission to promote student achievement and global competitiveness. Three-quarters of ED's discretionary appropriations typically go to local educational agencies for educational and related services. The amounts mentioned in this section are based on regular LHHS appropriations only and do not include mandatory funds provided outside of the annual appropriations process. Amounts are rounded to the nearest million or billion, and dollar and percentage changes are based on unrounded amounts. The U.S. Department of Education primarily uses funds to provide educational services for disadvantaged students and Pell Grants for low-income postsecondary students. The federal government contributes 7% of overall funding for elementary and secondary education, while states and local districts provide 83%. For higher education, the federal government provides about 61% of student aid. In AY 2017-2018, the majority of ED's budget is discretionary, with FY2019 enacted levels slightly higher than FY2018. Proposed FY2019 discretionary appropriations varied under different bills. The FY2019 LHHS omnibus allocated $1.3 billion for career and technical education, a 5.8% increase from FY2018. The President's budget requested approximately $1.1 billion for Career and Technical Education (CTE), with the Senate bill keeping funding at the FY2018 level and the House committee bill proposing over $1.3 billion. The Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Act is the primary federal law supporting CTE programs at secondary and postsecondary levels, aiming to help students attain technical skills and industry-recognized credentials. The Perkins Act was reauthorized in 2018 through Perkins V, signed into law by President Trump. Pell Grants provide need-based financial aid to undergraduate students. The FY2019 discretionary appropriation of $22.5 billion provided level funding compared to FY2018. The FY2019 LHHS omnibus bill proposed level funding for Pell Grants, with the discretionary maximum award increased to $5,135. The Senate bill recommended the same amount, while the House committee bill did not suggest an increase. The President's budget requested the same award level as in FY2017. Pell Grant awards consist of discretionary and mandatory components, funded through various sources including annual appropriations and a program surplus. The FY2019 LHHS omnibus bill reduced the definite mandatory appropriation for Pell Grants to pay for an increase in the discretionary maximum award level. The Senate bill proposed a similar reduction, while the House committee bill did not. The FY2019 LHHS omnibus bill included a provision rescinding $600 million from the Pell Grant program surplus to offset appropriations costs. The Higher Education Act allows sharing FAFSA information with state agencies and institutions for aid determination. The omnibus bill also authorized institutions to share FAFSA information with scholarship organizations with explicit consent from the applicant. The omnibus bill prohibits organizations from selling or sharing FAFSA information and remains in effect until Title IV of the HEA is reauthorized. Amounts in this section are based on regular LHHS appropriations only and are rounded to the nearest million or billion. Table 10 displays FY2019 proposed and enacted funding. The FY2019 omnibus bill increased discretionary appropriations for LHHS related agencies by about 0.1% compared to FY2018. The President's budget and the House committee bill proposed decreases of 14.0% and 2.2% respectively, while the Senate-passed bill proposed an increase of 0.5%. The Social Security Administration (SSA) consistently receives the largest share of funding in the LHHS bill, representing roughly 97% of total appropriations to related agencies. The bulk of mandatory funding provided to SSA from the LHHS bill supports the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program for disabled adults, children, and seniors aged 65 or older. SSA received 84.7% of discretionary appropriations for LHHS related agencies in FY2019, with CNCS being the next-largest agency in terms of appropriations. Typically, each remaining agency receives less than $1 billion from the annual LHHS appropriations bill. The SSA LAE account receives funding to administer Social Security and SSI programs, support CMS, and conduct program integrity activities. In FY2019, $12.9 billion was provided to the LAE account, with slight increases or decreases compared to FY2018 levels in different proposed bills. In FY2019, $1.7 billion (13.1%) of the $12.9 billion provided to the LAE account was allocated to program integrity activities. This included $273 million in \"base\" funding subject to discretionary spending caps, as well as additional cap adjustment funding. The FY2019 LHHS omnibus provided $1.4 billion in cap adjustment funding, the maximum amount permitted. However, program integrity funding for FY2019 was $52 million less than FY2018. All three proposals aimed to provide the maximum cap adjustment funding for FY2019. The FY2019 LHHS omnibus provided $1.1 billion in total CNCS funding, a $19 million increase over FY2018. The President's budget requested a significant decrease in funding for CNCS, but both the House and Senate bills rejected this proposal. The NLRB enforces provisions in the NLRA. The FY2019 LHHS omnibus maintained funding levels for the NLRB at $274 million, with proposed decreases in the President's budget and House committee bill. The omnibus retained a provision prohibiting funds for electronic voting in labor representation elections. The committee bill prohibits funds from being used to change the \"joint employer\" standard and enforce the NLRA against Indian tribes. Budget enforcement activities include discretionary spending limits and mandatory spending sequester. The Budget Control Act (BCA) provides mechanisms to reduce mandatory spending and discretionary spending through sequestration. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (BBA 2018) altered the budget enforcement requirements for FY2019, increasing defense and nondefense discretionary spending limits and extending mandatory spending sequestration through FY2027. The Budget Control Act (BCA) allows for reductions in mandatory and discretionary spending through sequestration. The BBA 2018 changed budget enforcement for FY2019, increasing spending limits and extending mandatory sequestration through FY2027. In FY2019, President Trump ordered a sequestration of nonexempt mandatory spending, with estimated reductions of 2% for Medicare and 6.2% for other nondefense mandatory spending, totaling $19 billion. In FY2019, President Trump ordered a sequestration of nonexempt nondefense mandatory spending, resulting in a total reduction of $19 billion. The FY2019 statutory spending limits for discretionary spending were increased by $18 billion each from their FY2018 limits. OMB determined that the appropriations for FY2019 did not violate the defense or nondefense spending limits set by BBA 2018. The Budget Control Act allows for adjustments to discretionary spending limits for FY2012-FY2021. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 and the BBA 2018 allowed for increases to the nondefense limit to accommodate new budget authority for program integrity initiatives at HHS, SSA, and DOL. Adjustments were made to the allowable SSA adjustment amounts in FY2017-FY2019 and FY2021. The BBA 2018 added a new cap adjustment for LHHS activities related to reemployment services and eligibility assessments conducted by states. The Cures Act of 2016 included budget enforcement procedures for discretionary spending limits, focusing on the NIH Innovation Account and the State Response to the Opioid Abuse Crisis Account. The Act authorized appropriations for specific fiscal years and created these accounts to address healthcare and substance abuse issues. The Cures Act of 2016 established budget enforcement procedures for discretionary spending limits, focusing on the NIH Innovation Account and the State Response to the Opioid Abuse Crisis Account. Appropriations from these accounts are exempt from spending limits and sequestration, including programs like Medicaid and Supplemental Security Income. The LHHS bill includes provisions for miners, retirement pay, medical benefits for Public Health Service officers, foster care, adoption assistance, and family support payments. It also addresses special rules for programs like unemployment compensation, student loans, health centers, and Medicare. Budget enforcement procedures are established through the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, with the Appropriations Committee receiving discretionary budget authority limits through 302(a) allocations, which are then divided among its subcommittees as 302(b) spending limits. The 302(b) suballocations set spending limits for each subcommittee on the 12 regular appropriations bills. Enforcement is through points of order, with the House and Senate using BBA 2018 authority for FY2019 budget levels. House and Senate Appropriations Committees adopted initial suballocations in May 2018. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees adopted initial suballocations in May 2018 for current-year LHHS discretionary funding. The House initially maintained flat LHHS appropriations, while the Senate proposed an increase of about $2.1 billion. Final enacted appropriations ended up slightly higher than the previous fiscal year. Funding adjustments under the BCA were also included in the table. The current-year budget authority for LHHS programs includes funding for program integrity activities and emergency requirements. Compliance with discretionary spending allocations is evaluated based on budget authority available in the current fiscal year. Advance appropriations from prior years that become available in the current year are also included. Total LHHS current-year budget authority is displayed in Table A-2 by title. The table reflects total budget authority available for obligation in the fiscal year, regardless of the year of appropriation. It includes budget authority from previous omnibus bills and the President's budget. Compliance with discretionary spending allocations is based on current-year budget authority. The LHHS bill (S. 3158) was not considered on the Senate floor but its text was included in a different appropriations bill (H.R. 6157) which was amended to include both Department of Defense and LHHS appropriations. The Senate passed the amended bill on August 23, 2018. Senator Shelby offered an amendment containing LHHS appropriations in Division B. The Senate passed the LHHS bill with a manager's package of amendments, including 32 LHHS amendments offered, with 29 adopted by unanimous consent and 3 receiving recorded votes."
