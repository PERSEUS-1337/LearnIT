    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Preparing More Welfare Recipients for Work Act\" and aims to improve the counting of required hours of participation in work activities. The \"Preparing More Welfare Recipients for Work Act\" aims to eliminate the distinction between core and non-core work activities and allow states to receive partial credit for partial engagement in work activities. This includes reducing the minimum hours required for families participating in the state program funded under this act. The \"Preparing More Welfare Recipients for Work Act\" allows states to request an alternate work participation rate calculation, reducing the minimum hours required for families participating in the state program. States can apply for this option by demonstrating compliance with guidelines to the Secretary. The Secretary, following established guidelines, ensures states have accurate systems to record individual work participation hours. States approved for an alternative calculation by the Secretary are deemed compliant with the work participation requirements. The text discusses the minimum participation rate for recipients required to participate in work activities, based on the number of hours per week they are required to work. This is a modification to counting job search as work. The text discusses modifications to counting job search as work and participation in work activities for recipients in State programs funded under this part. The amendment to Section 407(c)(2)(C) of the Act changes the age limit for individuals participating in job readiness activities from 20 to 26 years. Additionally, it requires periodic meetings with individuals involved in job readiness assistance after 3 months of participation in State-funded programs. The amendment to Section 407(d)(12) of the Act replaces child care assistance for community service participants with job readiness assistance as a separate work activity. Amendment to Section 407(d)(6) removes job readiness assistance. Section 407(d)(8) now allows counting vocational educational training as work for up to 24 hours. The amendments made by this Act will be effective on October 1, 2017."
