    "content": "The Act titled \"Farm and Ranch Land Protection Flexibility Act of 2006\" includes a section on the Farmland Protection Program. The Farmland Protection Program under the Farm and Ranch Land Protection Flexibility Act of 2006 is amended to include new definitions and eligibility criteria for eligible land, such as cropland, rangeland, grassland, pasture land, and forest land that is incidental to an agricultural operation. The Farmland Protection Program is amended to include new definitions and eligibility criteria for eligible land, such as cropland, rangeland, grassland, pasture land, and forest land that is incidental to an agricultural operation. The term 'permanent conservation easement' is defined as a conservation easement for the primary purpose of protecting the agricultural production capacity of the land, and is permanent or for the maximum duration allowed under State law. The term 'qualified State or local entity' refers to a public or private entity that operates a farm and ranch land protection program, which has purchased permanent conservation easements on at least 10 farms or ranches over 3 years and has the authority and capacity to monitor and enforce the easements. The qualified State or local entity must ensure that permanent conservation easements are enforced for the maximum duration and has financial control policies to maintain purchase prices. The permanent conservation easements must not exceed the appraised fair market value and must be certified by the Secretary based on strategic planning, long-term commitment, funds management, and project completion history. The Secretary will carry out a farm and ranch land protection program to facilitate the purchase of conservation easements for eligible land, prioritizing those with prime soils at risk of non-agricultural development. The Secretary will prioritize eligible land for conservation easements based on criteria such as staying in production agriculture, facing intense conversion pressure in rural communities, having locally-led land-use planning, and being in watersheds benefiting from farm and ranch resource protection. At least 75% of funds will be used for grants administered by the Natural Resources Conservation Service State Conservationists in consultation with State technical committees. The Secretary will prioritize eligible land for conservation easements based on criteria such as staying in production agriculture, facing intense conversion pressure in rural communities, having locally-led land-use planning, and being in watersheds benefiting from farm and ranch resource protection. Grants for purchasing permanent conservation easements will be distributed among States based on need and contributions from State or local entities. Qualified entities can use grant funds to purchase permanent conservation easements. The Secretary may enter agreements with State or local entities to purchase permanent conservation easements using grant funds. The agreements will stipulate terms and conditions for the purchase. The Secretary may enter agreements with State or local entities to purchase permanent conservation easements using grant funds. Each agreement shall authorize the entity to determine criteria and priorities for purchasing easements and establish terms and conditions for easements if State law permits. The law allows State or local entities to enforce conservation purposes of permanent conservation easements without requiring a Federal right of enforcement. The Secretary determines the amount of matching funds for the agreements. The Secretary determines the matching funds percentage required from qualified State or local entities for grants under subsection (b) based on their proposal. The proposal must include the amount of matching funds available for conservation easements and the entity's commitment. The qualified State or local entity must commit to achieving program priorities. In subsection (d), any exceptions to matching fund requirements are specified. Subsection (e) outlines limitations on the appraised fair market value for conservation easements. In subsection (d), exceptions to matching fund requirements are specified, and limitations on the appraised fair market value for conservation easements are outlined. If a qualified conservation contribution of at least 25 percent of the market value is made in connection with purchasing a conservation easement, two-thirds of the actual cost is covered. The Secretary will establish performance measures for farm and ranch land protection, including for qualified State and local entities receiving funding. Program coordination will minimize redundancy between this program and the grassland reserve program. Grant funds and technical assistance will remain available for a specified period for qualified State or local entities. The Secretary will provide grant funds and technical assistance for a reasonable period (minimum 18 months) to allow qualified State or local entities to finalize the purchase of permanent conservation easements."
