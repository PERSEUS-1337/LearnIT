    "content": "The \"Hong Kong Reversion Act\" aims to support Hong Kong's autonomous governance and the well-being of its people by ensuring the continuity of US laws after its reversion to China in 1997. It also outlines circumstances for the US President to modify laws if China fails to uphold Hong Kong's autonomy. The Joint Declaration of the UK and China on Hong Kong in 1984 is a binding agreement for the reversion of Hong Kong to China in 1997, ensuring a high degree of autonomy and basic human rights. Despite assurances from senior Chinese officials for a smooth transfer of Hong Kong to Chinese sovereignty and respect for the \"one country, two systems\" policy, there have been attempts to infringe upon Hong Kong's autonomy, including proposals to obtain confidential files on civil servants. The curr_chunk discusses various concerning actions by the Government of the People's Republic of China regarding Hong Kong, including dissolving the Legislative Council, restricting speech and association, warning religious institutions, and appointing a provisional legislature. The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of China decided on February 23, 1997, to repeal or amend certain Hong Kong ordinances, including the Bill of Rights Ordinance, Societies Ordinance of 1992, and Public Order Ordinance of 1995. Despite commitments in the Joint Declaration, UK's actions have damaged Hong Kong's autonomy, such as the agreement on the Court of Final Appeal. The reversion of Hong Kong to China has implications for US national interests and the rights of Hong Kong people. The US has a responsibility to protect its interests during this transition and ensure the human rights of Hong Kong residents are upheld. The US-Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992 is relevant in this context. The United States-Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992 ensures the continuity of US laws regarding Hong Kong's special status as a Special Administrative Region of China. It allows the President to modify the application of US laws if Hong Kong is not sufficiently autonomous. The United States-Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992 aims to maintain Hong Kong's autonomy by treating it as a separate legal entity from China, as long as China agrees to grant Hong Kong a high degree of autonomy. The Act also requires the Secretary of State to assess the implementation of the Joint Declaration. The future of Hong Kong depends on China's commitment to uphold the freedoms and self-governance outlined in the Joint Declaration. SEC. 4. CONGRESSIONAL DECLARATIONS.
