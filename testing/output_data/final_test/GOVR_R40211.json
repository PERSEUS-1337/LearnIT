    "content": "The federal government provides grants to states and local governments for human services programs. The recession is straining state and local budgets, leading to potential cuts in spending or tax increases. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 includes provisions to temporarily increase funding for human services programs. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 includes provisions to increase funding for human services programs administered by the Department of Health and Human Services. The additional funds provide fiscal relief to states and localities, community organizations, and faith-based organizations that offer benefits and services to families with children. This report does not cover proposals related to SNAP or Medicaid in the bill. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 includes provisions to increase funding for human services programs administered by the Department of Health and Human Services. The ARRA changes spending for some mandatory programs and provides additional appropriations for other programs. The report summarizes each grant or program's purpose, current funding, and proposed changes in the enacted version of the ARRA. It includes a detailed comparison of current law, the House-passed version, the Senate-passed version, and the final enacted version of the ARRA. Proposed funding increases for Low Income Home Energy Assistance are also discussed. The final version of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 did not include proposed funding increases for Low Income Home Energy Assistance and the Social Services Block Grant. The Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) block grant provides funding for cash welfare programs and other services for disadvantaged families with children. The TANF federal funding includes a basic block grant of $16.5 billion per year, along with a state spending requirement of at least $10.4 billion per year. The TANF program has a maintenance of effort requirement since FY1997, with fixed grants funded through FY2010. There is a $319 million supplemental grant for 17 states, a contingency fund with $1.3 billion remaining at the start of FY2009, and a new emergency contingency fund under the ARRA. The ARRA introduces a new temporary emergency contingency fund to provide extra funding to states in FY2009 and FY2010, covering 80% of increased recession-related costs. States' extra grants are capped at 50% of their annual basic TANF block grant for those two years. The ARRA appropriates $5 billion for the emergency fund and extends the TANF $319 million supplemental grant through FY2010. It also temporarily modifies the caseload reduction credit towards TANF work participation standards. The ARRA modifies the caseload reduction credit towards TANF work participation standards, allowing credits to be based on caseload reduction through FY2007 or FY2008 for FY2009, FY2010, and FY2011. States can now use unspent TANF grants for any TANF benefit and service, expanding flexibility. The Child Care and Development Block Grant (CCDBG) provides federal funding for child care subsidies for low-income working families. The Child Care and Development Block Grant (CCDBG) provides child care subsidies for low-income working families, allowing parents to work or participate in education/training. Funding for CCDBG comes from annual appropriations bills, with $2.062 billion allocated in FY2009. Another funding stream from the Social Security Act provides $2.917 billion annually through FY2010. These two funding sources are collectively known as the \"Child Care and Development Fund\" (CCDF). The Child Care and Development Fund (CCDF) and Child Care and Development Block Grant (CCDBG) are often used interchangeably. Discretionary CCDBG funds are allocated based on various factors. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) provides an additional $2.0 billion in discretionary funds to CCDBG, with a portion reserved for specific activities. Approximately $255 million is reserved from the total CCDBG appropriation for activities such as consumer education, increasing parental choice, and improving child care quality. States are required to use not less than 4% of their total amount for these activities. Nearly $94 million is designated for enhancing infant and toddler care quality. The Child Support Enforcement program, established in 1975, aims to secure financial support for children from noncustodial parents and help families remain self-sufficient. The Child Support Enforcement (CSE) program helps families remain self-sufficient by providing services to secure financial support from noncustodial parents. In FY2007, the program collected $24.9 billion in child support payments and served nearly 15.8 million cases. The federal government reimburses states for a share of CSE expenditures, with costs shared at a rate of 66% federal and 34% state. The federal government reimburses states for a share of Child Support Enforcement (CSE) program costs at a rate of 66% federal and 34% state. States also receive incentive payments based on performance in program areas, capped at $483 million for FY2008. Incentive payments must be reinvested back into the CSE program or related activities. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 prohibited federal matching of reinvested incentive payments, but the ARRA temporarily allows federal matching on reinvested payments. The ARRA allows CSE incentive payments received by states to draw down federal funds for the CSE program. Child welfare agencies aim to protect children from abuse and neglect, providing support through Title IV-B and Title IV-E of the Social Security Act. Title IV-E authorizes foster care, kinship guardianship, and adoption assistance programs, with the federal government reimbursing states for eligible children's care. The recent enactment of the Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions Act of 2008 allows states to provide kinship guardianship assistance payments to eligible children. Federal Title IV-E funds are reimbursed to states based on submitted claims for foster care maintenance, adoption assistance, and kinship guardianship. The federal reimbursement amount is determined using the state's federal medical assistance percentage (FMAP). The Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP) is calculated annually by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) for Medicaid programs. States with higher per capita income receive lower federal reimbursement rates, while states with lower per capita income receive higher rates. The FMAP ranges from 50% to 83% and is used to determine the federal share of Title IV-E funding for foster care maintenance, adoption assistance, and kinship guardianship assistance payments. For example, a state with an FMAP of 55% would receive $55 for every $100 in claims submitted. The ARRA temporarily increases federal matching rates for Title IV-E foster care maintenance, adoption assistance, and kinship guardianship assistance payments. It provides a general 6.2 percentage point increase in each state's FMAP from October 1, 2008, through December 2010. States received $3.1 billion in federal Title IV-E funding in FY2007, representing 55% of total claims. The law ensures no state has a lower calculated FMAP than in FY2008 during the temporary increase period. Additional FMAP increases are provided for states with high unemployment, but only for the Medicaid program, not for Title IV-E program costs. The ARRA temporarily increases federal matching rates for Title IV-E foster care maintenance, adoption assistance, and kinship guardianship assistance payments. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that the temporary FMAP increases will provide states with additional federal child welfare funding of just over $1.0 billion. States must maintain their Medicaid eligibility standards and procedures as of July 1, 2008, to be eligible for the increased FMAP. Head Start is a federal program providing early childhood development services to low-income children since 1965. Head Start is a federal program that provides child development, educational, health, and social activities for low-income children to prepare them for kindergarten. It is funded at $6.888 billion and serves over 900,000 children. The Head Start Act was reauthorized in 2007, restructuring the allocation of funds. The continuing resolution provides FY2009 funding for Head Start at a $6.9 billion annual rate, with additional funding from the House, Senate, and ARRA. Funds are allocated for various activities such as training, research, cost-of-living increases, and program expansions. The ARRA allocates $1.1 billion for the expansion of Early Head Start programs, with a portion for training and monitoring activities. The Community Services Block Grant program provides federal funds for antipoverty activities, originating from Lyndon Johnson's War on Poverty in 1964. The Community Services Block Grant (CSBG) program funds local Community Action Agencies (CAAs) to address causes of poverty. Low-income individuals are directly involved in designing and administering antipoverty activities. Services funded by CSBG include emergency assistance, home weatherization, youth and senior activities, transportation, credit counseling, domestic violence assistance, parenting education, food pantries, and shelters. Local agencies also provide information and referral to other community services like job training and vocational education. The CSBG program funds local Community Action Agencies to address poverty by providing various services such as emergency assistance, home weatherization, youth and senior activities, and more. States receive block grant funding based on a formula established in 1981, with at least 90% of the funds passed on to local eligible entities. About 1,000 local CAAs currently receive funding through the CSBG, which is allocated at an annual level of $654 million in FY2009. The CSBG program is funded at $654 million annually in FY2009, with an additional $1 billion from ARRA. Funds are allocated based on set-aside provisions for territories and training. The House Appropriations Committee highlighted the support provided by CSBG to low-income families, homeless individuals, and the elderly, especially during times of economic hardship. Community action agencies are receiving additional economic recovery funds to address increased requests for assistance. The funds will target over 1,000 local communities impacted by revenue shortfalls. States must allocate at least 1% of the funds for state-level activities, with the rest passed through to local entities. The Compassion Capital Fund provides grants to help local organizations expand social services for low-income communities, with $53 million allocated in FY2009. The FY2009 continuing resolution allocates $53 million for the Compassion Capital Fund. The ARRA provides $50 million for direct grants to nonprofit organizations for capacity building activities in communities affected by the economic downturn, separate from the Compassion Capital Fund."
