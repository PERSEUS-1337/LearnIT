Section 1773.1 of the Labor Code is amended to include employer payments for various benefits such as health and welfare, pension, vacation, travel, subsistence, training programs, worker protection programs, and industry advancement fees under collective bargaining agreements. Employer payments include contributions to a trustee or third person, actual costs for providing benefits to workers, and payments to the California Apprenticeship Council.

Increased employer payments leading to lower wages are not a violation of prevailing wage determination. Employer payments credited against prevailing wage obligation, except for required benefits, monitoring laws, and industry advancement fees not under collective bargaining agreement. Increased employer payments leading to lower wages not a violation of prevailing wage determination. The employer payment contribution is irrevocable unless made in error and is based on criteria set in a collective bargaining agreement. The employer can take credit for the payment even if contributions are not made in the same pay period, as long as they are made regularly on a quarterly basis. The credit for employer payments on public works projects is computed annually unless certain conditions are met, such as an enforceable obligation, project labor agreement, payments to the California Apprenticeship Council, or a determination by the director that annualization is not appropriate. The director determines that annualization is not suitable for this chapter. For determining per diem wages for contracts, representatives of workers must file collective bargaining agreements with the Department of Industrial Relations. The agreements can be considered if filed 30 days before bids, with a temporary typescript allowed if the final draft is not formalized. When modifications or extensions affecting per diem wages or holidays are made to a collective bargaining agreement, they must be filed. Failure to comply with filing requirements will not invalidate a prevailing wage determination if the information considered is accurate."
