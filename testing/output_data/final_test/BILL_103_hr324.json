    "content": "The Act is known as the \"Jacob Wetterling Crimes Against Children Registration Act\" and establishes a program. The Attorney General establishes guidelines for State programs requiring convicted individuals of criminal offenses against minor victims to register their current address with law enforcement for 10 years after release. The defined offenses include kidnapping, false imprisonment, criminal sexual conduct, and solicitation of a minor for sexual conduct. The paragraph discusses the registration requirement for individuals convicted of offenses against minor victims, including solicitation of a minor for sexual conduct, use of a minor in a sexual performance, and other sexual offenses against minors. The approved State registration program for individuals convicted of offenses against minors requires informing them of the duty to register upon release from prison, parole, supervised release, or probation. They must also report any change of residence address to a designated State law enforcement agency within 10 days. Upon release, individuals convicted of offenses against minors must register their new address with the law enforcement agency within 10 days. They also need to provide fingerprints and a photograph if not already obtained, and sign a form confirming their registration duty. Upon release, individuals convicted of offenses against minors must register their new address with the law enforcement agency within 10 days. The duty of the person to register under this section is explained. Information is transferred to the state and the FBI within 3 days. The State law enforcement agency enters the information into the State law enforcement record system and notifies the appropriate law enforcement agency where the person expects to reside. Conviction data and fingerprints are transmitted to the FBI. Annual verification is required on each anniversary of a person's conviction. Annual verification is required on each anniversary of a person's initial registration date. A nonforwardable verification form is mailed to the person's last reported address, which must be returned within 10 days signed, confirming residence at the same address. Failure to return the form within the specified time results in a violation unless proven otherwise. Any change of address by a registered person must be reported to the designated State law enforcement agency and the appropriate local law enforcement agency. The information collected in the registration program is treated as private data and can only be disclosed to law enforcement agencies. Registered individuals must report any change of address to law enforcement agencies. Information collected in the registration program is private and can only be disclosed to law enforcement for investigative purposes or to government agencies conducting background checks on applicants for positions involving contact with children. A person convicted of an offense triggering registration in one state must register their new address with law enforcement in another state within 10 days of establishing residence, if the new state has a registration requirement. Those required to register must do so for 10 years after release from prison, parole, supervised release, or probation. A person required to register under a State program established pursuant to this section who knowingly fails to register shall be subject to criminal penalties. Each State has 3 years to implement this section. Non-compliant States may face a 10% reduction in funds allocated under the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968. The House of Representatives passed the bill on November 20, 1993. Signed by DONNALD K. ANDERSON, Clerk, and witnessed by Dallas L. Dendy, Jr., Assistant to the Clerk."
