    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Spokane Tribe of Indians of the Spokane Reservation Grand Coulee Dam Equitable Compensation Settlement Act\". It includes findings related to the settlement. The Congress directed the Corps of Engineers to investigate the Columbia River for power production sites. The Corps recommended sites like the Grand Coulee Dam location for development by local authorities or utilities. Licensees under the Federal Power Act must pay Indian tribes for land use. The Columbia Basin Commission received a permit for water power development at the Grand Coulee Site in 1933. In the mid-1930s, the Federal Government federalized the Grand Coulee Dam project, recognizing the Spokane Tribe and the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation's compensable interests in hydropower development, salmon fishery extinguishment, and land inundation. Congress later enacted legislation in 1940 to grant rights related to the project. In 1940, Congress granted the United States rights over lands of the Spokane Tribe and Colville Indian Reservations for the Grand Coulee Dam project. The Secretary of the Interior determined compensation for the required lands and rights-of-way. The Spokane Tribe received $4,700, and the Colville Reservation received $63,000 in 1940. After 43 years of litigation, the Indian Claims Commission settled the matter in 1994. Congress ratified an agreement between the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation and the United States for past damages and annual payments of $15,250,000 in perpetuity. The agreement is based on revenues from the sale of electric power by the Bonneville Power Administration. Legal opinions and studies have recognized that the Spokane Tribe suffered similar damages. The Spokane Tribe suffered damages similar to the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation but was unable to bring its own action due to a 5-year statute of limitations. Factors contributing to this include the failure of the Bureau of Indian Affairs to fulfill its advisory responsibilities and the Commissioner of Indian Affairs imposing improper actions. The Spokane Tribe faced delays in retaining claims attorneys due to improper requirements imposed by the Commissioner of Indian Affairs. As a result of the Grand Coulee Dam project, the tribe suffered the loss of its salmon fishery, hydropower sites, and revenues. Additionally, over 39 percent of Indian-owned lands used for the project belonged to the Spokane Tribe. The Act aims to provide fair compensation to the Spokane Tribe for damages from the Grand Coulee Dam project, similar to the Colville Reservation. It establishes a Settlement Fund Account. The \"Spokane Tribe of Indians Settlement Fund Account\" is established in the Treasury to compensate for the use of tribal lands for hydropower generation from 1940 to 1994. The \"Spokane Tribe of Indians Settlement Fund Account\" compensates the Spokane Tribe for the use of tribal lands for hydropower generation from 1940 to 1994 by making annual payments to the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation. The Administrator of the Bonneville Power Administration pays into the Fund Account a percentage of the authorized sum to maintain purchasing power. The Bonneville Power Administration makes annual payments to the Spokane Tribe equal to 39.4 percent of the payments made to the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation. SEC. 5. USE AND TREATMENT OF SETTLEMENT FUNDS. The Secretary of the Treasury will transfer settlement funds to the Spokane Business Council within 60 days of receiving a written request. Twenty-five percent of the funds will be used for general benefit, while seventy-five percent will be used for specific purposes. The settlement funds allocated for resource development, credit, scholarship, and economic development programs. Annual payments to the Spokane Tribe can be used or invested without requiring approval from the Secretaries of the Treasury or Interior. The settlement funds allocated for various programs do not require approval from Secretaries once transferred to the Spokane Tribe. Payments from these funds will be treated similarly to the Investment Fund described in Public Law 99-346. The funds will be subject to an annual tribal governmental audit. SEC. 6. REPAYMENT CREDIT. Beginning in the fiscal year following enactment of this Act, the Administrator of the Bonneville Power Administration will deduct a percentage from interest payments to the Secretary of the Treasury to match deductions made for payments to the Spokane Tribe, similar to those made for the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation. Each deduction will be credited to interest payments due to the Secretary of the Treasury for that fiscal year. During the fiscal year, deductions will be made from interest payments on debt associated with the Federal Columbia River Power System's generation function. Any excess deduction will be allocated to other interest payments due that fiscal year and applied as a credit against other payments to the Secretary of the Treasury. SEC. 7. SATISFACTION OF CLAIMS.\n\nPayment under section 4 constitutes full payment and satisfaction of the Spokane Tribe's claim to a fair share of annual hydropower revenues from the Grand Coulee Dam project. This includes proportional entitlement based on lump sum damages from 1940 through 1994 and annual payments by the Bonneville Power Administration to the Colville Tribes from 1995 until the enactment of this Act. SEC. 8. DEFINITIONS.\n\nThe term \"Confederated Tribes Act\" refers to the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation Grand Coulee Dam Settlement Act. The \"Fund Account\" is the Spokane Tribe of Indians Settlement Fund Account. The \"Spokane Tribe\" refers to the Spokane Tribe of Indians of the Spokane Reservation.\n\nSEC. 9. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\nAppropriate sums are authorized for carrying out the purposes of this Act."
