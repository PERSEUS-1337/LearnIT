    "content": "The \"Child Welfare Provider Inclusion Act of 2017\" is the short title of this Act. The purpose of the Act is to provide findings and purposes related to child welfare services. Congress finds that child welfare service providers have the right to free exercise of religion, including the freedom to act in accordance with their religious beliefs. Most States rely on charitable and religious organizations to provide government-funded child welfare services, with religious organizations having a long history of involvement in this field. Religious organizations contract with governmental entities to provide child welfare services, displaying excellence and benefiting children and families. Some States have refused to contract with religious organizations that cannot provide services due to religious beliefs. Ensuring that religious organizations can continue to provide child welfare services benefits children and families receiving federally funded services. Individual child welfare service providers with varying religious beliefs should not be forced to choose between their beliefs and their work. The government entities provide child welfare services through various organizations and individuals with different religious beliefs or moral convictions. The inability of some religious organizations or individuals to provide certain services will not hinder access to federally funded child welfare services. The funding and administration of these services have a significant impact on interstate commerce. The Act aims to protect child welfare service providers' constitutional rights under the Fourteenth Amendment by allowing them to refrain from certain services based on their religious beliefs. Congress has the authority to pass this Act under various constitutional powers. The Act aims to protect child welfare service providers' right to decline services conflicting with their religious beliefs or moral convictions. It prohibits governmental entities from discriminating against providers for this reason. The Act aims to protect child welfare service providers' rights based on their religious beliefs or moral convictions, and provide relief to those whose rights have been violated. The Act prohibits discrimination or adverse actions against child welfare service providers based on their religious beliefs or moral convictions. It also specifies that funds may be withheld for violations. The Secretary of Health and Human Services can withhold 15 percent of Federal funds from a State for child welfare services if the State violates specified sections. Additionally, there is a provision for a private right of action. SEC. 5. PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION. A child welfare service provider can assert a violation of section 3 in a judicial proceeding and obtain relief, including declaratory relief, injunctive relief, and compensatory damages. Attorneys' fees and costs can be recovered if the provider prevails. By accepting Federal funds for child welfare services, a State waives its sovereign immunity for claims under this section. SEC. 6. SEVERABILITY. SEC. 6. SEVERABILITY. If any provision of this Act is deemed unconstitutional, the rest of the Act remains unaffected. SEC. 7. EFFECTIVE DATE. The amendments made by this Act will take effect on the 1st day of the 1st fiscal year after enactment.

Each year of the 2-year legislative session is considered a separate regular session. SEC. 8. DEFINITIONS.
