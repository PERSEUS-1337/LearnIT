    "content": "For four decades, Congress has debated whether air traffic services should be provided by an independent entity instead of the FAA. Proposals have suggested corporatization or privatization of the air traffic control system, with stakeholder involvement in the business entity. Interest in restructuring air traffic services reemerged in 2013 after budget cuts led to FAA controller furloughs and delays in upgrading facilities. Delays in implementing NextGen have renewed interest in private models for air traffic services. The Office of Inspector General found that FAA lacks a clear process for coordinating high-priority research projects for NextGen development. A proposed privatized model for air traffic control was considered in the past, but Congress did not include it in FAA reauthorization. The Trump Administration aims to shift air traffic control to an independent organization. The report examines past proposals to corporatize or privatize FAA air traffic functions and compares air traffic management structures in other countries. FAA oversees civilian air traffic control operations in the US, funded through two accounts in the budget. Operations and Maintenance account funds air traffic operations and safety programs, while the Facilities and Equipment account provides funding for air traffic facilities. The FAA's Operations and Maintenance account in FY2016 funds air traffic facilities, equipment, and technology development. The Air Traffic Organization operates 315 facilities, including control centers, TRACON facilities, and airport control towers. The organization has about 35,000 federal employees, including over 14,000 air traffic controllers. Additionally, more than 250 airport towers are overseen by private operators under the Federal Contract Tower program. The FAA's funding primarily comes from the Airport and Airway Trust Fund, which is supported by various taxes on passenger tickets, jet fuel, and other aviation-related fees. Additionally, the FAA collects user fees from aircraft flying in U.S.-controlled airspace. Proposals to restructure air traffic control have been discussed since 1974, but none have advanced beyond congressional committees. These proposals aim to address issues such as FAA funding tied to political processes, lack of dedicated budget for long-term investments, and inadequate management for modernization needs. The 1974 study recommended an independent government corporation with assured financing to carry out air traffic control functions, addressing issues such as delays, cost overruns, workforce restrictions, strained management-labor relations, and inadequate stakeholder engagement in technological initiatives. The 1974 study recommended an independent government corporation to handle air traffic control functions. A proposal was made for a board of directors to set corporate policy, with representation from various sectors. Two bills were introduced in 1976 to establish a United States Air Traffic Services Corporation, managed by a 10-member board with authority over corporate officers and tax rates for revenue sources. In 1981, over 11,000 striking air traffic controllers were fired for not returning to work. The Heritage Foundation proposed a corporate model for air traffic control in 1982, suggesting a two-tiered system with a not-for-profit corporation responsible for system design and coordination. The Heritage Foundation proposed a two-tiered system for air traffic control in 1982, with a not-for-profit corporation responsible for system design and coordination. The proposal included awarding long-term contracts to for-profit contractors limited to operating three facilities each to promote competition and prevent monopoly pricing. This decentralization aimed to prevent system-wide strikes while allowing for local unionization and collective bargaining. The proposal aligned with Reagan Administration goals to reduce federal government size and accommodate labor interests. The concept was later examined by the National Academy of Public Administration in 1986 at the request of the Air Transport Association of America. In 1986, the National Academy of Public Administration recommended separating FAA from DOT, possibly turning it into a government-owned corporation or spinning off air traffic functions into a stand-alone government-owned corporation. S. 1159 (100th Congress) proposed creating a National Aviation Authority as an independent government corporation funded by user fees, with a policy advisory board for oversight. Safety standards would remain under FAA's responsibility. The 1988 commission established by President Ronald Reagan studied privatization opportunities in the federal government, focusing on air traffic control. It found that post-deregulation airline traffic growth strained FAA resources and criticized micromanagement by various entities. The commission recommended keeping safety regulation under FAA but suggested privatizing certain functions, such as equipment maintenance and weather briefings, at en route centers. The 1988 commission recommended privatizing certain functions in air traffic control, such as equipment maintenance and weather briefings. They suggested moving towards privately operated airport traffic control towers and contracting operation of flight service stations. Some recommendations were implemented, like the growth of contract tower operations since 1993. However, Congress never accepted the recommendation to increase FAA expenditures through user charges. The 1988 commission recommended privatizing certain functions in air traffic control and suggested creating a corporation within DOT to manage and fund air traffic control operations. It called for removing funding from the federal budget and implementing best practices from the private sector. These recommendations aimed to address the limitations of FAA's current budget process and procurement system. The National Performance Review, led by Vice President Al Gore, highlighted the challenges faced by the FAA's air traffic control system, including budget constraints and delays in technology modernization. It recommended creating a government-owned corporation within DOT to improve funding and operational efficiency. The National Performance Review recommended creating a government-owned corporation within DOT to improve funding and operational efficiency for the FAA's air traffic control system. The corporation would be supported by user fees and governed by a board of directors representing the system's customers, allowing for easier equipment purchases and workforce management. In January 1994, the Clinton Administration adopted the recommendation, proposing a public corporation to run the nation's air traffic control system overseen by a CEO and an 11-member board of directors. The proposed United States Air Traffic Service (USATS) Corporation, overseen by a CEO and an 11-member board of directors, was to be funded by user fees and other charges to cover operational costs. The corporation would conduct a cost allocation study to determine fee structures for different air traffic service and user categories, while ensuring compliance with international agreements. The proposed United States Air Traffic Service (USATS) Corporation would be funded by user fees and other charges, with restrictions on fees for public or military aircraft and general aviation not used for hire. General aviation groups were concerned about potential airline influence on the USATS board. Chairman James Oberstar criticized the Clinton Administration's ATC reform proposal, expressing concerns about safety, organizational disruption, and potential airline dominance on the ATC board. He argued that an ATC corporation, as a natural monopoly, may not prioritize safety and efficiency due to lack of competitive pressures. The General Accounting Office criticized the USATS proposal in May 1994, attributing delays and cost overruns in air traffic modernization projects to technical and managerial factors, as well as poor performance by private contractors. GAO expressed skepticism about the proposed corporation achieving financial self-sufficiency, citing Amtrak as an example of potential financial problems. The GAO criticized the USATS proposal in 1994, citing delays and cost overruns in air traffic modernization projects. Advocates for ATC corporatization continue to push for FAA reform, with renewed interest due to funding and modernization concerns. In 2014, the FAA Management Advisory Council recommended separating the Air Traffic Organization from the FAA and creating an aviation stakeholder board. The Aviation Innovation, Reform, and Reauthorization Act of 2016 recommended establishing a not-for-profit corporation to provide air traffic services currently handled by the FAA. The corporation would operate as a nonprofit exempt from federal taxes and focus on providing air traffic services in domestic and international airspace. The proposed corporation in the Aviation Innovation, Reform, and Reauthorization Act of 2016 would operate as a nonprofit in international airspace, overseen by a board of directors representing various stakeholder groups. The corporation's CEO would also serve as a board member and be responsible for day-to-day management. The Aviation Innovation, Reform, and Reauthorization Act of 2016 proposed a nonprofit corporation overseen by a board of directors representing stakeholder groups. The board would have directors from business aviation and aerospace manufacturers, serving staggered three-year terms. Responsibilities included budget approval, strategic planning, debt issuance authorization, fee setting, bylaws establishment, CEO hiring, and annual report publication. The Aviation Innovation, Reform, and Reauthorization Act of 2016 proposed a nonprofit corporation with a board of directors representing various aviation stakeholders. The board's key responsibility was to set charges and fees for air traffic services in compliance with international policies. Fees would not apply to military aircraft, piston engine-powered aircraft, noncommercial jets, or commuter air taxi flights in remote locations. The Secretary of Transportation would determine the specific geographic areas affected by the fees. The Secretary of Transportation would specify geographic areas for the remote location exemption for air taxis. Proposals for user fees, based on aircraft weight and distance flown, have faced opposition in Congress. The George W. Bush Administration's plan for user fees on commercial jets was rejected by the 110th Congress. The 111th Congress considered a $25-per-flight surcharge on commercial and general aviation jet traffic, which was criticized and not approved. The Obama Administration proposed a $100 per-flight user charge on commercial and general aviation jets and turboprops in controlled airspace, but Congress has not acted on it. General aviation groups are concerned about governance and oversight of an air traffic corporation, fearing their interests would be overshadowed by the airline industry. Funding mechanisms for a privatized air traffic system could potentially cost general aviation users more. The Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association and business aviation interests opposed 2016 reform proposals for a privatized air traffic system due to concerns about user fee funding and loss of congressional oversight. Labor organizations supported a move away from FAA to a corporate structure. FAA technicians initially favored a corporate structure for air traffic control but shifted to supporting the FAA-managed system after gaining collective bargaining rights in the 1990s. Despite past contentious negotiations, the National Air Traffic Controllers Association (NATCA) did not advocate for privatization, commissioning a study in 2003 highlighting the drawbacks. In 2016, NATCA endorsed H.R. 4441 for stable funding solutions. The FAA addressed concerns by offering stable funding to address staffing needs for safety, efficiency, and innovation in the aviation community. The proposal includes labor provisions to ensure employee benefits and smooth collective bargaining negotiations. Airlines are concerned about the lag in progress on NextGen, the FAA's initiative to modernize the air traffic system. Congress has struggled to improve NextGen, the initiative to modernize the air traffic system. H.R. 4441 aimed to bring reforms similar to successful models in other countries, promoting funding stability and accountability. However, the issue of funding a corporatized or privatized air traffic control system remains unresolved. Opposition to aviation user fees, limited applicability of user fees to commercial airline operations, and lack of support from interest groups representing general and business aviation have hindered progress. The Federal Aviation Reauthorization Act of 1996 included language authorizing reform of FAA procurement and personnel management systems to keep pace with technology. It mandated the creation of a 15-member FAA Management Advisory Council to provide guidance on operations and regulatory matters. Recently, the council recommended further action to fully corporatize or privatize FAA air traffic control functions. The Federal Aviation Reauthorization Act of 1996 authorized reform of FAA procurement and personnel management. It recommended fully corporatizing or privatizing FAA air traffic control functions and proposed a user fee-funded Air Traffic Performance Fund to replace the Airport and Airway Trust Fund. The commission suggested a performance-based structure for air traffic services. The National Civil Aviation Review Commission recommended that the FAA adopt system performance metrics to improve service and safety. This led to the creation of a chief operating officer position within the FAA under the Wendell H. Ford Aviation Investment and Reform Act for the 21st Century. President Clinton later established the Air Traffic Organization within the FAA to manage air traffic services, acquisitions, and research activities. The FAA has implemented various measures to expand the role of contractors in providing air traffic services, including outsourcing operations of air traffic control towers and using contracts to maintain new technologies. This has been supported by Congress, despite ongoing debates about corporatization or privatization of the air traffic system. The Federal Contract Tower (FCT) program was established in 1982 to provide air traffic services at low-activity towers after a nationwide air traffic controller strike. Initially a trial program at five airports, it grew to 27 towers by 1993. Endorsed by the National Performance Review for cost-effectiveness, Congress mandated an FAA study in 1999 to expand the program to include all FAA-operated towers without radar capability. Funding was provided for a cost-sharing program to keep towers operational. The Federal Contract Tower (FCT) program was established in 1982 to provide air traffic services at low-activity towers. A 2003 audit found cost savings at contract towers due to lower staffing levels and salaries. As of January 2017, there were 253 towers operating under the FCT program, with 16 in the cost-sharing program. Contract towers are staffed by personnel employed by three companies under contract to the FAA. The Federal Contract Tower (FCT) program, established in 1982, provides air traffic services at low-activity towers. Controllers with military or FAA experience are hired by companies under contract to the FAA. In 2013, budget cuts threatened tower closures, but Congress intervened to keep all FCT program towers open. The incident highlighted how annual appropriations can impact air traffic services. Since 2006, FAA has outsourced work at automated flight service station facilities. In 2005, FAA completed a competitive source selection process to shift 2,500 federal positions at 58 AFSS facilities to contract operations, projected to save $1.7 billion over 10 years. Lockheed Martin Corporation was awarded a contract to operate AFSS facilities in the U.S. (excluding Alaska), reducing the number of employees to fewer than 900. The contractor reduced the number of facilities by over 90% and positions by more than 60% compared to 2005 due to changes in user demand and increased automation. In 2007, service disruptions occurred, leading to a $9.7 million withholding of contract incentives by the FAA. However, performance has improved since then, with positive satisfaction ratings from users. The contract has been extended through FY2017, with options to extend further through FY2019. The FAA has historically maintained air traffic control equipment through a combination of its own technician workforce and support services contracts. However, there is a shift towards private vendors being responsible for equipment maintenance, with contractors retaining ownership and potentially charging FAA for use. An example is the ADS-B ground station contract, where the system developer, ITT Corporation, retains ownership of about 800 ground stations for GPS-based aircraft tracking. The FAA is shifting towards private vendors maintaining air traffic control equipment, with contractors like ITT Corporation retaining ownership of equipment and charging a subscription fee for data relay to FAA facilities. This trend raises debates on ATC corporatization, with arguments for greater flexibility in contractual arrangements versus maintaining air traffic control as a federal function. International law allows countries to establish government corporations or private entities for air traffic services. Under international law, countries have the exclusive right to regulate and control navigable airspace over their territories and waters. Air traffic services manage airspace usage, including air traffic control, navigation equipment maintenance, and traffic management for efficient airport and airspace utilization. The term \"air navigation services\" encompasses activities related to airspace and airport capacity, carried out by air navigation service providers (ANSPs) internationally. FAA is the ANSP for the United States, while other countries are establishing government-owned or private corporations for air traffic control and other services. The term \"air navigation services\" includes activities related to airspace and airport capacity, with ANSPs like FAA in the United States. A 2005 GAO study of ANSPs in Australia, Germany, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and Canada found that they were subject to external safety regulation, operated as self-financed businesses, and improved productivity through investments in facilities and equipment. Commercialization allowed ANSPs to implement modernization projects more efficiently. The corporate structure of European ANSPs allowed for faster and cost-effective benefits compared to designing systems from scratch. European ANSPs formed partnerships for procurement, with similarities to FAA but less busy airspace due to fewer general aviation traffic. Different organizational models among global ANSPs are discussed, with NAV CANADA being a nonprofit private corporation governed by a 15-member board of directors. NAV CANADA is a private-sector nonprofit company governed by a 15-member board of directors representing airlines, the Canadian government, employee organizations, general aviation interests, and outside stakeholders. The company sets user fees based on projected flight operations to cover operational costs, capital expenditures, and debt service requirements, with long-term financing obtained through publicly traded bonds. NAV CANADA maintains stable rates by using a rate stabilization account, avoiding yearly fee adjustments based on air traffic changes. User charges remained unchanged from 2007 to 2014, with a 7.6% decrease in charges in 2016. In partnership with Iridium Communications Inc., NAV CANADA formed Aireon LLC to develop a satellite-based global aircraft tracking system. Aireon aims to provide global air traffic surveillance using 75 low-orbit satellites, with NAV CANADA as the first customer for this service. NAV CANADA will be the first customer for a satellite-based system to improve surveillance of North Atlantic airspace and remote regions of northern Canada and the Arctic. The service may be marketed to other air navigation service providers, airlines, and aircraft operators for real-time global flight tracking. Airways NZ in New Zealand operates as a highly autonomous government-owned corporation with user fees based on economic value added. Airservices Australia, the ANSP, manages air traffic in Australia based on economic value added (EVA). It returns profits to users as rebates and consults with major airline customers on setting fees. The organization was established in 1995 after the division of the Australian Civil Aviation Authority. Revenues come from a fee-for-service scheme for air traffic services and airport rescue and firefighting. Airservices Australia manages air traffic services and airport rescue and firefighting services based on economic value added. The pricing structure is overseen by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. Operating profits have been realized, but revenue growth has been constrained due to a downturn in the domestic aviation market. In Germany, air traffic functions were transferred to Deutsche Flugsicherung in 1993, which operates four control centers and manages about 3 million flights annually with a staff of 5,500, including 2,000 air traffic controllers. The concept of privatizing air traffic services in Germany arose due to concerns about modernizing infrastructure and low civil-service wages compared to Eurocontrol. The German government's budget constraints delayed the process, but eventually, Deutsche Flugsicherung (DFS) was established as a user fee-funded enterprise to procure systems and installations. DFS has been solely funded by user fees since its inception. DFS has been funded entirely by user fees and user fees in Germany and the EU are being harmonized. En route service charges are based on aircraft weight and distance flown, while terminal services are determined by aircraft weight. Air traffic control in Switzerland is operated by skyguide, a joint-stock company overseen by a seven-member board of directors appointed by shareholders. The Swiss government holds almost all shares of skyguide. Skyguide, a privately held company, is responsible for air navigation services in Switzerland. It receives revenue from overflights, approach charges, and government compensation. The company's commercial air traffic revenue has declined, leading to cost-cutting measures and route charge increases. Skyguide management was implicated in a 2002 midair collision in Germany, leading to 71 fatalities. German investigators found that staffing issues contributed to the accident. Critics argue that corporate cost-cutting measures could compromise air traffic safety. In the UK, air traffic services are operated by NATS Holdings Limited as a public-private partnership since 2001. The UK government holds a 49% share in the corporation. The private partner, Airline Group, has diversified ownership to include institutional investors like the Universities Superannuation Scheme. LHR Airports Limited also became a partner in NATS Holdings Limited after a financial restructuring. NATS Holdings, a UK air traffic services operator, underwent a financial restructuring with the UK government providing \u00a365 million. Currently, the UK government holds 49% of NATS Holdings, with the Airline Group controlling 42%. The company operates on a for-profit basis and is regulated by the Civil Aviation Authority. Additionally, NATS Holdings has a separate subsidiary that provides air traffic control services internationally. In December 2014, NATS UK experienced a system failure at its air traffic control center in Swanwick, Hampshire, leading to delays and cancellations. Concerns were raised about cost-cutting efforts affecting upgrades and the selection of a costly custom configuration. An independent inquiry found no safety incidents but highlighted the need for better system resiliency and addressing disruptions' impacts on users. Suggestions included providing stronger financial incentives to managers and developing long-term objectives. Europe has 37 separate ANSPs operating 63 en route facilities to manage airspace slightly larger than the United States, with 63% less air traffic. Direct comparisons with the US government-run model have limitations due to these differences. CANSO is the main source of data on ANSPs' productivity and costs. CANSO, the main source of data on ANSPs' productivity and costs, faces challenges in directly comparing ANSPs due to varying data availability. NAV CANADA stands out for handling a significant volume of air traffic compared to other ANSPs. Productivity and cost-effectiveness comparisons are based on metrics like air traffic controller workforce size and labor costs, with trends over time being more meaningful for individual ANSP performance assessment. CANSO defines productivity as the number of flight hours completed by aircraft operating under instrument flight rules (IFR) logged by an ANSP divided by its operational air traffic controller workforce. Productivity is highly correlated with traffic density. FAA handled 1,767 IFR flight hours per air traffic controller, while NAV CANADA's productivity topped the list at 1,843 IFR flight hours per controller in 2014. Other countries like Japan and Mexico had lower IFR flight hours per controller. In 2014, smaller countries had varying IFR flight hours per controller, with Estonia's ANSP handling 1,258 hours. FAA controllers worked 1,824 hours on average, while NAV CANADA controllers worked 1,624 hours. Thailand had controllers working over 2,800 hours due to high air traffic growth, while Serbia and Montenegro had the lowest average of 1,152 hours. ANSPs in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the UK reduced costs per IFR aircraft movement in 2009. In Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom, costs per IFR aircraft movement decreased by 5% to 15% from 1997 to 2004. France also saw a 15% reduction in costs despite air traffic services being government-run. However, the FAA's operating costs increased by over 20% during the same period, driven by high labor costs. Operating costs for ANSPs providing air traffic services in 2014 ranged from $122 to $1,232 per IFR hour, with FAA costs slightly below average at $465 per IFR hour. The average annual cost increases for air traffic services dropped to 2% between 2010 and 2014. FAA and NAV CANADA air traffic controller costs per IFR hour were very similar at roughly $110 and $123, respectively. Controller costs at FAA and NAV CANADA were nearly identical at about $109-$110 per IFR hour when adjusted for purchasing power parity. In 2014, annual costs per controller were roughly $200,000 at both FAA and NAV CANADA, with controller costs per flight hour converging between the two organizations. FAA's annual average change in controller employment costs between 2008 and 2012 was 5.0%, while NAV CANADA's was 0.4%. However, between 2010 and 2014, FAA controller costs increased by about 1% annually, compared to NAV CANADA's 2% increase. This has led to a narrowing of the difference in controller costs per IFR hour between FAA and NAV CANADA. The 2009 research report found that corporatized or privatized ANSPs, such as NATS UK, skyguide, DSNA, and DFS, showed improved service quality and performance due to technological modernization and increased funding availability. Commercial and private ANSPs were more willing to invest in technology projects to enhance service quality without competition from other government projects. The researchers contrasted the willingness of commercial and private ANSPs to forgo nonessential features and use off-the-shelf solutions for faster implementation and lower costs with FAA's acquisition delays affecting operational performance and service quality. While some aspects of service quality have improved under corporate or private models, the impact on user satisfaction remains unclear. Limited data suggests U.S. pilots rate FAA performance higher than Canadian pilots rate NAV CANADA. The 2005 study compared ATC systems in various countries and found that corporate models improved safety. A 2009 study showed that corporate air traffic service providers reduced serious safety incidents. Executives and regulators emphasized the importance of safety in air navigation services. Investigators from Transport Canada and the Canadian Transportation Safety Board noted improved safety culture and data reporting since commercialization. Safety regulators agreed that corporatization or privatization did not compromise safety, with a trend of reduced safety incidents among air navigation service providers. While a 2014 incident raised concerns about physical security risks, there is no conclusive evidence that private entities are less capable of providing adequate security for critical infrastructure in the United States. The United States' critical infrastructure, including chemical plants, refineries, pipelines, and the electrical grid, is primarily managed by private corporations. The potential transition of FAA air traffic services to a government corporation or private entity presents unique challenges in crafting enabling legislation. Various organizational structures and oversight models, including quasi-governmental organizations, have been considered for this purpose. The Tennessee Valley Authority, Fannie Mae, Amtrak, the Smithsonian Institution, and the National Academies are among the entities that work closely with the FAA. The FAA has experience outsourcing major acquisitions of air traffic control technologies and certain operational aspects of the national airspace system. However, radar control operations have not been outsourced, and air traffic services have only been contracted out at low-activity nonradar towers. Congress has shown interest in public-private partnerships in air traffic control. Public-private partnerships (P3s) have been of interest to Congress in various fields, including air traffic control. Federal agencies like the Department of Defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs have utilized P3s for real-property management. The Department of Transportation (DOT) has encouraged states to use P3s for highway and public transportation projects. A P3 approach involves a hybrid model between government-owned corporations and private entities, with shared financial and organizational oversight between the federal government and industry stakeholders. The creation of a private corporation regulated by the FAA could resemble NAV CANADA's corporate structure. Stakeholders in corporate governance are represented through the board of directors in private air traffic services corporations. NAV CANADA is an example of a closely held private corporation by industry stakeholders. Limited investor interest has kept Switzerland's skyguide mostly under government ownership. The FAA Management Advisory Council Report suggested spinning off FAA's Air Traffic Organization as a separate corporate entity. The FAA Management Advisory Council Report suggested spinning off FAA's Air Traffic Organization as a separate corporate entity, similar to private air traffic services corporations like NAV CANADA. However, corporatizing ATO could be problematic as certain functions would still be under FAA's control, unlike most international examples where the air navigation service provider owns the necessary equipment for air traffic control. This ownership allows for direct investment in service contracts and technology modernization. The potential corporatization or privatization of the FAA's Air Traffic Organization (ATO) in the United States raises concerns about its ability to effectively modernize equipment and technology, particularly the NextGen air traffic systems initiative. Without ownership of facilities and equipment, the corporation's role in modernization efforts may be limited, and procurement activities could remain under FAA control. A more comprehensive transition to a corporate structure would involve tying facilities and equipment functions directly to air traffic services for greater autonomy in acquisitions and maintenance. The potential corporatization or privatization of the FAA's Air Traffic Organization (ATO) in the United States raises concerns about its ability to effectively modernize equipment and technology. Functions related to performance testing or certification of air traffic and air navigation equipment could potentially be transitioned to a corporate air navigation service provider, but policy makers may want to retain these functions as governmental regulatory activities. Flight testing for navigation facilities like instrument landing systems could be considered regulatory certification activities under FAA's safety functions. The Traffic Service Corporation Act directed the transfer of property and functions from FAA to USATS. H.R. 4441 proposed transferring property to the ATC Corporation without cost for air traffic services. If assets were sold, proceeds would be used accordingly. The Traffic Service Corporation Act directed the transfer of property and functions from FAA to USATS. H.R. 4441 proposed transferring property to the ATC Corporation without cost for air traffic services. If assets were sold, proceeds would be used accordingly. The corporation could sell assets provided by the federal government without charge and use proceeds for acquiring air navigation facilities or other capital assets. Property located at an FAA technical facility would revert to federal government ownership if not needed by the corporation or to protect US interests. Proposals to corporatize or privatize air traffic services in the US have been linked to debates on user fees. Financing for a government-owned corporation could be similar to the FAA's current model, funded through taxes and fees on passengers and cargo. NAV CANADA, an air traffic control organization, charges fees based on aircraft weight and distance flown through controlled airspace. Small propeller planes pay annual fees based on weight, while larger private planes and commercial aircraft pay fees that consider both weight and distance. Rates are set to recover the costs of providing services. NAV CANADA charges fees based on aircraft weight and distance flown through controlled airspace. Rates are applied to a formula to assess each flight's costs for air traffic services. For example, a Boeing 737 flying from Toronto to Winnipeg may incur charges totaling C$1,067.79. Operators of smaller jets have the option to pay a daily use charge that covers both en route and terminal services. NAV CANADA charges fees based on aircraft weight and distance flown through controlled airspace. Rates are applied to assess each flight's costs for air traffic services. For example, a business jet making a round trip from Toronto to Winnipeg could choose to pay a flat daily charge instead of fees based on weight and distance. Legislation such as the United States Air Traffic Service Corporation Act and the Next Generation Air Transportation System Financing Reform Act have sought to authorize user fees for air traffic control services. Transitioning to a user fee-funded structure for air traffic services could create uncertainty about funding for FAA's budget, including airport improvement grants. A potential solution is to retain the AATF and revise fee collection schedules to fund airport improvements and FAA functions. However, incorporating FAA funding into the user fee structure poses challenges. The GAO report suggested transitioning to a user fee-funded structure for air traffic services, based on input from countries that had already made the switch. The Aviation Innovation, Reform, and Reauthorization Act proposed creating an ATC Corporation to assess and charge fees for air traffic services, with fees needing approval from the corporate board of directors. The bill H.R. 4441 proposed fees for air navigation services in line with international standards, exempting certain aircraft types. It did not specify funding beyond FY2019, but authorized $1.7 billion annually for FAA Operations and Maintenance in FY2020-2022 to support safety programs. The proposed ATC Corporation under H.R. 4441 specified funding for Operations and Maintenance and Facilities and Equipment. Activities beyond FY2019 would be funded by user fees, potentially offsetting passenger and cargo taxes that currently fund the Airport and Airway Trust fund. The proposed ATC Corporation under H.R. 4441 could potentially use the Airway Trust fund as an offset to user fees for commercial operators. Funding stability for corporate air traffic entities is a key challenge, with modifications to the current aviation tax scheme being sought to continue airport grant funding. Government overseers have blocked proposed fee increases, particularly when economic factors causing revenue declines are seen as temporary. Restrictions on rate hikes can have destabilizing effects, as seen with NATS UK being limited in raising rates tied to the retail price index. Different countries have varied approaches to maintaining fiscal stability for air traffic service providers while controlling rates. NAV CANADA sets rates at reasonable levels and has a rate stabilization account to adjust for fluctuations in air traffic. New Zealand also addresses this issue. New Zealand has a unique approach to air traffic fee setting, giving Airways NZ more autonomy in rate regulation. They use excess revenues to stabilize rates, resulting in minimal increases post-2001. This method was praised by the International Air Transport Association in 2003. The 2016 GAO report suggests incorporating risk mitigation into financial structures to ensure fiscal resilience during traffic downturns. The GAO highlighted NAV CANADA's rate stabilization account as a way to offset revenue drops and maintain liquidity. Privatization could allow for issuing equity and bonds to fund technology upgrades. The ability to issue equity and bonds for funding technology upgrades and capital purchases was recommended by the National Commission to Ensure a Strong Competitive Airline Industry in 1993. The proposed USATS corporation would have had the authority to incur debt through various instruments, with a cap of $15 billion on total outstanding balance. Plans to incur debt would have required approval from the Secretary of Transportation. The proposal suggests that if Congress were to allow an independent air traffic control corporation to issue bonds, the tax status of those instruments would need to be considered. Publicly owned airports typically issue tax-favored municipal bonds to fund their capital needs, while privately owned companies and government entities do not have access to tax-exempt bonds. Debt issued by an air traffic control corporation owned by private investors or the government would be taxable to investors, resulting in higher interest rates compared to municipal bonds. The United States Air Traffic Service Corporation Act proposed exempting the USATS from state and local taxes, but was silent on federal taxes for holders of its debt. H.R. 4441 specified that any debt assumed by the ATC Corporation would not be backed by the federal government. The bill aimed to establish the ATC Corporation as a tax-exempt entity, but did not provide tax incentives for investors. The Revenue Code of 1986 did not offer tax-related incentives for investors holding the corporation's bonds, as the legislation did not provide any tax-preferred treatment to the debt issued by the proposed corporation. This lack of government backing or tax incentives could make the corporation's debt less attractive to investors, potentially leading to higher interest rates for repayment. The transition to an air traffic services corporation would not significantly impact the FAA workforce, as the majority of qualified air traffic controllers and technicians would still come from the FAA. The FAA workforce, consisting of roughly 35,000 positions tied to air traffic services, would need to be shifted to the new corporation. The new management would need to maintain pay and benefits for stability during the transition. Reform proposals might include aligning the workforce with organizational objectives through performance-driven compensation and incentives. Limited research exists on the experiences of other air traffic service providers transitioning to a corporate entity. During the transition to a corporate entity, air traffic service providers may face fiscal challenges. Start-up capital or funding stabilization mechanisms are crucial. Transition plans should include provisions for financing startup and transition costs to ensure fiscal stability. The United States Air Traffic Service Corporation Act would transfer unexpended appropriations for air traffic services. The 2016 GAO report highlighted the challenges of transitioning air traffic services to a separate ANSP, estimating a timeline of about three years for negotiation, planning, and implementation. H.R. 4441 (114th Congress) proposed a timeframe for the new corporation to take over air traffic services by FY2020. Good communication between stakeholders was emphasized to ease the transition. The bill proposed the transfer of air traffic services to a separate corporation by FY2020. It required FAA and the corporation to meet with labor representatives to resolve issues related to the transition. The Department of Transportation Office of Inspector General would provide quarterly reports on the progress of the transfer. Labor organizations representing FAA employees are prohibited from striking or disrupting operations. President Reagan invoked statutes in 1981 to handle work stoppages, such as revoking recognition of the Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization. Labor provisions under Title 29 U.S.C. allow for lawful strikes or lock-outs after meeting collective bargaining obligations. A special provision requires a 10-day notification before striking at health care facilities, but not for air traffic facilities. The United States Air Traffic Service Corporation Act (H.R. 1441, 104th Congress) aimed to address this issue. The United States Air Traffic Service Corporation Act (H.R. 1441, 104th Congress) proposed allowing corporation employees to form a union and bargain collectively, while prohibiting strikes, work stoppages, or slowdowns. The bill also included language on employee management, giving the CEO full authority over defining positions, hiring, and setting policies. This framework could potentially follow the Railway Labor Act, which restricts strikes to major disputes and allows courts to order strikers back to work if legal conditions are not met. The proposed corporation's CEO would have full authority over defining positions, hiring, and setting compensation for employees. The bill included provisions for negotiating with labor organizations and allowing employees to keep federal benefits. Newly hired employees would not have access to federal benefit programs. The bill would require the corporation to engage in collective bargaining with labor organizations chosen to represent employees. FAA currently oversees air traffic operations and safety for commercial airlines, which could serve as a model for overseeing air traffic services entities. The FAA oversees air traffic operations for commercial airlines and could serve as a model for safety oversight of air traffic services entities. A 2016 GAO survey highlighted the importance of delineating roles between the FAA and a separate ANSP in transitioning to a private or corporate model. Experts agree that aviation safety oversight should remain an FAA responsibility, but opinions differ on the role of a newly formed ANSP in defining navigational procedures. Most experts believe global harmonization efforts should involve both the safety regulator and a newly formed ANSP. GAO stressed the need to clearly define roles and responsibilities, with FAA orders needing to be codified for a separate ANSP. A transitional period would likely be necessary to establish roles, as seen in Canada's transition with Transport Canada and NAV CANADA agreeing not to make operational changes for the first two years. The proposed legislation H.R. 4441, 114th Congress, aimed to establish performance-based regulations and safety standards for air traffic services before transferring them from the FAA to a separate ATC Corporation. This corporation would have integrated airspace management and operational procedures under a safety management system subject to regulatory oversight. The delineation of roles and responsibilities would involve the ATC Corporation, airlines, and the military. The proposed legislation aimed to establish performance-based regulations and safety standards for air traffic services before transferring them to a separate ATC Corporation. Interested parties could submit proposals for changes to air traffic management procedures, airspace classifications, or other actions affecting airspace access. The Secretary of Transportation would review and consider these proposals within 45 days, with exemptions for temporary and emergency actions. Concerns over safety and profit conflicts have been raised regarding a corporate or private approach to air traffic management. The proposed legislation aimed to establish performance-based regulations and safety standards for air traffic services before transferring them to a separate ATC Corporation. Safety concerns have been raised regarding for-profit models in aviation, as air traffic services typically exist as monopolies, limiting customer choice based on safety records. Establishing the ANSP as a nonprofit organization, as NAV CANADA has done, may improve cooperation among operators and regulators and enhance safety culture. The air traffic services corporation that would have been chartered under H.R. 4441 would have been operated as a not-for-profit entity. The proposed air traffic services corporation under H.R. 4441 would have been operated as a not-for-profit entity, funded by user fees. Stakeholder representation on the corporate board is crucial for supporting safety initiatives. Financial liability concerns include potential tort claims and lawsuits over business practices. The corporation may face lawsuits over its business practices, such as preferential treatment at airports. The Federal Tort Claims Act covers FAA, limiting liability for the government but not private companies. The United States Air Traffic Service Corporation Act would have expanded liability under certain laws. The Service Corporation Act (H.R. 1441, 104th Congress) aimed to apply the Federal Tort Claims Act to the United States Air Traffic Services Corporation, allowing legal challenges to its air traffic control procedures. The corporation could be represented by the Department of Justice in court, but could also hire its own attorneys with the Attorney General's consent. The proposed legislation would have barred the use of the Judgment Fund for paying claims against the corporation, leaving it fully liable. In contrast, the Aviation Innovation, Reform, and Reauthorization Act of 2016 (H.R. 4441, 114th Congress) addressed ATC issues differently. The Reauthorization Act of 2016 (H.R. 4441, 114th Congress) specified that the proposed ATC Corporation could be sued and held liable under civil and criminal law, requiring adequate liability insurance. The Secretary of Transportation would determine the insurance coverage needed. Equitable treatment of all airspace users would be a key concern under a corporate air traffic services model. Legislation to corporatize or privatize air traffic services may include provisions to prevent discrimination in service delivery and ensure equitable representation on the corporate board. Safeguards are necessary to prevent favoritism towards certain airspace users, such as airlines, which could impact general aviation or new passenger carriers. Diversity on the board can help address concerns about access to airspace, airports, and air traffic services. Airports receiving federal funding must provide fair access to national airspace system users under specific grant assurances. Federal law mandates that airports be available for public use without discrimination, and air carriers must be charged comparably for airport use. This framework ensures equitable treatment for all airport users. Canadian legislation also prohibits price discrimination by requiring equal fees for all air carriers using NAV CANADA's services. H.R. 4441 (114 th Congress) ensures fair access to airspace for all air carriers, including recreational and private aircraft. User fees imposed by the corporation should not determine airspace access, and general aviation operators cannot be denied access for not paying fees. Coordination with military, law enforcement, and emergency management agencies may require access to air traffic service facilities and data. Coordination agreements between ANSP and government agencies may be necessary for airspace surveillance data sharing. The United States Air Traffic Service Corporation Act aimed to ensure government access to airspace surveillance data for law enforcement and homeland security purposes. It required the corporation to collaborate with military and law enforcement agencies, share aircraft tracking data for drug smuggling monitoring, and allowed the President to transfer functions to the Department of Defense during war or national emergency. During war, the President can transfer duties, powers, and employees of the ATC Corporation or FAA to the Department of Defense."
