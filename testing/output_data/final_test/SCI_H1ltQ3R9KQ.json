    "content": "In this study, the focus is on training intelligent agents to perform causal reasoning using modern deep reinforcement learning. The approach involves meta-learning where the agent learns to conduct experiments through causal interventions to make accurate causal inferences. The agent was able to make counterfactual predictions and draw causal inferences from observational data. The results suggest that powerful learning-based approaches can benefit causal reasoning in complex settings. Learning-based approaches can benefit causal reasoning in complex settings by providing agents with the ability to perform and interpret experiments. Causal reasoning is essential for answering questions about cause and effect, even in areas like image classification where lack of causal understanding can lead to failure modes. This ability is crucial for natural intelligence and is present in human babies. Reasoning is a key component of natural intelligence found in human babies, rats, and birds. There is a rich literature on formal approaches to causal reasoning. Meta-learning can produce procedures for learning and using causal structure, avoiding manual implementation of explicit causal reasoning methods. This approach offers scalability and automatic incorporation of complex prior knowledge. The algorithm learns causal reasoning by incorporating complex prior knowledge and finding internal representations of causal structure. It explores observational, interventional, and counterfactual settings to infer associations and estimate causal effects. In the interventional and counterfactual settings, the agent can estimate causal effects and answer counterfactual questions by learning about causal graphs and making interventions. Causal relationships are represented using causal directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) in a graphical model framework. Causal DAGs are graphical models that capture independence and causal relations. Nodes represent random variables, and edges show causal semantics. Directed paths indicate potential causes, with causal effects calculated along these paths. An example DAG shows the causal effect of exercise on cardiac health, highlighting the role of confounders like age. Causal DAGs are graphical models that capture independence and causal relations, with directed paths indicating potential causes. Observing cardiac health conditioning on exercise level cannot determine causality due to confounders like age. Cause-effect reasoning involves intervening on variables to compute conditional distributions. Counterfactual reasoning is used to answer predictive questions. Meta-learning involves learning aspects of the learning algorithm from data, such as optimizing parameters and metrics. It is different from cause-effect reasoning, which focuses on predicting outcomes based on causal relationships and confounders. The approach involves parameterizing the learning algorithm as a recurrent neural network (RNN) trained with model-free reinforcement learning (RL). The RNN is trained on a variety of problems to efficiently solve novel learning tasks. The outer loop of learning shapes the RNN weights into an inner loop algorithm, which continues learning even when the network weights are frozen. The inner loop algorithm can have different properties from the outer loop. In the experiments, the agent interacted with different causal DAGs in episodes consisting of information and quiz phases. The agent collected information in the first T-1 steps by interacting with or observing samples from the DAGs. The agent collected information by interacting with or observing samples from causal DAGs to infer connectivity and weights. The quiz phase required the agent to use causal knowledge to select the node with the highest value under a random external intervention. During the information phase, an intervention action caused a node's value to be set to 5 outside the usual range of observations, facilitating learning of the causal graph. The intervened graph's values were sampled similarly to the original graph, with severed incoming edges to the intervened node. During the quiz phase, a non-hidden node was intervened on externally by setting its value to -5, preventing the agent from memorizing previous interventions. The agent was penalized for choosing quiz actions during the information phase to encourage quiz phase participation. The default phase length was fixed at T = N = 5 to ensure optimal performance on the test phase. During the information phase, the agent had to actively choose nodes to set values on and infer the causal DAG. This setup was referred to as the \"active\" condition, while the \"passive\" condition controlled for the agent's information phase actions not being learned. The active agent actively chooses nodes during the information phase to infer the causal DAG. In comparison, the passive agent's intervention policy is fixed to an exhaustive sweep through all observable nodes, which is close to optimal in noise-free conditions. The inner loop of learning occurs within each episode as the agent learns from gathered evidence to perform well in the quiz phase on new DAGs. The agent uses a LSTM network with 96 hidden units to discover causal dependencies and perform causal inference in the quiz phase. Learning is done through asynchronous advantage actor-critic. The agent uses a LSTM network with 96 hidden units for causal inference in the quiz phase. Learning is done through asynchronous advantage actor-critic with a loss function consisting of policy gradient, baseline cost, and entropy cost terms. Optimization is done with RMSProp and experiments vary in observed v t properties. Performance is measured by reward earned in the quiz phase on held-out DAGs. The agent uses a LSTM network for causal reasoning in the quiz phase, earning rewards based on node selection. The average reward across 1200 episodes is calculated for each agent, with Experiment 1 focusing on causal reasoning without intervention capabilities. In an experiment testing six agents, including observational and conditional agents, causal inference was limited due to interventions on certain nodes. Observational agents received values from observable nodes, while conditional agents observed a world based on selected actions. The performance of agents was measured across different episode lengths. The conditional agent in the experiment observes a world based on selected actions, allowing for more diagnostic information about the relation between random variables in the graph. This agent still has access to only observational data but can observe samples where a node takes a value far outside the likely range of sampled observations. The Optimal Associative Baseline has full knowledge of the correlation structure of the environment and can do exact associative reasoning. The Observational MAP Baseline separates causal induction and causal inference by carrying out exact MAP inference over the space of DAGs in each episode. In an experiment focusing on associative and cause-effect reasoning, Observational Agents show improved performance with more observations. The Passive-Conditional Agent outperforms the Observational Agents by learning statistical dependencies between nodes. The Passive-Conditional Agent's performance surpasses the Optimal Associative Baseline, indicating perfect associative inference. It outperforms when the intervened node has no parents, showing an advantage in cause-effect reasoning. In Experiment 2, the agent performs cause-effect reasoning when the intervened node has parents, showing some form of do-calculus learning. The Active-Conditional Agent's performance is close to the Passive-Conditional Agent, indicating reasonable decision-making when allowed to choose actions. In Experiment 2, interventions on observable nodes allow cause-effect reasoning, enabling the testing of new agents like \"Active Interventional\" and \"Passive Interventional\". The Passive-Interventional Agent's choices align with maximizing correct node values, demonstrating causal inference capabilities. In Experiment 2, interventions on observable nodes enable cause-effect reasoning. The Passive-Interventional Agent's performance is comparable to the Optimal Cause-Effect Baseline, showing its ability to make causal inferences. The Passive-Interventional Agent's performance is significantly better than the Passive-Conditional Agent in cause-effect reasoning, especially in cases with unobserved confounders. This highlights the importance of having access to interventional data for improved performance. The ability of an agent to access interventional data allows for better cause-effect reasoning, especially in the presence of confounders. This is demonstrated by the performance difference between Passive-Conditional and Passive-Interventional agents. Active-Interventional Agent's performance is close to optimal, indicating good decision-making when allowed to choose actions. In Experiment 3, the agent answered counterfactual questions after making interventions, showcasing its ability in this domain. The conditional distribution p(X i |pa(X i ))=N ( j w ji X j ,0.1) is described in Section 3, where X i = j w ji X j + N (0.0,0.1). Observing the nodes in FIG0, the Passive-Interventional Agent's choice maximizes on node values, while the Passive-Counterfactual agent's choice is consistent with maximizing. The Passive-Counterfactual agent's choice is consistent with maximizing on node values in a DAG. Two new agents, \"Active Counterfactual\" and \"Passive Counterfactual\", are tested to answer counterfactual questions about node values. The Passive-Counterfactual agent stores exogenous noise and uses it in the quiz phase to maximize rewards. The Passive-Counterfactual agent achieves higher reward by using exogenous noise to maximize rewards in the quiz phase, demonstrating the ability to do counterfactual reasoning. The Passive-Counterfactual Agent achieves higher rewards by using exogenous noise for counterfactual reasoning in the quiz phase. Splitting the test set based on noise presence reveals significant differences in rewards for degenerate nodes. The Passive-Counterfactual Agent outperforms the Passive-Interventional Agent in cases with degenerate maximum values. The Active-Counterfactual Agent's performance is close to the Passive-Counterfactual agent, showing good decision-making abilities. A framework for learning causal reasoning using deep meta-RL was introduced and tested across different data settings without explicit causal inference principles. The agent learned implicit strategies for causal reasoning through task optimization, including drawing inferences from passive observation, active intervention, and making counterfactual predictions. Results from experiments show improved performance in cases where do-calculus made distinguishable predictions based on causal structure. The agent learns to resolve unobserved confounders using interventions, outperforming observational data. Performance is better when the intervened node shares a confounder with other variables. The agent's performance matches a MAP estimate of causal structure, indicating optimal causal inference. Additionally, the agent learns to use counterfactuals, showing improved performance with access to specific randomness in the test phase. The study demonstrates that causal reasoning can emerge from model-free reinforcement learning, allowing for powerful methods in causal inference in complex scenarios. Traditional approaches separate causal induction and inference, but this work shows that learning-based methods can handle both effectively. Our meta-RL approach enables agents to learn causal structure and interact with the environment for active learning. The study shows promise in agents conducting experiments for rich causal reasoning in complex domains, paving the way for future exploration in optimal experiment design. The study focuses on scaling up the approach to larger environments with more complex causal structures and diverse tasks. Advanced architectures like BID16 and BID17 could enhance the approach by allowing longer, more complex episodes and leveraging symmetries in the environment. Performance comparison is made with two standard model-free RL baselines, Q-total and Q-episode agents. The study compares the performance of Q-total and Q-episode agents in a distribution over Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). An agent with memory, such as an RNN-based agent, is trained on this distribution, sampling a task from D in each episode. The agent observes o_t, executes a_t, and receives reward r_t, with a_t\u22121 and r_t\u22121 as additional inputs to the network. The Q-episode agent avoids choosing the arm indicated by m_t as an external intervention, resulting in an average reward of 0. The \"abduction-action-prediction\" method in BID30 addresses counterfactual queries by estimating unobserved makeup and transferring it to a counterfactual world. It involves a model with known causal effects and Gaussian noise terms. Counterfactual questions can be answered by adjusting variables like exercise levels. The experiment investigates causal DAGs with quadratic dependence on parents, demonstrating that causal induction and inference can be learned and implemented via a meta-learned agent. The results are generalized to nonlinear, non-Gaussian causal graphs typical of real-world scenarios. The experiment shows that the Long-Observational agent outperforms the Observational agent, indicating learning of statistical dependencies. The Active-Interventional agent performs close to the MAP baseline, suggesting optimal action selection. Test graphs were randomly selected, with training examples not overlapping with the test set. In new experiments, entire equivalence classes of test graphs were held out from the training set to prevent overfitting. Performance on the test set indicates generalization of learned inference procedures to unseen equivalence classes of causal DAGs. The agents showed good generalization to held out examples, with rewards ordered as Observational agent < Passive-Conditional agent < Passive-Interventional agent < Passive-Counterfactual agent. The Active-Interventional agent performs similarly to the Passive-Interventional agent and outperforms the Random-Interventional agent. Graphical models combine graph and probability theory to represent statistical dependence. D-separation is a method for assessing statistical independence in belief networks using directed acyclic graphs. A graph is a collection of nodes and links connecting pairs of nodes, which may be directed or undirected. A path from node X i to node X j is a sequence of linked nodes. Conditional distribution p(X 1:N\\j |Xj =5) was challenging to calculate for the quadratic case. A directed acyclic graph (DAG) has no directed paths starting and ending at the same node. The addition of a link from X 4 to X 1 creates a cyclic graph. The directed graph in FIG1 is acyclic, but adding a link from X 4 to X 1 creates a cyclic graph. Nodes in the graph can be parents or children of each other, and a node can be a collider on one path but not on another. An ancestor node has a directed path to a descendant node. A graphical model represents random variables with links showing statistical relationships. A belief network is a directed acyclic graphical model with nodes associated with conditional distributions. The joint distribution of nodes in a graph is determined by the product of conditional distributions. Statistical independence between random variables X and Y given Z is based on closed paths in the graph. A path is closed if certain conditions are met regarding non-colliders or colliders in the path."
