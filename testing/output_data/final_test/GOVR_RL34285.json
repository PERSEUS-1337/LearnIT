    "content": "Section 612 of the Communications Act of 1934 requires cable operators to lease a percentage of their channel capacity to unaffiliated persons, limits their editorial control over leased channels, allows the FCC to set rates and resolve disputes, and outlines procedures for challenging a cable operator's refusal to provide channel capacity. Subsection (g) of Section 612 allows the FCC to establish additional rules when cable systems with 36 or more channels reach 70% of U.S. households and 70% of households passed by these systems subscribe to the service. The FCC has determined that the first part of the \"70/70\" test has been met. The FCC has found that the second prong of the 70/70 test has been met based on data from Warren Communications News. The cable industry is required to provide more information on the number of homes passed by their systems and actual subscribers. This data will help the FCC accurately measure the percentage of households subscribing to cable services. The FCC is using data to determine if the 70/70 test has been met, which would give them authority to create new rules for information sources. There is debate over the extent of authority granted by Section 612(g), with a bill introduced to repeal it. H.R. 4307 aims to repeal Subsection 612(g) of the 1984 Cable Communications Policy Act, which limited the FCC's authority to regulate cable operators' rates and access terms. The House Report suggests that Subsection 612(g) was intended to grant the FCC power to create rules if the 70/70 test was met. The FCC may need different requirements for leased access to ensure diversity and flexibility as the cable industry grows. When cable systems reach 70% of households, the FCC can create additional rules to promote a wide variety of information sources on leased access channels. The FCC has the authority to regulate leased access for cable operators and unaffiliated programmers, including establishing rates, terms, and dispute resolution procedures. The 1992 Cable Television Consumer Protection Act granted the FCC more power to set maximum rates, terms, and resolve disputes concerning leased access. Congress did not repeal these powers granted to the FCC. The 1992 Cable Act revisions granted the FCC authority over leased access, including setting rates and resolving disputes. However, the scope of the FCC's authority under Section 612(g) remains unclear, with some arguing for broad rulemaking powers to encourage information diversity. The legislative history and context of 612(g) suggest a more limited interpretation, but courts generally rely on the plain language of statutes when interpreting them. Proponents argue that the FCC has broad authority under 612(g) to promulgate any rule promoting information source diversity, citing the expansive meaning of the word \"any.\" They believe this interpretation aligns with the purpose of Section 612 to promote competition and diverse video programming sources. Some argue that the broad language of Subsection 612(g) grants the FCC extensive regulatory powers beyond promoting leased access of channels to unaffiliated persons. Others believe that 612(g) only allows regulations related to leased access, not broad regulatory authority. The context and legislative history suggest that Congress intended 612(g) to apply solely to leased access. Proponents argue that Subsection 612(g) should be narrowly interpreted to govern only leased access to cable channel capacity by unaffiliated persons. They believe that Congress did not intend for 612(g) to grant the FCC broad regulatory authority and that it is a small provision within a specific section of the statute. The Supreme Court's principle of not hiding elephants in mouseholes is cited to support this view. Proponents argue that Section 612(g) should be narrowly interpreted to regulate only leased access to cable channel capacity by unaffiliated individuals. They believe that Congress did not intend for this provision to grant the FCC broad regulatory authority, citing the principle of not hiding elephants in mouseholes. Commenters supporting this view argue that the FCC's authority is limited by Section 624(f) of the Telecommunications Act, which restricts requirements on cable services unless expressly provided in Title VI. They contend that the legislative history and placement of 612(g) indicate that Congress only granted the FCC authority to regulate leased access, not broader cable services. If a court adopts this interpretation, the FCC would only have the power to regulate leased access more strictly. The FCC's power under Section 612(g) is limited to regulating leased access to cable services by unaffiliated persons. Judicial review would involve determining if the court must defer to the agency's interpretation of its authority. A federal court would analyze whether Congress has directly addressed the agency's authority under the statute. Ambiguity in statutory language must be considered in interpreting Congress's intent. When an agency's interpretation of its authority is in question, a reviewing court will consider the statutory context to determine the scope of power delegated by Congress. Justice Scalia emphasized that statutory construction is a holistic endeavor, where ambiguity in meaning can be clarified by looking at the entire statutory scheme. A court reviewing Congress's delegated authority under Subsection 612(g) would likely consider the broad language of the subsection within the context of the entire statute, which focuses on leased access to cable systems. This analysis would involve ensuring a diversity of information sources once the statutory test is met, while also considering other access avenues provided by Congress, such as must-carry provisions for local television channels. The court would likely adopt a narrow interpretation of Subsection 612(g) in the 1984 Cable Act, considering the provision's focus on leased access to cable systems and the need for diverse information sources. This interpretation would align with Congress's intent to ease regulatory burdens on the cable industry and avoid broad regulatory authority that could contradict the statute's deregulatory purpose. A narrow reading of Subsection 612(g) in the 1984 Cable Act aligns with the statute's theme of avoiding unnecessary regulation and focuses on leased access to cable systems."
