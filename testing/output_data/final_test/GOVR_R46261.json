    "content": "In vitro diagnostic devices, defined by the FDA, are used for diagnosing diseases and conditions. They can include reagents, instruments, and systems for specimen examination. IVDs may consist of commercial test kits or laboratory developed tests, utilizing general purpose reagents and analyte specific reagents. Laboratory-developed tests (LDTs) are a type of in vitro diagnostic device designed, manufactured, and used within a single laboratory. They are often used for rapidly changing conditions or diseases and are commonly genetic tests analyzing genetic material. Oversight of IVDs focuses on safety, effectiveness, accuracy, reliability, quality of clinical laboratories, utility of information in decision-making, and truthfulness of claims. The FDA regulates in vitro diagnostic devices (IVDs) based on their risk classification, which is determined by the potential harm they pose to patients. IVDs can have three classes: Class I (low risk), Class II (moderate risk), and Class III (high risk). COVID-19 diagnostics are crucial as a false negative result can impact not only the individual but also the community. Regulatory controls for IVDs depend on their risk classification. The FDA has clear regulatory authority over laboratory-developed tests (LDTs) as with all in vitro diagnostic devices (IVDs) that meet the definition of medical devices. However, the FDA has traditionally not enforced regulatory requirements on LDTs, focusing instead on commercial IVD kits. The FDA has regulatory authority over laboratory-developed tests (LDTs) and in vitro diagnostic devices (IVDs). Despite the absence of specific agency guidance on LDT regulation, the FDA has started asserting authority over some higher-risk direct-to-consumer genetic tests. CLIA of 1988 gives CMS the power to regulate clinical laboratories, setting quality standards and certification programs for labs using IVD devices. All labs conducting diagnostic testing on human specimens for health reasons are regulated under CLIA based on testing complexity levels. The FDA categorizes laboratory tests into low, moderate, and high complexity levels. CLIA requirements assess a test's analytical validity. Moderate and high complexity labs must meet specific standards for certification. All LDTs, including genetic tests, are considered high complexity tests under CLIA. COVID-19 diagnostics are also classified as high complexity tests. In emergency situations, the HHS Secretary may authorize the use of unapproved medical tests. During emergencies, the HHS Secretary can approve unapproved medical products for specific uses. This allows expedited access to new medical products. For COVID-19, the HHS Secretary authorized emergency use of diagnostic tests, leading to FDA issuing Emergency Use Authorizations for CDC and New York state-developed tests. These are the only EUAs for coronavirus diagnostics issued by the FDA so far. During emergencies, FDA requires approval for laboratory-developed tests for relevant pathogens like SARS-CoV-2. LDTs must be authorized under an EUA during emergencies, following FFDCA Section 564. The EUA process expedites access to medical products, even though premarket approval for LDTs is typically waived. During emergencies, FDA requires EUA approval for laboratory-developed tests for pathogens like SARS-CoV-2. The EUA process expedites access to medical products, including LDTs, which typically do not require premarket approval. The FDA declined to exercise enforcement discretion for LDTs detecting SARC-CoV-2 and diagnosing COVID-19, requiring them to receive an EUA. However, certain labs were allowed to use COVID-19 LDTs clinically before EUA approval after validation and notification to the FDA. The CDC developed a complex molecular diagnostic test for COVID-19 called the 2019-Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel. The diagnostic test for COVID-19 relies on Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) to amplify the RNA of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Primers and probes are used to target specific regions of the viral genome for amplification and detection. The CDC's original test used three sets of primers and probes to target specific regions of the viral genome. The CDC's test for COVID-19 includes primers and probes to target specific regions of the SARS-CoV-2 viral genome. It also has control samples to ensure proper functioning. The test received EUA from the FDA on February 4, 2020, allowing authorized laboratories to use it despite not being FDA-approved. The CDC's COVID-19 test received EUA from the FDA on February 4, 2020, allowing authorized laboratories to use it despite not being FDA-approved. Testing is limited to qualified laboratories certified under CLIA to perform high complexity tests. Public health laboratories must verify the test themselves and send presumptive positive cases back to the CDC for confirmatory testing. The Trump Administration aimed to make approximately 1 million tests available soon by leveraging CDC test kit manufacturing. The CDC test kit for COVID-19, manufactured by Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT), will be widely available soon. IDT will distribute the test kits to hospitals and labs across the country by the end of the week of March 2. These IDT-manufactured test kits are covered by the CDC's EUA authorization. Labs using these kits do not need their own EUA. LabCorp, a large commercial laboratory, can perform the CDC test under the EUA for COVID-19 testing demand. IDT is manufacturing test kits with a capacity of 500 reactions. The CDC's test kit had a faulty reagent for detecting SARS-like coronaviruses, but a new protocol allows the test to be run with only the other two diagnostic reagents. The CDC modified its test by excluding a faulty reagent, which did not affect its accuracy. Despite this, some labs still faced issues, prompting the New York State Department of Health to request FDA approval for its own test. The CDC is manufacturing new test kits with only the two reagents specific to SARS-CoV-2, resolving previous manufacturing issues. These kits are expected to increase testing capacity for up to 75,000 patients in public health laboratories. The CDC's decision to develop its own COVID-19 diagnostic test instead of using the WHO-approved test caused delays in the US response to the virus. Questions were raised about the necessity of a third reagent in the CDC test and its impact on detecting community spread. On February 29, 2020, FDA announced a new policy to utilize LDTs from high-complexity laboratories to expand COVID-19 testing capacity. Laboratories can use their own validated tests while awaiting FDA review for EUA submission. The guidance recommends confirming test results against an EUA-authorized diagnostic. FDA supports the use of these tests for clinical testing during the EUA pursuit. LabCorp and Quest are offering their own LDTs for COVID-19 testing while pursuing EUA with the FDA. The tests take 3-4 days for results and require a healthcare provider's authorization. Quest will start testing for coronavirus with its own LDT on March 9, 2020, and plans to seek EUA from the FDA within 15 days."
