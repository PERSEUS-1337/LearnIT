During the Cold War, workers at nuclear weapons facilities were exposed to radiation without their knowledge or consent, leading to health issues. During the Cold War, workers at nuclear weapons facilities were exposed to radiation without adequate monitoring or protection, leading to potential harm. Congress designated certain workers as members of the Special Exposure Cohort under the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act of 2000. The State of New York made a significant contribution to the security of the United States during the Cold War. Research by various organizations indicates that workers at former atomic weapons employer facilities and Department of Energy facilities in New York were not adequately monitored for radiation exposure. Thirty-six facilities in New York produced radioactive materials, conducted classified research, operated nuclear reactors, and processed high-level nuclear waste, with fourteen located in the western region of the state. No personal radiation dosimetry monitoring records are available from the Bethlehem Steel site in Lackawanna, New York, which is classified as an atomic weapons employer facility. Section 3626(b) of the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act of 2000 authorizes the President to act upon recommendations regarding radiation exposure monitoring. The President can designate additional classes of employees in the Special Exposure Cohort if accurate radiation dose estimation is not feasible and there is a likelihood of health endangerment. The Secretary of Health and Human Services established procedures for this in 2004. Legislation is needed to provide parameters for evaluating petitions for inclusion in the Special Exposure Cohort. The President can designate additional classes of employees in the Special Exposure Cohort based on limited or nonexistent individual radiation exposure monitoring or absence of records. SEC. 3. Addition of classes of former nuclear weapons program workers to the Special Exposure Cohort under Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program. Section 3626(b) of the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act of 2000 is amended to include a provision for employees with potential exposure to occupational ionizing radiation from production or processing materials related to atomic weapons. Employees with potential exposure to occupational ionizing radiation from production or processing materials related to atomic weapons may be subject to monitoring under a formal health physics program. Less than 50 percent of employees in this category were regularly monitored for internal and external radiation exposure during the period of potential exposure. Records for radiation exposure at the facility are missing or unreliable for a significant portion of employees, making it difficult to determine individual radiation doses. The Institute for Occupational Safety and Health has determined that employees at the facility met specific criteria during the residual contamination period as described in the Ronald W. Reagan National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2005. SEC. 4. REGULATIONS. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will issue regulations to designate additional classes of employees as members of the Special Exposure Cohort under the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act. They will also determine if workers at the Bethlehem Steel site in Lackawanna, New York, meet the requirements for membership in the Special Exposure Cohort. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will submit a report to Congress identifying Department of Energy and atomic weapons employer facilities where employees meet Special Exposure Cohort requirements. The report will include the number of classes and employees in each class."
