    "content": "The Davis-Bacon Act of 1931 requires employers to pay prevailing wages and fringe benefits on federal contracts over $2,000 for construction, alteration, or repair of public buildings. This ensures contractors pay wages consistent with local labor markets. Davis-Bacon wages also apply to federal construction projects funded through grants, loans, or loan guarantees in areas like transportation, housing, and water pollution control. Contractors must provide weekly payroll statements to comply with the act. The Davis-Bacon Act requires contractors on federal construction projects to pay prevailing wages and fringe benefits. The Act covers various types of construction and contractors must provide weekly payroll statements to the contracting agency. The Clean Water Act, enacted in 1948, aimed to improve water quality in the US and has been amended over the years to achieve different goals. The Clean Water Act (CWA) created the Construction Grants Program to fund wastewater treatment plants for local governments. Amendments expanded the program to meet performance goals and required contractors to pay prevailing wages. In 1987, the CWA was amended to establish the State Water Pollution Control Revolving Fund Program, replacing the Construction Grants Program with a loan program for states. The State Water Pollution Control Revolving Fund Program, established in 1987 under the Clean Water Act, requires states to match 20% of capitalization grants received. States then provide financial assistance to local governments for wastewater treatment facilities. The program operates on a revolving basis, with states loaning money to local governments and reinvesting repayments. Federal grants were expected to end in FY1994, but Congress has continued to appropriate funds for capitalization. The Clean Water Act authorizes funds for State Revolving Funds (SRFs) for wastewater treatment facilities. Questions arose after FY1994 regarding Davis-Bacon prevailing wage requirements for SRF-funded projects. EPA and the Building and Construction Trades Department disagreed on the interpretation. In 2000, a settlement agreement was proposed to ensure prevailing wages for SRF-funded projects. The EPA and the Building and Construction Trades Department reached an agreement in 2000 to enforce prevailing wage requirements for projects funded through the State Revolving Funds program. However, EPA later decided not to implement the agreement due to a belief that certain sections of the Clean Water Act conflicted with each other. The EPA and the Building and Construction Trades Department reached an agreement in 2000 to enforce prevailing wage requirements for projects funded through the State Revolving Funds program. However, EPA later decided not to implement the agreement due to a belief that certain sections of the Clean Water Act conflicted with each other. CWA was precluded by Section 602(b)(6), which addresses projects \"constructed in whole or in part before fiscal year 1995.\" EPA delayed implementation of the settlement agreement until October 1, 2001, but it does not appear that the agreement was ever implemented. Congress approved the Safe Drinking Water Act in 1974 to protect public drinking water supplies, and in 1996, Congress amended the SDWA to create a state revolving loan program similar to the CWA's program. The Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) established a revolving loan program to help public water systems comply with federal regulations. Funding for the program expired in FY2003, but Congress has continued to provide capitalization grants annually. The SDWA includes a Davis-Bacon provision, and in 2004, there were discussions about amending the Act to require prevailing wages for projects funded through the program. The Safe Drinking Water Act established a revolving loan program to assist public water systems in complying with federal regulations. Legislation has been enacted to require Davis-Bacon prevailing wages on projects receiving financial assistance from the program. This requirement applies to projects funded by both the Clean Water Act and Safe Drinking Water Act. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2012 (P.L. 112-74) provided capitalization grants to the Clean Water SRFs and Safe Drinking Water SRFs for FY2012, applying Davis-Bacon prevailing wages to projects funded under both programs. The act mandates compliance with specific sections of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act and the Safe Drinking Water Act for construction projects funded by the revolving loan programs. The Department of the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2010 (P.L. 111-88) mandated prevailing wages for construction projects funded by Clean Water SRFs and Safe Drinking Water SRFs in FY2010. The act also required compliance with specific sections of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act and the Safe Drinking Water Act for projects funded by State water pollution control revolving funds. For fiscal year 2010, prevailing wages were mandated for construction projects funded by Clean Water SRFs and Safe Drinking Water SRFs. EPA provided guidance on FY2010 appropriations and Davis-Bacon coverage extending to any assistance agreement funded with FY2010 appropriations. For FY2010, prevailing wages were required for construction projects funded by Clean Water SRFs and Safe Drinking Water SRFs. EPA mandated Davis-Bacon Act requirements for all assistance agreements executed between October 30, 2009, and October 1, 2010, regardless of the funding source. Prior to October 1, 2010, Davis-Bacon Act requirements apply to projects financed by SRF assistance agreements, regardless of funding source. Prevailing wages are mandated for projects with SRF assistance, as stated in P.L. 111-88. The Davis-Bacon Act requirements apply to projects funded with assistance from the State Revolving Funds (SRFs), including those funded by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA). Concerns were raised about the impact of imposing prevailing wage and reporting requirements on all projects receiving SRF assistance in FY2010, potentially affecting project costs, estimates, contracts, and causing delays. In response to concerns about imposing prevailing wage requirements on projects funded by the Federal Government, Congress extended Davis-Bacon requirements to all construction projects funded by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA). Legislation in the 111th Congress also proposed extending Davis-Bacon prevailing wage requirements to State Revolving Fund loan programs. In the 111th Congress, legislation extended Davis-Bacon prevailing wage requirements to projects financed by State Revolving Fund loan programs. This included loans made using repayments and projects financed through a Safe Drinking Water Act revolving loan fund."
