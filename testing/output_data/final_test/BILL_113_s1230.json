    "content": "The \"Alternative Fueled Vehicles Competitiveness and Energy Security Act of 2013\" includes provisions for loan guarantees, manufacturing incentives, workforce training, and reducing engine idling. It also addresses electric, hydrogen, and natural gas utility participation, federal fleets, and HOV lane access extension. Definitions are provided in the Act. The Act defines key terms such as alternative fuel, alternative fueled vehicle, community college, Department of Energy, and nonroad vehicle. The term \"nonroad vehicle\" includes vehicles used for industrial, farming, commercial, rail transportation, airport, or marine purposes. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Energy. SEC. 3 amends the Energy Policy Act of 2005 to include loan guarantees for alternative fuel infrastructure. SEC. 4 establishes an incentive program for advanced technology vehicles manufacturing. Section 136 of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 is amended to redefine what constitutes an ultra efficient vehicle or light duty vehicle. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 is amended to redefine ultra efficient vehicles, including medium-duty or heavy-duty work trucks, buses, or rail transit vehicles that reduce fuel consumption by 25% compared to existing technologies. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 is amended to redefine ultra efficient vehicles, including medium-duty or heavy-duty work trucks, buses, or rail transit vehicles that reduce fuel consumption by 25% compared to existing technologies. The Secretary may determine alternative percentage goals for vehicle types if the original percentage is unachievable and substantial fuel consumption reductions can still be achieved. Amendments are made to equipment suppliers and manufacturing process equipment regulations. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 is amended to redefine ultra efficient vehicles, including medium-duty or heavy-duty work trucks, buses, or rail transit vehicles that reduce fuel consumption by 25% compared to existing technologies. The term 'qualifying components' is redefined to include components, systems, or groups of subsystems designed to improve fuel economy or contribute to the overall improved fuel use of an advanced technology vehicle. Amendments are made to regulations regarding equipment suppliers and manufacturing processes. In subsection (h), the term \"Automobile\" is changed to \"Advanced Technology Vehicle\" and \"automobiles\" is replaced with \"advanced technology vehicles\" in paragraph (1)(B). In subsection (i), \"2012\" is replaced with \"2018\". SEC. 5. Conventional fuel replacement calculation and assessment. The Secretary will develop a methodology for calculating the equivalent volumes of conventional fuel displaced by alternative fuels. A national assessment will be conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of alternative fuels and vehicles in reducing oil imports, including market penetration and deployment barriers. The Secretary will assess successes, barriers, and deployment goals for alternative fuels and vehicles by 2020 and 2030, reporting the results to Congress. Technical assistance and coordination will be provided as outlined in Section 6. The Secretary will provide technical assistance to State, local, and tribal governments or public-private partnerships for deploying alternative fuel and vehicles. This assistance may include electric or natural gas utilities, vehicle manufacturers, and other entities. The Secretary will provide technical assistance to State, local, and tribal governments, public-private partnerships, and other non-Federal entities for deploying alternative fuel and vehicles. Assistance may include coordination for selecting recharging/refueling equipment, identifying transportation corridors, and developing communication protocols. The Secretary will provide technical assistance for deploying alternative fuel and vehicles, including development of protocols, codes, standards, education, outreach, and utility rate design. Cost sharing for assistance awarded will be consistent with the Energy Policy Act of 2005. Authorization of $50,000,000 for fiscal years 2014-2018 to implement section 988 of the Energy Policy Act of 2005. SEC. 7. WORKFORCE TRAINING. The Secretary, with consultation from the Secretary of Labor, will award grants to institutions for vocational workforce development programs focusing on alternative fueled vehicles and infrastructure. The training aims to equip the workforce with skills for manufacturing, installing, and maintaining alternative fuel infrastructure and vehicles, including training for electricians, plumbers, and other trades. Training will be provided for electricians, plumbers, pipefitters, contractors, building code inspection officials, vehicle dealers, mechanics, and other necessary positions to support the deployment of alternative fuels and vehicles. $50,000,000 is authorized for each fiscal year from 2014 to 2018 for this purpose. SEC. 8. REDUCTION OF ENGINE IDLING AND CONVENTIONAL FUEL CONSUMPTION. The definition of Idle Reduction Technology under the Energy Policy Act of 2005 is amended to include systems that reduce idling and use alternative fuels. Funding provisions are also updated. The definition of Idle Reduction Technology under the Energy Policy Act of 2005 is amended to include systems that reduce idling and use alternative fuels. Funding provisions are also updated by replacing \"fiscal year 2008\" with \"each of fiscal years 2008 through 2018\". SEC. 9. Electric, hydrogen, and natural gas utility and oil pipeline participation. The Secretary will identify barriers and solutions in electric, natural gas, and oil pipeline systems for distributing alternative fuels and establishing recharging/refueling capabilities. This includes regulatory rate design, grid load management for electric vehicles, integration with smart grid technology, and addressing transshipment barriers. The Secretary will identify barriers to transshipment of biofuels by oil pipelines and distribution of hydrogen, as well as barriers to installing alternative fuel recharging infrastructure. Consultation will be done with various entities, and a report on actions taken will be submitted to Congress within 2 years of the Act's enactment. SEC. 10. FEDERAL FLEETS. The Secretary will establish an interagency council for alternative fueled vehicles procurement by Federal agencies. Electricity and natural gas for these vehicles will be considered alternative fuels and reported under fleet management requirements. A report on this initiative is due within 180 days of the Act's enactment. The Secretary will establish an interagency council for alternative fueled vehicles procurement by Federal agencies, including electricity and natural gas as alternative fuels. A report on this initiative is due within 180 days of the Act's enactment. Additionally, an assessment of Federal Government fleets will be completed, detailing the types of vehicles suitable for alternative fuel use and the quantity of alternative fueled vehicles that could be deployed in 5 and 10 years. The estimated cost and benefits to the Federal Government for vehicle purchases or conversions described in this subsection will be assessed. SEC. 11. HOV Lane Access Extension amends Section 166(b)(5) of title 23, United States Code by removing the deadline for states to provide HOV lane access."
