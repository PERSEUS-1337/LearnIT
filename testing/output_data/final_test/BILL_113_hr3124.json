The Social Security Act is amended to replace \"adoption\" with \"permanency\" in various sections, including subsections (a) and (b). Subsection (c) outlines compliance requirements for states regarding data submission to the Secretary. The Secretary shall determine exits to reunification, adoption, and guardianship in a State based on data meeting system requirements, reported by the State and approved by August 1 of the succeeding fiscal year. Each State receiving payment under this section shall provide annual reports to the Secretary starting 24 months after the effective date. The State receiving payment must submit annual reports on the amount of payment for exits to reunification, adoption, and guardianship, along with how the payment was used to enhance post-permanency services. The permanency incentive payment for a fiscal year is calculated based on specific criteria. The State must report on the number of exits to adoption, guardianship, and reunification that exceed projected numbers for the fiscal year. The State must report on exits to adoption, guardianship, and reunification exceeding projected numbers for the fiscal year, with specific calculations for each category. The State must report on exits to adoption, guardianship, and reunification exceeding projected numbers for the fiscal year, with specific calculations for each category. The number of exits to reunification of older children in the State during the fiscal year exceeds the number of exits to reunification of older children in the State for the base fiscal year. $6,000 is multiplied by the sum of the excess exits to adoption of pre-adolescent children and exits to guardianship of pre-adolescent children in the State during the fiscal year compared to the base fiscal year. The State must report on exits to adoption, guardianship, and reunification exceeding projected numbers for the fiscal year. $4,000 is multiplied by the excess exits to special needs adoptions of young children in the State during the fiscal year compared to the base fiscal year. The State must report on exits to adoption, guardianship, and reunification exceeding projected numbers for the fiscal year. If insufficient funds are available, a pro rata adjustment will be made to the permanency incentive payments for special needs adoptions of young children in the State. In subsection (f), post-permanency services are required to ensure children stay with their families after reunification, adoption, or guardianship.

The 'reunification placement rate' is the total number of exits to reunification in a State during a fiscal year divided by the number of children in foster care. Post-permanency services refer to the support needed for children and families after reunification, adoption, or guardianship, including financial assistance, case management, counseling, community connections, respite care, and staff training. The term 'pre-adolescent children' refers to those aged 9 to 14.

The term 'projected number of exits to reunification' refers to the estimated number of foster children who will be reunified with their families in a fiscal year based on reunification placement rates. The term 'reunification' means a foster child exiting to a relative they lived with before foster care or another relative. 'Special needs adoption' is the final adoption of a child with special needs or under an adoption assistance agreement. 'Young children' are those under 9 years old.
