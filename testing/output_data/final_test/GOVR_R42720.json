    "content": "The executive branch controls agency rulemaking through Executive Order 12866, requiring agencies to submit rules to OIRA for review. This centralized review does not apply to independent regulatory commissions. Federal agencies create rules to implement statutes enacted by Congress, with rules holding the force of law. Congress grants agencies the power to promulgate rules through statutes like the APA, which dictates the rulemaking process. The Administrative Procedure Act (APA) dictates procedures for agencies to establish legally binding rules. The APA outlines formal and informal rulemaking procedures, with most agencies following the informal \"notice and comment\" process. Agencies must publish a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) in the Federal Register under informal rulemaking procedures. The Administrative Procedure Act (APA) requires agencies to provide notice of proposed rulemaking in the Federal Register, allowing for public comment for at least 30 days. After reviewing comments, the agency can issue a final rule with a concise statement of its basis and purpose. The final rule takes effect at least 30 days after publication, with exceptions. The APA mandates agencies to publish proposed rules in the Federal Register for public comment. Various statutes like NEPA, RFA, CRA, and PRA impose additional procedures on agencies. Executive orders and guidance from the President also dictate rulemaking processes. Presidential administrations have sought to control agencies through centralized review processes. President Clinton replaced Reagan's Order 12291 with E.O. 12866, maintaining centralized review for \"significant regulatory actions.\" This order exempted statutorily designated IRCs from the review process. These IRCs, known as independent regulatory agencies, are insulated from presidential control. The IRCs identified in the PRA have traits that insulate them from direct presidential control, including \"for cause\" removal protection, structural designs, and bypass of OMB oversight. These characteristics provide independence from presidential direction, unlike officers who serve at the pleasure of the President. Congress has established commissions with multiple members to further enhance insulation from presidential control. The IRCs identified in the PRA have traits that insulate them from direct presidential control, including \"for cause\" removal protection, structural designs, and bypass of OMB oversight. These characteristics provide independence from presidential direction, unlike officers who serve at the pleasure of the President. Congress has established commissions with multiple members serving set terms expiring at staggered intervals, aiming to create a collegial body insulated from political pressure. OMB acts as a coordination center for agency activities, reviewing legislative proposals, overseeing rulemaking, and approving budget requests to ensure consistency with the President's agenda. The IRCs identified in the PRA have traits that insulate them from direct presidential control, including \"for cause\" removal protection, structural designs, and bypass of OMB oversight. Some agencies may be exempted from OMB clearance procedures, providing them with greater independence from the President. For example, financial regulatory agencies are exempt from submitting legislative recommendations to any other agency before Congress if they state that their views do not necessarily represent the President's views. Additionally, some IRCs like the USITC and FCC are shielded from OIRA review under E.O. 12866. The USITC and FCC are shielded from OMB budget revisions. Executive Order 12866 establishes centralized review of regulations by OIRA within OMB for executive agencies. IRCs are exempt from this process. Executive agencies must submit planned regulations to OIRA for review. The Executive Order requires executive agencies to submit a list of planned regulations to OIRA, identifying significant regulatory actions likely to have a major economic impact or affect various aspects such as environment, public health, or legal issues. OIRA determines if a rule is \"significant\" and reviews all \"significant regulatory actions\" before their promulgation. Executive agencies must provide text, explanation, costs, and benefits for significant regulations. Executive agencies must submit a statement ensuring regulatory actions align with the law and President's priorities. \"Economically significant\" rules require a detailed cost-benefit analysis and consideration of alternatives. OIRA reviews proposed agency actions within 90 days to ensure compliance with E.O. 12866 before finalizing rules in the Federal Register. OIRA reviews proposed regulatory actions to ensure compliance with E.O. 12866 before finalizing rules in the Federal Register. If OIRA believes a proposed action fails to meet requirements, it may be returned to the executive agency for further consideration. Conflicts between OIRA and the agency are resolved by the President. The President's authority to unilaterally require executive agencies to submit rules to OIRA for review has raised questions due to Congress delegating rule-making authority to agencies, not the President, and not authorizing centralized review. The unitary executive theory supports the President's authority, arguing that all executive power is vested in the President. Proponents of the unitary executive theory argue that the President should have full control over the executive branch and be able to direct officers in fulfilling their obligations. They believe the President can substitute his judgment for the Secretary of State's decision, even if a statute prohibits presidential intervention. The Department of Justice Office of Legal Counsel supported the Reagan Administration's E.O. 12291, justifying centralized review processes. The OLC opinion supports the Reagan Administration's E.O. 12291, emphasizing the President's authority to ensure laws are faithfully executed and coordinate with executive agencies for uniform execution. The Take Care Clause grants the President the power to supervise and guide executive officers in implementing legislation. The OLC opinion supports E.O. 12291 by stating that the President's role is supervisory to ensure laws are faithfully executed by executive agencies. The Executive Order does not exceed the President's powers as he is not taking away agencies' authority but ensuring uniform implementation of statutes. Agencies are only required to comply with the order to the extent permitted by law. The President's authority for centralized review is based on statutory interpretation rather than clear constitutional authority. The President's authority for centralized review is based on statutory interpretation, not clear constitutional authority. Justice Elena Kagan argues that when Congress delegates rulemaking authority to an executive agency, it implicitly permits the President to direct agency officials to reach certain conclusions. This authority could justify subjecting agency rules to centralized review, but Congress still has the power to limit the President's control over agency officials. The President's authority for centralized review is based on statutory interpretation, not clear constitutional authority. Justice Elena Kagan argues that when Congress delegates rulemaking authority to an executive agency, it implicitly permits the President to control agency decisions. This control over agency decision making allows the President to require OIRA review of executive agency rules and resolve any issues. The President's authority for centralized review is based on statutory interpretation, allowing him to require OIRA review of executive agency rules and resolve disputes. Justice Jackson's framework from Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer sets out three types of circumstances for evaluating presidential authority in relation to constitutional and congressional authority. The President's authority for centralized review is based on statutory interpretation, allowing him to require OIRA review of executive agency rules and resolve disputes. Justice Jackson's framework from Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer sets out three types of circumstances for evaluating presidential authority in relation to constitutional and congressional authority. In instances where presidential action is \"incompatible with the express or implied will of Congress,\" the power of the President is at its minimum, resting upon an exclusive Article II power. An argument could be made that the issuance of executive orders requiring OIRA review of executive agency rules falls within Jackson's second prong\u2014the \"zone of twilight.\" Justice Jackson's opinion from Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer suggests that the scope of presidential authority in the \"zone of twilight\" depends on practical considerations rather than abstract legal theories. Evaluating orders based on practical considerations could support the President's authority, considering the need for centralized review in the complex administrative state and Congress's apparent acceptance. However, some argue that the President's imposition of centralized review without congressional authorization is contentious. The President's imposition of centralized review without congressional authorization is argued to violate the separation of powers. Congress has not delegated the authority for centralized review, implying a denial of such control by the President. This limits the President's authority in agency policymaking, placing him in the third category under Justice Jackson's opinion from Youngstown. Some scholars argue that the President's centralized review requirements must be based solely on his Article II powers, while opponents of the unitary executive theory believe the President is intended to be an \"agent of Congress\" and does not have broad power. The Take Care Clause does not imply the President can execute laws himself, but rather delegates that authority to subordinate officials. The President's centralized review requirements may potentially interfere with Congress's delegation of authority to agencies, raising concerns about constitutionality. However, scholars and organizations now generally agree that the President has the authority to conduct such reviews. The President's authority to conduct centralized review of agency rulemaking has been widely accepted, with scholars and organizations agreeing that it is essential for effective executive branch management. This authority has been in place since 1971 under E.O. 12866, with no congressional action to restrain it. The constitutionality of these orders has not been directly challenged in court, but the implicit support from Congress and the courts suggests that the President has the power to exercise centralized control over executive agencies. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit supports the President's authority to consult and advise executive officers for centralized review, emphasizing the importance of executive policymakers being connected to the Chief Executive for effective government functioning. The DC Circuit supports the President's authority for centralized review of executive policymaking, emphasizing the need for effective coordination between executive agencies and the President. Questions remain about extending this review to independent regulatory commissions (IRCs), with calls for centralized review but no action yet. The discussion revolves around the President's legal authority in this matter. The President's legal authority to extend centralized review requirements to independent regulatory commissions (IRCs) has been considered by past administrations. Both Presidents Reagan and Clinton received legal opinions supporting this extension, but decisions not to do so were based on political rather than legal reasons. A bill introduced by Senator Rob Portman in the 112th Congress would allow the President to require IRCs to comply with centralized review requirements. The bill aims to affirm the President's constitutional authority to extend centralized review requirements to independent regulatory commissions (IRCs), sparking debates on the legality of such action without congressional approval. President Reagan's E.O. 12291 in 1981 raised similar concerns, with arguments supporting the constitutionality of centralized review via executive order. The Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) referenced the Myers decision to justify extending E.O. 12866 requirements to IRCs. OLC references Myers decision to explain President's supervisory role over agencies with heads removable at will. Humphrey's Executor decision likely guides President's role with agencies where heads can only be removed \"for cause.\" The President's authority to remove an FTC commissioner is limited to \"inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.\" The FTC was intended to be independent of executive authority in selecting commissioners. An OLC opinion discusses the application of E.O. 12291 to IRCs, noting reasons why the President's supervision over rulemaking may not be restricted by the FTC's independence in agency adjudication. The OLC argues for presidential supervision over independent regulatory commissions (IRCs) to ensure faithful execution of laws, despite limitations on displacing their discretion. This aligns with the unitary executive doctrine, emphasizing the President's authority over administrative processes. The OLC argues that the President should have supervision over independent regulatory commissions to ensure the faithful execution of laws, in line with the unitary executive doctrine. This includes examining the terms of removal of executive officers to determine if Congress has granted the President authority to supervise the IRCs. The OLC argues that the President's authority to supervise independent regulatory commissions hinges on the interpretation of removal terms. A narrow view limits removal to non-policy reasons, while a broad view allows removal for any perceived transgressions. This could give the President significant control over agency policy choices. The inclusion of the IRCs in the executive order is considered lawful, with a focus on the President's supervisory powers post Morrison v. Olson. The new test for the constitutionality of a removal restriction is whether it hinders the President's constitutional duties. This shift indicates a move towards a more focused inquiry on the President's supervisory role rather than the extension of executive order requirements to the IRCs as a whole. The key question now is whether the executive's accountability can be trusted. The new inquiry focuses on whether the executive's accountability can be trusted and if political accountability would interfere with agency rulemaking. Legal arguments against applying E.O. 12866 to executive agencies also apply to IRCs. While coordinating regulatory review through executive order may not violate separation of powers, applying the tripartite framework to IRCs could yield a different outcome. The third prong of the framework emphasizes that presidential action must align with the will of Congress to avoid violating separation of powers. The President's power is at its minimum when it comes to centralized review of executive agencies or IRCs. The question arises whether it is the \"implied will of Congress\" for the President to refrain from supervising IRCs, based on statutory provisions. If so, the President's action must be based on exclusive power, raising concerns about relying solely on general authority as head of the executive branch. If S. 3468 becomes law, it would likely satisfy the first prong under Youngstown. If the President were to amend E.O. 12866 to include the IRCs, questions arise about enforcing agency compliance. Options include firing a member of an IRC or seeking court action. Congress could also codify E.O. 12866, affecting the President's recourse and judicial review availability. The President's role through OMB is supervisory, with limited authority over the administrative process. The President's role in overseeing agency compliance with E.O. 12866 is limited, with the only recourse being to remove the head of the agency for noncompliance. However, if an IRC disregards the OMB process, questions arise about the grounds for removing its members. The meaning of \"for cause\" removal and its application to IRC members without specified removal provisions in the establishing statute must be considered. In cases where the establishing statute is silent on removal, the appointing authority generally has the power to remove members of an IRC. While some IRCs have explicit provisions for removal \"for cause,\" others like the SEC, NCUA, and FEC are silent on removal, raising questions about removal only \"for cause.\" The SEC, NCUA, and FEC have inferred a \"for cause\" removal restriction. In Wiener v. United States, the Supreme Court ruled that the President could not remove a member of the War Claims Commission at will, similar to the FTC's restriction on removal upheld in Humphrey's Executor. The Court found the WCC's quasi-judicial functions and intent to be \"free from control or coercive influence\" as reasons for the restriction. In subsequent cases like Swan v. Clinton and SEC v. Blinder, courts have interpreted statutes to imply a \"for cause\" removal restriction for board members during their appointed terms based on legislative background and the nature of the agency's functions. The DC Circuit found that SEC commissioners may only be removed for \"inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office,\" similar to the FTC commissioners in Humphrey's Executor. The court also suggested that the President could discharge a commissioner for good cause. Courts may review independent regulatory agencies on a case-by-case basis to determine if a \"for cause\" limitation on removal can be implied in the establishing statute. The issue of whether noncompliance with E.O. 12866 could be grounds for \"for cause\" removal of agency members remains unclear, as the terms have not been defined by statute or the courts. There has not been a successful involuntary removal of an individual with \"for cause\" protection, raising questions about the type of conduct that could lead to removal. The terms for \"for cause\" removal of agency members remain undefined by statute or courts. In Humphrey's Executor case, differing political views were not considered grounds for removal. The case highlights conduct that would not warrant removal under a \"for cause\" standard. The President's ability to remove an individual \"for cause\" is limited, as seen in the context of the Independent Counsel position in Morrison v. Olson. The interpretation of \"good cause\" by Congress and DOJ differs, with the Senate emphasizing misconduct as the basis for removal protection. Court decisions suggest a more restricted power for the President to fire agency heads with \"for cause\" removal protection. The President's ability to remove agency heads with \"for cause\" protection is limited, as seen in Bowsher v. Synar. Legal scholars suggest a broad interpretation of \"for cause\" provisions, allowing removal for failure to follow presidential directives. The parameters for removal \"for cause\" remain unclear without guidance from courts or Congress. The President's ability to enforce compliance with Executive Orders by Independent Regulatory Commissions (IRCs) is uncertain, as it is unclear whether noncompliance could constitute grounds for removal. S. 3468 does not require IRCs to comply with E.O. 12866 by statute, but authorizes the President to enforce compliance through executive order. If the President extends centralized review requirements to IRCs, the same enforcement challenges would remain. If centralized review requirements are extended to Independent Regulatory Commissions (IRCs), the President may still face challenges in enforcing compliance due to uncertainties regarding grounds for removal based on noncompliance with statutes or executive orders. Noncompliance with a statute could potentially be considered as \"for cause\" for removal, with neglect of duty or malfeasance of office being possible grounds for removal. The limitations on judicial review in E.O. 12866 restrict challenges to agency rules for neglect of duty or malfeasance of office. Judicial review is only available if Congress allows courts to hear cases on centralized review compliance. E.O. 12866 prohibits judicial review for agency compliance with the order. The Executive Order 12866 limits judicial review for agency rules and prohibits questioning agency actions for noncompliance with centralized review procedures. This restriction extends to Independent Regulatory Commissions (IRCs) if centralized review is extended to them. Judicial scrutiny regarding compliance with the order has been effectively removed by E.O. 12866 and predecessor orders. The United States Tax Court and U.S. Court of Appeals have ruled that challenges to agency compliance with Executive Orders 12866 and 12291 are precluded from judicial review. Compliance with centralized review procedures cannot be questioned, as established by these court decisions. The United States Tax Court and U.S. Court of Appeals have ruled that challenges to agency compliance with Executive Orders 12866 and 12291 are precluded from judicial review. Compliance with centralized review procedures cannot be questioned, as established by these court decisions. However, Congress could enact a statute to require agencies to comply with centralized review and subject their actions to judicial scrutiny, potentially allowing for challenges under the APA for noncompliance. The SEC can be challenged for not considering costs and benefits in their regulatory actions, as required by the Investment Company Act. Failure to assess economic impacts can result in rules being vacated as arbitrary or capricious under the APA. This can lead to delays in implementing agency rules when courts review economic analyses. The DC Circuit has vacated SEC rules due to the agency's failure to consider costs, alternatives, and relying on insufficient data. In 2005, a rule requiring mutual funds to have independent directors was remanded for not adequately considering costs imposed on mutual funds. The SEC argued it couldn't determine potential costs without a reliable basis. The court found that the SEC violated its obligations under the ICA and APA by not conducting an economic impact analysis and failing to consider alternatives to their rule. In a previous case, the DC Circuit vacated an SEC rule due to similar failures in considering costs and alternatives. The court found problems with the SEC's justifications for a rule regarding board of director positions, determining it to be arbitrary and capricious under the APA. It highlighted issues such as reliance on unpersuasive studies, failure to consider costs and benefits, and lack of important data. This case demonstrates the importance of judicial review for compliance with centralized review requirements. Federal agencies adopt rules under the APA to implement statutes authorized by Congress. The executive branch, through OIRA, conducts centralized review for significant regulatory actions. E.O. 12866 establishes additional steps for rule finalization. There is debate over the President's authority to impose these obligations, but there is broad agreement that he has legal grounds to do so. IRCs are exempt from E.O. 12866, but this exemption has been under consideration. Arguments have been made for extending executive requirements to encompass IRCs, citing the President's authority under the unitary executive principle. However, some argue that Congress has not authorized this process, potentially insulating IRCs from presidential control. Questions arise regarding enforcement if E.O. 12866 were extended to IRCs or codified by Congress. The President's ability to enforce compliance with Executive Order 12866 on Independent Regulatory Commissions (IRCs) may be limited due to \"for cause\" removal protection enjoyed by IRC members. The meaning of \"for cause\" remains undefined, making it unclear what conduct would justify removal. Judicial review for noncompliance with the Executive Order is unlikely, but if provided via statute, claims could be brought against IRCs under the APA for arbitrary or capricious actions."
