    "content": "This report focuses on FY2018 appropriations and FY2019 advance appropriations for the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), funded through the MILCON-VA Appropriations Act. It includes an overview of the VA budget, advance appropriations, and recent funding developments for the Veterans Choice Program. The report also covers the President's budget request for FY2018 and FY2019, along with congressional action on funding levels. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) was established in 1989 to replace the Veterans Administration, providing benefits and services to veterans and eligible dependents. These benefits include medical care, disability compensation, education, vocational rehabilitation, and more. The VA provides benefits such as home loan guarantees, life insurance, and burial expenses for veterans through three administrations. The VBA offers compensation, pensions, and education assistance, the NCA maintains national cemeteries, and the VHA provides healthcare services and conducts research. The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) conducts medical research, trains healthcare professionals, and provides primary and specialized care to veterans. They also serve as a backup to the Department of Defense during emergencies and support the National Disaster Medical System. VHA pays for veterans' care in the private sector when needed and provides care to eligible dependents. The VA budget includes mandatory and discretionary funding for various benefits and compensation programs. The Department of Veterans Affairs provides a range of benefits and services to veterans, including disability compensation, pensions, vocational rehabilitation, education, and burial benefits. Funding for these programs comes from discretionary accounts, revolving funds, trust funds, and special funds. In FY2017, approximately 58% of VA's appropriations funded mandatory veterans benefits, and 37% funded health care programs. The Veterans Health Care Budget Reform and Transparency Act of 2009 authorized advance appropriations for VHA accounts. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015 expanded advance appropriations to VA benefits programs. In FY2017, VA's appropriations funded pensions, readjustment benefits, veterans insurance, and indemnities. Advance appropriations were authorized for VHA accounts and a new medical community care account. Various acts, including the Jeff Miller and Richard Blumenthal Veterans Health Care and Benefits Improvement Act of 2016, supported advanced appropriations for these accounts. The act provides advance appropriations for FY2018 to the new medical community care account by rescinding funds from the 2017 advance appropriation amounts in the medical services account. Congress has authorized advance appropriations for VBA and VHA accounts to prevent delays in care and benefits for veterans. Advance appropriations are scored as new budget authority in the fiscal year they become available for obligation. In response to the crisis of access to medical care at many VA hospitals and clinics across the country reported in 2014, advance appropriations numbers are shown under the label \"memorandum\" in the funding tables of the report. FY2018 advance appropriations are provided in the FY2018 column under the label \"memorandum\" to address the issue. In 2014, Congress passed the Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act to address the crisis of access to medical care at VA hospitals. The act established the Veterans Choice Program to authorize care for veterans outside the VA system and provided $10 billion in funding over three years. The Veterans Choice Program was established in 2014 with $10 billion in funding over three years. Additional funding of $5 billion was provided to improve veterans' access to healthcare. The program's sunset date was extended by subsequent laws, including P.L. 115-26 signed by President Trump in April 2017. The Veterans Choice Program, established in 2014 with $10 billion in funding, had its sunset date extended by subsequent laws. However, due to increased usage of funds, the program faced termination in August 2017. To address this, the VA Choice and Quality Employment Act of 2017 was signed into law, providing $2.1 billion to continue the program. The Veterans Choice Fund received an additional $2.1 billion in funding in response to the exhaustion of funds in December 2017. The funds are available until expended, with the Secretary of Veterans Affairs stating they will remain available for obligation until May 2018. These funds are separate from the regular annual appropriations provided in the House-passed and Senate-reported FY2018 MILCON-VA bills. The President's FY2018 budget request for the VA is $182.66 billion, a 3.23% increase from FY2017.

The cost of the VCP extension would be offset by terminating Individual Unemployment benefits for veterans eligible for Social Security benefits. The Administration's FY2018 budget proposal includes a cost of living adjustment round-down for disability compensation and DIC for 10 years.
