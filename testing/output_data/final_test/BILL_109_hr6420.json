The amendments made by the \"Tax Exempt Hospitals Responsibility Act of 2006\" apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2007, under various sections of the Internal Revenue Code. SEC. 3. Failure by specified medical care provider to meet minimum charity care requirement. Amends Chapter 42 of the Internal Revenue Code to add a new subchapter regarding failure to meet charity care requirements by specified medical care providers. Sec. 4968 imposes a $1,000 tax on a specified medical care provider for failing to provide specified medically necessary care to a low-income uninsured individual during an in-person visit. \"Sec. 4968A imposes an excise tax on a specified medical care provider for overcharging for specified medically necessary care.\" Imposition of Tax: A tax is imposed on a specified medical care provider if they charge a low-income uninsured individual more than the maximum allowed charges for necessary care. The maximum allowed charges are $25 per visit for individuals with an annual household income up to 100% of the poverty line, and the average amount paid for those with incomes between 100% and 200% of the poverty line. The tax is imposed on a specified medical care provider based on the average amount paid for necessary care under contracts with private health insurers.
