    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Children's Recovery from Trauma Act\". According to findings by Congress and the National Institute of Mental Health, many children face barriers in receiving appropriate mental health care, with only a small percentage of youth with mental disorders receiving services. Despite effective treatments available, there are long delays in accessing mental health treatment, even though half of all lifetime cases of mental illness begin by age 14. Long delays in accessing mental health treatment exist, with adverse childhood experiences predisposing children to negative trajectories. The Great Smoky Mountains Study found that by age 16, over 67% of children had experienced traumatic events. The lifetime prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder for 13 to 18 year olds is 4 to 6 percent. The National Institute of Mental Health reported that adults who experienced childhood abuse or neglect have an increased risk of major depression, often starting in childhood with long-lasting effects. The Department of Defense stated that over 700,000 children have experienced parental deployments, with children's reactions varying based on age, developmental stage, and the parent's mental health. The National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey found that nearly 1 in 5 women reported experiencing intimate partner or sexual violence. Survey revealed that 1 in 5 women reported being raped, with 42% experiencing their first rape before age 18. The National Child Traumatic Stress Network collected data on 14,088 children and adolescents, finding that 80% reported experiencing at least one traumatic event, with 77% experiencing multiple traumas and 31% experiencing five or more types. After receiving services from the National Child Traumatic Stress Network, 65% of children had received social services and 35% had received school-based services. Treatment led to significant improvements in trauma symptoms, mental health diagnoses, and behavioral problems. SEC. 3. GRANTS TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEMS OF INDIVIDUALS WHO EXPERIENCE TRAUMA AND VIOLENCE RELATED STRESS. Section 582 of the Public Health Service Act is amended to provide grants for individuals experiencing trauma and violence-related stress. The Secretary will award grants to entities for programs focusing on mental, behavioral, and biological aspects of trauma response, as well as developing evidence-based practices for treating disorders in children and youth resulting from traumatic events.
