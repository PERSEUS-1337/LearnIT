    "content": "The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of 2009 allocated $7.2 billion for broadband grant and loan programs at NTIA/DOC and RUS/USDA. NTIA received $4.7 billion for the Broadband Technology Opportunity Program (BTOP), while RUS got $2.5 billion for the Broadband Initiatives Program (BIP) focused on rural areas. The Broadband Technology Opportunity Program (BTOP) and Broadband Initiatives Program (BIP) were part of the ARRA broadband funding. NTIA and RUS evaluated applications based on project viability and benefits. All ARRA broadband funds were awarded by September 30, 2010. NTIA and RUS announced awards for 553 projects totaling $7.465 billion in federal funding. Unobligated funds will be returned to the U.S. Treasury by September 30, 2015. The ARRA broadband funding included the Broadband Technology Opportunity Program (BTOP) and Broadband Initiatives Program (BIP). NTIA and RUS awarded a total of $7.465 billion to 553 projects, with $6.273 billion in grant funding and $1.192 billion in loan funding. BTOP and BIP funding breakdown by state and per capita is shown in tables. Most BTOP awards went to government and nonprofit entities, while BIP infrastructure awards primarily went to for-profit corporations providing rural broadband service. Most of the BTOP infrastructure projects were for \"middle mile\" broadband infrastructure, while BIP awards were for \"last-mile\" projects providing broadband access to end users. Various technologies like fiber, wireless, and satellite are being deployed in funded projects. Most BTOP projects are fiber or fiber with wireless technology, mainly middle mile infrastructure. NTIA and RUS are closing out all BTOP and BIP projects by September 30, 2015, with unspent funds returned to the U.S. Treasury for deficit reduction. Concerns exist about incomplete projects by the deadline and the potential return of undrawn funds. According to the latest Broadband Initiatives Quarterly Report, 297 broadband infrastructure project loans and grants were awarded by RUS. 42 rescissions accounted for $325 million returned to the U.S. Treasury. As of March 31, 2015, out of the $3.1 billion awarded to active projects, $2.560 billion had been advanced by RUS. Concerns have been raised in Congress about the completion of all projects before the funding deadline of September 30, 2015. On July 29, 2014, the RUS Administrator mentioned the deadline for project completion and fund availability. A report on July 28, 2015, revealed that many approved projects had not utilized their full funding. RUS Administrator McBride stated on August 2, 2015, that most funds had been used, and projects were on track to meet goals by the fiscal year end. As of December 31, 2014, 12 BTOP grant projects were still active, while 212 had been completed. As of December 31, 2014, 12 BTOP grant projects were still active, while 212 had completed their activities, drawing down $3.65 billion of federal grant funds. Concerns arose with public safety broadband projects, initially awarded in 2010 but partially suspended due to the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012. Ultimately, four projects reached spectrum leasing agreements, one moved forward without an agreement, and two were unresolved. The partial suspension of public safety projects has caused challenges in completing them by September 30, 2015. As of December 31, 2014, $274 million or 72% of the funds allocated to these projects had not been used. Monitoring of funded projects now focuses on oversight and milestone achievements to draw down federal funds incrementally. Subrecipients are monitored by agency staff to ensure project goals, performance, timelines, budgets, and other requirements are met. NTIA and RUS have the authority to reclaim funding in cases of waste, fraud, or non-compliance. ARRA mandates quarterly and annual reports from award recipients, with NTIA reporting every 90 days to specific committees. The Secretary of Agriculture must report on planned and actual spending. The ARRA mandates reporting to Congress on planned spending and actual obligations for RUS broadband programs. NTIA maintains a public website with detailed project information for BTOP grants, while RUS provides brief summaries. The OIG has conducted audits on BTOP, including an audit on excess equipment inventory. The OIG conducted an audit of BTOP's excess equipment inventory and closeout procedures. NTIA must address issues such as slow awardee spending, equipment procurement monitoring, grant match documentation, impact of the FirstNet program on BTOP projects, and funding questions for 2013 and beyond. The USDA OIG had not reviewed the BIP program until 2011, deferring to the GAO. The OIG previously criticized the RUS Rural Broadband Access Loan Program for making too many loans in certain areas. The USDA OIG conducted audits of the Broadband Initiatives Program (BIP) and found that some funded projects overlapped with existing providers, some projects would not be completed within the established timeframe, and the program could have been more focused on rural residents without broadband access. The USDA OIG audited the Broadband Initiatives Program (BIP) and found issues with grant agreements, exceeding award components, and uneven fund advancements. Questions remain about the effectiveness of ARRA broadband programs in achieving goals. NTIA and RUS have reported on jobs created, broadband network deployment, and homes connected. As of March 31, 2015, 230,323 broadband subscribers received new or improved service. As of March 31, 2015, 230,323 broadband subscribers received new or improved service from BIP projects. BTOP grant recipients generated 671,000 new subscribers. Evaluating broadband program impact is complex, considering deployment without federal funding. NTIA awarded a $5 million contract to measure BTOP grant impact on broadband availability and economic conditions. The NTIA funded a study to assess the economic impact of BTOP grant funding, with ASR Analytics submitting the final report in 2014. Findings showed that BTOP infrastructure created over 22,000 jobs and generated $1 billion in household income annually. Community anchor institutions saw a 95% decrease in broadband prices and a sevenfold increase in broadband capacity. The evaluation study sample of BTOP communities showed that over 4.3 million people gained broadband availability from June 30, 2011, to June 30, 2013. Policy makers may seek independent evaluations to assess the long-term effects of ARRA broadband programs on jobs, economic growth, and prosperity. GAO recommended that RUS improve the quality of its data on the number of fiber miles and wireless access points created by BIP projects. The GAO report in June 2014 raised concerns about staffing for oversight of incomplete BIP projects. USDA's performance reports do not track BIP performance against goals. Over 550 broadband awards were announced, with instances of award declines, suspensions, revocations, and complaints filed. RUS rescinded 42 BIP awards totaling $325 million, and 9 BTOP awards totaling $183 million were rescinded. Specific complaints or issues with BTOP or BIP projects have been publicly noted. Specific complaints or issues with BTOP or BIP projects have been publicly reported, including misrepresentations in project applications for the San Francisco Bay Area Wireless Enhanced Broadband project and ineffective management of funds and inventory in West Virginia. A complaint was filed with RUS calling for an investigation and suspension of a $66.4 million award to Lake County, MN, for the construction of the Lake County Fiber Network. Mediacom alleges the project lacks financial viability and Lake County lacks legal authority. The EAGLE-Net project in Colorado has faced criticism for program waste and overbuilding, leading to a suspension by NTIA in December 2012. The project was resumed in May 2013 and included in an audit by the DOC Office of the Inspector General. The House and Senate committees are monitoring the ARRA broadband programs in NTIA and RUS, expressing concern about potential delays in project completion before unspent funds return to the Treasury. Options for Congress include letting the funds expire, extending project deadlines, or providing new funding. An amendment proposed to the highway bill by Senator Wicker would extend BTOP funding through fiscal year 2020 for active grants. The House Subcommittee on Communications and Technology has held hearings focusing on BTOP and BIP, with testimony from Inspectors General and Administrators of NTIA and RUS. In February 2013, a hearing was held regarding BTOP and BIP funds, with concerns raised about potential fraud and abuse. Legislation was proposed to address these issues, including provisions for terminating awards for cause. The agencies were directed to promptly terminate BTOP or BIP awards for cause, such as poor performance, wasteful or fraudulent spending. Upon termination, NTIA or RUS had to deobligate the award amount, minus allowable costs, and return the money to the U.S. Treasury within 30 days. If informed of noncompliance or improper fund usage, the agencies had 30 days to decide on termination, unless advised otherwise. Congressional committees were to be notified within three days of considering award termination. The Energy and Commerce Committee majority supported H.R. 1343, which aimed to add required reporting, establish timelines for agencies to respond to IG reports, and clarify the requirement for agencies to return unused funds to the U.S. Treasury. RUS and NTIA argued that existing statutes already addressed these issues. H.R. 1343 was discharged by the House Committee on Agriculture and passed by the House under suspension of the rules. A similar bill, S. 1659, was introduced in the Senate. Concerns were raised about grants and loans being awarded to areas with existing broadband providers, despite the ARRA favoring projects in underserved areas. The ARRA specified that RUS BIP projects should serve rural areas without sufficient access to broadband for economic development. Priority is given to projects serving the highest proportion of rural residents without broadband. NTIA's BTOP program aims to provide broadband access to unserved and underserved areas, with a focus on increasing affordability, subscribership, and speeds for the greatest population of users. RUS and NTIA had flexibility in implementing grant and loan programs for broadband access. Eligible areas were defined as those with limited access to terrestrial broadband service. \"Unserved areas\" had at least 90% of households without access, while \"underserved areas\" had specific criteria for broadband availability. The service provider advertises broadband speeds of at least 3 Mbps downstream. A proposed funded service area qualifies as underserved if broadband subscribership is 40% or less. For middle-mile projects, an area is underserved if one interconnection point terminates in an underserved last-mile area. In the second-round NOFAs, eligible project areas for BIP projects must be at least 75% rural and lack high-speed broadband access in 50% of the area. In the second round of BTOP projects, eligible service areas must have broadband speeds of 5 Mbps in 50% of the area. Existing providers had 30 days to respond to broadband infrastructure applications to assess service levels. In the second round of BTOP projects, eligible service areas must have broadband speeds of 5 Mbps in 50% of the area. Existing providers had 30 days to respond to broadband infrastructure applications to assess service levels. Agencies could reclassify applications based on public notice responses from existing providers in round one. RUS stated that existing providers must provide a PNR for their services to be considered in determining eligibility for funded service areas in BIP applications. The presence of a PNR does not guarantee an area is not unserved or underserved. The lack of a public notice response does not necessarily mean there is no existing service provider in the proposed area. Two-thirds of awarded BIP projects had existing broadband service, with three-quarters of the funding going to projects with at least one provider in the area. Many projects received multiple PNRs. In Round One, BTOP and BIP used the same methodology for collecting PNRs. In Round One, BTOP and BIP used the same methodology for collecting PNRs. 90% of awarded BTOP infrastructure projects received one or more PNRs. NTIA significantly changed the methodology for collecting PNRs in Round Two by posting a list of Census block groups or tracts for Comprehensive Community Infrastructure applicants. In Round Two, 391 broadband providers filed PNRs based on Census block groups or tracts. RUS and NTIA considered the presence of existing providers in proposed service areas when deciding on funding applications. PNRs were one tool used to assess existing broadband service levels in project areas. The level of existing broadband service in proposed project areas is assessed using available data from the FCC, states, and other sources. RUS also considers factors like affordability, quality of service, and adoption rates. Providing federal funding to areas with existing providers is controversial, as it may lead to competition with other companies. The controversy surrounding federal funding for broadband service in rural areas stems from the potential competition it may create with existing providers. While some argue that subsidies should not support competitors in sparsely populated markets, others believe that competition can drive down prices and improve service. Additionally, diverting assistance from unserved areas to those with preexisting broadband service may hinder progress in areas most in need. The controversy over federal funding for rural broadband centers on competition with existing providers. Some argue subsidies should not support competitors in sparsely populated markets, while others believe competition can lower prices and enhance service. Middle-mile broadband facilities under BTOP can help existing providers serve unserved areas economically. NTIA and RUS oversee BTOP and BIP projects, with NTIA seeking additional administrative funding post-ARRA to manage grants effectively. The Administration has requested additional appropriations for NTIA to oversee BTOP grants, while RUS has not requested extra funds for the BIP program. The National Broadband Plan set a goal for broadband availability for all Americans. The FCC estimated a \"broadband availability gap\" of 14 million people in the US without access to broadband infrastructure. $24 billion in funding is needed to fill this gap. BTOP and BIP programs are not enough to close the gap, requiring additional government support. States and federal government need to commit to connecting the nation for ubiquitous broadband availability. The nation requires a substantial commitment from states and the federal government to build new networks in unserved areas and support ongoing operation. The Universal Service Fund (USF) provides subsidies for telecommunications services, including broadband access. Encouraging the rollout of wireless broadband is also crucial for reaching National Broadband Plan goals. President Obama set a goal in 2011 to enable wireless broadband for 98% of Americans within five years. This can be achieved through broadband funding programs and making more spectrum available to providers. Federal programs like the Rural Broadband Access Loan and Loan Guarantee Program support telecommunications and broadband development. The Rural Utilities Service offers ongoing broadband grants and the Telecommunications Infrastructure Loan Program, operating on a smaller scale than the BIP program."
