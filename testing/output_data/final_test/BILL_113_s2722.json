    "content": "The \"Protecting Our Infants Act of 2014\" is also known as the \"Protecting Our Infants Act.\" It provides evidence-informed recommendations regarding maternal addiction and neonatal abstinence syndrome. The Secretary of Health and Human Services is responsible for coordinating evidence-informed recommendations for neonatal abstinence syndrome, including screening and intervention for maternal substance abuse and treatment for pregnant and postpartum women with substance use disorders. The Secretary of Health and Human Services coordinates evidence-informed recommendations for neonatal abstinence syndrome, including screening and intervention for maternal substance abuse, treatment for pregnant and postpartum women with substance use disorders, and ongoing support for women and infants affected by substance abuse. Input from stakeholders such as health professionals, public health officials, and law enforcement is considered in carrying out these efforts. The Secretary will disseminate evidence-informed recommendations to stakeholders in States and local communities. A study will be conducted to evaluate factors related to maternal opiate misuse and abuse, including barriers to treatment and effective prevention strategies for pregnant women and women of childbearing age at risk for opiates. The Secretary will provide findings on factors related to neonatal abstinence syndrome, including epidemiological studies, diagnosis, treatment, and long-term effects, to relevant committees within a year of the Act's enactment. The House of Representatives Energy and Commerce committee will receive a report on gaps in evidence-based recommendations and priority areas for further research based on a study's findings. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will assist States in improving data collection on neonatal abstinence syndrome. Congress supports research on pain management for women of childbearing age by the National Institutes of Health. The Comptroller General of the United States will conduct a study within a year of this Act's enactment to evaluate federally facilitated substance abuse treatment programs for pregnant women and their children, Federal programs promoting State adoption of safety measures for mothers with substance use disorder and children with neonatal abstinence syndrome, and the effectiveness of Federal data systems in monitoring drug utilization and trends, including neonatal abstinence syndrome data incorporation. The identification of discretionary funds to address maternal substance abuse, including prescription drug misuse and abuse, is essential."
