He joined the movement of La Giovine Italia and participated in independence struggles in Central and South America. Garibaldi later came to the United States, where he applied for citizenship and lived with inventor Antonio Meucci in Staten Island, New York. The Garibaldi-Meucci Museum celebrates Italian-American heritage and culture. The Garibaldi-Meucci Museum, listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places in 1980, commemorates Giuseppe Garibaldi's role in Italy's unification in 1861. Garibaldi left Staten Island, New York in 1854 to lead military forces in the Risorgimento conflicts for Italy's unification, which was seen as a victory for individual political self-determination in the United States. He was even offered a command as Major General in the Union Army. Giuseppe Garibaldi declined a command as Major General in the Union Army but was honored by having the 39th New York Infantry named \"The Garibaldi Guard\". He was an active freemason and believed in uniting men globally. Garibaldi spent his later years in Caprera with his family and is considered a national hero in Italy, with Italian Navy ships named after him. On March 17, 2011, Italy will celebrate its 150th Anniversary with events in Italy, Washington, DC, and the United States to highlight the partnership between Italy and the United States. Both nations share common values, historical ties, and cultural relations. Great men like Andrea Palladio, Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin, Antonio Meucci, Giuseppe Garibaldi, and Abraham Lincoln have inspired each other in various fields. Today, the legacy of immigrants is evident. The legacy of Italian immigrants in the United States is evident in the millions of Italian Americans and community organizations like the National Italian American Foundation. Despite facing discrimination, Italian Americans persevered and contributed to all areas of public and economic life while preserving their traditions. They have also served in the military to defend the country since the Revolutionary War. Italian Americans have served in the military during various conflicts, including World Wars, Vietnam, Korea, Persian Gulf, and current conflicts.
