    "content": "In January 2016, Senator Orrin Hatch announced plans for tax reform exploring corporate integration to eliminate or reduce additional taxes on corporate equity investment. The current system of taxation creates differential tax burdens, favoring noncorporate equity investment, debt finance over equity finance, and retained earnings over dividends. The goal of corporate integration is to reduce these distortions. Congress held hearings on this proposal on May 17, 2016. Work has continued on the proposal for corporate tax integration, with Congress holding hearings on various aspects such as corporate dividend deductions and debt. This approach differs from previous tax reform plans, focusing on reducing distortions in the current tax system. Former Chairman Dave Camp introduced a corporate tax reform bill in the 113th Congress, and a potential tax reform could combine elements from previous proposals with an integration plan. Corporate tax integration was previously studied in a major Treasury report in 1992. The tax system has seen changes over the years, with reductions in taxes for shareholders on capital gains and dividends. In 2003, tax rates on dividends and capital gains were lowered to a maximum of 15%. These rates were set to expire after 2010 but were extended, with high-income levels taxed at 20% in 2013. Additionally, a 3.8% tax was imposed on certain amounts as part of the Affordable Care Act in 2010. In 2010, as part of the Affordable Care Act, an additional 3.8% tax was imposed on investment income of high-income taxpayers. Factors such as the global economy and increased ownership of U.S. corporate stock by shareholders not subject to U.S. taxes have changed since a 1992 study. The next section of the report discusses the differential effects of the current system of taxing corporate income and outlines various options for addressing corporate tax integration. Revenue, administrative, and efficiency concerns associated with these options are also addressed. The current treatment of corporate and noncorporate income in the U.S. tax system produces differential tax rates along various margins, including by sector, form of finance, and asset. Estimates of effective tax rate differentials are provided to discuss potential efficiency gains. Key elements to consider include how the system taxes income from corporate investments more heavily, the impact of tax preferences, treatment of debt, and integration options. The United States has a \"classical\" corporate tax system with a 35% rate for large corporations. Profits can be distributed as dividends or retained for investment, leading to potential capital gains. The total tax on a corporate investment could be 58%, compared to 35% on noncorporate investment, due to favorable treatment of dividends. The tax treatment of shareholders varies based on their status as U.S. individuals, U.S. tax-exempt entities, or foreign shareholders. Most stock is held in forms not subject to U.S. individual income taxes. Individuals pay taxes on dividends and capital gains when selling stock, while some gains may be deferred or never taxed if stock is passed on at death. Retained earnings are taxed more lightly than distributed earnings due to this double taxation of corporate income. The tax treatment of shareholders varies based on their status as U.S. individuals, U.S. tax-exempt entities, or foreign shareholders. Corporate income is taxed twice, known as double taxation, with dividends and capital gains taxed at lower rates. Tax rates range from 0% for taxpayers with ordinary rates less than 15% to 20% for those at the top rate of 39.6%. A Congressional Research Service study estimates average tax rates on dividends at 14.7% and on realized capital gains at 15.4%. About half of capital gains are not taxed due to being passed on at death, resulting in an effective tax rate of 7.7%. The overall individual shareholder tax averages 11.6%, not including the 3.8% tax on investment from the Affordable Care Act. After factoring in a 35% corporate tax rate, the additional tax rate would be 1.4%. The combined average marginal tax rates for dividends and capital gains are 16.8% and 17.6%. About 50% of corporate income is not taxed at the shareholder level. Foreign shareholders holding portfolio shares of U.S. firms make up 26% of total shares, with minimal U.S. tax obligations. Pensions and individual retirement accounts represent 37% of shares, nonprofits hold 5%, and the rest consists mainly of insurance assets. Foreign shareholders holding portfolio shares of U.S. firms have minimal U.S. tax obligations on capital gains and dividends. Dividends are subject to a 30% withholding tax, which can be reduced by treaty, with an average withholding tax of 5.9%. Capital gains are not taxed, resulting in an estimated overall withholding tax rate of 3.4%. Corporate recipients, who receive 57% of dividends, may not be subject to tax due to exemptions or credits. Most of this income may have been from direct investment. Foreign shareholders holding portfolio shares of U.S. firms have minimal U.S. tax obligations on capital gains and dividends. Most of this income may have been from direct investment, partnerships, trusts, and exempt groups. Tax-exempt shareholders might account for about 20% of portfolio stock held by foreign shareholders. The remaining income goes to qualified intermediaries, with the final beneficiary not reported. U.S. subsidiaries of foreign parents are subject to corporate tax. Pass-through businesses are subject only to individual tax. Pass-through businesses, also known as noncorporate firms, are subject only to individual tax, with income allocated to each owner. Shareholders of corporations have limited liability for the firm's debts, while many pass-through firms have full liability, putting personal assets at risk. These businesses include sole proprietorships, ordinary partnerships, and Subchapter S corporations. Limited partnerships have a general partner with full liability and limited partners with liability limited to their investment. Limited liability companies (LLCs) can be taxed as pass-through businesses. Sole proprietorships are subject to payroll taxes, including OASDI and Medicare taxes. Subchapter S allows for separating income from capital. The 3.8% additional tax on income over $250,000 applies to dividends, capital gains, and passive income of partnerships and Subchapter S firms. The Affordable Care Act imposes an additional 0.9% tax on high incomes, totaling 3.8%. Active income of partnerships and Subchapter S firms is exempt. Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) are pass-through firms that distribute most income to shareholders. The tax burden difference between investing in noncorporate and corporate firms depends on individual tax rates and ownership type. The average marginal statutory rate for noncorporate firms is around 27%, with an additional 3.8% tax on high incomes likely increasing it to 28%. The 2014 CBO study estimated that 57.2% of stock investment is in taxable accounts, with 3.9% in tax-deferred accounts. Recent estimates suggest a smaller share of corporate stock held in taxable accounts. CBO estimates focus on determining the tax rate on marginal investments, excluding accounts at maximum value like IRAs and 401(k)s. The CBO study focused on domestic ownership distribution and estimated higher marginal tax rates on dividends, capital gains, and noncorporate income compared to CRS estimates. Tax preferences, like accelerated depreciation, impact burdens on domestic investment by reducing effective tax rates below statutory rates. The effective tax burden on investments in intangibles is zero, with accelerated recovery for oil and gas investments. Depreciation is faster for equipment investments compared to public utility structures. Bonus depreciation allows immediate expensing of half the cost of equipment investments. Residential buildings receive more favorable treatment than commercial and industrial buildings. Bonus depreciation, production activities deduction, research and experimentation credit, and treatment of foreign source income are important tax provisions that reduce effective tax rates. Bonus depreciation is set to phase out after 2019, while the research and experimentation credit was made permanent in December 2015. Interest on borrowed funds for investments is also deductible, further reducing effective tax rates. Tax on profits from debt finance is lower due to tax preferences and inflation. With a lower effective tax rate, firms can make investments yielding less than 5% and still cover interest payments. Tax depreciation rules offset inflation and provide a subsidy. Nominal interest, which includes inflation, is deductible. With an inflation rate of 2% and a 25% real profit rate, the nominal interest rate would be 7%. The tax benefit of interest deduction is 2.45%. Interest income is subject to tax by creditors, but the combined effect of firm/creditor tax is likely small or zero. The estimated effective tax rate is 22%, with a large fraction of income not expected to be taxed. The study of interest distribution is similar to corporate stock distribution, with only 19% of interest income appearing on individual tax returns. In the last reconciliation, 74% of interest income in personal income was excluded, with the largest shares in pensions and insurance. Studies suggest a smaller share of debt is taxable compared to corporate stocks. Investors hold a smaller share of taxable debt compared to equity, with a larger portion being foreign. Interest paid to foreign entities may be subject to tax in their countries of residence. A significant amount of interest payments are to corporations, including those in tax haven countries with low or no taxes. Interest income is also subject to a 3.8% tax, resulting in a total tax of 4.6% for taxable recipients. The growth in foreign source income has impacted the view on corporate integration. The U.S. corporate-level tax is largely imposed on a source basis, encouraging more equity investment in the United States compared to foreign countries. Shareholder and creditor taxes are imposed on a residence basis. Proposals from 1992 that relieved tax at the shareholder and individual level may be less efficient today. Lower tax rates on dividends would not affect the location choices of multinational firms. The corporate tax is imposed on worldwide income, but little tax is paid on foreign source income. The U.S. corporate tax is imposed on worldwide income, but little tax is paid on foreign source income due to deferral and foreign tax credits. Income from foreign subsidiaries is only taxed when repatriated as dividends to the U.S. parent. Some profits are reinvested permanently, escaping taxation. Credits from higher-tax countries can offset U.S. tax liability from low-tax countries, resulting in a low effective tax rate. Relief at the corporate level, rather than the shareholder level, is suggested, raising questions on how to treat foreign source income under integration approaches. One objective of corporate tax integration is to reduce distortions caused by current tax treatment. Effective tax rates on new investments are estimated for equity-financed, debt-financed, and combined finance investments. The discussion also covers incentives for retaining earnings and delaying capital gains realizations. Table 1 provides estimates of effective tax rates on equity investments through corporate and noncorporate investment. The effective tax rates on new domestic investments in equipment, structures, and intangible assets reflect the share of profits collected. There are two measures of the effective tax rate for corporate investments: the firm-level rate and the total corporate tax rate. The firm-level rates are relevant for multinational corporations deciding where to locate investments. The statutory rate of 35% is reduced by tax preferences. The treatment of tax preferences is crucial in corporate tax integration plans, as they reduce the statutory rate of 35%. Provisions like accelerated cost recovery, production activities deductions, and research tax credits result in an effective tax rate of 20% in the corporate sector. Different investments have varying tax rates, with intangible investments in research and development benefiting the most from expensing and R&D credits. Branding and workforce training investments have a zero tax rate due to expensing eligibility. Including temporary bonus depreciation would lower the firm-level corporate tax rate for equipment to 13.4% and for public utilities to 14.2%, reducing the overall tax rate to 14.6%. Bonus depreciation is more important for the corporate sector than the noncorporate sector. The tax rates do not reflect the Section 179 expensing provision for equipment, which has dollar caps and phase-outs. The tax rates for corporations reflect domestic investment, with foreign source income likely taxed at a lower rate. Studies show U.S. firms abroad paid an average tax of 17.4%, with 21.7% of total corporate profits coming from earnings abroad. Adjustments can be made considering that foreign firms hold 79% of portfolio holdings, indicating 21.2% of total earnings are from foreign source income. The tax rates for U.S. firms on foreign source income are around 17.4%, favoring foreign over domestic investment. Most large countries have similar tax rates, possibly reflecting profits in low-tax countries. The total corporate tax rate includes taxes on shareholders and affects investment choices between equity and direct investment. The effective tax rates for corporate and noncorporate sectors are similar due to the favorably treated assets like intangibles. Table 2 shows negative tax rates for most cases, subsidizing income rather than taxing it. The CBO study estimated negative tax rates for owner-occupied housing at -3%. Large negative tax rates can be difficult to interpret, especially for debt-financed or R&D investments, as taxes cause the pretax return to vary. Tax subsidies can become very large, approaching infinity as the pretax return approaches zero. The tax wedge is a way to measure the effect of taxes on after-tax returns, with the tax system increasing the required return in the equity case but reducing it in the debt case. Negative tax rates can lead to significant distortions in investment returns, with tax wedges providing better insight into the magnitude of these distortions. For example, research investments face large negative tax rates, significantly lowering returns. Returns from investment are significantly reduced by the tax system, with a nearly 40% decrease for equity and close to 90% for debt. The tax rates for firm-level investments highlight how debt is subsidized, mainly through deducting the nominal interest rate instead of the real interest rate. Without these elements, the tax rate on debt-financed investment would be zero. Additionally, debt-financed noncorporate investment is taxed at a higher rate than debt-financed corporate investment. Debt-financed noncorporate investment is taxed at a higher rate than debt-financed corporate investment, with corporate debt-financed investment receiving a larger subsidy. The tax wedges are -31% for the corporate sector and -17% for the noncorporate sector. The difference is partly due to the mix of assets and the firm's statutory tax rate. Overall, corporations are more heavily taxed on equity investment but more favored in debt finance. The overall effective tax rates are higher for structures and equipment in the corporate sector compared to the noncorporate sector due to the corporate debt advantage offsetting the penalty for equity. Tax preferences for intangible investments result in lower overall tax rates in the corporate sector. The classic method of taxing corporate income creates an incentive to retain earnings, although tax rates on dividends and capital gains are now set at the same levels. Favorable treatment of capital gains still exists. Favorable treatment of capital gains still exists, with taxes not due until gains are recognized. Estimates suggest about half of gains are never taxed, resulting in an average tax rate of around 7.5%. Foreign investors pay a 6% withholding tax rate on dividends with no tax on capital gains. About half of corporate stock is owned by tax-exempt investors. The classical system of taxation creates distortions in corporate stock ownership and capital gains realization. Tax-exempt investors own half of corporate stock, reducing overall tax rates. Capital gains are not taxed until stock is sold, leading to a lack of incentive to realize gains. Taxing corporations as pass-throughs would tax gains as they accrue, but over half of gains are realized by tax-exempt entities. The magnitude of this effect depends on the responsiveness of realizations to the tax rate. The analysis reveals variations in capital gains realization responses, with about half of gains realized despite taxes and trading costs. Shareholder capital gains on corporate stock represent a third or less of total gains, and integrating plans may only partially address the distortion from taxing gains on a realization basis. Tax differences exist between investment in corporate and noncorporate sectors, but the aggregate tax burdens may be similar depending on assumptions. Effective tax rates show wider differentials between asset types than sectors, with significant gaps between debt and equity taxes. Payout ratios are expected to be minimally affected. The effects of taxes on debt and equity on payout ratios are expected to be small due to equal tax rates on dividends and capital gains. Various approaches to reducing corporate tax distortions include full integration, partial integration focusing on dividends, and proposals addressing interest treatment. These approaches differ in relief provision, administrative challenges, treatment of tax-exempt and foreign shareholders, preferences, and revenue implications. In the analysis of revenue and efficiency effects, it is assumed that the tax treatment of U.S. shareholders of foreign firms remains unchanged. Full integration would eliminate one level of taxation and apply to dividends and retained earnings. Different approaches include taxing only at the shareholder level and simplifying tax laws by eliminating taxes on shares of foreign stock. The most comparable treatment to partnership taxation would be to impute corporate earnings to shareholders in the same way as a partnership treatment. Shareholders would pay taxes on dividends and any retained earnings, increasing their stock basis. Losses would be passed through to offset other income, subject to current law restrictions on passive loss deductions. The current law restricts passive loss deductions. Tax preferences are passed through to shareholders, who would receive credits. Nonprofits would not pay tax, leading to significant revenue loss. Foreign shareholders would file tax returns and pay income taxes. Foreign parents of U.S. subsidiaries would also pay income tax. Individuals could have tax liability exceeding income due to retained earnings. The 1992 Treasury study proposed a system to address administrative and policy issues with the partnership approach. It suggested reporting aggregate income to simplify tax filing, but losses would not be passed through. Taxpayers would only need to report corporate income as an aggregate amount on their tax return. The Treasury prototype simplifies tax filing by reporting aggregate income on the tax return, withholding corporate tax due, and providing it as a credit to shareholders. This credit is nonrefundable to tax-exempt shareholders and refundable only by treaty agreement to foreign shareholders. The basis of stocks is increased by the income allocated minus the corporate tax credited and the dividend, reflecting the after-tax earnings retained by corporations. The Treasury prototype simplifies tax filing by reporting aggregate income on the tax return, withholding corporate tax due, and providing it as a credit to shareholders. This credit is nonrefundable to tax-exempt shareholders and refundable only by treaty agreement to foreign shareholders. The treatment would establish a shareholder level tax on taxable individuals and a corporate level tax on tax-exempt investors, with some foreign shareholders paying little to no U.S. tax. There would still be a revenue loss due to taxable shareholders paying less tax than before, and foreign shareholders benefiting from refundable credits by treaty. The Treasury prototype simplifies tax filing by reporting aggregate income on the tax return, withholding corporate tax due, and providing it as a credit to shareholders. This credit is nonrefundable to tax-exempt shareholders and refundable only by treaty agreement to foreign shareholders. The treatment would establish a shareholder level tax on taxable individuals and a corporate level tax on tax-exempt investors, with some foreign shareholders paying little to no U.S. tax. There would still be a revenue loss due to taxable shareholders paying less tax than before, and foreign shareholders benefiting from refundable credits by treaty. The shareholder would benefit from the timing based on taxable income, with some gain realized when stock is sold if economic profits exceed taxable income. Exclusions under the prototype would be automatically excluded, increasing the basis in the stock by the amount of the exclusion so it would never be taxed. Credits would be allowed directly but would not increase the basis of the stock, resulting in taxable capital gains income. The average effective corporate withholding rate in this example is slightly over 19%. If $20 is distributed, the stock's value should rise by $85. Under the prototype, the shareholder would receive an allocation of $100 and a credit of $35, paying a tax of $30. The shareholder would be left with $25 in cash. The shareholders' basis would increase by $55. If the shareholder were to sell the stock, the capital gain would be $30. The integration of deferred income and credits in stock basis adjustment can be complex. One approach is to increase the basis for the credit and exclusion, leaving a gain tax only on the deferred income. Another option is to tax dividends and capital gains at ordinary rates, marking the stock value to market. This would eliminate preferences and increase the stock basis for the future. The proposal to eliminate preferences in publicly traded firms and provide pass-through treatment to privately traded firms has been suggested by academics like Joseph M. Dodge, Eric Toder, and Alan Viard. Dodge acknowledges that private firms may still benefit from tax preferences, but they tend to benefit less than public firms due to similarities in asset distribution. In an example, a shareholder would receive a $20 dividend, causing the stock market to rise by $110. The proposed tax system would eliminate preferences for publicly traded firms, relying on the market to determine income. Some subsidies, like those for research, could still be granted through direct subsidies or refundable credits. The system would retain subsidies for privately traded firms. Key issues include the failure to tax tax-exempt shareholders and the imposition of tax on gains. The proposed tax system aims to eliminate preferences for publicly traded firms and relies on the market to determine income. One option to address the issue of failure to tax tax-exempt shareholders is to impose a tax on their income. Alternatively, shareholders could sell shares or a modification could tax capital gains only upon realization with an interest charge to offset deferral benefits. The proposal suggests applying the interest charge regime to all capital gains and keeping a 15% corporate tax. An alternative approach is to impose a corporate level tax and eliminate taxes on dividends and capital gains from corporate stock, which would simplify the tax system but may reduce revenue. The major concern is that reducing the firm level tax could impact investment allocation for multinational firms. The final integration proposal aims to reduce the incentive to invest in low tax jurisdictions abroad by taxing dividends to shareholders with a corporate dividend deduction and eliminating capital gains on corporate stock. Revenue loss from tax exempt shareholders could be addressed with a nonrefundable corporate withholding tax. This proposal removes the double tax on corporate income for dividends, avoiding imperfections in assigning all corporate income to shareholders or taxing gains on an accrual basis. The principal alternatives for taxing dividends to shareholders include taxing at the firm level or individual level. Different approaches such as dividend relief, imputation credit, and dividend deduction with withholding tax and credit aim to achieve similar results in terms of tax treatment. The Senate Finance Committee is considering a dividend deduction approach to eliminate double taxation on dividends. However, this approach may lead to revenue loss, tax exemptions for certain investors, and a shift towards dividend payments over retaining earnings. The Senate Finance Committee is exploring a dividend deduction system to address double taxation on dividends. This system, similar to imputation credit systems used in other countries, aims to withhold taxes at the corporate level. Key issues include the treatment of tax-exempt and foreign investors, as well as the pass-through of preferences. Australia's pension system taxes dividends, limiting credits to taxable income. The difference between a credit for corporate taxes paid and a withholding tax with credit is mainly in name only. One approach enacts credits for shareholders, while the other provides a dividend deduction but imposes a withholding tax at the corporate rate. Issues such as treatment of preferences and refundable credits impact dividend relief approaches. Pass-through of preferences is restricted if all dividend credits must reflect income subject to U.S. tax. Two methods to achieve this are the credit limitation and compensatory tax. Shareholders may receive only partial credits if dividends exceed income subject to U.S. tax under the credit limitation approach. The compensatory tax method involves an additional corporate-level withholding tax on dividends paid from untaxed income. Current dividends may exceed income subject to U.S. tax, with about half of U.S. multinational firms' worldwide income falling into this category. Foreign source income with foreign taxes offset by the foreign tax credit is not passed through. Foreign source income with foreign taxes offset by the foreign tax credit would be considered nontaxed income, leading to disallowed dividend credits. The interaction of these provisions with tax-exempt and foreign shareholders could result in increased burdens, especially if tax credits are not refundable to these shareholders. A compensatory tax on dividends exceeding taxable income could further complicate the tax implications for shareholders. Additionally, discussions include the possibility of a dividend reinvestment plan (DRIP) where firms issue deemed dividends that are reinvested in the company. The discussion includes the possibility of a dividend reinvestment plan where firms issue deemed dividends that increase the stock basis. This treatment benefits firms paying cash dividends less than U.S. tax income, with a stacking order for dividends paid out of taxable income. Nonrefundable credits, especially for foreign shareholders, may lessen the issue. There are differences between shareholder imputation credit and dividend deduction methods noted by analysts. Professor Edward Kleinbard discusses how book accounting treats withholding tax differently from corporate tax, potentially increasing earnings and profits. Alvin Warren's analysis highlights the differences between reporting dividends net of corporate tax in an imputation credit approach versus gross of tax in a dividend deduction or withholding tax approach. These approaches can impact individual and corporate tax liabilities, despite no economic difference. The firm-level tax approach could affect the distribution of dividends. The firm-level tax approach proposes excluding dividends from shareholders' income, subjecting only corporate tax. This proposal was recommended in a 1992 Treasury study and considered in the Bush Administration in 2003. Integration proposals have also included debt, such as the CBIT and dividend deduction proposals. The 1992 CBIT proposal suggested taxing only at the firm level, disallowing interest deductions, and eliminating dividend and interest taxes at the shareholder or creditor level. It also addressed preferences by imposing a compensatory tax if interest and dividends exceeded taxed income, with options for capital gains treatment at the shareholder level. This plan aimed to impose a single corporate-level tax on earnings from both debt and equity, extending to noncorporate businesses as well. The 1992 CBIT proposal aimed to tax only at the firm level, disallowing interest deductions and eliminating dividend and interest taxes at the shareholder or creditor level. It proposed compensatory taxes if interest and dividends exceeded taxable income, increasing the tax burden on debt. The proposal also suggested treating interest in the same way as dividends, with a withholding tax and nonrefundable credits. This feature may be included in the Senate Finance Committee integration proposal. The 1992 CBIT proposal aimed to tax only at the firm level, disallowing interest deductions and eliminating dividend and interest taxes at the shareholder or creditor level. It addressed financial intermediaries like banks by excluding interest income and disallowing interest deductions. The Treasury relied on firms to substitute loan fees for interest to avoid continual losses for tax purposes. Revenue impacts are an important consideration in any tax reform proposal. The curr_chunk examines revenue estimates for various tax proposals, including full integration options, partial integration options, and restrictions on debt. Estimates are approximations to determine feasibility. The first step is to estimate current revenues as a base for comparison. The curr_chunk discusses estimating the average tax rate for different segments of the corporate tax base, including domestic investment by U.S. firms and foreign source income. The corporate-level tax rate for domestic investment is estimated at 27%, while foreign source income pays a 3.3% U.S. tax and 14.1% foreign tax. The average tax rate for U.S. firms, including both domestic and foreign income, is 24.9%, with U.S. tax on worldwide income at 21.9%. The U.S. corporate level tax rate is 22.7%, with additional shareholder taxes depending on the distribution among shareholders. The ownership of U.S. firm shares is divided among taxable individuals (25%), tax-exempts (50%), and foreign shareholders (25%). Individual and foreign shareholders each hold 20.8% of all shares, while foreign parents of U.S. subsidiaries own 16.7%. Tax-exempt investors own 50% of U.S. shares. The total tax rate is 25.7%, including additional shareholder taxes. Effective tax rates and revenue reductions for different options are detailed in Table 4. The marginal tax rate for taxable shareholders is estimated at 28%, adjusted from CBO's initial rate of 32.3% to reflect a weighted average of dividends and retained earnings. If refundable credits for corporate tax were allowed, effective tax rates would be calculated based on individual rates multiplied by the firm's effective tax rate. The effective tax rates for different types of shareholders are calculated based on the firm's effective tax rate, foreign tax credit, and individual rates. The overall rate is determined to be 2.5%, showing the challenges of full partnership taxation of corporate source income. The effective tax rate for different types of shareholders is 22.6%, with a 14% reduction in corporate revenues. The mark-to-market option reflects the shareholder's tax rate, which is 28% for individual shareholders and 3.4% for foreign owners. The effective tax rate for different types of shareholders is 22.6%, with a 14% reduction in corporate revenues. The mark-to-market option reflects the shareholder's tax rate, which is 28% for individual shareholders and 3.4% for foreign owners. The base would be reduced by 3.1% foreign taxes paid for U.S. firms. Stock that is not publicly traded is taxed on a flow through basis, resulting in a lower tax rate and larger revenue loss. U.S. subsidiaries of foreign firms are also not publicly traded. The effective tax rate is 6.5% with an 85% reduction in revenue. Mark to market and economic income reflected in the base would be larger without the deduction of the inflation portion of the interest rate. The mark-to-market option would increase the tax rate to 7.5%, resulting in a 71% reduction in revenues. Alternatively, imposing a 35% unrelated business income tax on tax-exempt firms would lead to a 6% loss in revenue. Imposing a tax at the corporate level only would result in a 13% revenue loss. The final full integration option involves taxing dividends at the shareholder level and exempting capital gains. The cost of dividend relief plans varies depending on the rules regarding treatment of preferences and the inclusion of dividend reinvestment plans (DRIPs). Firms are assumed to distribute dividends up to the amount needed to cover the tax, with some cases having sufficient tax already paid to cover the dividends. The cost of dividend relief plans varies depending on the rules regarding treatment of preferences and the inclusion of dividend reinvestment plans (DRIPs). For U.S. firms, the effective tax rate is 21.9%, equivalent to a 35% tax applying to 62% of income. Under a dividend relief proposal, the cash dividend paid will be grossed up for tax purposes. The taxable dividend would be 0.62 (0.77 for a U.S. subsidiary of a foreign firm) with a cash dividend similar to the current payment. The remaining cash retained by the firm would be 34.8% instead of 32.3%. The tax on income net of foreign taxes paid would be offset by refundable dividend relief. Individual shareholders would pay taxes on dividends at a rate of 19.8%. Foreign shareholders of U.S. firms would face a tax rate of 5.8%. The tax rate on dividends would be 5.8%, with an 88% reduction in corporate tax rate. There would be no double taxation from capital gains tax, resulting in a 23.6% effective tax rate and a 10% revenue loss. Eliminating the capital gains tax would have a similar effect due to tax-exempt and foreign shareholders not paying capital gains taxes. Assuming a dividend exclusion allowed only for income subject to U.S. tax, with a DRIP, individual investors would pay tax on half of capital gains, while no other shareholders would pay tax. Corporate tax would still apply. The effective tax rate is 24.0% with an 8% revenue loss. Dividend relief plans with DRIPs should eliminate residual corporate tax, avoiding double taxation. Eliminating capital gains tax on corporate stock would reduce tax rates by 1.8 percentage points and 7% of corporate revenues. This would benefit tax-exempt and foreign shareholders who do not pay capital gains taxes. If corporate reform is to be revenue neutral, certain proposals would result in significant revenue losses that cannot be recouped within the corporate tax system. These include full integration proposals like shareholder allocation with a withholding tax and refundable credits, as well as the taxation of dividends and gains marked to market. Other proposals may recoup revenues through limiting interest deductions or reducing preferences, but the mark-to-market proposal would result in total revenue loss. The mark-to-market proposal for corporate tax reform could see a significant reduction in revenue loss by imposing a direct tax on tax-exempt shareholders. This could be done at a rate of 35% or 22%, resulting in different effective tax rates and revenue losses. Excluding U.S. subsidiaries of foreign firms from the system, along with taxing tax-exempt investors, could be a potential option to mitigate revenue loss. The proposal includes imposing a 22% tax on tax-exempt investors, leading to a 22.3% tax rate and a 13% revenue loss. Increasing withholding taxes on foreign holders of U.S. stocks may be challenging due to treaty implications. The mark-to-market proposal involves taxing foreign stock owned by U.S. residents, potentially increasing revenue by 15.7%. The proposal suggests distributing revenue based on U.S. ownership of U.S. firms' stock, with one-third going to individuals and two-thirds to tax-exempt entities. A 15.7% increase could achieve revenue neutrality. Retaining a small corporate tax rate allows some tax to be imposed at the shareholder level. However, complications arise when considering disallowing deductions for debt in an integration proposal. Financial firms may require special treatment due to their role as intermediaries for corporate and other borrowing. Nonfinancial firms may also need to be considered as creditors. The difficulty in estimating revenue effects from tax rate data arises from the various sources of interest receipts and deductions, including NIPA and IRS data. Excluding certain sectors, the revenue gain from disallowing net interest deductions is significant, especially in recent years marked by lower corporate tax revenues and abnormally low interest rates. The NIPA and IRS data show that disallowing deductions for debt in combination with a corporate-level tax could result in a reduction in gains for individual shareholders. This reduction could be around 13% if only corporate taxes are considered, and 6% if a shareholder allocation or dividend deduction system is implemented. Disallowing deductions for debt at the corporate level or implementing a partial interest deduction could help close the revenue gap and reduce favoritism between debt and equity. Simplifying tax administration by taxing only at the corporate level or through a dividend exclusion would also be beneficial. However, shareholder allocation and dividend deduction proposals may increase compliance burden. Eliminating taxes on capital gains could further simplify the tax system. The mark-to-market approach may reduce compliance costs by eliminating the need to calculate corporate tax liability and deductions. However, for multinational firms, transfer pricing disputes must still be addressed. Simplifying taxes at the shareholder level could make dividends and gains on stock easier to manage. The mark-to-market approach simplifies taxes at the shareholder level by eliminating the need for special treatment of dividends and gains on stock. However, it may create a cash flow issue as income tax is assessed on unrealized income. Shareholders could sell stock to pay the tax, or firms may pay additional dividends to help finance tax payments. The proposal may also result in additional complexity for financial matters. The proposal to disallow interest deductions would add complexity for financial institutions and intermediaries like banks and mutual funds. Corporate tax integration aims to reduce distortions in investment choices and allocation caused by tax preferences. International tax concerns have expanded economic objectives to include disincentives to invest in the United States. The discussion on corporate tax reform has expanded to include issues such as shifting profits to low-tax jurisdictions and inverting with foreign firms. The main focus is on reducing distortions in investment choices caused by tax preferences, particularly favoring the noncorporate sector. The discussion on corporate tax reform has expanded to include reducing distortions in investment choices caused by tax preferences, particularly favoring the noncorporate sector. Allocation across types of investments, especially between tangible and intangible assets, appears to be more significant than the choice across sectors. The noncorporate sector is disfavored when the treatment of debt is taken into account. Significantly lowering or eliminating corporate taxes may not be efficient. Significantly lowering or eliminating corporate taxes may not be efficient as it would result in very low tax rates. Converting the corporate tax to a partnership basis could reverse distortions, with corporate profits on domestic investment taxed at 3.3%. Current rates are 22.4%, with rates on tangible investments ranging from 26.1% to 33%. This shift would bring tax rates on different assets closer together within the corporate sector. The proposal aims to create uniform tax rates across assets within the corporate sector, favoring corporate investment overall and fixed assets, while disadvantaging intangible assets. The mark-to-market proposal would impose statutory tax rates on economic income at the shareholder level, with rates of 7.85% for basic assumptions and 18.4% for CBO assumptions. The proposal suggests various options to reduce tax rates in the corporate sector, such as shareholder allocation or dividend deductions. These options aim to maintain the existing corporate tax system while slightly lowering tax rates. Effective tax rates range from 13.6% to 14.7%, narrowing inter-sectoral differences for fixed assets. The proposal aims to slightly narrow inter-sectoral differences for fixed assets by implementing options like shareholder allocation or dividend deductions in the corporate sector. This could lead to a system favoring the corporate sector overall and potentially narrowing differences across assets. There is a suggestion to address revenue loss by imposing taxes on tax-exempt firms at the shareholder level and possibly on foreign portfolio investors, excluding U.S. subsidiaries of foreign firms, to achieve uniform treatment across corporate assets and possibly narrow the sectoral gap.

There is a suggestion to address revenue loss by imposing taxes on tax-exempt firms at the shareholder level and possibly on foreign portfolio investors, excluding U.S. subsidiaries of foreign firms, to achieve uniform treatment across corporate assets and possibly narrow the sectoral gap. Limited scope for narrowing differentials across sectors is suggested due to small present differentials. Distortions between debt and equity finance are significant, with equity subject to a combined tax of around 23%, whereas the effective tax rate for debt is a subsidy. Imposing a withholding tax on interest paid in concert with a full or partial integration proposal could put debt finance more closely on par with equity finance, potentially achieving efficiency gains. The current tax rules favor retaining earnings over capital gains taxes. Full integration proposals aim to achieve neutrality between retained earnings and capital gains. A dividend deduction plan and a DRIP could help achieve neutrality for firms with desired dividends less than fully taxed income. If desired dividends exceed the limit eligible for relief, the distortion would depend on the tax. The distortion in favoring retained earnings over payouts would depend on the tax rates imposed on dividends and capital gains. Different tax rate scenarios could either increase or reverse the distortion. Full integration proposals aim to eliminate the distortion for corporate stocks by largely taxing regardless of realization.

Full integration proposals aim to eliminate this distortion by taxing corporate stocks regardless of realization. In the international context, it is important to distinguish between growth, efficiency, and optimality. In an open economy, lower tax rates can attract capital to the United States, leading to domestic growth. However, this growth may not significantly impact national income as it is influenced by factors such as foreign investments. Efficiency is about maximizing welfare, and capital movements can affect returns to labor and capital but may have a minimal effect on overall national income. Efficiency in an open economy means maximizing worldwide income, with different policies needed to maximize U.S. welfare. Outbound investments should be taxed at a higher rate than domestic income to account for the influence of the U.S. economy on world rates. For inbound investment, the tax rate should be around 30% to account for capital inflows from abroad. A zero rate would not be optimal as it would lead to a decline in U.S. income. U.S. tax at the corporate level is higher than the overall tax rate on foreign source income due to profit shifting to tax-haven countries with low tax rates. Profit shifting to tax-haven countries with low tax rates is a significant issue, with most profits likely due to paper profits. Lowering corporate tax rates may not lead to a more efficient worldwide income allocation and could potentially encourage excessive capital to locate in the United States. A zero tax rate could be optimal for outbound investment, as it is equivalent to allowing a deduction for foreign taxes. A zero tax rate could be optimal for outbound investment, equivalent to allowing a deduction for foreign taxes paid. However, it would not be optimal for inbound investment. Modest reductions in shareholder allocation or dividend deductions with nonrefundable credits would likely achieve efficiency gains. Other proposals like refundable dividend deduction plans may not have a significant effect. The mark-to-market plan, if designed to yield adequate revenue, could potentially increase efficiency and optimality by imposing higher tax rates. Excluding U.S. subsidiaries of foreign parents in this plan would lead to a more optimal outcome for inbound capital. The current corporate tax system incentivizes holding earnings abroad, leading to inefficient investment and lost revenues. Lowering the tax barrier to repatriation could be achieved by combining different tax mechanisms. The tax barrier to repatriation could be lowered with combined corporate and individual tax rate reductions. Proposals for shareholder allocations or dividend deductions may only benefit a quarter of shareholders with limited reductions. Refundable allocation and dividend proposals result in significant revenue losses. Disallowing interest deductions and preferences could offset some revenue loss and lead to significant tax-rate reductions. The mark-to-market approach would eliminate the repatriation tax by removing the corporate tax. The mark-to-market approach eliminates the repatriation tax by removing the corporate tax, allowing earnings from abroad to be repatriated without consequences. International concerns include reducing profit shifting through transfer pricing of intangibles and leveraging. Transfer pricing accounts for 72% of profit shifting. Reducing the statutory tax rate will also reduce profit shifting. The mark-to-market approach, if modified to generate sufficient revenue, would globally tax shareholders of U.S. firms, eliminating profit shifting incentives. Ending interest deductions for corporations would also prevent transfer pricing by keeping debt within the United States, impacting U.S. multinational firms. Recent proposed Treasury and IRS regulations under Section 385 of the Internal Revenue Code aim to reclassify certain debt between related parties as equity, addressing concerns for U.S. multinational firms and foreign firms of U.S. subsidiaries. Corporate inversions, where U.S. firms acquire smaller foreign firms to shift debt into the United States and access unrepatriated income, have been motivated by the desire to move to a territorial tax system and make profit shifting abroad more attractive. The attractiveness of inversions stems from profit shifting and real investment abroad being more attractive due to regulations issued in 2015 and 2016. Lowering the tax rate under dividend deduction and allocation might reduce the attraction of inversions, but plans disallowing interest deductions and implementing mark-to-market would eliminate incentives to invert. Integration proposals were examined for revenue adequacy, administrative feasibility, and economic efficiency gains. Some proposals to address revenue gaps and reduce profit shifting include disallowing interest deductions and implementing mark-to-market. Shareholder allocation plans and dividend deductions with refundable credits could be made revenue-neutral by disallowing interest deductions and eliminating tax preferences. Nonrefundable credits could achieve revenue neutrality with additional changes and potentially lower corporate rates. The curr_chunk discusses the potential benefits of addressing revenue gaps by tackling the debt-equity distortion in the corporate sector. It also mentions how this distortion exists in the noncorporate sector but to a lesser extent. The major limitation is the administrative difficulty in providing exclusions for interest income on the creditor's side. The curr_chunk discusses potential approaches to address revenue gaps by considering limited options like disallowing inflation portion of interest deduction or partial disallowance. The mark-to-market proposal aims to tax global economic income to eliminate distortions, but may face political challenges. It suggests imposing taxes on foreign shareholders of U.S. firms to maintain a neutral burden. The mark-to-market proposal faces a major issue with taxation of income on stocks not sold, reflecting capital gains without realization."
