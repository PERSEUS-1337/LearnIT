    "content": "The \"Entrepreneurship Promotion Act of 1994\" allows for the rollover of gains from the sale of eligible small business stock into other eligible small business stock under section 1045 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The sale of eligible small business stock allows for nonrecognition of gain, with certain conditions. This section does not apply to gains treated as ordinary income. Eligible small business stock is defined as stock in a C corporation, subject to specific criteria. The tax code allows for nonrecognition of gain on the sale of eligible small business stock in a C corporation, under certain conditions. The corporation must meet active business requirements and be a C corporation for the taxpayer's holding period. The tax code provides a special rule for stock issued by S corporations in the case of eligible small businesses. Stock that was not initially eligible solely because the corporation was an S corporation can still qualify under certain conditions. Additionally, rules similar to section 1202(c)(3) apply to certain purchases of a corporation's own stock for this purpose. For tax purposes, an eligible small business is defined as a domestic C corporation with annual gross receipts not exceeding $20,000,000. To meet the active business requirement, at least 80% of the corporation's assets must be used in active trades or businesses, and the corporation must be eligible as defined in section 1202(e)(4). For tax purposes, an eligible small business is defined as a domestic C corporation with annual gross receipts not exceeding $20,000,000. The basis adjustments for gain from any sale of eligible small business stock purchased by the taxpayer during the 18-month period described in subsection (a) shall be applied to reduce the basis for determining gain or loss. The statute of limitations for assessing any deficiency with respect to such gain shall not expire before 3 years from the date the Secretary is notified by the taxpayer. The taxpayer must notify the Secretary of their cost of purchasing eligible small business stock, intention not to purchase within the reinvestment period, or failure to make the purchase within the period. A deficiency may be assessed within 3 years of notification, regardless of any law preventing such assessment. Amendments are made to include sections 1045 in the Code. Amendments are made to include section 1045(e) in the Code. The amendments made by section 1045 allow for the rollover of gain from the sale of eligible small business stock into other eligible small business stock. This applies to sales on and after the enactment date of the Act, in taxable years ending on and after such date."
