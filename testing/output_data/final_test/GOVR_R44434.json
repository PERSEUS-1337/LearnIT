    "content": "This report compares H.R. 2576, the TSCA Modernization Act of 2015, with S.Amdt. 2932, the Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act. Both bills amend Title I of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), with the Senate amendment also amending the Mercury Export Ban Act of 2008 and adding a provision to the Public Health Service Act regarding potential cancer clusters. In 1976, President Ford signed the Toxic Substances Control Act, allowing the EPA to regulate chemicals posing risks to health or the environment. Congress has since added titles and amendments to address specific chemical concerns. The report compares H.R. 2576 and S.Amdt. 2932, which both amend TSCA. The final section includes a comparison of existing law, the House bill, and the Senate amendment. Title I of TSCA requires EPA to maintain the TSCA Chemical Substance Inventory, which includes over 62,000 chemical substances. EPA distinguishes between existing chemical substances on the inventory and new chemical substances not listed. EPA has added over 23,000 new chemical substances to the inventory since its initial compilation. The EPA has added over 23,000 new chemical substances to the TSCA inventory, making them existing chemical substances under the statute. The agency evaluates risks throughout the commercial life-cycle of chemicals and has regulatory options under TSCA Section 6 to address unreasonable risks. EPA has regulated only a few chemicals under this section, including chlorofluorocarbons, nitrosamines, and hexavalent chromium. The EPA has taken actions under various authorities in the statute, including evaluating chemical risks, collecting information on chemicals, and promulgating rules for new chemical substances. Members of Congress have introduced bills to revise the chemical evaluation process, sparking debate on potential amendments. The bills sparked debate on amending the evaluation process, regulatory criteria, and other elements of the law under TSCA. The House bill would make changes to EPA's authority to require testing of chemicals, evaluate risks, regulate chemicals, and collect fees. The Senate amendment would also make similar changes, including reviewing new chemical substances and recordkeeping. The debate to amend Title I of TSCA focuses on issues such as prioritization of existing chemical substances for risk evaluation, regulatory criteria for restricting chemicals, options available to EPA for regulation, development of new information, preemption of state laws, disclosure of information to EPA, and resources for EPA administration. EPA has discretion over which chemicals to evaluate for risks, with limited resources to assess over 85,000 substances listed on the TSCA inventory. In 2012, EPA prioritized 90 substances for evaluation based on hazard, exposure, and bioaccumulation potential. EPA prioritized 90 substances for risk evaluation, assessing five with three found to present risks. TSCA Section 5 requires manufacturers to submit a premanufacture notice (PMN) for new chemical substances. EPA has received over 39,000 PMNs and taken regulatory action on approximately 10%. The EPA has taken regulatory action on approximately 10% of the PMNs submitted. Both the House bill and the Senate amendment would establish a process for EPA to prioritize existing chemical substances for evaluation. The Senate amendment would also amend TSCA Section 5 for the evaluation of new chemical substances. In order for EPA to restrict a chemical under TSCA, it must first determine that the chemical presents an unreasonable risk to human health or the environment. The existing regulatory threshold for restricting a chemical in TSCA is debated due to the difficulty for EPA to demonstrate unreasonable risks. The \"unreasonable risk\" standard in TSCA is interpreted as a multi-factor balancing test, but lacks a clear definition. Clarifying the criteria and factors for determining regulatory control of certain chemicals is a recurring concern in the TSCA debate. The Fifth Circuit ruled that EPA's asbestos ban did not consider costs adequately under the \"unreasonable risk\" standard of TSCA. Regulation of a chemical under TSCA depends on hazards, exposure, costs of risk management, and benefits of chemical use. EPA has not restricted a chemical since 1991. The EPA has not restricted a chemical under TSCA since 1991. Both the House bill and the Senate amendment aim to modify the regulatory threshold for restricting chemicals by prohibiting the consideration of cost and other non-risk factors. The ultimate impact of amending the regulatory threshold on the regulation of more chemicals under TSCA would depend on implementation. EPA is directed to promulgate requirements to protect against unreasonable risks of injury to health or the environment. The EPA is directed to promulgate requirements to protect against unreasonable risks of injury to health or the environment, using the \"least burdensome requirement\" while considering costs and alternatives. Stakeholders argue that this may require lengthy analyses by the agency to determine the appropriate regulatory requirement for chemicals meeting the threshold. The EPA is required to protect against unreasonable risks using the \"least burdensome requirement,\" which may lead to regulations that are inadequately protective due to cost considerations. In Corrosion Proof Fittings v. EPA, the Fifth Circuit ruled that EPA must show each less burdensome requirement would not adequately protect against unreasonable risk to reject it in favor of a more burdensome one. The House bill and Senate amendment would amend TSCA to remove the \"least burdensome requirement\" for regulating chemicals with unreasonable risks. EPA relies on scientific information to evaluate risks and determine regulation. TSCA Section 8 allows EPA to require reporting and recordkeeping of information on chemical substances. Section 4 mandates testing if risks are unknown, and EPA has required testing for over 200 substances. Some stakeholders argue for limits on EPA's authority under TSCA. The EPA's authority under TSCA to require new information on chemical substances has been debated by stakeholders. EPA faces challenges in assessing chemical risks due to the need to prove unreasonable risk before requiring new data. Testing requirements are based on production volume and exposure likelihood. Stakeholders argue that developing new information is time-consuming and costly. Proposed legislation aims to expand EPA's authority for test data development. The proposed legislation would expand EPA's authority to require testing of chemicals to evaluate risks and determine the need for regulation under TSCA. The House bill authorizes testing if necessary, while the Senate amendment gives EPA discretion for testing related to risk evaluation. State regulations add complexity to TSCA preemption discussions. The scope of TSCA preemption under the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution gives EPA a primary role in managing chemicals while allowing states some ability to set their own requirements. States are generally preempted from managing chemical risks if EPA has taken similar action, with exceptions for certain state requirements. Exceptions to preemption allow states to co-enforce federal requirements that are identical to their own laws. States can regulate disposal, establish chemical requirements, and prohibit certain chemical uses within the state. Advocates of federal preemption argue for a uniform national regulatory framework to mitigate compliance costs and economic impacts, while opponents fear conflicting regulations and reduced economies of scale. The House bill and Senate amendment would retain TSCA preemption, allowing certain EPA actions to preempt state regulations for specific chemicals, with exceptions and waivers. Both propose aligning EPA actions with the amended regulatory framework but differ in their approaches. States can still enforce identical federal requirements and regulate disposal and chemical use within their borders. TSCA requires chemical manufacturers, processors, and distributors to submit information to EPA, including chemical structures, production volumes, and health data. Balancing public access to information with protection of competitiveness is a concern in amending TSCA. Section 14 of TSCA prohibits disclosure of trade secrets and confidential information, with exceptions. Wrongful disclosure is a criminal act. CBI protection under TSCA does not prevent disclosure. Confidential business information (CBI) protection under TSCA allows for the disclosure of health and safety studies while safeguarding manufacturing processes and proprietary compositions. EPA can designate chemical identities as CBI on the TSCA Inventory and in other situations. Exceptions in TSCA Section 14 require disclosure of CBI if necessary to protect health or the environment. EPA must notify the submitter before disclosing information if it is determined that CBI protection is not warranted. The EPA can designate information as CBI to protect confidentiality, with no substantiation required. However, recent initiatives aim to increase transparency by reviewing confidentiality claims more rigorously and encouraging voluntary withdrawal of CBI claims. Proposed legislation would expand requirements for substantiation of confidentiality claims and specify circumstances when disclosure may be necessary. The House bill and Senate amendment differ in approaches to protecting chemical identities in health and safety studies. Congress faces the decision of funding EPA's TSCA activities through discretionary appropriations or establishing dedicated funding sources. Appropriations for Title I under TSCA were authorized through FY1983, with ongoing funding decisions made by Congress. Congress has continued to fund EPA's implementation of TSCA through annual appropriations and fees on chemical manufacturers or processors. The fees are limited to $2,500 for certain actions under TSCA Section 5, with an exception for small businesses capped at $100. EPA's authority to collect fees does not have a sunset date. The EPA is authorized to assess fees for evaluating testing data submitted by chemical manufacturers under TSCA Section 4, with a maximum cap of $100. Fees collected are treated as miscellaneous receipts and deposited into the General Fund of the U.S. Treasury. The availability of these fees for EPA's use is subject to annual appropriations. Both the House bill and the Senate amendment propose changes to TSCA Section 26(b) regarding fee collection authority. The House bill and Senate amendment propose changes to TSCA Section 26(b) regarding fee collection authority. Collected fees would only be available to EPA through the discretionary appropriations process. A comparison of existing law, the House bill, and the Senate amendment is presented in Table 1, which outlines the provisions under 10 subheadings reflecting elements of TSCA. The Senate amendment proposes changes to TSCA under 10 subheadings selected by CRS, covering various elements such as definitions, advisory committees, recordkeeping, addressing risks of chemical substances, judicial review, resources for implementation, and other provisions."
