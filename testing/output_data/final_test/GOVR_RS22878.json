    "content": "In the 110th Congress, legislation was introduced regarding environmental regulatory requirements for boats. Bills such as the Clean Boating Act of 2008 and the Recreational Boating Act of 2007 were proposed. Congress passed two bills, S. 2766 and S. 3298, in response to a federal court order to revise Clean Water Act regulations exempting vessel discharges. The bills passed by Congress aimed to exempt around 13 million recreational and other vessels from new EPA rules following a federal court order. The court's ruling reversed EPA policy dating back to 1973, which excluded discharges from vessel operations from Clean Water Act permitting requirements. The district court's order revoked this exemption as of September 30, 2008, leading to EPA proposing two draft permits in response. The focus of the legal challenge was primarily on EPA's permitting exemption for ballast water discharges. The court's ruling on ballast water discharges from vessels also applied to other types of vessel discharges like graywater and bilge water. EPA would have had to implement a CWA permitting program by September 30 without legislative relief. S. 2766 and S. 3298 exempted recreational boats and some vessels. The Clean Water Act regulates pollutant discharges into surface waters. EPA delayed the court's order until December 19, 2008, and finalized a permit for vessels requiring one. The Clean Water Act prohibits the discharge of pollutants into navigable waters from any point source unless in compliance with certain sections. Biological organisms are considered pollutants, but sewage from vessels is excluded from this definition. The Clean Water Act regulates the discharge of pollutants into navigable waters from point sources. Sewage discharges from vessels are excluded from the definition of pollutants. A National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit allows lawful discharge of pollutants. Failure to obtain a permit or violating its terms can result in fines and penalties. EPA or a qualified state can issue permits for pollutant discharge under certain conditions. The EPA regulation excludes discharges incidental to vessel operation from NPDES permitting requirements, citing minimal pollution impact and reduced administrative costs. This exemption applies to all vessels, regardless of size or propulsion. In 2005, the Northern District of California found that discharges from vessels should be regulated under the CWA, revoking a regulatory exclusion in 2006. The court rejected EPA's argument that Congress had exempted vessel operations from permitting, leading to discharges being subject to CWA prohibitions after September 30, 2008. EPA proposed NPDES permits for vessel discharges following a court order, potentially affecting millions of recreational and commercial vessels in U.S. waters. Bills in Congress aimed to exempt vessels from CWA permitting requirements in response to the court's decision. Bills in Congress aimed to exempt recreational vessels from Clean Water Act permitting requirements by defining them and detailing types of discharges that would be exempt. The bills in Congress aimed to exempt recreational vessels from Clean Water Act permitting requirements by defining them as vessels primarily used for recreational purposes and detailing types of discharges that would be exempt. The bills in Congress aimed to exempt recreational vessels from Clean Water Act permitting requirements by defining them as vessels primarily used for recreational purposes. S. 2766 and H.R. 5949 would introduce management practices for controlling discharges from recreational vessels, requiring EPA to develop regulations in consultation with the Coast Guard, Department of Commerce, and states. Factors to be considered include the nature of the discharge, feasibility of management practices, legal standards, and costs. The bills proposed exempting recreational vessels from Clean Water Act permitting requirements by defining them as primarily used for recreational purposes. EPA would develop federal standards of performance for managing discharges, with input from the Coast Guard, Department of Commerce, and states. The standards would differentiate among vessel classes, types, and sizes, and could include waivers for specific circumstances. The Coast Guard would then incorporate these standards into regulations, prohibiting vessels from operating or discharging in violation. Another approach in S. 2645 and H.R. 5594 suggested giving primary responsibility for addressing vessel discharges to the Coast Guard, not EPA. The legislation proposed giving primary responsibility for addressing vessel discharges to the Coast Guard under the Nonindigenous Aquatic Nuisance Prevention and Control Act. The Coast Guard would study and report on various types of discharges, potential effects on human health and the environment, and enforce uniform national discharge standards based on the study. The legislation proposed giving primary responsibility for addressing vessel discharges to the Coast Guard under the Nonindigenous Aquatic Nuisance Prevention and Control Act. S. 2645 and H.R. 5594 would suspend permit requirements for discharges incidental to vessel operation, superseding any CWA permits issued by EPA. States would be preempted from establishing separate laws, but could prohibit discharges for environmental protection. Certain vessel discharges would be exempt from the new Coast Guard rules. The proposed legislation aimed to give primary responsibility for addressing vessel discharges to the Coast Guard under the Nonindigenous Aquatic Nuisance Prevention and Control Act. S. 2645 and H.R. 5594 would suspend permit requirements for discharges incidental to vessel operation, overriding any CWA permits issued by EPA. States would be preempted from establishing separate laws but could prohibit discharges for environmental protection. Certain vessel discharges would be exempt from the new Coast Guard rules. Additionally, S. 3298 and H.R. 6556 proposed a two-year moratorium on NPDES requirements for fishing vessels and vessels less than 79 feet in length, requiring EPA to study and report to Congress on impacts of non-recreational vessel discharges. The Senate Environment and Public Works Committee approved S. 2766, while the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee approved H.R. 5949. On July 22, 2008, Congress passed two bills regarding vessel discharge issues. S. 2766 exempted recreational boats from permit requirements and required EPA to develop management practices for non-sewage discharges. S. 3298 provided a two-year permit moratorium for fishing vessels and vessels less than 79 feet in length, requiring EPA to evaluate the impact of non-sewage discharges. EPA is to submit a report to Congress within 15 months. On June 17, EPA proposed two CWA permits in response to a court order, covering multiple facilities within a specific category for up to five years. The permits would apply nationwide, with EPA as the permitting entity. EPA believed using general permits made administrative sense due to the large number of potential sources of vessels. The EPA proposed a Recreational General Permit for vessels under 79 feet, covering 13 million domestic boats. The permit addresses discharges of toxic and conventional pollutants from various sources on boats. Recreational boat owners would need to implement management practices to reduce pollutants, with an estimated national compliance cost of $88 million. Enactment of S. 2766 eliminated the need for the Recreational General Permit, which had a maximum national compliance cost of $88 million. The Vessel General Permit (VGP) applies to commercial and large recreational vessels, covering eight categories of vessels with 28 types of waste streams. EPA estimated that 98,645 vessels would be subject to this permit, with specific monitoring and reporting requirements. Enactment of S. 3298 temporarily exempted 29,000 fishing and large recreational vessels from a permit requirement, but commercial vessels over 79 feet still need to comply. EPA finalized the VGP for 69,000 vessels unaffected by S. 2766 or S. 3298, applying to pollutant discharges from non-recreational vessels over 79 feet and ballast water discharges from smaller commercial and fishing vessels. The permit covers waters of the United States and is effective from December 19, 2008. The federal district court granted an EPA motion to delay vacatur of the existing exclusion in 40 CFR \u00a7 122.3(a) until February 6, 2009. Regulated sources need not comply with permit terms until then. The final permit identifies 26 types of waste streams from covered vessels, including pollutants like aquatic nuisance species, nutrients, pathogens, oil, grease, metals, and toxic pollutants. Best management practices will control most discharges, with specific requirements for categories like cruise ships. Monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting are required for vessels larger than 79 feet. Vessels larger than 79 feet or more than 300 gross tons are required to submit a Notice of Intent by September 19, 2009, to be covered by the permit. Smaller vessels are automatically covered with no permit fees. Compliance costs range from $8.9 million to $23.0 million annually, depending on vessel populations and incremental costs."
