    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Puget Sound Regional Shellfish Settlement Act of 2006\" and its purpose is outlined in the findings. Congress finds that the Tribes have established treaty rights to take shellfish from public and private tidelands in Washington State, including lands owned, leased, or subject to harvest by commercial shellfish Growers. The district court found that Growers were innocent purchasers without notice of the Tribes' fishing rights. Numerous unresolved issues remain regarding the implementation of the Tribes' treaty rights to take shellfish from Growers' lands. The Tribes, Growers, State of Washington, and the United States Department of the Interior have resolved these issues. The United States Department of the Interior has resolved disputes regarding the Tribes' treaty right to take shellfish from covered tidelands owned or leased by Growers. The Settlement Agreement does not address potential claims from \"Other Tribes\" to take shellfish from Growers' lands in the future, which could lead to uncertainty and legal battles. The Settlement Agreement resolves disputes over the Tribes' treaty right to take shellfish from Growers' tidelands. The Act aims to extend the same option to \"Other Tribes\" to resolve any claims to shellfish from Growers' lands. The Settlement Agreement aims to resolve disputes over shellfish harvesting rights between shellfish growers, the State of Washington, and the United States. It also seeks to provide Other Tribes with a fair resolution for any potential claims to shellfish from designated tidelands and authorizes the Secretary to implement the terms of the agreement and the Act. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, the term \"Fund\" refers to the Puget Sound Shellfish Settlement Trust Fund Account. The term \"Growers\" includes specific companies and individuals involved in shellfish cultivation. The term \"Other Tribes\" pertains to federally recognized Indian nations or tribes not defined in the Act, who establish treaty rights to take shellfish from specified tidelands within 20 years. The Settlement Agreement defines tidelands owned, leased, or subject to harvest by Growers. The Secretary refers to the Secretary of the Interior. The Tribes involved in the Agreement are Tulalip, Stillaguamish, Sauk Suiattle, and Puyallup. The Agreement includes multiple tribes such as Tulalip, Stillaguamish, Sauk Suiattle, Puyallup, Squaxin Island, Makah, Muckleshoot, Upper Skagit, Nooksack, Nisqually, Skokomish, Port Gamble S'Klallam, Lower Elwha Klallam, Jamestown S'Klallam, Suquamish, Lummi Nation, and Swinomish Indian Tribal Community. The Special Holding Account refers to the Puget Sound Shellfish Settlement Special Holding Account established by this Act. SEC. 4. Approval of Settlement Agreement, ratification, and confirmation. Authorization for Implementation by the Secretary. SEC. 5. Authorization of $23,500,000 appropriations for fiscal years 2007-2011. SEC. 6. Establishment of Fund, Special Holding Account, and Conditions. The Puget Sound Regional Shellfish Settlement Trust Fund is established with $22,000,000 to be deposited by the Secretary of the Interior. Monies will be transferred to each Tribe according to the payment agreement. Additionally, a Puget Sound Regional Shellfish Settlement Special Holding Account is created. The Puget Sound Regional Shellfish Settlement Special Holding Account is established with $1,500,000 deposited by the Secretary of the Interior in fiscal year 2011. The funds will be maintained and invested until all monies are transferred, and if a court decision confirms treaty rights for Other Tribes to harvest shellfish, the funds will be used accordingly. If Other Tribes with established treaty rights to harvest shellfish in covered tidelands opt to accept a share of the Special Holding Account instead of litigating against Growers, the Secretary will transfer the appropriate funds to compensate them. This transfer will fully satisfy the tribes' claims to shellfish on the tidelands, with the Secretary retaining necessary amounts for additional tribes. The Special Holding Account will be used to compensate tribes with shellfish harvesting rights in covered tidelands. The Secretary will transfer remaining funds to Other Tribes before closing the Account after 20 years, with no interest for the Tribes in the Account. The Secretary may keep the Account open to resolve claims from Other Tribes within the 20-year term. The tribes must notify the Secretary within the 20-year term of their interest in resolving their claim. Other Tribes have the option to agree to similar rights and responsibilities as signatories to the Settlement Agreement. Each tribe accepting a settlement must submit an annual report on expenditures from the Fund. The Secretary can take action to ensure proper use of withdrawn funds. Beginning on the date of transfer, any trust responsibility of the United States regarding the expenditure of withdrawn monies by tribes shall cease. The Secretary is not responsible for the State of Washington payment of $11,000,000 to the Tribes. Other Tribes' claims are released. As of the date of enactment of this Act, the rights of Other Tribes to take shellfish from public and private tidelands in Washington State will be determined by the decisions of the Courts of the United States. If a tribe chooses to resolve its claims to take shellfish from tidelands owned or leased by Growers, their rights will be governed by this Act and the court decisions in United States v. Washington. The failure of the United States to enforce treaty rights of Other Tribes to take shellfish from public and private tidelands in Washington State, including those owned by Growers, does not constitute a breach of trust or require compensation to Other Tribes. SEC. 9. CAUSE OF ACTION. If any payment by the United States is not made as specified in this Act or within 6 months of the Settlement Agreement date, the Tribes can sue for damages in the United States Court of Federal Claims for the unpaid amount plus interest."
