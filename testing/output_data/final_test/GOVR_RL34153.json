    "content": "The Transportation Research Board reports that school buses transport an estimated 25% of the nation's K-12 students, around 12.5 million students, resulting in 5.5 billion student trips annually. Between 1995 and 2005, there were 1,368 fatal crashes involving school transportation vehicles. Most fatalities in these crashes are not school bus occupants but occupants of other vehicles or pedestrians. Only 7% of the crashes resulted in a fatality to a school transportation vehicle occupant, with an average of 8.8 crashes and 6.7 school vehicle passenger deaths each year during that period. Between 1991 and 1999, an average of 815 school-aged children were killed each year in motor vehicle crashes during normal school travel hours. School buses were found to be the safest mode of transportation for children. Out of the 815 deaths, only five were passengers in school buses, while 15 were pedestrians killed by school buses. This means that 98% of school-aged child deaths in motor vehicle crashes during school travel hours occurred in passenger vehicles or to pedestrians, cyclists, or motorcyclists. More than half of the deaths occurred to occupants of vehicles driven by teenagers. The question of whether seat belts should be required on school buses has been of interest to Congress. The question of requiring seat belts on school buses has been a long-standing interest for Congress. Various legislative acts have directed studies on school bus safety and the use of seat belts to reduce injuries to school bus occupants. In 1998, Congress directed DOT to analyze options for improving school bus safety and contracted with the National Academy of Sciences to study safety issues. The school bus industry defines four types of buses: Type A, Type B, Type C, and Type D. Federal regulations categorize school buses into Type I and Type II based on weight ratings. Type A, B, C, and D school buses are categorized into Type I and Type II based on weight ratings. Type II buses must have seat belts, while Type I buses are not required to have them. Type C buses are the most common, representing about 57% of school bus purchases. Type D buses make up about 23% of purchases. The largest school buses have GVWRs of 24,000 pounds or more, making up about 80% of the school bus fleet. These buses provide crash protection due to their mass, reducing crash forces on occupants compared to smaller vehicles. Large school buses have energy-absorbing designs for crashes and occupants are positioned above most vehicles for protection. Ejections during crashes are rare due to compartmentalization with high-backed padded seats. NHTSA regulations prioritize passive protection over seat belts since 1976. Compartmentalization in school buses provides passive protection for passengers during crashes, especially in head-on collisions. However, it is less effective in side-collisions or roll-over accidents. The NTSB has called for improved occupant protection systems to cover various types of collisions. The NHTSA plans to propose standardized test procedures for lap/shoulder belts in school buses, increasing seat back height to reduce passenger injury risk, and requiring lap/shoulder belts in smaller buses. Studies show lap/shoulder belts provide safety benefits if used correctly, but misuse can lead to injuries. The Transportation Research Board study on school bus safety concluded that seat belts may not have significantly reduced deaths in crashes. While equipping large school buses with seat belts could potentially save one life and prevent several serious injuries annually, the study suggested that lap/shoulder belt systems might be more effective. However, the increased rigidity of seat backs to support these belts could pose a risk to unrestrained passengers. Ultimately, the study did not find enough benefit to justify a federal mandate for seat belt installation on large school buses. The NTSB and NHTSA studies explored safety options for school bus passengers. NTSB found potential for a crash protection system to retain passengers in most accidents. NHTSA's crash testing showed lap belts helped keep passengers in their seats but increased neck injury risk. The lap/shoulder belt system offers the greatest safety in large school buses, but misuse can increase the risk of injury. NHTSA estimates that universal use of seat belts could save one life annually in frontal crashes. Seat belts also show potential in reducing fatalities and injuries in non-frontal crashes. Proponents of seat belts include the American Academy of Pediatrics and the National Coalition for School Bus Safety. Proponents argue that requiring students to wear seat belts on school buses will increase safety in various types of accidents, prevent injuries from sticking body parts out of windows, improve student behavior, reduce bullying, and minimize distractions for bus drivers. They believe this measure will also promote seat belt use in other vehicles. The National Association of State Directors of Pupil Transportation Services and the National School Transportation Association caution against requiring seat belts on school buses due to concerns about cost, limited usage rates, and potential lack of safety improvement. They also worry about reduced seating capacity leading to students using more dangerous forms of transportation unless additional resources are provided. Some organizations support requiring lap/shoulder belts on certain school buses with adequate funding. Opponents of seat belts on school buses have concerns about rapid evacuation after a crash and potential injuries from lap belts. However, NHTSA reports no serious injuries from lap belts on large school buses in over 30 years. Some states and districts require seat belts on all buses, with lap belts being the most common on Type I buses. The cost of adding lap belts to Type I buses is relatively low. Adding lap belts to Type I school buses is relatively inexpensive at around $1,000 and does not reduce seating capacity. However, studies have not shown a clear safety benefit for lap belts in school bus crashes. NHTSA is considering requiring lap/shoulder belts on smaller Type II buses, which is more costly and may reduce seating capacity. Only California currently mandates lap/shoulder belts on school buses. Studies suggest that lap/shoulder belts could improve school bus safety if widely used and fitted correctly. Equipping large school buses with 3-point seat belts could cost $8,000 to $15,000 per bus, totaling $250 million to $465 million annually for the nation's fleet. This represents a 10%-20% increase in total spending on large school buses. Opponents of requiring seat belts on large school buses are concerned that the additional expense may lead to fewer buses being purchased, increasing the risk of death and injury for students. Adding lap/shoulder belts could reduce seating capacity, potentially requiring the purchase of additional buses to maintain overall capacity. This would result in additional costs for school districts and states. The costs of school buses have increased due to emissions standards and rising commodity prices. NHTSA is proposing seat belt requirements for Type II buses, which could further raise costs. Proponents argue that the cost of not having seat belts should be considered, including medical expenses and injury costs. The federal government does not generally provide funding for school transportation. Congress is providing $7 million annually to help school districts retrofit or replace school buses with older diesel engines, and in the 1987 surface transportation authorization act Congress authorized DOT to set aside up to $5 million for FY1989-FY1991 for grants to states to implement school bus safety measures. The impact on seating capacity of adding lap/shoulder belts to large school buses is complex. Adding lap/shoulder belts to large school buses with 3-3 seating reduces seating capacity by 16%-33%. Buses with lap/shoulder belts have 3-2 or 2-2 seating configurations. Widening the bus body to accommodate lap/shoulder belts is opposed due to safety concerns on narrow roads. Most school districts use the same buses for K-12 students, with seating capacity lower for middle- and high-school students. Adding lap/shoulder belts to large school buses can reduce seating capacity by up to 30%, leading to potential additional annual capital expenses of $260 to $290 million if more buses are needed to prevent student displacement. Other costs may include increasing storage areas and operating expenses for extra buses. Widely using lap/shoulder belts could help reduce the small number of school bus occupant deaths each year. Adding lap/shoulder belts to school buses can reduce seating capacity and lead to additional expenses. NHTSA estimates one life saved in frontal crashes with 100% proper belt use. Lap/shoulder belts are not widely used on school buses, with California and New York having varying requirements. Usage rates differ by age group, with elementary students showing higher usage. New York requires new school buses to have lap belts since 1987, but usage is not mandated. Only around 45-50 school districts out of 720+ in New York require students to use seat belts. Nationwide, usage of lap belts on school buses equipped with them is around 50%. Some states like New Jersey mandate seat belt usage on school buses. Enforcement of seat belt usage on buses is a challenge, as it may increase costs for school districts. In 1999, California, Florida, and Louisiana passed laws mandating seat belts on new school buses. California requires lap/shoulder belts on buses purchased since 2004/2005 and mandates student usage. Florida requires lap belts on buses purchased since 2001 and mandates student usage. Louisiana requires an \"occupant restraint system\" on every bus, pending state funding. Texas passed a law in 2007 for lap/shoulder belts on buses purchased since 2010, with student usage required. The current focus is on improving the crashworthiness of school buses rather than maintaining federal requirements for seat belts. Experts have found that lap belts offer little additional safety benefit and the costs of lap/shoulder belts may not be justified. NHTSA is working on regulations for better occupant protection systems in school buses, with 35% of the nation's school bus fleet already required to have some form of seat belt. If Texas implements its seat belt law, the nation's school bus fleet could see a rise to over 40% equipped with seat belts. NHTSA is considering requiring lap/shoulder belts for smaller Type II school buses, potentially increasing the ratio to almost 30%. Other states may follow suit based on cost-benefit assessments. NHTSA's evaluation of seat belt regulations for school buses shows that while lap/shoulder belts could save lives and prevent injuries, improper usage could increase the risk of harm. Some states have mandated seat belts on school buses, but it is unlikely that large buses will be required to have them through the regulatory process. Congress could mandate the availability of lap/shoulder belts on all school buses. California is the only state that has required lap/shoulder belts on Type I school buses, which would increase costs by 10%-20% and potentially reduce seating capacity. Congress could impose this requirement without providing funding to offset the additional costs, or choose to provide funding to states and school districts. Retrofitting existing buses with lap/shoulder belts is more expensive and may require phasing in the requirement for buses manufactured after a certain date. States and school districts replace large school buses every 12-15 years, so it could take that long to equip the nation's school bus fleet with lap/shoulder belts. The capital costs could exceed $500 million annually, with additional operating costs. Congress could encourage more states and school districts to adopt seat belt requirements by providing incentive grants for buses equipped with lap/shoulder belts. Congress could incentivize states and school districts to require seat belts on school buses by tying grant amounts to proper belt usage rates. However, other measures like shifting students to safer modes of transportation may have a greater impact on school children's safety. Federal funding is not typically provided for large school bus purchases, but a grant program could encourage districts to make safety improvements. A grant program could promote safety by encouraging school districts to increase the percentage of students traveling to school by bus. Congress has also created a program to make walking and bicycling to school safer. Other options include improving pick-up and drop-off locations, implementing graduated licensing programs for teen drivers, and equipping school buses with onboard data recorders for crash information and improved safety practices."
