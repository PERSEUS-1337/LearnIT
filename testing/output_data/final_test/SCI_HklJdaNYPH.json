    "content": "Transformer networks have significantly advanced language modeling and machine translation by incorporating self-attention layers to capture long term dependencies. A new model proposed in this study consists solely of attention layers augmented with memory vectors, eliminating the need for feed-forward layers without compromising performance. Evaluation results demonstrate the model's effectiveness on standard language modeling benchmarks. Transformers, introduced by Bahdanau et al. in 2015, have revolutionized natural language processing tasks by surpassing previous models like recurrent or convolutional networks. They utilize self-attention layers to gather relevant information from the input context, allowing for long-distance information flow and rich sequence representations. Researchers have focused on enhancing transformers by increasing the context captured by these layers. In enhancing transformer models, researchers have focused on increasing the context captured by self-attention layers. However, the effectiveness of transformers is not solely explained by these layers, as feedforward layers also play a crucial role in transforming context into rich representations. This combination of self-attention and feedforward layers makes Transformer models complex and challenging to analyze. The transformer architecture is simplified by merging self-attention and feedforward sublayers into a single unified attention layer. A new layer directly builds its representation from context and a persistent memory block, replacing the feedforward sublayer with key-value vectors. This modification simplifies the network structure without performance loss, competitive with transformers on language modeling benchmarks. Our all-attention layer merges feedforward and self-attention sublayers, simplifying the network structure without performance loss. Various network architectures have been proposed for language modeling, including feed-forward, recurrent, gated convolutional, and transformer networks. In language modeling, various techniques have been introduced to improve efficiency and performance. These include caching mechanisms, learnable self-attention spans, and hierarchical softmax for better GPU utilization. Additionally, regularization methods are also being explored to enhance large language models. Regularization techniques such as dropout and weight tying have been shown to improve the performance of large language models. The attention mechanism, introduced by Bahdanau et al. (2015), has also been widely adopted in various models for natural language processing and computer vision tasks. The attention mechanism has been widely adopted in various models for natural language processing and computer vision tasks, showing potential in language modeling, algorithmic tasks, question answering, and image captioning. Transformer models consist of stacked transformer layers, each utilizing the attention mechanism. The transformer model is made of stacked transformer layers, each containing multi-head self-attention and feedforward sublayers. Each layer includes add-norm operations for skip-connections and layer normalization. The multi-head self-attention layer applies attention heads in parallel to input vectors, utilizing key and value matrices for transformations. The transformer model utilizes key and value vectors to compute similarity scores between elements of an input sequence and its context. Different methods of position encoding, such as fixed absolute, learned absolute, and learned relative, can be used to improve efficiency for unbounded sequences, making them useful for tasks like language modeling. The transformer model uses relative position encoding to improve efficiency for unbounded sequences, such as in language modeling. The output of the sublayer is a sequence of vectors of dimension d, obtained by applying attention weights to context representations. The feedforward sublayer consists of two affine transformations applied independently to each position in the input sequence. The transformer model utilizes AddNorm operation for multi-head self-attention and feed-forward layers, ensuring well-conditioned input for subsequent sublayers. The AddNorm operation involves a residual connection followed by layer normalization. The transformer layer equations include the multi-head self-attention sublayer. The feedforward sublayer can be transformed into an attention layer by replacing the ReLU function with Softmax and removing biases. This novel layer combines self-attention and feedforward layers, relying solely on multi-head attention without the need for a feedforward sublayer. The vectors x, V, and U represent query, key, and value vectors respectively, with attention weights computed using these vectors. This transformation is equivalent to the self-attention sublayer with certain adjustments. The all-attention layer proposed in this study combines self-attention and feedforward layers into a single layer. It applies the attention mechanism on both the input sequence and a set of persistent vectors to capture general knowledge about the task. These persistent vectors act as a shared memory across the data. The all-attention layer combines self-attention and feedforward layers into a single layer. It uses persistent vectors as shared memory to capture general knowledge about the task. The persistent vectors are added to the key and value vectors conditioned on the input, and the similarity score is computed between elements of the input sequence and its extended context. The all-attention layer can have multiple heads, and the outputs are concatenated and multiplied by W o. The all-attention layer combines self-attention and feedforward layers into a single layer using persistent vectors as shared memory. The outputs from different heads are concatenated and multiplied by Wo for each timestep. Persistent vectors are not shared between heads, and the layer includes a MultiHeadAllAttn sublayer followed by AddNorm operation. In a single head scenario, unconditioned persistent vectors are added to the self-attention sublayer. In a multi-head version, it is comparable to multiple small feedforward layers working in parallel. An all-attention layer has the same number of parameters as a standard transformer layer, regardless of the number of heads, if there are as many persistent vectors as ReLU units. In this paper, attention mechanism is used for unconditioned persistent vectors, as proposed in question answering with knowledge bases. Language modeling involves assigning probabilities to sequences of words or characters, dominated by neural networks like feedforward or recurrent models. Auto-regressive transformers have shown the best performance recently. Specificities like relative position embeddings and caching are borrowed to improve language modeling with large vocabularies and long contexts. Relative position embeddings and caching are used to encode positions in sequences and allow models to work on unbounded sequences. A caching mechanism is necessary for processing input sequences in small blocks efficiently. Adaptive attention span allows each attention head to learn its context size from data, enabling some heads to have a long attention span while others focus on recent past. This extends the maximum attention span without significantly increasing memory footprint or computation time. The method involves multiplying attention weights by a soft-masking function controlled by a parameter. It adapts context size while ensuring persistent vectors are always included in attention. In word level language modeling, adaptive softmax is used to handle large vocabularies efficiently. The adaptive softmax, introduced by Grave et al. (2017a), splits the vocabulary into clusters based on word frequency to compare words within the same cluster. This approach minimizes running time by creating small clusters for frequent words and large clusters for infrequent words. Classifiers are adjusted based on cluster assignment, with fewer parameters allocated to infrequent words to reduce memory usage. In character level language modeling, the model dimension is set to d = 512 with 8 heads. Small models have 18 all-attention layers, N = 1024 persistent vectors, and a dropout rate of 0.3. The adaptive span has hyperparameters similar to Sukhbaatar et al. (2019) with a maximum span of 8192 and a loss coefficient of 10^-7. Adagrad is used with a learning rate of 0.07, and individual gradients are clipped with a norm larger than 0.03. For word level language modeling, a model with d = 512 and 36 layers, each with 8 heads and 2048 persistent vectors is used. Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.00025 and 8k warmup steps is employed. The whole gradient norm is clipped at 1. Dropout rates are set to 0.3 for attention weights and 0.1 for input embeddings and final representation. Datasets include enwik8 and text8 for character level language modeling. The enwik8 and text8 datasets for character level language modeling have a training set of 100M tokens and vocabularies of 28 and 205 unique characters respectively. The text8 dataset is preprocessed by lowering casing and retaining only whitespaces and letters from the ISO basic Latin alphabet. For word level language modeling, the WikiText-103 dataset contains around 100M tokens and a vocabulary of about 260k words. The dataset is made of Wikipedia articles, and perplexity (ppl) is reported on the dev and test sets. Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art models on word and character level language modeling benchmarks. Our small model surpasses similar-sized models on enwik8 and matches the best performing model on text8. The large model achieves state-of-the-art performance with fewer parameters. In word level language modeling, our network outperforms previous best models on the WikiText-103 dataset by 3.4 ppl. In this section, different variations of a large model for character level language modeling on Text8 are compared. The models vary in the number of persistent vectors N in each layer and the way persistent vectors are integrated into self-attention. The comparison includes models like \"all-attn\" where persistent vectors are concatenated to context vectors, \"attn-split\" where attention is computed separately for context and persistent vectors, and \"head-split\" which is similar to \"attn-split\". In this section, different variations of a large model for character level language modeling on Text8 are compared. The models vary in the integration of persistent vectors into self-attention. Variants include \"all-attn\" where persistent vectors are concatenated to context vectors, \"attn-split\" where attention is computed separately for context and persistent vectors, \"head-split\" where half of the heads attend only to context vectors and the other half to persistent vectors, \"single-head\" with a single set of persistent key-value vectors per layer, and \"FF-attn\" with a Softmax function replacing ReLU in feedforward sublayers. The comparison of different versions of a large model for character level language modeling on Text8 shows that \"all-attn\" outperforms \"attn-split\", \"single-head\" is worse than \"attn-split\", dividing heads into context-only and persistent-only groups does not work well, and \"FF-attn\" is not as effective as \"all-attn\". A novel attention layer is proposed in this paper to aggregate general and contextual information in a unified mechanism. Persistent vectors can replace feedforward layers in a transformer network without loss of performance, aiding in understanding information processing and storage. Attention maps from a model trained on the WikiText-103 dataset show how persistent vectors dominate attention in some heads, while others have more diverse activations. The 3rd head in the transformer model has diverse activations on persistent vectors and recent context. The last head focuses on the last 500 tokens in the context. Baseline Transformer models were trained on the WikiText-103 dataset to compare training details with the model. Two baselines with similar parameters were considered: a 22-layer model and a 36-layer model. The 36-layer model has more non-linear layers than our model. Training of these models diverged early due to instability in deep Transformer models. The 22-layer model also experienced divergence towards the end of training, with likely worse performance than our model."
