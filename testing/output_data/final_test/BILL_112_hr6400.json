    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Restoring the Doctors of Our Country through Scholarships Act of 2012\" or the \"RDOCS Act of 2012\". The United States is facing an impending physician workforce shortage, especially in primary care, due to factors like an aging population and newly insured individuals under the Affordable Care Act. By 2020, the shortage of primary care doctors is expected to reach 45,000, disproportionately affecting rural and underserved urban communities. The ROTC model of education and training is seen as an effective solution to address this issue. Education and training are effective in meeting the Nation's need for educated officers in the US Armed Forces and addressing the primary care shortage. There is high demand for medical scholarships, with 10 applicants for each National Health Service Corps scholarship awarded. SEC. 3. Grants to states for restoring doctors through scholarships program. Amends the Public Health Service Act to include grants for scholarship programs in Subpart III of part D of title III. The Secretary will make grants to States for RDOCS programs to increase primary health care services in shortage areas. States must submit applications for grants. RDOCS programs involve contracts between States and RDOCS scholars. The State agrees to pay tuition and costs for an RDOCS scholar's undergraduate medical education for up to 48 months, along with a cost-of-living stipend determined by the Secretary. The RDOCS scholar agrees to enroll and maintain enrollment in a participating undergraduate medical program in their State of residence. The RDOCS program requires scholars to enroll in a participating undergraduate medical program, maintain academic standing, complete a residency in primary care, obtain a medical license, achieve board certification, and serve in a health professional shortage area for 5 years post-graduation. Priority is given to scholars in awarding scholarships. The RDOCS program gives preference to applicants enrolled in accelerated family-medicine programs or programs with clinical training in rural or underserved urban areas. States receiving grants must administer the program directly and provide matching funds for scholarship costs. The RDOCS program requires states to contribute cash towards costs, with a minimum of $1 for every $9 of Federal funds provided. The amount of non-Federal contributions excludes funds from the Federal Government but may include administrative expenses for operating the program. States must coordinate their RDOCS program with federal assignments for health professional shortage areas. The RDOCS program requires states to assign RDOCS officers to public and nonprofit entities in health professional shortage areas. The Secretary may not grant funds unless states provide remedies for contract breaches by RDOCS scholars. States must ensure contracts with RDOCS scholars are not more favorable than terms set by the Secretary. The RDOCS program requires states to assign RDOCS officers to underserved areas. States must adhere to terms set by the Secretary for contracts with RDOCS scholars and report on the program annually. The RDOCS program requires states to assign officers to underserved areas and report annually on the physician workforce, including data on shortages by State and region, gap analysis of needed primary care practitioners, and funding estimates to close the gap. The Secretary may withhold payments to noncompliant states after the first fiscal year. The RDOCS program requires states to assign officers to underserved areas and report annually on the physician workforce. The Secretary may withhold payments to noncompliant states after the first fiscal year if the State has breached agreements made under this section. The Secretary determines the number of breached contracts before making a grant to a State, and grants may be reduced for States with breached contracts. The Secretary may reduce grants to States with breached contracts by the amount of federal funds spent on the contracts plus interest. The Secretary has the authority to waive the requirement for initial breach of a contract if it was due to a serious illness. Definitions include an accelerated track family-medicine program and associated regions like Washington, Wyoming, Alaska, Montana, and Idaho. The term 'board certification' refers to a medical specialty certification. 'Health professional shortage area' is an area designated under section 332. The terms defined in this section include 'participating undergraduate medical program' for state-operated medical programs, 'primary care specialty' for pediatrics, family medicine, or general internal medicine, 'RDOCS officer' for program participants who completed medical training but not their scholarship requirements, and 'RDOCS scholar' for individuals in the program who have not finished medical education. The term 'relevant committees' refers to specific Senate and House committees. The term 'State' refers to all 50 states and the District of Columbia. An authorization of $200,000,000 is allocated annually for fiscal years 2013 through 2016 for this section."
