    "content": "The \"Access to Birth Control Act\" may be cited as the short title of this legislation. Congress finds that family planning is essential for women's health, as access to contraception helps prevent unintended pregnancies and allows for planned births. Despite family planning being recognized as a significant public health achievement, the United States still has high rates of unintended pregnancies. Each year, 3 million pregnancies in the US are unintended, with nearly half ending in abortion. Women also rely on prescription contraceptives for medical purposes beyond birth control. Emergency contraception is safe and effective in preventing unintended pregnancy, approved for over-the-counter access for individuals aged 17 and older. It can significantly reduce the chance of unintended pregnancy if taken soon after unprotected sex. Access to legal contraception is a protected fundamental right in the United States. Reports of pharmacists refusing to fill prescriptions for contraceptives, including emergency contraceptives, have been reported in multiple states across the nation, even for non-prescription emergency contraception. The Public Health Service Act is amended to include duties of pharmacies to ensure provision of FDA-approved contraception. Pharmacies receiving FDA-approved drugs must provide requested contraceptives without delay, even if not in stock, offering alternative options promptly. Pharmacies must promptly locate or transfer prescriptions for contraceptives, order if requested, and ensure employees do not intimidate customers or obstruct services. Pharmacies must comply with regulations regarding the delivery of contraception services, including not obstructing services, deceiving customers, breaching confidentiality, or refusing to return a valid prescription. Pharmacies not stocking contraceptives are exempt. Pharmacies can refuse to provide contraceptives if no valid prescription is presented, the customer cannot pay, or based on professional clinical judgment. This section does not affect rights under the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and does not preempt State laws or professional obligations. State law or professional obligations enforced by State boards or licensing entities may offer greater customer protections than those outlined in this section. Pharmacies violating subsection (a) may face civil penalties up to $1,000 per day of violation, not exceeding $100,000 for all violations in a single proceeding. Individuals affected by such violations can pursue civil action against the pharmacy for appropriate relief in court. The section outlines penalties for pharmacies violating regulations, with potential civil action for relief including damages, injunctive relief, and attorney's fees. Civil actions must be filed within 5 years of the violation. Definitions for contraception, employee, and pharmacy are provided. The curr_chunk defines terms related to pharmacies, including the definition of a product as an FDA-approved drug or device, professional clinical judgment, and the timeframe for providing contraception services. The curr_chunk states that the section will take effect 31 days after enactment, regardless of guidance from the Secretary."
