    "title": "AB 311",
    "content": "The State of California enacts the following. Section 21168.6.7 of the Public Resources Code defines a \"water storage project\" funded by bonds from the Water Quality, Supply, and Infrastructure Improvement Act of 2014. The procedures outlined in subdivision (c) apply to legal actions challenging the certification of environmental impact reports or approvals for such projects. The Judicial Council must establish procedures for resolving legal actions challenging the certification of environmental impact reports for water storage projects within 270-370 days. Environmental impact reports for such projects must include a notice in at least 12-point type. The EIR is subject to Section 21168.6.7 of the Public Resources Code, which states that the lead agency is not required to consider comments filed after the public comment period for the draft EIR. Any legal challenge to the EIR certification or project approval must follow the procedures in the Public Resources Code. The draft and final EIR must include the full text of this section as an appendix. Within 10 days of releasing the draft EIR, the lead agency must hold an informational workshop for the public. Within 10 days before the close of the public comment period, the lead agency must hold a public hearing for testimony on the draft environmental impact report, with a transcript included in the final report. Within five days after the comment period closes, a commenter may request nonbinding mediation, identifying areas of dispute to be mediated. Mediation must end within 35 days after the comment period closes. The lead agency must select mediators with experience in land use and environmental law or science for mediation on areas of dispute. The applicant covers the costs of mediation. Any agreed-upon measures must be adopted as a condition of approval, preventing challenges to the agency's decision. The lead agency does not have to consider comments submitted after the public comment period unless they address new issues, new information, changes to the project, or proposed conditions for approval. The lead agency must file the required notice within five days of the last initial project approval. The agency may prepare and certify the record of proceedings, with the applicant covering all costs. The lead agency must make the draft environmental impact report and related documents available to the public in an electronic format within three business days of its release. Any additional documents prepared or submitted after the draft report's release must also be accessible electronically within five business days. The lead agency must make the draft environmental impact report and related documents available in an electronic format within three business days of release. Copyright protected documents not prepared specifically for the project do not need to be electronically accessible, but an index of these documents must be provided electronically. Written comments on the project should be encouraged to be submitted electronically and made available to the public within five days of receipt. (5) Within seven business days, the lead agency must convert non-electronic comments into an electronic format for public access. (6) Comments not considered by the lead agency will be noted in the record without including their content. Within five days of filing the required notice, the lead agency must certify and provide an electronic copy of the proceedings record to a party upon request. A reasonable fee may be charged for the copy. Within 10 days of receiving a complaint or petition, the lead agency must lodge a copy of the certified record with the superior court. (9) Disputes over the record of proceedings are resolved by the superior court. A party must file a motion to augment the record when disputing its content. (10) The contents of the record are specified in Section 21167.6. (f) These rules do not apply to projects with environmental reviews before December 31, 2015. (g) The court can only stop a water storage project if it poses a threat to public health and safety. The court can only enjoin specific activities of a water storage project if it poses a threat to public health and safety or adversely affects important Native American artifacts, historical, archaeological, or ecological values. An action to challenge a decision of the lead agency regarding a subsequent project approval must adhere to the requirements of this chapter. No reimbursement is necessary for this act as local agencies have the authority to fund mandated services through service charges or fees."
