Congress finds that more than two-thirds of transportation petroleum in the United States is imported, leading to the establishment of the Clean Cities program in 1993 by the Department of Energy. This program aims to reduce petroleum dependence and emissions through a partnership between public and private entities, empowering local citizens to lead a national movement for change. The Clean Cities program, established in 1993 by the Department of Energy, consists of coalitions in communities across the United States involving various stakeholders. Over the past 10 years, the program has provided $43 million in grant funds, leveraged into $214 million in matching funds, and obtained an additional $845 million in funding. These coalitions have reduced petroleum use by over 2 billion gallons and put 500,000 alternative fuel vehicles on the road in the last 15 years. The Clean Cities program has put 500,000 alternative fuel vehicles on the road and established alternative fuel infrastructure in strategic locations. It aims to lead the United States towards a clean, secure, and environmentally friendly transportation future. The Clean Cities program aims to lead the United States towards a clean, secure, and environmentally friendly transportation future.

It includes projects, education, and training to support the adoption of alternative fuels and technologies. The Clean Cities program promotes the adoption of petroleum reduction technologies, collaborates with emergency responders, coordinates efforts between agencies and the alternative fuel industry, develops refueling infrastructure, and provides financial assistance grants to stakeholders. The Clean Cities program supports stakeholders in deploying alternative fuels and petroleum reduction technologies in on-road vehicles. It encourages the formation of local Clean Cities organizations comprising various public and private stakeholders interested in reducing petroleum use in transportation. The Clean Cities program supports the deployment of alternative fuels and petroleum reduction technologies in on-road vehicles. $125,000,000 is authorized for the program over a 5-year period starting in fiscal year 2010."
