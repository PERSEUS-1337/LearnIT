The \"Tax Equity Act of 2011\" includes regional cost-of-living adjustments in individual income tax rates, where the rate table is further adjusted based on minimum and maximum dollar amounts for each rate bracket. The Tax Equity Act of 2011 incorporates regional cost-of-living adjustments in individual income tax rates, with rate brackets multiplied by applicable multipliers based on the statistical area of the individual's primary residence. Rate brackets are not changed, and tax amounts are adjusted accordingly. Any amount not a multiple of $50 is rounded to the nearest multiple of $50. The Tax Equity Act of 2011 adjusts individual income tax rates based on regional cost-of-living differences. Applicable multipliers are determined for each statistical area, with adjustments made to tax amounts to ensure they are rounded to the nearest multiple of $50. The Tax Equity Act of 2011 adjusts individual income tax rates based on regional cost-of-living differences. Applicable multipliers are determined for each statistical area, with adjustments made to tax amounts to ensure they are rounded to the nearest multiple of $50. The cost-of-living differential for any statistical area for any calendar year is calculated by dividing the cost-of-living for the area in the previous year by the average cost-of-living. If the cost-of-living differential falls within a certain range, a specific multiplier is applied. The Secretary of Labor determines and publishes a cost-of-living index for each statistical area based on average market prices for the 12-month period ending on August 31 of the calendar year. The cost-of-living index for each statistical area is determined by the Secretary of Labor based on average market prices. The methodology used is similar to the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers. The term 'statistical area' includes metropolitan statistical areas defined by the Secretary of Commerce and portions of states not within those areas. The area multiplier for locations outside the United States is 1. The amendment made by this section applies to taxable years starting after December 31, 2011. A transition rule sets the date for prescribing multipliers for 2012 to be 1 year after the enactment of this Act."
