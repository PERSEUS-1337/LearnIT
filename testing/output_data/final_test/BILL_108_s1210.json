    "content": "The Act titled \"Marine Turtle Conservation Act of 2003\" is established for the purpose of conserving marine turtles. Congress finds that marine turtle populations have declined, endangering the survival of various species listed as threatened or endangered. Human exploitation and habitat loss pose significant threats, with illegal international trade particularly impacting hawksbill turtles. Marine turtle populations, including the hawksbill turtle, are facing immense challenges due to human activities causing loss of nesting habitats. Sustaining healthy populations of marine turtles benefits other wildlife species. Studies of wild marine turtle populations have provided important biological insights. Changes in marine turtle populations are a reliable indicator of ecosystem health. The purpose of this Act is to support the conservation of marine turtles and their nesting habitats in foreign countries by providing financial resources for conservation projects. The Act emphasizes the importance of monitoring changes in turtle populations through nest numbers and nesting females. Collaboration between countries with nesting habitats and experts in turtle conservation is essential to address threats to turtle populations. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.
