It includes an action-forcing mechanism for elimination and guidelines for systematic review. This idea emphasizes legislative oversight to promote efficiency and control government growth. Termination of budget authority is a common mechanism, along with periodic expiration of agency statutes or regulations. The sunset concept was refined and popularized in Colorado. The sunset concept, popularized in Colorado, allows agencies to automatically terminate unless renewed by law. By 1982, 36 states had enacted some version of the sunset review process. However, by 1990, 12 states had ceased the use of this legislative oversight. Since 1990, 12 states have stopped using sunset laws due to various reasons such as high costs, lobbying, and low citizen participation. Despite this, sunset reviews have led to agency terminations and improvements in accountability and efficiency. The Council of State Governments has been compiling data on sunset legislation in The Book of the States since 1978. States are categorized by the scope of their sunset review process: comprehensive, regulatory, selective, or discretionary. The 2010 edition of The Book of the States shows that 24 states have active sunset review processes, while nine states have terminated or suspended their sunset procedures. Another source, the Council on Licensure, Enforcement, and Regulation (CLEAR), indicates that 13 states have repealed, terminated, or suspended their sunset laws. In at least three states, sunset laws were terminated or repealed and reinstated, with Texas having an active sunset process guided by a 12-member body. Since 1978, 58 agencies in Texas have been abolished as part of the sunset process. Since 1978, Texas sunset process has abolished 58 agencies and consolidated 12 agencies, saving nearly $783.7 million. The Texas Sunset Advisory Commission was nearly abolished in 1993 but was ultimately saved by supporters in the legislature. At the federal level, over 70 bills were introduced in Congress proposing sunset arrangements, with the Senate passing the Program Reauthorization and Evaluation Act in 1978. In 1997, H.R. 2939 (105th Congress) introduced a bill for a federal sunset process, modeled on the Texas sunset process. It proposed a 12-member \"Federal Agency Sunset Commission\" to review and recommend reorganization or abolishment of federal agencies every 12 years. Members would be appointed by the Speaker of the House and Senate majority leader. Agencies would be abolished within a year of review completion unless Congress acted to continue them. In 1998, the House Subcommittee on Government Management, Information, and Technology held a hearing on H.R. 2939. Representative Brady and four other Members testified in favor of the bill. The main criticism raised concerned potential constitutional issues with the commission framework. An advisory opinion from the Department of Justice referenced the INS v. Chada decision by the Supreme Court in 1983, stating that the bill could allow the abolishment of an executive agency without proper legislative process. In 1999, Congressman Brady introduced a revised bill, H.R. 2128, with 92 cosponsors, containing provisions for extending agency abolishment deadlines with congressional approval and creating a \"Program Inventory\" compiled by congressional support agencies. This legislation aimed to address constitutional separation of powers concerns. In the 95th Congress, a bill was introduced to create an inventory of federal programs within each agency to assist Congress and a commission. In the 107th Congress, a similar bill was reintroduced as the \"Abolishment of Obsolete Agencies and Federal Sunset Act.\" Representative Brady and Jim Turner testified in favor of the bill at a hearing in 2002. The OMB spokesman testified in support of a sunset review process for the federal government, similar to a proposal endorsed by President Bush in 2000. A substitute amendment to H.R. 2373 was circulated but not considered before adjournment. Congressman Brady introduced a similar bill in the 108th Congress, but it did not progress further. Budget process reform proposals were endorsed in the President's budget submission for FY2006. In February 2005, the President endorsed budget process reform proposals, including the establishment of a federal sunset commission to review programs and a results commission to improve program performance. Programs would be automatically terminated unless reauthorized by Congress. In March 2005, a proposal for a federal sunset commission to review and abolish obsolete agencies and programs was considered by Congress. Despite opposition, a Sense of the Senate provision regarding program performance review was included in the FY2006 budget resolution. In June 2005, OMB released a legislative proposal to create commissions to eliminate waste, fraud, and abuse. Bills were introduced in July 2005 mirroring the OMB proposal in both the Senate and the House. In the House, two bills were introduced in July 2005 mirroring the OMB proposal. H.R. 3276, introduced by Representative Jon Porter, would establish results commissions. H.R. 3277, introduced by Representative Kevin Brady, would establish a Sunset Commission and review process for the federal government. Brady also reintroduced his sunset commission bill as H.R. 3282. H.R. 3277 would require the schedule for review and termination of agencies and programs to be enacted into statute. The bills H.R. 3277 and S. 1399 proposed the establishment of a federal sunset commission with seven members appointed by the President. The commission would review programs and agencies every 10 years based on criteria like cost effectiveness and duplication. It would have the authority to gather information, hold hearings, and consider evaluations, providing annual reports to the President. The proposed federal sunset commission would review agencies and programs annually, providing recommendations to the President on improvements or abolishment. The President would then submit recommendations to Congress, with agencies facing abolition if not reauthorized within two years. The Senate bill differed from other drafts in certain aspects. The OMB draft and H.R. 3277 included an exemption for certain regulations, ensuring they would not sunset without provisions for continued enforcement. S. 1399 did not have provisions for exemptions. A hearing was held on H.R. 3276 and H.R. 3277 in September 2005, with testimony from OMB officials and private sector witnesses. In May 2006, plans were announced to bring sunset legislation to the House floor, along with other budget process reforms. In FY2007, attention was on crafting a consensus bill, focusing on H.R. 3282 (Brady bill) and H.R. 2470 sponsored by Representative Todd Tiarht for a \"Commission on the Accountability and Review of Federal Agencies (CARFA).\" H.R. 3282 had provisions for termination of agencies and programs without congressional action, while H.R. 2470 did not. A revised version of H.R. 2470 was introduced as H.R. 5766. Hearings and markup on both bills took place in July 2006. President Bush endorsed the creation of a federal sunset commission in his budget submission for FY2008, calling for a bill to incorporate provisions from the Administration's 2005 proposal. The Sunset Commission would evaluate Presidential proposals to retain, restructure, or terminate agencies and programs on a schedule set by Congress, with automatic termination if not reauthorized. No further action was taken in the 109th Congress after H.R. 5766 and H.R. 3282 were reported favorably by party-line votes. President Bush reaffirmed his support for a federal sunset commission in the budget submission for FY2009, aiming to improve the performance of poorly designed or overlapping government programs. Senator John Cornyn introduced a new sunset measure, S. 1731, in the 110th Congress. In the 110th Congress, Senator John Cornyn introduced S. 1731, the United States Authorization and Sunset Commission Act. Congressman Brady introduced H.R. 5794, a bill similar to H.R. 3282 from the previous Congress. In the 111th Congress, Brady and Cornyn reintroduced their sunset commission bills, including the Federal Sunset Act of 2009 (H.R. 393). The Responsible Government Empowerment Act of 2009 (H.R. 534) and the Spending, Deficit, and Debt Control Act of 2009 (H.R. 3964) were introduced to reform federal budget procedures and improve Congress's ability to set spending priorities. The Spending, Deficit, and Debt Control Act of 2009 (H.R. 3964) was introduced on October 29, 2009, by Representative Hensarling with 20 cosponsors. Senator Cornyn introduced S. 926, the United States Authorization and Sunset Commission Act of 2009, on April 29, 2009. The bill proposed the creation of a Federal Agency Sunset Commission (FASC) to review the efficiency and public need for federal agencies, aiming to abolish those deemed unnecessary. The Federal Agency Sunset Commission (FASC) would consist of 12 members appointed by congressional leaders to review federal agencies for efficiency and public need, with a schedule for review every 12 years and abolishment if not reauthorized by Congress. The Federal Agency Sunset Commission (FASC) would review agencies based on 19 criteria, reporting to the President and Congress annually with recommendations on abolishment or reorganization. Agencies not reauthorized would be abolished within one year, with a possible two-year extension through legislation. The commission would also report on new agency or program legislation introduced to Congress. H.R. 393 and S. 926 proposed the establishment of new agencies or programs, with H.R. 393 focusing on preparing an inventory of federal programs within each agency and S. 926 creating the United States Authorization and Sunset Commission (USASC) with specific membership and reporting requirements to Congress. The Commission Schedule and Review bill proposed by S. 926 would require a legislative proposal to Congress every 10 years for the review and abolishment of agencies and programs, with specific criteria and timelines outlined for the process. The Commission Schedule and Review bill proposed by S. 926 would have required the USASC to submit reports to Congress every two years analyzing proposals for reauthorizing, reorganizing, or transferring federal agencies or programs. H.R. 5407, the Program Reform Commission Act, aimed to establish a Program Review Commission to identify unnecessary federal programs and make recommendations for their termination or modification. The Program Reform Commission Act, H.R. 5407, aimed to establish a Program Review Commission to identify unnecessary federal programs and make recommendations for termination or modification. The Government Efficiency, Effectiveness, and Performance Improvement Act, P.L. 111-352, strengthened the Government Performance and Results Act by requiring agencies to identify high-priority goals and perform frequent evaluations of progress. H.R. 2142, as amended, required a review of government programs every five years to assess performance. It proposed establishing a Federal Program Sunset Commission to review programs and submit annual reports to Congress and the President. The Federal Program Sunset Commission would submit an annual report to Congress and the President analyzing federal programs for efficiency and necessity, recommending abolishment or reorganization, and proposing consolidation or transfer of functions. Draft legislation would be submitted for implementation, with programs abolished within one year unless reauthorized by Congress. Another bill, the Stop Waste by Eliminating Excessive Programs (SWEEP) Act, was introduced to review and abolish unnecessary programs. The SWEEP Act aims to review and eliminate inefficient federal programs through the creation of a Federal Programs Sunset Commission (FPSC) with bipartisan members appointed by congressional leadership. The Comptroller General of the GAO would prepare a program inventory, and the commission would have the power to hold hearings and issue subpoenas. The SWEEP Act establishes a Federal Programs Sunset Commission to review and eliminate inefficient government-funded programs. The commission will schedule reviews of programs every 10 fiscal years, assess their outcomes and cost-effectiveness, and recommend abolishment or consolidation to Congress. Representative Issa introduced the bill on October 13, 2010, to reduce unnecessary government spending through expedited procedures for congressional consideration and action on program changes. Representative Issa proposed the establishment of a bipartisan federal program sunset commission to review and abolish failing programs unless reauthorized by Congress within one year. The commission would consist of experts from outside the federal government to foster objectivity and reduce unnecessary government spending. In the context of establishing a federal program sunset commission, there were discussions about key features such as membership criteria and commission powers. Journalist Robert Brodsky pointed out differences between Representative Issa's proposal and a failed amendment to H.R. 2142, particularly regarding the composition of the commission. Representative Issa's proposal aimed for all members to be independent experts, while the amendment suggested a majority of Members of Congress. Additionally, similarities and differences between three bills introduced in the 111th Congress to establish a sunset commission were highlighted. Three bills introduced in the 111th Congress aimed to establish a sunset commission: H.R. 393 (Brady bill), S. 926 (Cornyn bill), and H.R. 5568 (SWEEP bill). The bills differed in scope of coverage, with H.R. 393 and S. 926 referring to federal agencies while H.R. 5568 focused on programs. All three bills proposed a 12-member bipartisan commission, with variations in appointment methods. The bills H.R. 393, S. 926, and H.R. 5568 proposed a 12-member bipartisan commission. The appointment methods varied, with Democrats and Republicans appointed from each chamber. The Director of the Congressional Budget Office and the Comptroller of the Government Accountability Office would serve as non-voting members in S. 926. The commission chair would appoint a staff director, with differences in appointing other staff members. H.R. 393 would have the General Services Administration provide administrative support on a reimbursable basis, while S. 926 would authorize the commission to receive support. H.R. 393, S. 926, and H.R. 5568 proposed a bipartisan commission with varying appointment methods. H.R. 393 and S. 926 included action-forcing mechanisms to terminate programs unless reauthorized. H.R. 393 would abolish agencies within one year, extendable by two years, while S. 926 would abolish agencies two years after review. H.R. 5568 aimed for timely congressional consideration of commission reports and recommendations. H.R. 5568 emphasized timely congressional consideration of commission reports and recommendations. It included provisions for transparency and public involvement in program reviews, requiring public hearings and consultation with oversight committees, GAO, and OMB. S. 926 and H.R. 5568 did not mention public hearings or comments in their provisions. The bills S. 926, H.R. 5568, and H.R. 393 proposed expedited procedures for congressional action on review schedules and program abolishment. H.R. 393 and H.R. 5568 included provisions for program inventory compilation, while S. 926 did not. Additionally, two bills authorized funds for commission duties. The bills S. 926, H.R. 5568, and H.R. 393 proposed expedited procedures for congressional action on review schedules and program abolishment. H.R. 393 and H.R. 5568 included provisions for program inventory compilation, while S. 926 did not. S. 926 contained \"such sums as may be necessary\" language, H.R. 393 required offsetting appropriations for commission operations, and H.R. 5568 did not authorize funds. All three bills had sunset provisions for the commission, with different termination dates. Representative Kevin Brady introduced H.R. 235 in the 112th Congress, a measure expanding on previous sunset commission bills. H.R. 235, the CUTS Act, calls for the elimination of duplicative government programs. The OMB director and agency heads are required to consolidate programs with similar goals within 120 days of enactment. If Congress does not act within 60 days of receiving the OMB report, department secretaries and agency heads must implement the recommendations. Representative Schock introduced H.R. 606 on February 10, 2011. On February 10, 2011, Representative Schock introduced H.R. 606, the Federal Program Sunset Commission Act, which proposes a 10-member commission appointed by the President to oversee Federal programs. Senator John Cornyn proposed an amendment to a small business reauthorization bill on March 16, 2011. The amendment aimed to establish a bipartisan sunset commission to improve oversight and eliminate wasteful government spending. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid filed a cloture motion on May 2, 2011, to close debate on the bill, which included provisions similar to those in a previous Congress. Reid mentioned efforts to reach an agreement on amendments for final passage, with the Cornyn amendment being a point of contention. Supporters of sunset commission measures argue that there are too many overlapping and ineffective federal programs contributing to the growing deficit. A 2011 GAO report highlighted duplicative goals in federal programs, indicating a need for systematic review. Congressional reviews of programs are seen as sporadic and inadequate, as shown by unauthorized appropriations. Supporters of a federal sunset commission argue that it is necessary to reduce fraud, waste, and abuse in federal programs. President Bush and President Obama both supported the idea of a sunset commission or a similar Cut-and-Invest Committee to review federal agencies and programs for inefficiencies. This action-forcing mechanism would help Congress in its oversight function and improve the operation of federal agencies. The Cut-and-Invest Committee would review federal agencies and programs, recommending changes such as reauthorization, abolishment, consolidation, or reorganization. Advocates cite the success of sunset commissions in states like Texas. Senator Cornyn proposed a bipartisan sunset commission modeled after Texas' successful process. The Texas Sunset Advisory Commission has eliminated over 50 State agencies, saving taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars. Estimates show a potential 27-year savings of $783.7 million compared to expenditures of $28.6 million. Critics argue that mandatory reauthorization could burden Congress with excessive workload and increase costs. The proposed sunset commission could increase congressional personnel costs and grant substantial power to a small group of members, potentially leading to the termination of important programs. Critics also highlight concerns about lack of transparency in commission activities. The proposed sunset commission may not require public participation in its deliberations. Programs and agencies would terminate unless Congress approves a reauthorization bill, which could be vetoed by the President. This could lead to a significant transfer of power. A proposed sunset commission, requiring approval from Congress and potentially facing a presidential veto, could result in a significant shift of power from Congress to the executive branch."
