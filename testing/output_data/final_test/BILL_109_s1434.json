    "content": "The \"Master Teacher Scholarship Act of 2005\" may be cited as the short title for this Act. Congress finds that programs in title II of the Higher Education Act aim to improve the teaching workforce and hold institutions accountable for teacher preparation. However, States still struggle to provide high-quality teachers in math, science, and secondary schools. Additionally, under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, States must ensure all teachers are highly qualified, but schools in rural and high-poverty areas face challenges in attracting teachers. Teacher shortages in rural areas and high-poverty schools are mainly due to difficulties in retaining teachers. Recruitment efforts alone are not enough to address this issue.

The Secretary may award grants to teacher preparation programs to provide scholarships for eligible teachers to obtain a graduate degree. Programs must apply with a local educational agency, detailing their partnership and how they meet the needs of teachers and align with state academic standards. Each teacher preparation program receiving a grant under this Act must use the funds to award scholarships to eligible teachers pursuing a graduate degree in specific areas. Additionally, a small portion of the grant funds can be used for administrative costs related to the scholarship program. Each scholarship recipient must use the funds for graduate level tuition and fees. The scholarship agreement requires recipients to use the funds for graduate level tuition and fees. Eligible teachers awarded scholarships must enter an agreement with the local educational agency and teacher preparation program. The program will provide a scholarship of $5,000 to $7,000. Teachers agree to teach for 5 years after receiving their degree, mentor a novice teacher for 2 years, and repay funds if they fail to comply. Authorization of appropriations for this Act includes $30,000,000 for fiscal year 2006 and each of the 5 succeeding fiscal years."
