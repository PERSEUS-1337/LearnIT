    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Community Hospital Preservation Act\" and grants authority to make grants. The Secretary may make grants to eligible community hospitals under the Community Hospital Preservation Act. Grant amounts range from $100,000 to $2,500,000 or 10% of the hospital's total assets. Grants cannot exceed the hospital's non-Federal funding for the fiscal year. Hospitals with HUD-insured mortgages are not eligible for grants. The Act awards grant amounts to hospitals with HUD-insured mortgages only if approved by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development before the award date. Grant amounts under this Act may only be used for legitimate hospital purposes. The Secretary may award grants to eligible community hospitals based on competitive criteria. The Secretary will recover grant amounts if the recipient fails to comply with specified conditions or if the hospital no longer meets requirements. The recovery amount is the award reduced by 10% for each year until the specified date. The Secretary will recover grant amounts if the recipient fails to comply with conditions or if the hospital no longer meets requirements. The recovery amount is amortized over a 20-year period with interest at the Treasury's borrowing rate. The Secretary must submit an annual report to Congress by February 1 detailing activities under the Act in the previous year. The Act defines an eligible community hospital as a nonprofit hospital with total assets not exceeding $75,000,000, providing essential healthcare services in the community, facing financial difficulties, and operating efficiently or having a financial recovery plan. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Health and Human Services. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will issue regulations to implement the Act. $1 billion is authorized for grants each year from 2000 to 2004."
