    "content": "Comprehensive immigration reform was debated in the 109th and 110th Congresses, but no legislation was enacted. The Speaker of the House and Senate majority leader pledged to address immigration reform in the 111th Congress. Previous bills covered border security, interior enforcement, employment verification, temporary worker programs, permanent admissions, and unauthorized aliens. The 111th Congress considered the DREAM Act to legalize certain unauthorized alien students. The House approved a version of the DREAM Act on December 8, 2010, as an amendment to an unrelated bill. The 111th Congress passed legislation to extend various immigration programs until September 30, 2012, and also addressed border security, refugees, and Haitian migrants. The 111th Congress addressed immigration-related issues such as employment eligibility verification and worksite enforcement as part of comprehensive immigration reform efforts. Employers are required to verify the work eligibility of new hires through the I-9 system to reduce unauthorized immigration. Employers must verify new hires' identity and work eligibility through I-9 forms to comply with worksite enforcement laws. They can also choose to use the E-Verify system for electronic verification, administered by DHS's USCIS. E-Verify was set to expire in 2009 but was extended by Congress through various provisions. E-Verify, a program for electronic verification of work eligibility, has been extended multiple times by Congress. The latest extension, authorized until September 30, 2012, was a compromise between the House and Senate versions of the bill. Additionally, funds under the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2010 were prohibited from being used for new DHS hires not verified through E-Verify. The E-Verify program was extended until September 30, 2012, with provisions in the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2010. However, certain E-Verify provisions in H.R. 2892 were not enacted in P.L. 111-83, including verifying existing employees and requiring contractors to use E-Verify for all hires and workers in the United States. Other bills in the 111th Congress aimed to make broader changes to employment verification laws. The Secure America Through Verification and Enforcement Act of 2009 aimed to make E-Verify permanent and required all employers to use it for verifying employment authorization. DHS is responsible for border security to prevent illegal entries into the country. The 111th Congress debated on whether DHS had enough resources for border security, with bills introduced to add resources for Customs and Border Protection (CBP). CBP is responsible for securing U.S. borders at ports of entry and between them, with the border patrol enforcing immigration and federal laws along the border. The 111th Congress enacted key provisions on border resources. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 provided $680 million for CBP in FY2009, including funds for salaries, nonintrusive inspection technology, tactical communications equipment, and port construction. Additionally, Congress allocated $140 million for Southwest border activities in response to drug-related violence. In response to increasing drug-related violence, funding was allocated for CBP activities along the Southwest border. This included $40 million for CBP and $5 million for CBP Air and Marine for additional air operations. The FY2010 DHS Appropriations bill also provided funding for 50 additional CBP Officers and 10 support positions. Additionally, $600 million in emergency supplemental appropriations was made available for border security in FY2010, with $394 million allocated to DHS, $196 million to DOJ, and $10 million to the federal judiciary. Within DHS, CBP received $306 million, including $39 million for CBP officers at ports of entry on the Southwest border. The Anti-Border Corruption Act of 2010 allocated $10 million for integrity and background investigation programs within CBP. Legislation in the 111th Congress funded the hiring of 100 border patrol agents and deployment of SBInet technology with $100 million from ARRA. Additionally, $574 million was requested for SBInet-related technologies deployment. The Administration requested $574 million for SBInet-related technologies in FY2011, a decrease from the previous year. DHS Secretary Napolitano ordered an assessment of the project but continued to support border protection technologies. Legislation imposed reporting requirements on border patrol sectors and improvements in cross-border inspection processes. The Coast Guard Authorization Act of 2010 included provisions for mobile biometric identification in the maritime environment. The Coast Guard Authorization Act of 2010 included provisions for mobile biometric identification in the maritime environment and directed a cost analysis for expanding biometric capabilities for other DHS maritime vessels. Legislation also mandated a study on the use of various biometric technologies for security purposes. Additionally, P.L. 111-230 provided emergency supplemental funding for DHS, including funds for CBP border patrol activities. The DHS funding in P.L. 111-230 included $80 million for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), $30 million for reducing violence along the Southwest border, $50 million for additional ICE personnel, and $8 million for basic training at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center. Congress has shown interest in deploying barriers along the U.S. international land border since 1996. In 2008, Congress mandated DHS to construct reinforced fencing or barriers along 700 miles of the Southwest border where deemed practical and effective. Despite no legislative amendments in the 111th Congress, border fencing remained a contentious issue with calls for at least 700 miles of double-layered fencing to deter illegal crossings. Unauthorized immigration remains a significant issue for policymakers, with an estimated 11 million unauthorized aliens living in the United States in early 2009. Various legislative proposals in the 111th Congress focused on enforcement measures such as border security and employment eligibility verification. Some policymakers also support a legalization program for unauthorized aliens. In the 111th Congress, various bills were introduced to address unauthorized immigration, including legalization programs for unauthorized aliens like the DREAM Act. These bills aimed to provide earned adjustment for unauthorized alien students and were part of comprehensive immigration reform efforts. In the 111th Congress, multiple DREAM Act bills were introduced in the House and Senate to provide relief to unauthorized students by enabling them to obtain legal permanent resident status in the United States through a two-stage process. In the 111th Congress, DREAM Act bills aimed to help unauthorized students gain legal status through a two-stage process. The House-approved version required beneficiaries to meet various requirements, including paying surcharges and federal tax liabilities. The Senate cloture motion on the House DREAM Act amendment failed in a 55-41 vote on December 18, 2010. Refugee admission to the United States is authorized by the INA for individuals facing persecution based on various grounds. DOS handles overseas processing of refugees, while DHS/USCIS determines eligibility for admission. Refugees must apply for LPR status after one year in the U.S. The Foreign Relations Authorization Act proposed changes to the U.S. refugee admissions program, including authorizing refugee admission at the start of a fiscal year without a presidential determination, expanding training for embassy personnel, and establishing overseas programs for resettled refugees. The Senate bill (S. 3113) aims to make changes to refugee admissions and asylum processes, including special provisions for certain refugee groups like the Lautenberg and Specter amendments. The Lautenberg amendment was extended through FY2010 by P.L. 111-117, but was not re-enacted for FY2011. The \"McCain amendment\" allowed adult children of certain Vietnamese refugees to be eligible for U.S. refugee resettlement, with provisions for reconsideration of previously denied cases. The McCain amendment, which allowed adult children of certain Vietnamese refugees to be eligible for U.S. refugee resettlement, was repealed by P.L. 111-117. Other immigration mechanisms have been established to facilitate the admission of foreign nationals closely associated with the U.S. government. The Department of Health and Human Services administers transitional assistance programs for refugees and Cuban/Haitian entrants. Funding for refugee assistance was provided in P.L. 111-117 for FY2010. The devastation caused by the 2010 Haiti earthquake led to U.S. policies on Haitian migration being reconsidered. Temporary Protected Status (TPS) was granted to Haitians in the U.S. at the time of the earthquake. Additionally, a program was established to allow certain Haitian children to enter the U.S. for adoption. $220 million was provided to HHS for services under the Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2010. The Haitian Emergency Life Protection Act of 2010 (S. 2998/H.R. 4616) aimed to provide a nonimmigrant V visa to Haitian nationals with approved petitions for family-sponsored immigrant visas. However, no legislative action was taken on the bill. In intercountry adoptions, the law and process vary based on the Hague Convention on Protection of Children. P.L. 111-287 aims to equalize requirements for Convention and non-Convention countries, exempting adopted children from certain inoculations. It also allows U.S. citizens to adopt a child aged 16 or 17 from a Convention country if their sibling has been adopted. The provision in P.L. 111-287 allows a U.S. citizen to adopt a child aged 16 or 17 from a Convention country if the child's sibling has been adopted by that citizen. This provision is retroactive to April 1, 2008. Additionally, other bills in the 111th Congress aimed to exempt adopted children from certain inoculations and broaden the definition of child under the INA to allow for the adoption of children under 18. In response to the 2010 Haiti earthquake, USCIS established a temporary program to parole Haitian children eligible for adoption by U.S. citizens. The program allowed for immediate adjustment to LPR status for children paroled into the country under this program. The program allowed Haitian children eligible for adoption by U.S. citizens to immediately adjust to LPR status. Prior to P.L. 111-293, children granted parole needed to live in the U.S. for two years to become LPRs. The special immigrant category includes religious workers and certain Afghans employed by the U.S. government. Ministers of religion and religious workers are the largest group of special immigrants. Religious work is defined as employment related to traditional religious functions within a denomination. The provision for admitting religious workers is set to expire on September 30, 2012. Special immigrant status is also available for certain Afghans who worked for the U.S. government in Afghanistan after October 7, 2001, for at least one year and provided valuable service. The special immigrant program for certain Afghans who worked for the U.S. government is capped at 1,500 principal aliens annually. Concerns about illegal immigration have led to reexamination of U.S. citizenship laws. The case of Yaser Esam Hamdi, a U.S.-Saudi dual national captured in Afghanistan, is relevant in this context. Yaser Esam Hamdi, a U.S.-Saudi dual national captured in Afghanistan fighting with Taliban forces, has sparked interest in revising birthright citizenship laws. Some legislators are considering changes to the Citizenship Clause, while others support denying birth certificates to children of undocumented immigrants. Legal scholars have differing opinions on this matter. Some legislators are considering changes to the Citizenship Clause to exclude children of undocumented immigrants from birthright citizenship. Legislation in the 111th Congress aimed to amend the Constitution or the INA for this purpose, but no action was taken. Additionally, there is an immigrant visa program, known as the EB-5 visa, specifically for foreign investors coming to the United States. The EB-5 Regional Center Program was created to encourage investment in specific geographic areas through Regional Centers. The program has been extended multiple times, most recently through September 30, 2012. Legislation to permanently reauthorize the program was not included in the conference agreement. Additionally, a provision in P.L. 111-83 repeals the \"widow penalty\" for immigrant relative petitions. Upon the death of a U.S. citizen spouse, the immigrant relative petition may be revoked if the alien spouse had not been granted LPR status or admitted into the United States on an immigrant visa. USCIS interprets the definition of \"immediate relative\" to cease upon the death of the U.S. citizen spouse. However, if the couple had been married for at least two years, the immigrant petition is converted into a self-petition by the surviving spouse. The new law allows the surviving alien spouse of a deceased U.S. citizen to self-petition for an immigrant visa/adjustment to LPR status within two years of the citizen's death, regardless of the length of the marriage. USCIS has not issued new regulations but has revised guidelines and may extend the practice to include previously ineligible alien spouses. The new law (P.L. 111-83) allows alien spouses of deceased U.S. citizens to self-petition for an immigrant visa/adjustment to LPR status within two years of the citizen's death, regardless of the length of the marriage. It also provides relief for surviving relatives of deceased petitioners, allowing their pending or approved petitions to be adjudicated despite the petitioner's death, as long as the surviving relatives resided in the U.S. at the time of death. The new law (P.L. 111-83) allows alien spouses of deceased U.S. citizens to self-petition for an immigrant visa/adjustment to LPR status within two years of the citizen's death. Surviving relatives, including spouses, parents, minor children of U.S. citizens, and other eligible family members, can also have their pending or approved petitions adjudicated despite the petitioner's death if they resided in the U.S. at the time of death. Lawsuits challenging the widow penalty under the INA are ongoing, with some still pending despite the settlement of a class-action lawsuit. The new USCIS guidelines implement a statute allowing plaintiffs' claims to be processed accordingly. Class members in the Ninth Circuit can have their denied petitions reopened without additional fees. The new statute addresses a pending U.S. Supreme Court case regarding the classification of noncitizen spouses under the INA. The new statute allows surviving spouses of deceased U.S. citizens, married for less than two years, to obtain lawful permanent resident status. USCIS issued updated guidance, a fact sheet, and an updated petition form in response. Foreign medical graduates can enter the U.S. on J-1 visas for medical education and training. Foreign medical graduates (FMGs) on J-1 visas must return to their home countries for two years before applying for other visas or LPR status, unless granted a waiver through the Conrad State Program. This program, established in 1994 and extended multiple times, allows states to request waivers for FMGs. Concerns exist about the national security risks posed by alien smuggling into the U.S., as smugglers could potentially aid terrorists in entering undetected. Alien smuggling poses national security risks as terrorists may exploit existing smuggling routes to enter undetected. The main statute outlines penalties and evidentiary requirements for smuggling offenses. Legislation has been passed to increase penalties for individuals on maritime vessels who obstruct law enforcement during smuggling activities. Additionally, the House passed the Alien Smuggling and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2009 to address these concerns. The Alien Smuggling and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2009 (H.R. 1029) aimed to expand the scope of prohibited activities under the INA, strengthen criminal penalties for smuggling offenses, and assert extraterritorial jurisdiction. The SAVE Act (H.R. 3308, S. 1505) proposed similar amendments and increased investigative personnel for alien smuggling, along with establishing a reward program for information leading to arrests and convictions. P.L. 111-5 included a provision requiring H-1B employers receiving TARP funding to comply with stricter labor market rules. P.L. 111-230 temporarily increased filing fees for L and H-1B visas for certain employers. The new fee increases for H-1B and L visas are to be deposited into the General Fund of the Treasury to offset an increase in appropriated funds for border security. P.L. 111-306 amended the INA to require accreditation for language training programs accepting foreign students on F visas. The Improving Assistance to Domestic and Sexual Violence Victims Act of 2009 proposed amendments to the Violence Against Women Act of 1994 and the Omnibus Crime Control Act. S. 327 proposed amendments to the Violence Against Women Act and the Omnibus Crime Control Act to expand victim protections, including provisions for T and U nonimmigrants. Aliens admitted as refugees must apply for LPR status after one year, and asylees and refugees need one year of physical presence in the US to adjust status. Refugee Opportunity Act (S. 2960) aimed to add an exception to the physical presence requirement for certain cases. The Return of Talent Act (S. 2974) proposed allowing LPRs to temporarily return to their countries for reconstruction or medical services. S. 3113 aimed to exempt certain refugees and asylees who worked overseas for the U.S. government from the physical presence requirement for adjustment of status. The September 11 Family Humanitarian Relief and Patriotism Act of 2009 aimed to enable spouses and children of aliens who died in the September 11 attacks to adjust to LPR status without counting against numerical limits in the INA. A similar bill in the Senate received no action."
