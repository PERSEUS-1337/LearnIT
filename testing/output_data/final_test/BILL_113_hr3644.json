The Office of Management and Budget requires an annual budget request report from the applicable agency. If a review shows an improper payment rate of 0.00034 percent or less for a listed program, this section no longer applies to that program. SEC. 3 amends Section 1105(a) of title 31, United States Code by adding a new report requirement. The effective date for these amendments is October 1, 2014. SEC. 4 involves the rescission of funds. If an agency's report does not show a decrease in improper payment rates for a program, funds will be rescinded from the agency's budget based on the highest improper payment rate. The agencies included in the budget for various departments are: Department of Agriculture, Department of Health and Human Services, Department of Labor, Department of the Treasury, Social Security Administration, and Department of Veterans Affairs. The Department of Veterans Affairs is required to make proportional rescissions within each listed account to programs, projects, and activities. Each agency head listed in the budget must submit a report to Congress annually starting in fiscal year 2015. This section will be effective on October 1, 2014."
