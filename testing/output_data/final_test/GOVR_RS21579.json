Military cooperation includes Moroccan purchases of U.S. defense equipment and joint exercises like African Lion. Morocco urges the U.S. to expand ties, leading to a Bilateral Strategic Dialogue in 2012 covering political, economic, security, and educational/cultural cooperation. The United States has engaged in Strategic Dialogues with Algeria and Tunisia, with high-level sessions held in both countries. In November 2013, King Mohammed VI visited Washington, DC, meeting with President Obama to emphasize support for Morocco's reforms and bilateral cooperation. Vice President Joe Biden also visited Morocco in November 2014 for the Global Entrepreneurship Summit. The U.S. has not recognized Morocco's claim of sovereignty over Western Sahara or the self-proclaimed government-in-exile, the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic. The Obama Administration supports Morocco's proposal for regional autonomy in Western Sahara, while also backing UN-facilitated negotiations between Morocco and the independence-seeking Polisario. Congressional hearings have examined US policy towards Morocco. During the 113th Congress, hearings examined U.S. policy interests in Morocco and North Africa. The Moroccan royal dynasty has ruled since the 17th century, with King Mohammed VI leading a complex political system. In 2011, a new constitution was introduced to strengthen the legislature and judiciary, while preserving the king's role as the ultimate decision-maker. The Moroccan king retains ultimate decision-making power, heads the military, and holds the highest religious authority. The constitution grants some executive powers to the prime minister, but the king approves and may dismiss cabinet ministers. Despite reforms in 2011, the monarchy's political and economic prerogatives remain largely unchanged, with the king maintaining popular legitimacy and ensuring stability. The new constitution in Morocco may lead to political changes depending on interpretation and implementation. Justice sector reforms and decentralization have been slow. Gender equality and civil liberty protections are yet to be fully implemented. Protests have decreased since 2011, with some calling for deeper political changes. The bicameral legislature consists of an upper house and lower house. The bicameral legislature in Morocco consists of an upper house and a lower house. The lower house, the Chamber of Representatives, has reserved seats for women and candidates under 40. The Party for Justice and Democracy (PJD) won a plurality of seats in the 2011 elections, leading to the appointment of Abdelilah Benkirane as Prime Minister. Benkirane leads a multiparty government coalition focused on reforming the state pension system and subsidy programs. The PJD aims to replace subsidies with targeted aid for the poor and has influenced various policies, including cultural and educational, with a moderate stance. The party, recognized for two decades, gained cabinet positions in 2011 and is seen as more constituent-driven and anti-corruption. It faces opposition from pro-palace elites, potentially due to its interest in devolving power from the monarchy to elected government. The PJD, led by Prime Minister Benkirane, faces opposition from pro-palace elites and has limited influence over policymaking due to its slim legislative plurality and economic constraints. Despite a potential shared interest in democratization, mutual distrust between Moroccan Islamists and liberals hinders political cooperation. In 2013, Benkirane had to reshuffle the cabinet after a coalition member withdrew, leading to months of stalemate until the National Rally of Independents joined. The National Rally of Independents (RNI) joined the government, leading the PJD to relinquish key portfolios. The PJD is seen as weakened by these events, but some believe it can capitalize on being an underdog. Other Islamist movements, like Salafist groups and the Justice and Charity Organization (JCO), operate outside formal politics. The JCO, Morocco's largest grassroots organization, opposes the monarchy as un-Islamic and undemocratic, and is banned but tolerated for its non-violent activities. The Justice and Charity Organization (JCO) in Morocco, along with leftist groups, played a key role in the 2011 protest movement.

Critics argue that the antiterrorism laws are too broad and lack civil liberties protections. The U.N. Secretary-General has expressed concerns about rising insecurity in the Polisario-administered Western Sahara refugee camps in Tindouf, Algeria.
