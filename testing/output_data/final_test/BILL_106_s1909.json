    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Wartime Violation of Italian American Civil Liberties Act\" and includes findings related to the violation of civil liberties. During World War II, Italian Americans faced restrictions and violations of their civil liberties, including being branded as \"enemy aliens,\" carrying ID cards, travel restrictions, and seizure of property. Thousands were forced to leave their homes, subjected to curfews, arrested, and interned in military camps. Despite this, many Italian Americans served the United States with distinction and sacrifice. During World War II, Italian Americans faced restrictions and violations of their civil liberties, including being labeled as \"enemy aliens,\" ID cards, travel restrictions, and property seizures. The impact of this wartime experience was devastating to Italian American communities in the United States, with effects still being felt today. Information about these measures was deliberately kept from the public during the war, and even 50 years later, much remains classified and unknown to the public, without any official acknowledgment by the United States Government. SEC. 3. REPORT. The Inspector General of the Department of Justice will review the treatment of Italian Americans during World War II, submitting a report to Congress within a year. The report will detail Italian Americans taken into custody, interned, and ordered. The report will include the names of Italian Americans affected by the United States Army's \"Individual Exclusion Program\" and Executive Order 9066, as well as details of FBI raids on their homes, restrictions on fishermen, confiscation of boats, and prevention of railroad workers from working in certain zones. The report will detail civil liberties infringements suffered by Italian Americans during World War II due to Executive Order 9066, including internment, hearings without counsel, illegal searches, travel restrictions, employment restrictions, property confiscation, and forced evacuations. It will also explain why some Italian Americans were subjected to these infringements while others were not, and review wartime restrictions to improve civil liberties protection during national emergencies. The Congress acknowledges the civil liberties violations against Italian Americans during World War II under Executive Order 9066. The Congress acknowledges the need to tell the story of the treatment of Italian Americans during World War II, support projects to raise awareness of this history, and prevent similar injustices in the future. Federal agencies should back initiatives like conferences and exhibits on this topic. The bill proposes funding for traveling exhibits and documentaries to raise awareness of the treatment of Italian Americans during World War II. It also suggests the creation of an advisory committee and financial support for educational projects, including a documentary film for public broadcast. The United States Government formally acknowledges the injustice against Italian Americans during World War II."
