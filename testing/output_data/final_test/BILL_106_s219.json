    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Northern Border Trade Facilitation Act\" and its purpose is outlined in the findings. The Northern Border Trade Facilitation Act outlines findings regarding the US-Canada border, emphasizing the strong trading relationship between the two countries and the Shared Border Accord to promote efficient movement of goods and people. The Shared Border Accord between the United States and Canada aims to enhance border management, protect against illegal activities, and increase trade. This agreement has led to harmonization, shared training, and joint facilities between customs agencies, resulting in a significant increase in merchandise entries and cross-border traffic. For example, formal entries of merchandise on the Northern border have increased sixfold from 1,000,000 in 1980 to 6,000,000 in 1997, and the number of individuals crossing the border has more than doubled from 54,000,000 in 1989. The staffing and technology acquisitions of the Customs Service along the Northern border have not kept pace with increased trade and traffic. The number of authorized United States Customs inspectors has remained the same since 1980, leading to understaffing and congestion at border crossings. New technology for border management has been deployed primarily on the Northern border. Since 1952, the Customs Service has conducted preclearance activities in Canada, inspecting passengers and baggage before departure. This has helped facilitate movement across the United States-Canadian border. However, the Customs Service is now eliminating preclearance positions due to a perceived lack of statutory authority to fund them. The Customs Service is losing preclearance positions in Canada due to lack of funding authority. This could lead to increased congestion and delays at US ports. The purpose of the Act is to facilitate commerce and traffic across the US-Canadian border by authorizing funds for inspection lanes and advanced technology. The Customs Service is authorized to pay for preclearance positions in Canada and develop automated commercial systems using funds collected from passenger and merchandise processing fees to facilitate border traffic and commerce. Authorization of appropriations for the United States Customs Service to enhance inspection and trade facilitation along the US-Canadian border by opening all primary lanes during peak hours and increasing investigative resources. $75,896,800 for fiscal year 2000 and $43,931,790 for fiscal year 2001 are authorized. Authorization of appropriations for the United States Customs Service to increase border inspectors, special agents, and intelligence analysts at the US-Canadian border to enhance cargo processing and reduce waiting times. In fiscal year 2000, $26,582,000 is authorized for acquisition and deployment of cargo inspection equipment along the US-Canadian border, including Vehicle and Container Inspection Systems, mobile truck x-rays, pallet x-rays, portable contraband detectors, contraband detection kits, and portable Treasury Enforcement Communications Systems terminals. In fiscal year 2000, funds are allocated for various inspection equipment along the US-Canadian border, including narcotics detectors, fiber optic scopes, contraband detectors, x-ray vans, radio systems, vehicle counters, examination tool trucks, commuter lanes, targeting systems, and weigh-in-motion sensors. In fiscal year 2001, funds are allocated for the maintenance and support of communication systems for Customs personnel. The Commissioner of Customs may also use funds from fiscal year 2000 for acquiring technologically superior equipment that achieves similar results at the same or lower cost compared to existing equipment. The Commissioner of Customs may reallocate funds up to 10% from specified paragraphs in subsection (a) for equipment that can be obtained at a lower cost than the equipment described in subsection (a).
