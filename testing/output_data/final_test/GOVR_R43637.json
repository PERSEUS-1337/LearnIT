    "content": "Following the death of a worker beneficiary or insured worker, Social Security pays a $255 lump-sum death benefit to the surviving spouse or eligible dependent children. In 2016, around 782,300 of these payments were made, totaling about $204 million. The benefit amount has been capped at $255 since 1982, leading to a decline in real value over time. This benefit was not initially included in the Social Security Act of 1935 but was later added to provide some financial support to families of deceased workers. In 1939, a limited version of the lump-sum death benefit was added to the Social Security program, paid when no survivors benefits were given. The payment equaled six times the primary insurance amount and was made to family members or individuals who helped with funeral expenses. In 1950, eligibility for the payment was expanded to include cases where survivors benefits were also paid, ensuring the benefit was paid in nearly every death of a Social Security-insured worker. The lump-sum death benefit under the Social Security program was increased in 1950, with the formula changed to three times the primary insurance amount. The benefit was capped at $255 in 1954, and has remained unindexed since 1973. Payments have averaged $255 since 1982, with some variations based on earlier PIAs. The lump-sum death benefit under the Social Security program has been capped at $255 since 1982. Eligibility for the payment may be lower if the deceased was covered by a foreign system with a totalization agreement. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981 restricted eligibility for the benefit, reducing the number of payments made. If a surviving spouse is living with the worker at the time of death, the benefit is paid to the spouse. If not, the benefit can be paid to a child who is receiving or eligible to receive monthly benefits. The Social Security Administration pays a lump-sum death benefit of $255 to eligible children or surviving spouses of deceased workers. In 2016, $204 million was paid out for 782,300 deaths, with the benefit split among multiple recipients in some cases. Less than 42% of insured worker deaths resulted in a lump-sum death benefit payment due to a lack of eligible family members. The lump-sum death benefit payment has decreased in real value over the years since its introduction in 1954. In 1981, eligibility restrictions led to a significant decrease in the total payment amount from $394 million in 1980 to $203 million in 1982. The lump-sum death benefit payment decreased from $394 million in 1980 to $203 million in 1982, with the share dropping to 0.15% in 1982 and further declining to about 0.03% in 2016. The share is expected to continue decreasing as other benefits increase steadily. Administrative costs were estimated at $10 million in 2016. The lump-sum death benefit payment decreased from $394 million in 1980 to $203 million in 1982. In 2024, almost 900,000 lump-sum death benefits will be paid out, costing $217 million. Various proposals have been made to change or eliminate the death benefit, with President Carter's budget proposing a similar benefit for those eligible for Supplemental Security Income. The 1979 Advisory Council on Social Security recommended increasing the benefit to three times the PIA, but no more than $500. The council debated the Carter proposal to target the death benefit to those in greatest need, with a higher benefit of $625. The benefit is meant for special financial needs, not burial expenses. President Bush's FY2007 budget suggested eliminating the benefit due to high administrative costs and lack of meaningful monetary benefit for survivors. The Social Security death benefit has high administrative costs, estimated at $15 million annually, which is about 7% of the benefit outlays. Various proposals have been made to increase the benefit, such as expanding eligibility and raising the amount from $255 to $1,000 in different Congress sessions. In the 115th Congress, proposals were made to increase the lump-sum death benefit to 50% of the worker's PIA, but none have been enacted into law."
