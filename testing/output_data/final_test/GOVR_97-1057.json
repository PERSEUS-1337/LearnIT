    "content": "The United States Constitution grants Congress the power to establish uniform bankruptcy laws. The first bankruptcy law was enacted in 1800 due to financial panics, but was repealed in 1803. Subsequent bankruptcy laws in 1841, 1867, and 1898 were also short-lived, with periods of operation ranging from 16 to 20 years. The bankruptcy laws in the United States have evolved over time. The first law was enacted in 1800 and subsequent laws in 1841, 1867, and 1898 followed. The 1898 Act was amended in 1938 with the Chandler Act, which modernized relief provisions and established wage earner plans. Further changes were made in 1970 with the creation of a Commission on the Bankruptcy Laws. In 1970, a Commission was created to study and recommend changes to modernize bankruptcy laws. The final report was filed in 1973, leading to the enactment of the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978, replacing the outdated 1898 Act. The Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978 replaced the outdated 1898 Act and established the current Bankruptcy Code. Since then, the Code has undergone several major amendments, including the Bankruptcy Amendments and Federal Judgeship Act of 1984, the Bankruptcy Judges, United States Trustees, and Family Farmer Bankruptcy Act of 1986, and the Retiree Benefits Bankruptcy Protection Act of 1988. Amendments during the 101st Congress included technical changes affecting swap agreements and forward contracts. Legislation passed in 1990 and 1994 made amendments to the Bankruptcy Code, including changes to dischargeability of debts for driving while intoxicated, criminal restitution, and student loans. The Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1994 created a National Bankruptcy Review Commission to study and make recommendations for legislative action. The Commission issued a report in 1997 with 172 recommendations on bankruptcy reform, including consumer, business, and municipal bankruptcy. Despite a split vote on consumer bankruptcy, the 1994 Act allowed bankruptcy courts to conduct jury trials and created Bankruptcy Appellate Panels. Sanctions were also included for negligent or fraudulent bankruptcy. The 105th Congress considered bankruptcy reform legislation, including penalties for fraudulent petition preparers and additional penalties for bankruptcy fraud. Some provisions were enacted, such as the Religious Liberty and Charitable Donation Protection Act allowing debtors to make charitable donations before filing for bankruptcy. Other changes included narrowing the dischargeability of student loans and amending the automatic stay. The 106th and 107th Congresses continued to debate bankruptcy reform, but no major changes were enacted. The Code is divided into eight chapters. The U.S. Bankruptcy Code, under Title 11 of the United States Code, is divided into eight chapters governing general procedures and different forms of bankruptcy relief. Any debtor in the U.S. may file for relief under the Code, with specific exceptions. Entities eligible to file for relief under the Bankruptcy Code are limited, with specific restrictions for liquidation under chapter 7, reorganization under chapter 11, and chapter 13 reorganization for individuals with regular income and specific debt limits. Entities eligible to file for relief under the Bankruptcy Code are limited, with specific restrictions for liquidation under chapter 7, reorganization under chapter 11, and chapter 13 reorganization for individuals with regular income and specific debt limits. A voluntary case is commenced when the debtor files a petition under the operative chapter of the Code in which the debtor desires to proceed. An involuntary bankruptcy may be initiated by creditors under chapter 7 or 11 of the Code. Creditors may file a petition under the Bankruptcy Code, but it does not immediately force the debtor into bankruptcy. The debtor can challenge the petition in court, and until a decision is made, they can continue operating their business. The court may appoint a trustee if necessary to manage the debtor's estate. An order for relief may be entered if the debtor is not paying debts on time or if a custodian took possession of their property within 120 days before the petition was filed. The bankruptcy court may dismiss an involuntary petition against a debtor after trial and award costs, attorney's fees, and damages if filed in bad faith. It can also dismiss a case or suspend proceedings in the best interests of creditors. Attorneys representing debtors must file their compensation agreement with the court, which may be canceled if deemed excessive. Within a reasonable time after an order for relief is entered, the United States Trustee must convene and preside at a meeting of creditors. The Trustee may order a meeting of any equity security holders. In a chapter 7 case, the trustee must orally examine the debtor to ensure awareness of seeking a discharge in bankruptcy, effects on credit history, ability to file under a different chapter, receiving a discharge, and reaffirming a debt. The debtor must be available for examination under oath at the creditor's meeting. \"Use\" immunity may be granted to all. After notice, a case may be converted from one chapter to another without changing the original filing date or order for relief. Claims against the debtor before conversion are treated as prepetition claims. A debtor can convert a case from chapter 7 to chapters 11, 12, or 13, but not vice versa. Conversion terminates the trustee's services in the case. A debtor in possession of the estate can convert a chapter 11 case to chapter 7, unless it was filed involuntarily or already converted to chapter 11. The court can also convert a chapter 11 case to chapter 7 for various reasons, such as continuing loss of the estate or failure to meet reorganization plan requirements. Conversion to chapter 12 or 13 requires debtor's request, and conversion to chapter 7 can be done at the U.S. Trustee's request for non-compliance. A debtor under chapter 13 may convert a case to chapter 7 at any time. Property of the estate in the converted case consists of property as of the initial filing date. Conversion to another chapter can be requested \"for cause\" in chapter 13. The court may dismiss a case under Chapter 13 for various reasons, including unreasonable delay by the debtor, nonpayment of fees, or failure to provide necessary information. Dismissal does not prevent discharge of debts in a later case. Dismissal also reinstates prior custodianships, voided transfers, and revests estate property. The court may dismiss a Chapter 13 case for reasons such as unreasonable delay, nonpayment of fees, failure to provide necessary information, or other causes specified in the law. Dismissal can result from various factors, including debtor mismanagement, nonpayment of fees, failure to file a plan, or default under a confirmed plan. In a Chapter 13 case, the debtor's failure to file required information concerning consumer debt can lead to dismissal. Filing fees for bankruptcy cases range from $155 for Chapter 7 or 13 to $800 for Chapter 11 cases not involving a railroad. Fees can be paid in installments, and there are additional fees for converting cases. Chapter 11 debtors also pay quarterly fees based on disbursements. When the Bankruptcy Reform Act was enacted in 1978, one of its goals was to remove bankruptcy judges from case administration. The U.S. Trustee system was established to allow judges to focus on judicial matters. United States Trustees are appointed nationwide and are permitted to charge a percentage fee in Chapter 13 cases, not exceeding ten percent. The U.S. Trustee system, established in 1978, is nationwide and funded through bankruptcy filing and user fees. United States Trustees, appointed by the Attorney General, have administrative duties in chapters 7, 11, 12, and 13 bankruptcies. They oversee private trustees, appoint standing trustees when needed, and focus on case administration. The U.S. Trustee system, established in 1978, appoints standing trustees in chapter 12 or 13 cases. The U.S. Trustee reviews professional fee applications and can raise issues in any case under the Code. A trustee is appointed in chapter 7 and 13 cases, and in chapter 11 only \"for cause\" or in the best interest of creditors. The U.S. Trustee system appoints standing trustees in chapter 12 or 13 cases. Eligibility criteria for private trustees include residency in the judicial district, no prior service as an examiner, and filing a bond with the court. Trustees can employ professionals with court approval and may be removed for cause after notice and hearing. The court oversees compensation of professionals retained by a trustee in bankruptcy cases. Factors considered include the nature, extent, and value of services, time spent, and necessity of the services for the estate's completion. Compensation may be awarded at a rate less than requested. The court oversees compensation of professionals in bankruptcy cases based on factors like the nature and value of services, time spent, and necessity for estate completion. Limits are imposed on trustee compensation, with percentages set based on the amount disbursed by the bankruptcy estate. The automatic stay is triggered by an order for relief. The automatic stay, governed by 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 330(b), provides essential protection for debtors in bankruptcy by halting all collection efforts, harassment, and foreclosure actions. It allows debtors to work on repayment or reorganization plans and prevents creditors from pursuing individual remedies that could harm other creditors. The stay is triggered by the filing of an order for relief, which stops all prepetition proceedings. The automatic stay, under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 330(b), halts all prepetition proceedings upon the filing of an order for relief in bankruptcy. It stays actions such as enforcing judgments, obtaining possession of property, creating or enforcing liens, and collecting prepetition claims. Exceptions to the stay include criminal proceedings, paternity establishment, alimony actions, and collection from nonestate property. The automatic stay, under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 330(b), halts all prepetition proceedings upon the filing of an order for relief in bankruptcy. It stays actions such as enforcing judgments, obtaining possession of property, creating or enforcing liens, and collecting prepetition claims. Exceptions to the stay include criminal proceedings, paternity establishment, alimony actions, and collection from nonestate property. Other exceptions include actions to enforce governmental powers or judgments, set-off of mutual debts, specified transactions involving financial entities, tax-related audits and notices, and actions by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development in cases of insured loans under the National Housing Act. The automatic stay, as per 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362(a)&(b), halts various actions against the debtor's property, including actions by lessors for possession of nonresidential real property, dishonoring of negotiable instruments, state licensing agency actions, and creation of statutory liens for property taxes. Creditors can request the court to modify or terminate the stay for specific assets of the debtor. The court may grant relief to terminate, modify, annul, or condition a stay with respect to a specific asset of the debtor for cause, lack of adequate protection, or if the debtor has no equity in the property. If the court does not rule within 30 days from a request for relief, the stay is automatically terminated. Relief may be granted without a hearing when necessary. The court may grant relief without a hearing to prevent irreparable damage to an entity's property interest. The termination of a stay can occur if the property is no longer part of the estate. The stay continues until the case is closed, dismissed, or a discharge is granted or denied. The concept of \"adequate protection\" for a secured creditor's interest is based on the U.S. Supreme Court's protection of property interests. The Code outlines the rights of a trustee or debtor in possession to use, sell, or lease estate property in a liquidation or reorganization, with a focus on protecting secured creditors and other parties with interests in the property. The trustee may use, sell, or lease the property, subject to limitations and conditions, to ensure the secured creditor receives the equivalent value of their interest. The trustee may use, sell, or lease estate property with certain conditions, including notice and hearing requirements, consent of all parties involved, or court authority. The trustee can sell property free and clear of interests under specified conditions. The trustee in a bankruptcy case can obtain credit and incur debt in the ordinary course of business, with such credit treated as a high priority administrative expense. Court authorization is required for credit obtained or debt incurred outside the ordinary course of business. If necessary, the court may authorize additional priority for credit. The court may authorize additional priority for postpetition creditors, allowing them to receive priority over administrative expenses, a lien on unencumbered assets, or a junior lien on property already subject to a lien. Trustees can obtain credit secured by a senior or equal lien on property of the estate with court approval. They can also assume or reject executory contracts or leases to facilitate successful reorganization. The trustee has the power to assume or reject executory contracts or leases to facilitate reorganization, with conditions such as curing defaults and providing adequate assurance of future performance. Special rules apply to shopping center leases. The trustee must act within specified time frames and cannot assume a contract if nonbankruptcy law excuses the other party from performance without consent. In bankruptcy cases, the trustee must assume or reject executory contracts within specific time frames. In liquidation cases, the trustee must assume within 60 days, or the contract is deemed rejected. The Code invalidates clauses that automatically terminate contracts in bankruptcy. The trustee can assign contracts if allowed by nonbankruptcy law. Special provisions apply to leases of real and personal property. Contracts and leases in bankruptcy cases must be assumed or rejected within specific time frames. Rejection of a contract allows the other party to claim damages as a prepetition, unsecured claim. Utilities cannot discontinue service based solely on the bankruptcy filing or unpaid debts. The bankruptcy filing creates a bankruptcy estate with the debtor's property interests. The utility can discontinue service if adequate assurance of payment is not provided within 20 days of the order for relief. The court can adjust the deposit or security required for service. The bankruptcy estate includes property interests received by the trustee from various sources, such as a custodian, avoided transfers, or inheritance. It also includes income from estate property and any property interest acquired after the case begins. Excluded from the estate are certain powers of the debtor, lease interests in nonresidential real property that has ended, and eligibility for certain benefits. Certain interests in property may be excluded from the bankruptcy estate, such as oil and gas production payments, cash proceeds from money order sales, and spendthrift trusts. However, restrictions on transfers or conditions related to financial insolvency will not prevent property from becoming part of the estate. When a bankruptcy case is initiated, estate property must be delivered to the trustee, and debts owed to the estate must be paid to the trustee. The court can order disclosure of financial information related to the debtor. Exceptions exist for certain types of property, such as life insurance premium loans. When a custodian of the debtor's property becomes aware of the bankruptcy case, they are prohibited from making disbursements or taking actions, except to preserve the property. They must turn over the property to the trustee and provide an accounting. The bankruptcy court must protect entities to whom the custodian became obligated, compensate the custodian, and may surcharge them. The bankruptcy court may excuse compliance with requirements for custodians if it benefits creditors and equity holders. The trustee can nullify prepetition transfers to maximize the bankruptcy estate for equitable distribution among creditors. Constraints on avoidance powers protect commercial transactions. The trustee in a bankruptcy case has the power to avoid property transfers or obligations of the debtor that are voidable by certain creditors or purchasers, known as the \"strong arm clause\" in the Bankruptcy Code. This provision allows the trustee to assume the rights of hypothetical creditors or purchasers to prioritize interests to be avoided. The trustee in a bankruptcy case can avoid statutory liens that are not perfected or enforced against a bona fide purchaser, are for rent, or are a distress of rent lien. These liens, created under state law, establish priorities for distribution but are not incorporated into the federal bankruptcy scheme. The trustee's rights and powers under certain avoiding powers in the federal bankruptcy scheme are limited by a general statutory limitation. This limitation applies to statutory liens, preferences, fraudulent transfers, and obligations, as well as to the trustee's rights as a lien creditor. The trustee must act within two years after the case is filed or one year after the first trustee's appointment under chapter 7, 11, 12, or 13, whichever occurs first. If an interest holder can still perfect their lien against an intervening interest holder under applicable law at the time of the petition filing, they may do so against the trustee. The trustee's avoiding powers are limited by statutory limitations in federal bankruptcy law. If property seizure is required for perfection but not done, perfection can be achieved by notice to the trustee. The seller's right of reclamation can't be avoided if certain conditions are met. In a chapter 11 case, the court may allow the return of goods shipped before the case, with the creditor offsetting the purchase price against any prepetition claim. Additional restraints are placed on a trustee's avoiding powers when the debtor operates specified businesses. The trustee's avoiding powers are limited by statutory limitations in federal bankruptcy law, including restraints when the debtor operates specified businesses. A \"preference\" is a prebankruptcy transaction favoring one creditor, which the trustee may avoid to promote equality of distribution. A \"preference\" in bankruptcy law is a transaction that benefits one creditor over others, which the trustee can avoid to ensure fair distribution. Certain transactions, such as those involving new value or made in the ordinary course of business, are excluded from being considered preferences. A preference in bankruptcy law involves transactions that benefit one creditor over others, which the trustee can avoid to ensure fair distribution. Excluded transactions include those involving new value or made in the ordinary course of business. In bankruptcy law, a trustee can avoid certain transactions to ensure fair distribution, such as fixing a statutory lien, bona fide payments for alimony or child support, or transfers in cases with debts primarily consumer-related and under $600. The burden of proof lies with the trustee for avoidable transfers, while creditors must prove nonavoidable transfers. Fraudulent transfers involve intent to defraud creditors or occur while insolvent. The trustee can avoid transfers or obligations incurred in such situations. The trustee can avoid transfers or obligations incurred by the debtor within one year prior to the case if there was intent to defraud creditors or if the debtor received less than reasonably equivalent value. This applies if the debtor was insolvent, had unreasonably small capital, or intended to incur debts beyond their ability to repay. The trustee can also avoid transfers to a general partner if the debtor was insolvent at the time of the transfer. The trustee can avoid transfers or obligations incurred by the debtor within one year prior to the case if there was intent to defraud creditors or if the debtor received less than reasonably equivalent value. This applies if the debtor was insolvent, had unreasonably small capital, or intended to incur debts beyond their ability to repay. The transferee or obligee who takes for value and in good faith may retain the lien transferred or enforce any obligation incurred, to the extent of the value furnished to the debtor. Prepetition contributions to qualified religious or charitable organizations may not be avoided. The trustee can avoid transfers or obligations incurred by the debtor within one year prior to the case if there was intent to defraud creditors or if the debtor received less than reasonably equivalent value. This applies if the debtor was insolvent, had unreasonably small capital, or intended to incur debts beyond their ability to repay. The property of the debtor becomes property of the estate at the commencement of a case, and the trustee may avoid transfers that occur after the filing of the petition without court authorization. In an involuntary case, certain transactions may not be avoided if the transferee has given new value for the transfer. Additionally, a transfer of real property to a good faith purchaser outside the county where the case is commenced may not be avoided if fair value is paid and the purchaser is unaware of the case. The trustee may recover property transferred within two years of the date of transfer or case closure. Recovery can be sought from initial and subsequent transferees who received the property. Immediate or mediate transferees who took value without knowledge of avoidability may not be subject to recovery. The trustee may recover property transferred within two years of the date of transfer or case closure from initial and subsequent transferees. A transferee who takes value without knowledge of the avoidability may not be subject to recovery. If a transfer is avoidable and made for the benefit of an insider creditor, the trustee may not recover from a transferee who is not an insider. Good faith transferees retain a lien on the recovered property to secure the cost of any improvements made after the transfer. A proceeding against a subsequent transferee must be brought within one year after the avoidance of the transfer. Under the Bankruptcy Code, creditors may take security interests in after-acquired property, but the effect of such interests in postpetition property is governed by the Code. Generally, if a security agreement is entered into before the case begins, property acquired by the estate is not subject to the security interest extending to after-acquired property. However, if the agreement extends to property acquired before the case and its proceeds, the security interest may survive bankruptcy to cover after-acquired property. The security interest may survive bankruptcy to cover after-acquired property as specified in the security agreement and nonbankruptcy law, unless the court decides otherwise based on the case's equities. The Bankruptcy Code allows prepetition security agreements for property paid as rents for hotel or motel rooms to be treated as encumbered after-acquired property. Setoff, where one debt owed to the debtor is reduced by the debtor's debt, is generally permitted under the Code with some exceptions and restrictions. The Bankruptcy Code allows for setoff of debts owed to the debtor, with exceptions such as the automatic stay and trustee's rights. Offset is not allowed if the creditor's claim is not allowed or if certain conditions are met regarding the timing and purpose of the debt. The trustee may recover the setoff in certain cases. The trustee may recover a setoff if an insufficiency exists before the case begins. The trustee can abandon burdensome estate property after notice and hearing. Creditors can file a proof of claim, and the debtor must file a schedule of debt. The debtor is responsible for filing a schedule of debt and creditors. If a creditor fails to file a claim, the debtor, trustee, or anyone liable to the creditor may file a proof of claim. All unsecured creditors and equity security holders must file a proof of claim to be eligible for distribution in chapters 7 and 13. In chapter 11, the debtor's schedule of liabilities is sufficient unless the creditor disputes the claim amount. In bankruptcy cases, creditors must file a proof of claim within a specified time frame. The court determines the amount of a disputed claim after a hearing. Certain types of claims are disallowed, such as those for unmatured interest or services exceeding reasonable value. The curr_chunk discusses various types of claims that are disallowed in bankruptcy cases, including claims for unmatured and nondischargeable alimony, maintenance, support, damages from lease termination, damages from employment contract termination, and reduction of credit due to late payment. In bankruptcy cases, claims for employment taxes on wages, salaries, or commissions earned from the debtor must be timely filed. Government unit claims are timely if filed within 180 days after the order for relief. Contingent and unliquidated claims may be estimated if they delay case administration. Certain types of claims, such as those arising in the debtor's business before the order for relief, are treated as prepetition claims. Claims from rejected executory contracts are also included. In bankruptcy cases, claimants may file for payment of administrative expenses, which are high priority claims paid first out of the debtor's assets. These expenses include costs of preserving the estate, wages, salaries, commissions, and certain taxes. Payment of administrative expenses requires notice and hearing. In bankruptcy cases, administrative expenses include taxes incurred by the estate, compensation for trustees and professional persons, necessary expenses of creditors, contributions in chapter 9 or 11 cases, and reasonable compensation for services rendered. In bankruptcy cases, administrative expenses include taxes incurred by the estate, compensation for trustees and professional persons, necessary expenses of creditors, contributions in chapter 9 or 11 cases, and reasonable compensation for services rendered. The bankruptcy court may determine the amount or legality of taxes, fines, or penalties related to tax. Fee splitting among trustees, examiners, professionals, attorneys, and accountants is generally prohibited, except for partners and associates in the same professional association and attorneys for petitioning creditors in an involuntary case. The bankruptcy court may determine taxes, fines, or penalties related to tax. The trustee can request a determination of unpaid tax liability by submitting a tax return. Secured creditors are only secured to the extent of the property value. 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 505 governs tax refunds and discharge of tax liabilities for trustees and debtors. Secured creditors are only secured to the extent of the property value. An undersecured creditor's claim is bifurcated into an allowed secured claim and an unsecured claim. Oversecured creditors may receive interest and reasonable fees. The trustee can recover costs from collateral, but nonpriority unsecured creditors may receive only a small percentage of what is due. Bankruptcy priorities dictate payment order for claims, with nonpriority claims paid after priority claims. In reorganizations, plans must consider distributions to unsecured creditors as per statute requirements. Priority distribution of funds in bankruptcy cases is outlined by statute. Administrative expenses come first, followed by \"involuntary gap\" creditors. Third priority is for unsecured claims for wages, salaries, or commissions up to $4925 per individual. Fourth priority is similar. Priority distribution in bankruptcy cases is outlined by statute, with administrative expenses taking precedence, followed by \"involuntary gap\" creditors. Third priority is for unsecured claims for wages, salaries, or commissions up to $4925 per individual. Fourth priority is similar, governing unsecured claims for contributions to an employee benefit plan within 180 days before the filing or cessation of the debtor's business. The sixth priority in bankruptcy cases is for unsecured claims of individuals up to $2225 arising from deposits for property or services not delivered. The seventh priority has no monetary limit and is for claims related to alimony or support. The eighth priority covers unsecured claims by governmental units for various taxes. The ninth priority has no monetary limit and is for unsecured claims based on commitments to Federal depository institutions regulatory. The Code grants a \"super\" priority to secured creditors for losses incurred during the automatic stay or in credit transactions with a trustee. An additional \"super\" priority exists for administrative expenses after conversion to chapter 7. Codebtors who pay a claim are subrogated to the creditor's rights. The court must subordinate the claim of a surety or codebtor to a creditor of the estate. The bankruptcy court can subordinate the claim of a surety or codebtor to a creditor of the estate if the creditor has not been paid in full. Subordination agreements are enforceable in bankruptcy and principles of equitable subordination apply, where claims may be subordinated if the holder is guilty of inequitable conduct. The debtor has specific duties to fulfill, including filing a list of creditors, assets and liabilities, and a financial statement with the court. The debtor in bankruptcy must file a statement of financial affairs, disclose intention to retain or surrender property, cooperate with the trustee, surrender estate property, and appear at discharge hearings. The law allows debtors to keep a minimum amount of money and property necessary for survival. The bankruptcy law allows debtors to retain a minimum amount of money and property for a \"fresh start.\" Congress permits debtors to choose between federal and state exemptions, with some states denying the use of federal exemptions. When a debtor's state allows federal exemptions, they can retain up to $18,450 in real or personal property. The debtor can retain various interests in property, including a residence, motor vehicle, household goods, jewelry, tools of the trade, and life insurance, up to specified dollar amounts. The debtor can retain various interests in property, including life insurance contracts, health aids, social security benefits, pension benefits, and personal injury awards. The debtor can retain various interests in property, including personal injury awards not exceeding $18,450 for actual compensation. Exempt property is protected from prepetition claims, with exceptions such as certain taxes, alimony, and debts secured by nonavoidable liens. In bankruptcy, debtors may avoid certain judicial and nonpossessory liens on exemptible property, even if state law allows the encumbrance. The 1994 amendments to the Code provide a limited exception to this rule for debtors limited to state law exemptions. In bankruptcy, debtors may avoid certain judicial and nonpossessory liens on exemptible property. State law exemptions may limit this principle, especially for implements, professional books, or tools of the trade valued over $5,000. A lien impairs an exemption if it exceeds the value of the debtor's interest in the property without any liens. Waiver of an exemption in favor of an unsecured claim is unenforceable. In bankruptcy, a discharge grants the debtor a \"fresh start\" by extinguishing prepetition debt. The Code specifies dischargeable and nondischargeable debts, with the latter subject to case-by-case examination by the court. A discharge voids judgments on personal liability for prepetition debts and prohibits actions to collect debts from the debtor or their property. The bankruptcy court can establish a trust to settle future personal injury claims related to asbestos exposure, as authorized by the Code. Reaffirmation of dischargeable debt is enforceable under nonbankruptcy law if made before discharge and not rescinded within thirty days. The court scrutinizes reaffirmation agreements by individuals. When entering into a reaffirmation agreement, the court ensures the debtor understands their rights under Title 11 and the consequences. Approval is required if the debtor was not represented by an attorney, ensuring it does not cause undue hardship and is in the debtor's best interest. Certain debts are not dischargeable under chapters 7, 11, and 13, and the court determines the dischargeability of other debts. Certain debts are not dischargeable under chapters 7, 11, and 13, including customs duties, fraudulently prepared taxes, debts not listed by the debtor, debts to spouses or children for support, fines or penalties to governmental units, and educational benefit overpayments. Certain debts are not dischargeable under chapters 7, 11, and 13, including debts for an educational benefit overpayment or loan made by a governmental unit, debts arising from death or personal injury caused by the debtor's operation of a motor vehicle while legally intoxicated, debts that could have been listed in a prior bankruptcy case, and debts arising from fraud or defalcation while acting in a fiduciary capacity. Certain debts are not dischargeable under chapters 7, 11, and 13, including debts for an educational benefit overpayment or loan made by a governmental unit, debts arising from death or personal injury caused by the debtor's operation of a motor vehicle while legally intoxicated, debts that could have been listed in a prior bankruptcy case, and debts arising from fraud or defalcation while acting in a fiduciary capacity. The debtor may also be responsible for debts incurred while acting in a fiduciary capacity with respect to a depository institution or insured credit union, malicious or reckless failure to fulfill a commitment to a federal depository institutions regulatory agency, restitution orders under Title 18 of the U.S. Code, taxes owed to the United States, postpetition fees or assessments from a condominium or cooperative membership association, court-imposed costs, expenses, or fees for filing a case, motion, complaint, or appeal. Certain types of debt may be discharged unless, at the request of a creditor, the court finds the debt to be nondischargeable, such as debts obtained by false pretenses, false representation, or actual fraud. This includes debts related to violation of securities laws, common law fraud, deceit, or manipulation in connection with the purchase or sale of securities. Debts may be discharged unless found to be nondischargeable by the court, such as debts incurred through false pretenses, false representation, or fraud. This includes debts for luxury goods or services exceeding $1,225 within sixty days before bankruptcy, cash advances over $1,225 within the same period, fraud or embezzlement debts, willful and malicious injury debts, and debts from divorce unless the debtor lacks the means to pay. The bankruptcy code allows for the discharge of debts unless they are found to be nondischargeable by the court, such as those incurred through false pretenses, false representation, or fraud. Certain conditions must be met for debt discharge, including the ability to pay the debt from income or property not necessary for the debtor's maintenance, or if discharging the debt benefits the debtor more than the detrimental consequences to others. Additionally, a governmental unit cannot discriminate against a debtor solely based on insolvency or bankruptcy filing. The Bankruptcy Code prohibits discrimination in employment or loan approval based on a person's bankruptcy status. Lenders can still consider bankruptcy when extending credit, and credit reporting agencies can report bankruptcy actions for up to 10 years. The Bankruptcy Code prohibits discrimination in employment or loan approval based on bankruptcy status. Lenders can consider bankruptcy when extending credit, and credit reporting agencies can report bankruptcy actions for up to 10 years. In a chapter 7 liquidation, a trustee is appointed to oversee the consolidation and distribution of the estate. Credit transactions over $50,000, life insurance underwriting over $50,000, and employment over $20,000 are exempt from the 10-year limit on bankruptcy actions. In a chapter 7 bankruptcy, a trustee is appointed to oversee the distribution of the estate. The trustee must be elected by general unsecured creditors holding 20% of the claims, and if not elected, the United States Trustee may appoint an interim trustee. The trustee must collect and liquidate the property of the estate. In a chapter 7 bankruptcy, the trustee appointed must collect and liquidate the property of the estate. The trustee is responsible for various tasks such as closing the estate promptly, being accountable for all received property, investigating the debtor's financial affairs, examining proofs of claims, opposing discharge if necessary, and providing requested information about the estate. If the debtor's business is operating, the trustee must file periodic reports with the court and relevant tax units. In a chapter 7 bankruptcy, the trustee appointed must collect and liquidate the property of the estate. The trustee is responsible for closing the estate promptly, investigating the debtor's financial affairs, and providing information about the estate. Unsecured creditors may elect a creditors' committee to consult with the trustee and make recommendations. The court may authorize the trustee to operate the debtor's business for a limited period if it benefits the estate. The trustee in a chapter 7 bankruptcy may operate the debtor's business for a limited period. The debtor can redeem personal property from a dischargeable consumer debt lien. General partners in a partnership debtor are personally liable for any deficiency in partnership assets. The trustee can seek recovery from nondebtor partners and may order them to indemnify the estate. The trustee in a chapter 7 bankruptcy can recover surplus from general partners' estates. The trustee can avoid liens for fines or penalties not related to pecuniary loss. The Code prioritizes distribution of property, subordinating certain tax liens. In a chapter 7 bankruptcy, distribution of property is prioritized according to the Bankruptcy Code. Unsecured claims, tax liens, allowed claims, and administrative expenses are paid in a specific order. In chapter 7 bankruptcy, distribution of property follows a specific order. Claims are paid pro rata within a class when funds are insufficient. Superpriority is given to administrative expenses in chapter 7 over other chapters. Community property of the debtor and spouse is handled separately. The discharge in bankruptcy is crucial for the debtor's \"fresh start\" and is granted unless specific conditions are met, such as fraudulent actions or false statements by the debtor. The debtor may be denied discharge in bankruptcy if they engage in fraudulent actions, present false claims, withhold financial information, fail to explain asset deficiencies, refuse to obey court orders, or commit specified acts within a certain timeframe. The debtor may be denied discharge in bankruptcy for various reasons, including fraudulent actions, false claims, withholding financial information, failure to explain asset deficiencies, refusal to obey court orders, or committing specified acts within a certain timeframe. A discharge may also be denied if the debtor has been granted a discharge in a previous bankruptcy case within a certain timeframe, unless certain conditions are met, or if the court approves a written waiver of discharge executed by the debtor. Debts and liability on claims before the order for relief can lead to discharge revocation if obtained through fraud. Revocation can also occur if the debtor acquires estate property and fails to report it, disobeys court orders, or refuses to testify. Complaint for revocation must be made within one year of discharge grant. The court may revoke a discharge if obtained through fraud or if the debtor fails to report estate property, disobeys court orders, or refuses to testify. Complaint for revocation must be made within one year of discharge grant. Chapter 7 debtors must file tax returns for the period until the order for relief is entered. Chapter 11 allows for reorganization for eligible individuals or businesses. Chapter 11 bankruptcy is more complex and costly compared to chapters 12 or 13, involving creditor committees, professional assistance, creditor votes, and securities exchange. The Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1994 streamlined procedures for small business reorganizations in Chapter 11. Small business debtors can skip creditor committees, have a 100-day exclusivity period to file a plan, and benefit from more lenient disclosure and acceptance solicitation rules. The statutory requirements for a chapter 11 reorganization include the appointment of a committee of unsecured claim holders by the U.S. Trustee. A small business debtor can request a waiver of the creditors committee appointment. The committee is typically composed of creditors with the seven largest claims of the same kind. The U.S. Trustee appoints a creditors' committee in a chapter 11 reorganization. The committee can employ professionals, consult with the trustee, investigate the debtor's financial condition, participate in plan formulation, and request the appointment of a trustee or examiner if needed. The court may order the appointment of a trustee or examiner in a chapter 11 case for reasons such as fraud, incompetence, or in the interest of creditors. An examiner may investigate allegations of misconduct if it benefits creditors or if the debtor's debts to an insider are significant. The court may appoint a trustee or examiner in a chapter 11 case for reasons like fraud, incompetence, or in the interest of creditors. The trustee must account for all property received, examine proofs of claims, furnish information requested by parties, file reports on the debtor's business operation, and make a final report of the estate. The trustee in a chapter 11 case is responsible for collecting taxes, filing reports with the court, investigating the debtor's conduct and financial condition, and submitting a reorganization plan or recommending conversion or dismissal. The debtor in possession in a chapter 11 case is required to perform duties similar to those of a trustee, such as filing reports, submitting a reorganization plan, and complying with court orders. They have the rights of a trustee with limitations set by the court, excluding investigative and reporting duties. The business of a chapter 11 debtor can continue to operate unless the court decides otherwise. In a chapter 11 case, the debtor's business can continue to operate without needing court authorization. The Securities and Exchange Commission, creditors, equity security holders, and other parties have the right to be heard in the reorganization case. Unsecured creditors and equity security holders do not need to file a proof of claim unless it is disputed, contingent, or unliquidated. Secured claims are treated as recourse claims, even if they are non-recourse. In chapter 11 cases, secured creditors can have unsecured claims for deficiencies, with the option to be treated as secured up to the allowable claim amount. This preferred status can be lost if the collateral is sold or if the class elects not to be treated as secured. In chapter 11 cases, secured creditors can have unsecured claims for deficiencies, with the option to be treated as secured up to the allowable claim amount. This preferred status can be lost if the collateral is sold or if the class elects not to be treated as secured. If the election is made, the claim is a secured claim to the extent that such claim is allowed. Prior to 1984, collective bargaining agreements were considered executory contracts that could be rejected by a debtor. Congress enacted a statute to prescribe procedures for altering or terminating such agreements in response to court interpretations. In chapter 11 cases, secured creditors can have unsecured claims for deficiencies, with the option to be treated as secured up to the allowable claim amount. This preferred status can be lost if the collateral is sold or if the class elects not to be treated as secured. Collective bargaining agreements can be altered or terminated through good faith negotiations, with the court scheduling a hearing within fourteen days of an application to reject the agreement. The court must rule on the application within thirty days, considering if necessary information was provided and if the proposal was refused without justification. In chapter 11 cases, secured creditors can have unsecured claims for deficiencies, with the option to be treated as secured up to the allowable claim amount. Collective bargaining agreements can be altered or terminated through good faith negotiations, with the court scheduling a hearing within fourteen days of an application to reject the agreement. The court may authorize interim changes in a collective bargaining agreement if essential for the debtor's business continuation or to avoid irreparable damage to the estate. Section 1114 of the Code deals with the treatment of a corporate debtor's employees, specifically retirees, during reorganization, prohibiting termination of retirees' benefits without court permission or retiree consent. The court may modify retiree benefits if the debtor fulfills disclosure and negotiation requirements, and if the modification is necessary for reorganization. The court cannot lower benefits below what the debtor proposed. The court may authorize modifications to retiree benefits if necessary for reorganization, with a hearing scheduled within fourteen days of filing. Interim modifications can be allowed to prevent irreparable damage to the estate. Retiree benefit payments before plan confirmation are considered high priority expenses and cannot be deducted from unpaid claims. The debtor may file a plan with the petition in a voluntary case, or at any time in a voluntary or involuntary case. After the order for relief is entered, the debtor has an exclusive 120 day period to file a plan. Any other party in interest, other than a U.S. Trustee, may file a plan if certain conditions are met. The court may extend the 120-day and 180-day periods for filing a plan \"for cause.\" A small business debtor has a 100-day exclusive period to file a plan, with all plans required to be filed within 160 days of the order for relief. The reorganization plan must place each claim or interest in a class that is substantially similar. The reorganization plan must designate classes of claims and interests, specify treatment for impaired classes, provide means for implementation, and be confirmed based on statutory criteria. The reorganization plan may involve retention, transfer, merger, sale, lien satisfaction, default modification, securities issuance, and charter amendment. The reorganization plan must include provisions for voting power distribution, election of directors for preferred equity classes, and selection of officers consistent with creditor and equity holder interests and public policy. It can impair or leave unimpaired claims and interests, and must address executory contracts and leases. The reorganization plan must address executory contracts, unexpired leases, settlement of claims, sale of estate property, modification of secured and unsecured claims, and other provisions consistent with the Code. The reorganization plan must address various aspects such as executory contracts, unexpired leases, settlement of claims, sale of estate property, and modification of secured and unsecured claims. An \"impaired\" claim in bankruptcy is one that is materially affected by the reorganization plan, giving impaired creditors a greater role in accepting or rejecting the plan. To be unimpaired, a claim must either maintain the holder's rights or cure a default. The reorganization plan in bankruptcy must address executory contracts, unexpired leases, settlement of claims, sale of estate property, and modification of secured and unsecured claims. An \"impaired\" claim is materially affected by the plan, giving impaired creditors a greater role in accepting or rejecting it. To be unimpaired, a claim must maintain the holder's rights or cure a default. The debtor must provide creditors with information about the proposed plan and solicit votes accepting it, with court approval required for vote solicitation. A small business debtor may solicit acceptances based on a disclosure statement conditionally approved by the bankruptcy court and mailed to creditors at least 10 days before the confirmation hearing. The disclosure statement must contain adequate information for creditors to make an informed judgment about the plan, but does not need to include information about other possible plans. The court's decision on the adequacy of the disclosure statement is not based on a valuation of the debtor or assets, although in some cases a valuation may be necessary. The court's decision on the adequacy of a disclosure statement is not influenced by nonbankruptcy laws. The Securities and Exchange Commission or other relevant agencies can provide input but cannot appeal the approval of the statement. Individuals involved in soliciting or participating in securities activities under a bankruptcy plan are not liable for securities law violations. Claim and interest holders, including the Secretary of the Treasury, can accept or reject a plan. The Secretary of the Treasury, along with other claim and interest holders, can accept or reject a reorganization plan. Acceptance or rejection is valid if solicitation complies with nonbankruptcy laws or adequate information disclosure under the Code. Postpetition solicitation has certain presumptions, where a class is deemed to accept a plan if not impaired, and solicitation may not be required. If a class does not entitle holders to payment, they are deemed to reject the plan. Acceptance by a class requires two-thirds in amount of creditors, excluding those not acting in good faith. The proponent of a reorganization plan can modify it before confirmation, and after confirmation with court approval. The plan must comply with Chapter 11 provisions on claims classification, plan contents, and disclosure. Pre-confirmation modifications become the plan upon filing, while post-confirmation changes require court confirmation after notice and hearing. Acceptance of a plan by a class requires two-thirds in amount of creditors acting in good faith. The court holds a confirmation hearing for a reorganization plan, where objections can be raised. To confirm the plan, it must meet statutory requirements, including compliance with Chapter 11 provisions, good faith proposal, and reasonable payments. The reorganization plan must be disclosed to the court, reasonable, and approved if payment is fixed after confirmation. The proponent must disclose the identity of proposed officers and insiders, and any rate changes must be approved by regulatory commissions. Each holder of a claim or interest must accept the plan or receive a specified amount. The reorganization plan must be disclosed to the court, reasonable, and approved if payment is fixed after confirmation. Each holder of a claim or interest must accept the plan or receive property of a value not less than in a chapter 7 liquidation. Undersecured creditors can elect treatment as secured or unsecured. Each class must accept the plan or not be impaired. The plan must provide for each holder of an administrative expense. The reorganization plan must provide cash or deferred payments for different types of claims, ensuring that each holder receives the allowed amount. Confirmation of the plan should not lead to liquidation or further financial reorganization. The reorganization plan must ensure fair treatment for all types of claims, with secured creditors retaining their lien and receiving deferred cash payments equal to the value of their claim. The court may confirm a plan even if some creditors reject it, as long as it is fair and equitable. The reorganization plan must ensure fair treatment for all types of claims, with secured creditors retaining their lien and receiving deferred cash payments equal to the value of their claim. Unsecured creditors must receive property of a value equal to the allowed amount of their claim. Each class of interests must receive or retain property of a value equal to the greater of the allowed liquidation preference, redemption price, or nothing for junior interest holders. The court may confirm only one reorganization plan, considering the preferences of creditors and equity security holders. When confirming a submitted plan, the court must consider creditors' preferences and equity security holders. The plan cannot be confirmed if its main purpose is tax avoidance or avoiding federal securities law provisions. Once confirmed, the plan binds the debtor, entities issuing securities or acquiring property, impaired and unimpaired creditors, equity security holders, and general partners. Confirmation vests all estate property in the debtor, free from creditor claims. The debtor is discharged from all debts existing at the time of filing and those arising before confirmation. Confirmation of a plan in bankruptcy binds the debtor and various parties, discharges existing debts, and vests estate property in the debtor. However, certain debts are not discharged, and the confirmation order can be revoked within 180 days if obtained through fraud. The court may revoke a confirmation order in bankruptcy if obtained through fraud, which would also revoke the debtor's discharge. The court can direct parties to execute necessary instruments for property transfer and perform acts for plan consummation. There is a five-year limitation for presenting securities after confirmation. The Bankruptcy Code grants limited exemptions from registration requirements for the offer or sale of securities under a plan. Failure to take required actions may bar participation in distribution under the plan. The Bankruptcy Code provides exemptions for the offer or sale of securities under a plan, including limited exemptions for certain transactions. Failure to comply with requirements may prevent participation in the distribution under the plan. For tax purposes, the taxable period of an individual debtor under chapter 11 ends on the date of the order for relief unless converted from chapter 7. The trustee must file income tax returns for the estate during pending cases. The issuance of a security under a confirmed plan is not subject to stamp tax. The court can authorize a request for tax effect determination from state authorities. Chapter 13 offers a streamlined process for individual reorganization. Chapter 13 offers a more expedited and streamlined procedure for individual reorganization compared to chapter 11. It requires the participation of a standing trustee and does not involve creditor committees or voting on the reorganization plan. Only the debtor can propose the plan, which must be completed within three to five years. A discharge of indebtedness is granted upon completion of all payments. Chapter 13 also includes an automatic stay to prevent creditor collection activities. Chapter 13 imposes a stay on creditor collection efforts against those liable with the debtor to protect the debtor from indirect pressures. Creditors cannot collect consumer debts from individuals liable with the debtor unless certain conditions are met. Creditors can still preserve their rights under nonbankruptcy law. The court may grant relief from the stay in Chapter 13 if the codebtor received the consideration for the claim, the debtor's plan does not pay the claim, or the creditor's interest would be harmed. If the court does not rule on the request within twenty days, the stay will be terminated unless an objection is filed. The U.S. Trustee can appoint a standing trustee or a disinterested individual to serve. The trustee must perform various duties as the principal administrator in the case. The trustee, as principal administrator in a Chapter 13 case, must be accountable for all property received, investigate the debtor's financial affairs, examine proofs of claims, oppose discharge if advisable, furnish requested information, file a final report, appear at relevant hearings, advise and assist the debtor in plan performance, and ensure timely payments are made. The trustee in a Chapter 13 case must oversee the debtor's financial affairs, investigate the debtor's business operations, and report to the court. The debtor can sell estate property with or without a hearing, as long as creditor interests are protected. The Code allows a self-employed debtor to operate their business under Chapter 13, as long as the business debts are included in the bankruptcy. The debtor can continue to use, sell, or lease property without court approval, unless ordered otherwise. The debtor in Chapter 13 bankruptcy can operate their business and use property without court approval, except for cash collateral which requires consent or court authorization. They can incur unsecured debt as an administrative expense and file reports on their business operations. 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1304 allows for the filing of claims for taxes or consumer debts that arise during a Chapter 13 bankruptcy case. Claims must be necessary for the debtor's performance, and approval is required if the trustee's prior consent was feasible but not obtained. Chapter 13 bankruptcy allows debtors to keep earnings from services performed during the case. Debtors can retain possession of estate property, including documents. Only the debtor can file a reorganization plan, which must be submitted within 15 days of the petition. The Chapter 13 bankruptcy plan must include provisions for future earnings, full payment of priority claims, equal treatment of claims within a class, and fair classification of unsecured claims. It can also modify rights of claimholders, except for claims secured by real property. The Chapter 13 bankruptcy plan must include provisions for a security interest in the debtor's principal residence, curing or waiving defaults, concurrent payments on secured and unsecured claims, curing defaults on claims, payment of postpetition claims, assumption or rejection of contracts and leases, payment of claims from the debtor's property, vesting of estate property, and other provisions consistent with the Code. The plan cannot exceed three years unless approved by the court for cause, with a maximum of five years. The Chapter 13 bankruptcy plan must include provisions for a security interest in the debtor's principal residence, curing defaults, concurrent payments on claims, payment of postpetition claims, assumption or rejection of contracts and leases, payment of claims from the debtor's property, and other provisions consistent with the Code. The court may approve a plan for a longer period, not exceeding five years. A debtor can cure a default on a lien for their principal residence until it is sold at foreclosure. Payments proposed by the plan must begin within 30 days of filing, and if the plan is confirmed, the trustee will distribute payments accordingly. The Chapter 13 bankruptcy plan must include provisions for payments to creditors, trustee fees, and administrative expenses. The debtor can modify the plan before confirmation, with acceptance or rejection by creditors. Modifications become part of the plan unless they change creditor rights. The court will confirm a Chapter 13 bankruptcy plan if it complies with all Code provisions, filing fees are paid, proposed in good faith, and meets criteria for distribution of property to creditors. The Chapter 13 bankruptcy plan will be confirmed if the property to be distributed on account of a claim is not less than the allowed amount of the claim, or if the debtor surrenders the property securing the claim. The plan must ensure the debtor can make all payments and that disposable income will be used for payments under the plan. \"Disposable income\" is defined as income not necessary for the debtor's maintenance, support, and necessary business expenses. Maintenance and support in Chapter 13 bankruptcy includes charitable contributions of up to 15% of the debtor's gross annual income. The court can order income received by the debtor to be paid to the trustee. A confirmed plan binds the debtor and creditors, vests estate property in the debtor, and allows for modifications to the plan before completion of payments. In Chapter 13 bankruptcy, the court can modify payment terms for creditors, extend payment timelines, and consider other sources of payment. A confirmed plan binds both debtor and creditors, allows for plan modifications within three to five years, and can be revoked within 180 days if fraud is involved. Failure to confirm a modified plan may result in case dismissal or conversion to Chapter 7 or Chapter 11. In Chapter 13 bankruptcy, the court can modify payment terms for creditors, extend payment timelines, and consider other sources of payment. After completing payments under the plan, the court grants the debtor a discharge of debts, with some exceptions like debts to a spouse, criminal fines, and student loans. The discharge in Chapter 13 is potentially broader than in other chapters like 7, 11, or 12. In Chapter 13 bankruptcy, the court may modify payment terms for creditors and extend payment timelines. The debtor can receive a discharge of debts, except for debts to a spouse, criminal fines, and student loans. The discharge may still be granted even if all payments under the plan are not completed, under certain circumstances. A hardship discharge in Chapter 13 bankruptcy relieves the debtor from unsecured debts under the plan, but not debts under \u00a7 523(a). Long term debts not due until after final payment are also not discharged. The \"superdischarge\" is not available with a nonperforming hardship discharge. Postpetition consumer debts require trustee approval to be discharged. The court can revoke the discharge within one year if obtained through fraud. The court may revoke a Chapter 13 bankruptcy discharge if obtained through fraud, even after it has been granted."
