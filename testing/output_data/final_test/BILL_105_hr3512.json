    "content": "The \"Pay for Your Stay Act\" requires prisoners to work. The \"Pay for Your Stay Act\" mandates that Federal prisoners must work at least 48 hours a week, engage in educational study for 12 hours a week, restrict television viewing to educational programs only, and have a 25 percent assessment on their wages with portions allocated for prosecution costs, victim restitution, and a designated Fund. The James Wilson, Jr. Fund is established in the Treasury with 10 percent of moneys placed in it under subsection (a). The Fund distributes money equally to State and local programs for training and equipment to protect peace officers, and to families of officers killed in the line of duty, as determined by the Attorney General. The authorities of States, the District of Columbia, and other territories can utilize inmate labor to address natural disaster damage. The Attorney General must maximize inmate employment within Federal correctional institutions. The Attorney General must maximize inmate employment in Federal corrections institutions, focusing on vocational education and skill training for post-release employment. Expansion of inmate-produced products for sale must be limited to Federal agencies through Federal Prison Industries to avoid unfair competition with the private sector. In implementing disaster remediation activities by inmates, the Attorney General must maximize the use of inmate labor to assist in preparing for and conducting remediation activities after a natural disaster. This must be done without displacing post-disaster community volunteers or governmental personnel. The Attorney General must ensure that inmate labor does not replace private sector firms or governmental entities in post-disaster remediation activities. SEC. 3. REQUIRED STATEMENT OF ASSETS. Amends Section 1915(a)(2) of title 28, United States Code to require prisoners to submit a statement of all assets they possess."
