    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) Funding Act of 2003\". The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) is recognized for its global efforts in promoting population stabilization and women's empowerment. It operates in numerous countries, providing family planning and health services, including contraception, to women in need. UNFPA provides contraception and health services to women in developing countries to prevent unwanted pregnancies and maternal injuries. They also work on preventing the spread of HIV/AIDS and eradicating obstetric fistula, a preventable maternal injury. UNFPA works to eliminate female genital mutilation in Africa, which affects millions of girls annually. They also aim to reduce abortion rates globally by promoting family planning. UNFPA aims to reduce abortion rates globally by promoting family planning and providing treatment for complications of unsafe abortions. They also work to slow population growth to address environmental issues, in line with the principle of individuals having the right to decide on the number and spacing of their children. UNFPA opposes coercion in any form and investigates and eliminates coercive practices in its programs. Allegations of complicity in Chinese government's coercive family planning program have been proven false by monitoring teams. The United States team found no evidence of UNFPA supporting coercive practices in China and recommended releasing $34,000,000 in funding. Despite this, the Administration used a flawed interpretation of Federal law to cut funding for UNFPA. The loss of $34,000,000 in US funding, 13% of UNFPA's budget, has already impacted services for women in developing countries. This could lead to 2,000,000 more unwanted pregnancies, 4,700 maternal deaths, 60,000 serious maternal injuries, 77,000 infant deaths, and 800,000 abortions. SEC. 3 authorizes $50,000,000 for fiscal year 2004 and $84,000,000 for fiscal year 2005 for US voluntary contributions to the United Nations Population Fund. SEC. 4 imposes limitations on these contributions. The Secretary of State can withhold funds from the United Nations Population Fund for the country program in China if it does not focus on improving voluntary family planning services. The United Nations Population Fund's program in China must adhere to human rights principles, eliminate quotas and coercive measures, consult with the UNFPA executive board, undergo independent monitoring for consent and participation, and suspend operations in case of violations."
