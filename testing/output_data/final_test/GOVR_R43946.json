    "content": "This report provides data on Senate staff listed in telephone directories since 1977. Telephone directories are chosen for their official and consistent breakdown of staff by organization over decades. However, data should be interpreted carefully due to limitations. The Senate staff listed in telephone directories since 1977 may not provide accurate data due to various reasons, such as staff not being listed in all directories, changes in inclusion criteria over time, and discrepancies in listing staff in different entities. The Senate telephone directories may not always list staff consistently, leading to potential inaccuracies in identifying congressional staff levels. Staff may have multiple listings, which could result in overcounts or misclassification of staff in different categories or offices. The directories started listing Senate staff in state offices in 1987, but prior data lacks consistency. Since 1987, Senate staff levels have steadily increased from 4,916 to 5,749 in 2016, with an average growth of 29 individuals per year. From 1977 to 1986, staff numbers grew from 3,397 to 4,180. Comparisons between pre-1987 and post-1987 data are incomplete due to inconsistent staff records before 1987. Since 1987, Senate staff levels have steadily increased, with staff in Senators' offices growing from 2,068 in 1977 to 2,474 in 1986, and to 4,120 in 2016. Staff in Senators' DC offices increased by 13.25% from 1977 to 2016. Member-office staff comprised 66.84% of Senate staff in 1987. Since 1987, Senate staff levels have steadily increased, with most growth seen in state-based staff. In 2016, 71.66% of Senate staff were in Member-office staff, with 56.84% working in Washington, DC offices. Senate committee staff levels have shown the smallest change among Senate staff categories. Senate committee staff levels have shown minimal change, increasing from 1,084 in 1977 to 1,153 in 2016, or 6.37%. The growth can be divided into three stages: an increase from 1977-1980, a decline from 1980-1999, and growth from 1999-2016. The proportion of Senate committee staff decreased from 23.39% in 1987 to 17.49% in 1995, but rose to 20.06% in 2016. Data tables provide staff levels in various Senate committees. The number of staff in Senate leadership offices grew significantly from 44 in 1977 to 160 in 2016, with a peak of 234 in 2012. As a proportion of Senate staff, leadership employees were 2.69% in 1987 and 2.78% in 2016. Staff working in the offices of Senate officers and officials increased by 57.21% since 1977, reaching 316 in 2016. However, their proportion of Senate staff decreased from 7.08% in 1987 to 5.50% in 2016. Since 1987, the Senate has seen growth in staff numbers, particularly in leadership offices and officers' offices. There has been a shift of staff from committee settings to leadership or personal offices, indicating potential institutional development and professionalization in congressional management. Some note that as organizations develop, they identify needs for expertise and specialized practices. In Congress, areas of specialization include supporting the legislative process, oversight of floor activities, and managing legislation in a bicameral, partisan environment. The demands for professional management and support may arise from the use of communications technologies and professionalized human resources processes. This specialized support explains the increase in staff working for chamber leaders, officers, and officials. The distribution of staff working for Senators has shifted from committee settings to personal office settings, with staff in Member offices growing while staff in Senate committees has decreased. This shift may indicate a move from collective congressional activities in committees to individualized activities in Senators' personal offices."
