    "content": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is an agency within the Department of Defense responsible for military and civil works. Congress directs the agency for water resource projects to support navigation, reduce flood damage, and protect ecosystems. The civil works program is led by a civilian Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works, overseen by a military Chief of Engineers. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' civil works program is overseen by a Director of Civil Works who reports to the Chief of Engineers. The agency's responsibilities are organized under eight divisions and 38 districts. Congressional authorization and appropriations are essential for Corps water resource activities, with most authorizations legislated in Water Resources Development Acts (WRDAs). Congress generally authorizes Corps activities before funding, and WRDAs cover studies, projects, and programs. Development Acts (WRDAs) authorize Corps studies, projects, and programs, establishing policies for civil works activities. WRDAs generally add new activities to existing authorized ones, including project studies, construction projects, and modifications. They also deauthorize projects and establish deauthorization processes, making certain projects eligible for federal funding. WRDAs do not appropriate funds but provide project funding through the annual appropriations process. The Water Resources Development Acts (WRDAs) authorize Corps activities and projects, establishing policies for civil works. WRDAs do not appropriate funds but provide project funding through the annual appropriations process. WRDAs may also alter trust fund collections and disbursement policies, with authorization provisions sometimes appearing in appropriations legislation. A biennial WRDA cycle was loosely followed for several years, with WRDAs enacted in various years including 1988, 1990, 1992, 1996, 1999, 2000, 2007, and the Water Resources Reform and Development Act of 2014 (WRRDA 2014). The Water Resources Development Acts (WRDAs) authorize Corps activities and projects, establishing policies for civil works. WRDA 1986 resolved disputes related to cost-sharing, user fees, and environmental requirements, ending a stalemate between Congress and the executive branch. Biennial consideration of Corps authorization legislation resumed after WRDA 1986 to avoid delays in project planning and execution. Pressure for new projects, increased funding levels, and project modifications prompt regular WRDA cycles. The Water Resources Development Acts (WRDAs) authorize Corps activities and projects, establishing policies for civil works. WRDA 1986 resolved disputes related to cost-sharing, user fees, and environmental requirements, ending a stalemate between Congress and the executive branch. Pressure for new projects, increased funding levels, and project modifications prompt regular WRDA consideration. WRDA enactment was inconsistent for a period due to controversial project authorizations and disagreements over project planning and execution. The 110th Congress enacted WRDA 2007 in November 2007, overriding a presidential veto. WRRDA 2014, enacted on June 10, 2014, authorized 34 construction projects that had received agency review and Chief of Engineers reports, overcoming concerns related to congressionally directed projects. WRRDA 2014 also altered processes and authorizations for project delivery options. WRRDA 2014 changed project delivery options and financing, allowing nonfederal entities to lead projects and promoting public-private partnerships. WRDA 2016 returned Corps authorization legislation to a biennial schedule. The Corps is funded through annual congressional appropriations, but only a subset of authorized activities are typically included in the President's budget request. The President's budget request includes activities funded by enacted appropriations, leading to competition for funds among authorized activities. The estimated total for authorized Corps construction activities in mid-2017 was $75 billion. Recent administrations focused funding on projects near completion within the agency's primary missions. Enacted annual Corps civil works appropriations have remained steady or slightly increased over the last decade, ranging from $4.5 billion to nearly $6.0 billion. The President's budget request for the Corps typically includes funding information at both the account level and by business line. Project-specific funding levels are also included. The executive branch justifies project funding decisions through metrics like benefit-cost ratios. The Corps budget development guidance outlines metrics each year. Proposed work descriptions are included in budget justifications published by the Corps after the President's budget request. Congress provides money to the Corps at the account level in appropriations laws, with specific projects identified in accompanying congressional reports. Since FY2010, projects identified in reports have been limited to those in the President's budget request, with no new project-specific line items added by Congress. Congressional action on Corps appropriations has focused on providing additional funding for activities deemed underfunded. The Corps budget development guidance outlines metrics each year. Congress provides money to the Corps at the account level in appropriations laws, with specific projects identified in accompanying congressional reports. Congressional action on Corps appropriations has focused on providing additional funding for activities deemed underfunded, particularly in the Construction and Operations and Maintenance (O&M) accounts. The O&M account has seen a growing portion of the agency's funds being used over time, reflecting a shift towards completing existing projects and addressing aging infrastructure. Enacted appropriation bills for FY2014-2017 allowed for new construction starts, but many authorized projects remain uninitiated. The Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund (HMTF) and the Inland Waterways Trust Fund (IWTF) are congressionally authorized trust funds administered by the Corps. HMTF supports maintenance for harbors, funded by taxes on waterborne cargo imports and cruise ship passengers. IWTF supports inland waterways construction, funded by a fuel tax on barge fuel. The Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund (HMTF) and the Inland Waterways Trust Fund (IWTF) have had financial challenges in recent years. The HMTF has developed a surplus balance, while the IWTF has faced revenue shortages. Changes to their financing structures in 2014 led to increased spending from both funds. The future of increased spending on inland and coastal navigation will depend on future appropriations legislation and other legislative proposals. Harbor interests support increasing harbor maintenance to maintain authorized channel dimensions. In January 2017, the Corps estimated the cost of maintaining coastal navigation channels at $7.6 billion over five years, with an additional $7.0 billion needed for the following five years. The economic benefits of maintaining channels include reduced transportation costs and improved navigation conditions. Roughly 85% of the Corps budget is allocated to geographically specified projects. Congress annually identifies projects for funding in addition to those in the President's budget. In the President's budget, Congress historically identified additional Corps projects for funding during the appropriations process. However, since FY2010, Congress has adhered to earmark moratorium policies and refrained from adding funds for specific projects not requested in the President's budget. Instead, Congress has included \"additional funding\" categories for various types of Corps projects with directions and limitations on fund usage. The Corps receives funding for various categories of work, with Congress adding over $1.4 billion in FY2017. Supplemental appropriations totaling $33.2 billion were provided from FY1987 to FY2017, mainly for flood-fighting activities and infrastructure repairs. The Corps receives funding for flood-fighting activities, repairs, and infrastructure investments in response to natural disasters. Congress provided $1.03 billion in supplemental appropriations in December 2016. Competition for Corps discretionary appropriations has led to interest in \"innovative\" finance. The Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (WIFIA) was authorized by WRRDA 2014 to encourage private-sector investment in federal water infrastructure. WIFIA allows the Corps and EPA to provide loans and loan guarantees for various water projects, with each agency authorized $175 million over five years. The program is modeled after the TIFIA program for transportation projects. The Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (WIFIA) allows the Corps to provide support for different project types, including flood damage reduction, environmental restoration, and navigation improvement projects. WRRDA 2014 set project selection criteria for eligibility for Corps WIFIA funding. Implementation of WIFIA requires congressional appropriations for administrative and subsidy costs. As of the end of FY2017, the Corps had not taken steps to implement its WIFIA authority. The Corps has not taken steps to implement its WIFIA authority, unlike the EPA. The standard process for Corps projects involves obtaining congressional authorization for studies and construction, with exceptions to the standard process. The Corps requires appropriations for projects, with congressional authorization needed for studies and construction. Nonfederal sponsors share costs, with state, tribal, or local agencies typically involved. Private entities can also be partners in some cases. Projects often take longer than expected due to various steps involved. WRRDA 2014 expanded authorities for nonfederal entities to perform studies and construct projects, with costs shared by the federal government. The standard Corps process involves the Corps managing the study and project, with nonfederal sponsors contributing costs and resources. The Corps study process informs federal decisionmakers on potential construction projects. Congress authorizes Corps studies in WRDA legislation, with WRRDA 2014 introducing a new process for identifying potential studies. The Secretary of the Army submits an annual report to Congress on potential study and project proposals for authorization. The Corps delivers annual reports to Congress on potential construction projects. Public submissions for consideration are due before reports are delivered. Projects are planned at the district level and approved at higher levels within the Corps. Feasibility studies begin if nonfederal sponsorship is secured and the Corps recommends proceeding. The feasibility study, cost-sharing, and objectives are key components when nonfederal sponsorship is secured for a Corps water resources project. The study involves formulating alternative plans, conducting benefit-cost analyses, and assessing environmental impacts. The evaluation is guided by established principles and guidelines, with the outcome determining project feasibility. The feasibility analysis determines if a project merits federal investment based on national economic benefits. The Chief of Engineers signs a recommendation known as the Chief's Report, which is submitted to congressional committees and reviewed by the Assistant Secretary and OMB. Congressional authorization for project construction may be granted after the Chief's Report, allowing preconstruction engineering and design to begin. The Preconstruction Engineering and Design (PED) phase involves finalizing project design, preparing construction plans, and drafting contracts. Corps work on PED is subject to funding availability and typically lasts two years. Costs are shared between federal and nonfederal sponsors based on the cost-share arrangement. Once construction funds are available, the Corps usually manages the project implementation. Construction of Corps projects is mainly contracted out to private engineering and construction contractors. Ownership and operations responsibilities post-construction vary depending on the project type. Cost-share responsibilities for construction and O&M differ based on project purpose, as outlined in Table 2. Allocation of costs among nonfederal sponsors, beneficiaries, and the federal government has been a topic of debate. The allocation of costs among nonfederal sponsors, beneficiaries, and the federal government has been debated for decades. WRDA 1986 increased local cost-share requirements, with subsequent adjustments in later WRDAs. Waiving cost-share requirements for individual projects is rare and usually requires specific congressional authorization. Projects may require additional authorization if there are significant changes in features or costs. Requests for modifications are typically included in a WRDA or the Section 7001 annual report process. Less significant modifications may not need additional authorization, with WRDA 1986 allowing for increases in project costs up to 20%. WRDA 2016 allows for increases in project costs of up to 20% without additional congressional authorization. Projects can be deauthorized if no funding is obligated for construction within seven years of enactment. The Secretary of the Army is required to report annually to Congress on projects and elements that have not received funding for the last five fiscal years. If funds are not allocated for planning, design, or construction in the following fiscal year, the project is deauthorized. For studies, any feasibility study not completed within seven years is automatically deauthorized. The study list is not published in the Federal Register. Congress has 90 days to appropriate funds for a study, otherwise, it is deauthorized. The Corps has authorities for small projects, technical assistance, and emergency actions. Congress has authorized the Corps for municipal water and wastewater projects. Continuing Authorities Programs (CAPs) allow the Corps to undertake small projects without specific congressional approval. The Corps has limited project size and scope, with CAPs authorized by section numbers in bills. WRRDA 2014 mandates prioritization criteria and annual reports. The Corps has general authorities for technical assistance and tribal support. Project-specific authority is not needed for eligible activities. The Corps may assist in disasters under the Stafford Act, funded through the Disaster Relief Fund and directed by FEMA and the President. The Corps coordinates emergency support for public works and engineering in response to disasters, including technical assistance, engineering, construction management, emergency contracting, and repair of public facilities. They also assist in monitoring and stabilizing damaged structures, demolishing hazardous structures, clearing debris, and establishing routes into affected areas. The agency has its own emergency response authority in addition to work under the National Response Framework. The Corps has its own emergency response authority known as P.L. 84-99, which authorizes various disaster assistance activities such as emergency operations, rehabilitation of flood control works, and protection of shore protection works. This authority allows the Corps to perform actions to save lives and protect property during emergencies, including drought assistance. The Corps has emergency response authority under P.L. 84-99 for disaster assistance activities like rehabilitation of flood control works and protection of shore projects. This includes the Rehabilitation and Inspection Program (RIP) for damaged projects eligible for assistance during emergencies. The Rehabilitation and Inspection Program (RIP) maintains active status through proper project maintenance and correction of deficiencies. Approximately 14,000 miles of levees participate in RIP, with different cost-sharing arrangements for repair depending on the type of levee. The Corps determines repair eligibility based on a favorable benefit-cost ratio, and local sponsors are responsible for rehabilitation costs due to deficient maintenance. Since 1992, Congress has authorized Corps assistance for municipal drinking water and wastewater infrastructure projects, including treatment facilities, distribution works, and surface water protection projects. Environmental infrastructure funds are regularly included in appropriations bills, despite not being included in Corps budget requests. The Corps has been authorized to provide environmental infrastructure assistance for specific geographic locations since 1992 under various authorities in WRDAs and appropriations acts. The nature of Corps involvement and nonfederal cost-share varies based on the authorization specifics. Since 1992, the Corps has been authorized to provide environmental infrastructure assistance with varying cost-sharing arrangements. Congress has authorized over 400 projects with appropriations totaling more than $5 billion. WRRDA 2014 expanded authorizations and funding for environmental infrastructure activities in multiple states, with the Corps receiving $140 million in FY2010 and $200 million in the American. The Obama Administration did not fund environmental infrastructure activities in FY2013. Congress recommended $44 million in FY2014, $50 million in FY2015, and $55 million in each of FY2016 and FY2017. Environmental infrastructure projects are not subject to traditional Corps planning processes but are subject to federal laws like the National Environmental Policy Act. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' civil responsibilities initially focused on creating navigable channels and flood control projects. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' civil responsibilities include navigation projects like river deepening and flood control projects such as levees and dams. The agency also engages in environmental activities like wetlands restoration and issuing permits for private actions affecting water bodies. Its projects are often multipurpose, providing water supply, recreation, and hydropower in addition to navigation or flood control. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has a long history of civil and military building for the nation. Congress passed legislation in 1824 for military engineers to plan roads and canals. In 1850, the Corps began flood control planning for the lower Mississippi River. Over the years, Congress expanded the agency's abilities for hydropower projects and comprehensive river-basin development plans. The modern era of federal flood control started with the Flood Control Act of 1936, declaring it a federal activity. The 1944 Flood Control Act increased the agency's involvement in multipurpose projects, while the Flood Control Act of 1950 authorized emergency flood operations. The Water Supply Act of 1958 gave the Corps authority to include reservoir storage for municipal and industrial water supply at nonfederal cost. Construction of major waterworks declined in the late 1960s due to changing priorities, increasing costs, and completed projects. Congress authorized no major water projects from 1970 to 1985, leading to competition between traditional off-stream uses and in-stream uses. In the 1970s, the Corps of Engineers scaled back projects and passed laws to protect the environment. This marked a transformation in project planning, with new requirements to consider environmental impacts and consult with other agencies. Congress further transformed water project rules and funding in the 1980s through WRDA 1986, establishing new cost-share formulas. WRDA 1986 introduced new cost-share formulas and increased local stakeholders' financial and decision-making roles. Subsequent WRDA acts expanded the Corps' mission to include environmental protection, contamination cleanup, dredged material disposal, hazardous waste management, and aquatic ecosystem restoration projects. The Corps' mission expanded to include aquatic ecosystem restoration projects with WRDA 2000, marking its first multiyear, multibillion-dollar effort in the Florida Everglades. WRDA 2007 further authorized billions for ecosystem restoration, including projects in coastal Louisiana and the Upper Mississippi River. The agency also focused on infrastructure rehabilitation, maintenance, and protection to enhance security against terrorism and natural threats. The Corps shifted to a flood risk management approach in response to disasters like Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, Ike, and Sandy. This approach emphasizes shared responsibilities across government levels for managing flood risks. WRRDA 2014 allowed for nonfederal participation in project delivery and aimed to improve planning efficiency. Congress resumed biennial enactment of WRDA legislation with WRDA 2016. WRDA 2016 authorized projects within the agency's primary mission areas and continued Corps involvement in regional restoration efforts nationwide."
