The Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits states from treating aliens differently than citizens, potentially leading to legal challenges. State measures denying or providing access to public higher education, in-state tuition, and financial aid to unauthorized aliens have been challenged for violating the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The level of scrutiny applied by the courts in reviewing such measures determines whether they are upheld or struck down, with different standards such as rational basis review and strict scrutiny. Courts have also applied other tests based on the persons or rights affected by the measure. The level of scrutiny applied to measures that classify on the basis of alienage depends on whether the measure is federal, state, or local. Federal classifications based on alienage are subject to rational basis review and have generally been upheld, while state and local measures are subject to strict scrutiny. The Supreme Court applies strict scrutiny to state or local measures treating aliens differently than citizens, except for political functions or Congress-prescribed standards. In Plyler v. Doe, the Court used intermediate scrutiny for a Texas statute due to undocumented status relevance to legislative goals. The Plyler case involved a law depriving minor children of a basic education, not generally applicable to classifications involving unauthorized aliens. Education and receipt of public benefits are not recognized as fundamental rights for equal protection. The denial of access to public education was subjected to intermediate scrutiny, while receipt of public benefits falls under rational basis review. The Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution establishes federal law as supreme, preempting state actions that conflict. States cannot regulate immigration, as this falls under federal authority. Other measures affecting aliens may also be preempted. Federal statutes may preempt state and local measures in three ways: express preemption, field preemption, or conflict preemption. State actions in traditionally state-regulated fields are presumed against preemption when Congress legislates in the field, but this does not seem to apply to education, historically seen as a local matter. The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act (PRWORA) defines state public benefits and is often discussed in relation to state measures regarding unauthorized aliens' access to public higher education, in-state tuition, and state financial aid. The presumption against preemption does not seem to have been applied in cases involving unauthorized aliens' access to higher education. The PRWORA and IIRIRA laws restrict access to public benefits for aliens not lawfully present in the United States, including welfare, health, housing, education, and unemployment benefits. The IIRIRA specifically prohibits states from providing postsecondary education benefits to unauthorized aliens. After PRWORA, states are barred from providing postsecondary education benefits to aliens not lawfully present unless other U.S. citizens are eligible. IIRIRA has been seen as narrowing states' authority under PRWORA, but subsequent interpretations may have changed this view. Challenges to state measures denying unauthorized aliens access to higher education have been made on Equal Protection and Supremacy Clause grounds, but case law suggests these restrictions do not violate equal protection or PRWORA. Restrictions on access to in-state tuition for unauthorized aliens have been considered permissible under PRWORA and IIRIRA. These laws restrict states from providing public benefits to unauthorized aliens, including federal and state financial aid. State measures barring unauthorized aliens from public higher education institutions have not been found impermissible on equal protection grounds, as per the Supreme Court's decision in Plyler v. Doe. The Supreme Court's decision in Plyler v. Doe precludes states from denying unauthorized alien children access to public elementary and secondary schools. However, Plyler did not address access to higher education, and the decision's applicability in that context may be limited. The Court invalidated a Texas measure that sought to deny basic education to unauthorized children, citing their young age and lack of culpability. This decision was based on heightened scrutiny, as the state's goals were deemed insubstantial. Some commentators suggest that state laws barring unauthorized aliens from higher education may be permissible under certain circumstances. Some commentators suggest that state laws barring unauthorized aliens from public institutions of higher education may be subject to scrutiny similar to Plyler v. Doe for elementary and secondary education. However, no court has adopted this view, and challenges to such laws have been based on grounds other than equal protection, such as preemption. Federal district courts have found preemption in three cases regarding state restrictions on access to public institutions of higher education. Two cases found preemption based on the specific state statute language, while the third case relied on an interpretation of PRWORA. In Hispanic Interest Coalition of Alabama v. Bentley, provisions of Alabama's H.B. 56 were found to be per se preempted for attempting to regulate immigration. In the case of Montana Immigrant Justice Alliance v. Bullock, a state law in Montana was found to be preempted as it relied on classifications of aliens not used in federal law. Similarly, in League of United Latin American Citizens [LULAC] v. Wilson, California's Proposition 187 provisions were found to be problematic by a federal district court. In LULAC v. Wilson, a federal district court found that California's Proposition 187 provisions regarding admission to public institutions of higher education for unauthorized persons were preempted by PRWORA. The court's interpretation has been challenged and may not reflect the prevailing view on PRWORA's preemption of benefits for aliens. State measures that deny unauthorized aliens in-state tuition may be permissible. The holding of Plyler regarding access to higher education has not been extended to eligibility for in-state tuition by any court. State measures denying unauthorized aliens in-state tuition may be permissible under federal law, as unauthorized aliens are generally ineligible for public benefits according to PRWORA. This is supported by Congress's plenary power over immigration and public benefit eligibility for aliens. Federal measures limiting aliens' eligibility for public benefits are subject to more deferential review than state measures and will generally be upheld with a reasonable basis. States may impose restrictions on aliens' receipt of public benefits if Congress has set appropriate standards. Pre-PRWORA Supreme Court cases invalidating state measures may not necessarily apply post-PRWORA, especially regarding unauthorized aliens. The issue of in-state tuition for unauthorized aliens is debated, with some arguing it does not constitute a public benefit under PRWORA due to lack of direct financial assistance. However, courts have found in-state tuition to be a public benefit as it involves a calculable amount, supported by some legal authorities. In-state tuition is considered a public benefit as it assists needy students with economic hardship and may incentivize illegal immigration. It benefits the student directly, not their household, and states are not required to restrict eligibility based on parents' immigration status. Some states have tried to classify U.S. citizen students as \"out of state\" residents because their parents are unauthorized aliens, but courts have rejected this view as it creates a second-tier of U.S. citizenship. Some states have denied state financial aid to unauthorized aliens, as financial aid is considered a public benefit under PRWORA and IIRIRA. States must pass legislation to affirm eligibility for unauthorized aliens to receive state financial aid, without conditioning it on residence. The Higher Education Act amendments in 1986 allow certain unauthorized aliens to qualify for federal financial aid if they intend to become permanent residents. However, the Department of Education only considers aliens who meet PRWORA's definition of qualified alien eligible for federal financial aid. Certain aliens, such as LPRs, refugees, and Cuban/Haitian entrants, are considered \"qualified aliens\" under PRWORA. Unauthorized aliens may have access to public higher education institutions without specific legislation, but in-state tuition and financial aid are generally seen as public benefits requiring state laws. States must enact legislation affirmatively providing for unauthorized aliens' eligibility for public benefits, which may include access to public institutions of higher education. Factors like high school attendance and graduation in the state could determine eligibility. Some argue that access to higher education should be considered a public benefit due to reliance on federal and state funds for education. Access to higher education is considered a public benefit, with courts differing on the rationale. One court viewed it as a benefit based on federal law's definition, while another argued that admission does not involve payments or assistance to students. The term \"public benefit\" is interpreted as \"aid\" or \"help,\" with access to public higher education unlikely to be considered a public benefit under PRWORA. Court cases define public benefits as resources for those with economic hardship or creating incentives for illegal immigration, which enrolling in a public institution of higher education does not do. Nonimmigrant visas for foreign students reduce the need to attend public institutions unlawfully. States are not prohibited from offering in-state tuition to unauthorized individuals. States may provide in-state tuition to unauthorized aliens as long as they comply with PRWORA and potentially IIRIRA. PRWORA generally prohibits states from offering public benefits to unauthorized aliens unless specific legislation is enacted. Some state statutes providing public benefits like in-state tuition have been challenged for not explicitly referencing PRWORA or eligibility for \"illegal aliens.\" This interpretation is based on the conference report accompanying PRWORA. Courts have found that PRWORA does not require states to reference the law or include language notifying the public about benefits for unauthorized aliens. State laws may delegate authority to determine unauthorized aliens' eligibility for benefits, but the significance in higher education may be limited by statutes requiring legislative approval for new tuition classifications. The limits imposed by IIRIRA on states providing in-state tuition for unauthorized aliens are unclear due to differing court decisions. In Martinez v. Regents of the University of California, the California Supreme Court upheld a statute allowing students who attended high school in California for three or more years to receive in-state tuition at public institutions of higher education. This decision was challenged under IIRIRA, but the court ruled in favor of the statute. The California Supreme Court upheld a statute allowing students who attended high school in California for three or more years to receive in-state tuition at public institutions of higher education. The court found that the measure did not conflict with IIRIRA as it was based on high school attendance and graduation, not just residence. The court declined to consider legislative history materials indicating an intent to benefit unauthorized aliens. The federal district court in Kansas dismissed a suit filed by out-of-state students alleging that a Kansas statute similar to the California one was barred by IIRIRA. The court found that the students lacked standing and had no right to sue to enforce IIRIRA, as they were not injured by the statute and IIRIRA did not create a private right of action. The court's decision was later affirmed by a federal appeals court. Following the Day decision, the Washington Legal Foundation (WLF) filed complaints with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) regarding in-state tuition laws for unauthorized aliens. DHS did not publicly respond to these complaints but stated that states can decide on providing in-state tuition. Private individuals may potentially challenge state practices on in-state tuition in recent state court litigation. State practices in providing in-state tuition to unauthorized aliens may face challenges from state taxpayers. While fewer states offer state financial aid to unauthorized aliens, it is likely that such aid would be considered a public benefit under PRWORA and IIRIRA. States can enact legislation to clarify eligibility for unauthorized aliens, potentially avoiding legal issues. The trend of states allowing unauthorized aliens to receive in-state tuition may face challenges from state taxpayers. While state financial aid for unauthorized aliens could be considered a public benefit under PRWORA and IIRIRA, there may be developments in state courts regarding challenges to state measures' conformity with state law."
