The Congress finds that the global illicit trade in wildlife is worth up to $20 billion annually, with the US legal wildlife trade valued at $2.8 billion annually. The illegal trade in prohibited wildlife species stimulates demand and harms both the American people and the species themselves. Private ownership and possession of prohibited wildlife species have a significant impact on interstate commerce as these species are often transported across state lines. This contributes to the swelling interstate traffic of these species, which are considered fungible commodities that cannot be differentiated between intrastate and interstate distribution. Federal control of prohibited wildlife species in private ownership or possession, whether intrastate or interstate, is crucial for effective regulation and compliance with international conservation agreements. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. The term 'breed' is defined as facilitating the reproduction of a prohibited wildlife species for commercial use. SEC. 4. PROHIBITIONS. SEC. 4. PROHIBITIONS.
