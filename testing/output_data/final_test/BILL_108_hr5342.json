    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"United States-Israel Energy Cooperation Act\". Congress finds that it is crucial for the national security interests of the United States to secure access to reliable energy sources. The country heavily depends on foreign crude oil, with 58 percent of its total oil requirements being imported, 45 percent of which comes from OPEC member states. Some of these countries use oil revenues to fund terrorism and anti-US propaganda. In the past, these countries have manipulated US policy by leveraging its dependence on their oil supplies, as seen during the 1973 OPEC embargo. The 1973 oil embargo on the United States led to a recession. Research shows US dependence on foreign oil will increase by 33% in 20 years. A 10 cent increase in gas prices would result in an $18 billion outflow to oil-exporting nations. The US should reduce its reliance on nations that do not share its interests. Israel has been a strong ally since 1948. Israel has been a close friend of the United States since its creation in 1948, sharing democratic values of peace, freedom, and justice. Cooperation on projects like the Arrow Missile has benefited both countries' security. Jointly-funded programs in scientific research and development further strengthen the special relationship between Israel and the United States. The Binational Agricultural Research and Development Fund (BARD) and the United States-Israel Binational Industrial Research and Development (BIRD) Foundation, supported by contributions from both governments, have led to scientific breakthroughs in various fields. Israeli scientists excel in alternative renewable energy research, attracting top corporations to establish research facilities in Israel. Israeli scientists have made significant breakthroughs in alternative renewable energy sources, including a cathode using hexavalent iron salts for rechargeable batteries, a technique to increase solar energy efficiency for hydrogen generation, and a novel membrane for direct-oxidant fuel cells. Collaboration between the United States and Israel in research and development of renewable energy is strong. Collaboration in the field of research and development of alternative renewable energy sources would benefit both countries. The grant program is outlined in Section 3. The Assistant Secretary of Energy for Policy and International Affairs will establish a grant program to award grants to eligible joint ventures comprised of Israeli and United States entities for projects promoting cooperation in research, development, and commercialization. The Assistant Secretary of Energy for Policy and International Affairs will establish a grant program to award grants to eligible joint ventures comprised of Israeli and United States entities for projects promoting cooperation in research, development, and commercialization of alternative energy, improved energy efficiency, and renewable energy sources. Eligible entities must submit applications to BIRD or BSF, which will review and select recipients based on criteria established by the Advisory Board. The amount of each grant awarded will be determined by BIRD or BSF, and recipients must submit a report within 6 months of receiving the grant. Each recipient of a grant under this program must submit a report to the Assistant Secretary within 6 months, detailing the use of funds and evaluating project success. SEC. 4. INTERNATIONAL ENERGY ADVISORY BOARD. Established in the Department of Energy, the International Energy Advisory Board (Advisory Board) is responsible for setting grant criteria and determining grant amounts for recipients selected by BIRD and BSF. The Advisory Board consists of 4 members appointed by the Secretaries of Commerce and Energy, with two members being Israeli citizens. The International Energy Advisory Board in the Department of Energy consists of 4 members, with two being Israeli citizens appointed by the Secretary of Energy. Members serve without pay, receive travel expenses, and are appointed for 4-year terms. Vacancies are filled in the same manner as the original appointment.
