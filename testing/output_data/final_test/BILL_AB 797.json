    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 43.100 of the Civil Code provides immunity from civil liability for property damage or trespass to a motor vehicle when rescuing an animal in accordance with Penal Code Section 597.7. This immunity does not affect liability for rendering aid to an animal. Section 597.7 of the Penal Code is amended. Section 597.7 of the Penal Code prohibits leaving an animal in a vehicle under conditions that could harm the animal. It allows for reasonable steps to be taken to rescue an animal in immediate danger. A person can remove an animal from a vehicle if they believe the animal is in imminent danger and have contacted authorities. They must stay with the animal until help arrives. If an individual believes an animal is in danger in a vehicle, they can use necessary force to remove the animal and must hand it over to law enforcement or emergency responders. The penalty for a first offense is a fine up to $100 per animal, and for subsequent offenses or if the animal is injured, the fine can be up to $500 with possible jail time. (d) (1) Peace officers, firefighters, and other emergency responders can remove an animal from a vehicle if its safety is at risk due to various factors. (2) The animal must be taken to a shelter or veterinary hospital, and the owner may be responsible for any incurred charges. A peace officer, firefighter, or other emergency responder can remove an animal from a vehicle if necessary, including breaking into the vehicle. They must leave a notice with their information and where the animal can be claimed. The owner must pay any charges for the animal's care before claiming it. This section does not change existing liabilities or immunities in current law. Prosecution can still occur under other laws. The transportation of agricultural animals in designated vehicles is allowed."
