Despite recent advancements in production, the U.S. remained a net importer of oil in 2018. Oil availability is crucial for energy independence and security, with factors like supply, demand, and currency strength influencing prices. The U.S. has the ability to influence the world oil market due to its significant role in consumption and production. The United States plays a significant role in the global oil market as a top consumer and producer. Factors like trade agreements, regulations, sanctions, and unpredictable events impact oil flow. Congress considers policies affecting the market, such as sanctions, alternative fuels, emission controls, and protection of trade routes. The report provides an overview of U.S. and world oil markets, including supply, demand, prices, and trade flows. It also analyzes international conditions influencing past policy decisions in the U.S. The report does not cover the entire oil value chain or detailed trade balance analysis. Impacts of the world oil market on climate and the environment are not the focus. The United States has abundant reserves of crude oil, including shale deposits. Technological advancements and new policies have shifted the outlook for oil production from scarcity to abundance. Despite being the top oil producer and consumer, the U.S. remains a net oil importer due to limited proved reserves. These reserves are undeveloped resources that can be economically recovered under existing conditions, subject to fluctuations in technology costs. The United States has 39.2 billion barrels of proved oil reserves as of 2017, with production doubling from 5 to 10 million barrels per day by 2018. In September 2018, the U.S. surpassed Russia and Saudi Arabia as the top crude oil producer, with 3 million barrels per day coming from shale formations in the Permian basin. The U.S. primarily produces light, sweet crude oil, accounting for over half of all production in 2017. The United States produces over half of its crude oil from shale formations using hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling technologies. These methods have raised environmental concerns such as groundwater contamination and earthquakes. The U.S. is the top consumer of crude oil and refined petroleum products. The United States produces over half of its crude oil from shale formations using hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling technologies, raising environmental concerns. Crude oil is a raw ingredient for transportation fuels and petrochemical feedstock. U.S. crude oil and petroleum product supplied in 2017 was 19.96 Mb/d, 20% of total world consumption. Domestic production was 9.35 Mb/d, not meeting U.S. consumption, filled by imports, natural gas liquids, or commercial crude oil stockpiles. Economic conditions closely link to the demand for crude oil and petroleum products. The demand for crude oil and petroleum products is closely tied to economic conditions and policy decisions. Federal policies, such as the Energy Independence and Security Act, can influence crude oil consumption in transportation. Different characteristics of oil, such as quality, determine crude oil prices. Lighter, sweeter crude oils are generally priced higher than heavy, sour crude oils due to their use in producing higher-value products. Crude oil refineries use lighter, sweeter crude oils to produce valuable petroleum products like gasoline and diesel fuel. Different benchmarks, such as West Texas Intermediate (WTI) and Brent, are used to measure crude oil prices in the spot market. These benchmarks reflect the type and quality of oil, regional market conditions, and transportation costs. The pricing of crude oil, tied to benchmarks like WTI and Brent, impacts the cost of petroleum products for consumers. The Permian Basin produces light, sweet crude at low cost due to its unique geologic structure, influencing oil prices. The 1970s marked the beginning of limited oil availability and rising prices, with the 1973 OAPEC oil embargo leading to the passage of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act of 1975. This act restricted U.S. crude oil exports, allowing exports only in certain circumstances. In 1985, President Reagan lifted export restrictions on U.S. crude oil to Canada, following Canada's removal of export controls. U.S. oil sector has transformed since the 1970s, with trade policies adapting to technological advancements. U.S. crude oil imports decreased from over 13 Mb/d in 2005 to 10 Mb/d in 2017. Congress repealed restrictions on oil exports in 2015 to accommodate higher production levels. In 2015, Congress repealed restrictions on oil exports, allowing for increased production levels. Canada has become the top supplier of crude oil to the United States, with imports steadily rising since the 1980s. Over half of Canada's production comes from oil sands, leading to infrastructure demands as most crude oils end up in the Midwest due to pipeline limitations. Due to pipeline capacity limitations to the Gulf of Mexico, the United States has seen a shift in crude oil exports. With export restrictions removed in 2015, producers can now sell crude oil to the world market, reducing discounts on light, sweet crude oils. The EIA estimates that the United States exported around 7 Mb/d of crude oil and products combined in 2018, with projections showing the country becoming a net petroleum exporter by 2030. The United States is projected to become a net petroleum exporter around 2030. Top destinations for U.S. crude oil and petroleum product exports include Mexico, Canada, China, Brazil, and Japan. Mexico's increased imports of U.S. oil products are due to its decreased production and rising demand. The world oil market determines prices and supply for U.S. consumers, potentially influencing policy decisions by Congress. The World Bank projected global GDP growth of 2.9% in 2019 and 2.8% in 2020-2021, impacting policy decisions. Developing economies' demand for fuel and consumer goods, dependent on crude oil, is increasing. Countries are working to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and enhance energy security. The world oil market is influenced by the world economy's growth or decline, leading to price volatility due to supply-demand imbalances. Alberta implemented a crude oil curtailment policy in January 2019 due to export infrastructure bottlenecks. The Canadian province faced a storage crisis with 35 million barrels of excess crude oil due to export limitations, causing prices to plummet from $58.49 to $11.43/bbl. The world oil supply is influenced by various factors like project investments, demand forecasts, and geopolitics, with approximately 1,645 billion barrels of proved reserves in 2017. Oil producers aim to match global demand projections through new investments and site replacements, sustaining production for around 50 years at 2017 levels. Venezuela, Saudi Arabia, and Canada hold the largest proved oil reserves in the world. Despite having significant reserves, Venezuela has seen a decrease in production due to lack of investment. The United States has become the top crude oil producer, surpassing Russia and Saudi Arabia in 2018. National oil companies dominate the oil industry in Russia and Saudi Arabia. In 2018, Saudi Arabia, a member of OPEC, held the largest share of world spare capacity in crude oil production, allowing it to influence the market. OPEC, representing nearly 40% of world oil production, can impact global oil supply and prices through policy decisions. National oil companies in Russia and Saudi Arabia are government-owned or influenced, while U.S. oil companies operate independently in the private sector. Saudi Arabia, a founding member of OPEC, holds the largest share of OPEC production. Russia, although not an OPEC member, coordinates with OPEC on oil supply decisions. OPEC countries, especially Saudi Arabia, maintain varying levels of spare oil capacity, with some referred to as \"swing producers\" who can influence the market by adjusting production levels. The International Energy Agency (IEA) predicts that non-OPEC countries like the United States, Brazil, and Canada will drive most of the world's oil supply growth by 2023, with a total increase of 5.2 Mb/d. Other countries like Iraq, Iran, Norway, the United Arab Emirates, and Libya will also contribute to supply growth, albeit to a lesser extent. This growth is expected to account for 81% of the total world oil capacity growth during this period. Countries like China, Mexico, and Venezuela may experience production declines due to lower investments and other factors. Venezuelan crude oil production has been declining since 1998, dropping from 3.4 Mb/d to 2 Mb/d in 2018. The IEA forecasts further declines to as low as 1 Mb/d by 2023. Global new oil discoveries hit a record low in 2017 with 4 billion barrels of new reserves found. Producers consider demand growth forecasts and price outlooks when deciding on investments, leading to a focus on making existing fields more productive and exploring alternatives like biofuels. Oil extraction costs may render mature fields unprofitable. The IEA projects an increase in world oil demand to 104.7 Mb/d by 2023, with China and India contributing significantly. China's oil demand is expected to grow to 14.4 Mb/d, while India's is projected to reach 5.9 Mb/d by 2023. The United States is forecasted to have relatively flat demand growth. Transportation is expected to dominate oil demand, with BP estimating it to comprise over half of world oil demand through 2040. The IEA projects transportation sectors to represent 6.4 Mb/d of the 9.6 Mb/d total oil demand growth from 2017 through 2030. Petrochemicals are projected to contribute nearly one-third of the total demand growth at 3.2 Mb/d. Oil demand forecasting for the transportation sector is influenced by policy, regulation, and technological development such as electric vehicles. The International Maritime Organization has set a new world limit of sulfur content in fuel oil used in ships, which may impact the overall oil market. The shipping industry may turn to alternative fuels like biofuels or LNG with low sulfur emissions. Petrochemicals play a key role in manufacturing everyday items. Lighter crude oils in the US contribute to petrochemical production. Forecasted petrochemical demand growth may be affected by efficiency gains and environmental policies. Forecast models for world oil demand rely on assumptions and can yield divergent results. The IEA has multiple scenarios for forecasting, each resulting in different forecasts of future oil demand. Factors like fuel efficiency standards and alternative fuels can influence oil demand projections. Oil prices are primarily determined by supply and demand dynamics in the world market. Oil prices in the world market are influenced by supply and demand, as well as factors like currency exchange rates, the global economy, investments, and political environments. Various hubs around the world trade oil in U.S. dollars, which historically had an inverse relationship with oil prices. However, China's launch of crude oil futures contracts in Shanghai pegged to the Chinese yuan in March 2018 has introduced a new dynamic to the market. The Shanghai futures contract pegged to the Chinese yuan has surpassed the Dubai Mercantile Exchange's oil contract in trade volumes. Events like OPEC decisions, political destabilization, financial crisis, and war can impact the supply and price of oil. Geopolitical events have led to significant changes in oil prices. The IEA Oil 2018 report forecasts changes in oil supply and prices globally. Americas may reach near parity in production and consumption by 2023, while Asia's oil trade deficit could increase. Middle East, Former Soviet Union, and Europe's crude oil balances are projected to see marginal changes. Latin America may experience a drop in exports due to Venezuela's production decline. Africa's Nigeria and Egypt may increase domestic consumption, while Angola's production is expected to decline. The OECD countries are expected to reduce imports due to efficiency gains, emissions policies, and fuel diversification. Asia is projected to increase imports by 3.7 Mb/d by 2023, with China alone increasing net imports from 8 Mb/d in 2017 to 10 Mb/d in 2023. Russia is the top exporter of oil to China due to an extensive pipeline network. The IEA forecasts the United States, Norway, Brazil, and Canada to provide the largest new non-OPEC crude exports. Europe is expected to reduce oil imports and diversify its sources. The IEA projects Europe to reduce oil imports and diversify away from reliance on Russia, increasing imports of crude oil from the United States. Brazil may boost exports to offset reductions from Venezuela. Canadian producers face transportation bottlenecks limiting export capacity to the US. They are exploring new opportunities, including exporting to Asia via pipeline despite opposition from environmental groups. Canadian producers face opposition from environmental groups and government, posing challenges for pipeline approvals. Oil policy can influence geopolitics and be used as a tool to influence other countries. Energy conservation, environmental protection, and strategic resource protection decisions impact oil supply and demand. The US plays a significant role in the global oil market, affecting Congress's policy decisions. OPEC, along with other major producers like Russia, can exert a strong influence on the market. OPEC, along with Russia, has significant influence in the global oil market. They committed to reducing oil supply in 2016, leading to price increases. OPEC has exceeded production cut targets, while non-OPEC members have not fully complied. In June 2018, OPEC and Russia agreed to increase production to 100% compliance, resulting in price declines. OPEC's coordinated effort to adjust oil supply affects prices. Bills in the 115th Congress aimed to address the U.S. relationship with OPEC, proposing to make oil cartels illegal and prosecutable by the U.S. Department of Justice. The sovereign immunity historically applied to OPEC members, allowing the United States to sue for collusion and make production and price manipulation illegal. Some private sector entities, like the American Petroleum Institute, opposed the bills, expressing concerns about unintended consequences for the U.S. oil and gas sectors, as well as diplomatic and military interests. Low oil prices may not benefit all U.S. stakeholders in the oil supply chain. The pressure from various stakeholders and their influence on government policy is a key factor in the oil market. Congress and Presidents have used oil policy as a foreign policy tool, imposing sanctions on crude oil, banking, and other sectors to communicate favor or disfavor to certain countries. Sanctions have targeted countries with National Oil Companies (NOCs) and individuals/entities in response to undesirable international behavior. The United States imposed sanctions on Russia in response to its activities in Ukraine, targeting over 600 individuals, entities, and vessels. These sanctions have been widened since 2014 to include election interference and illegal trade with North Korea, with a focus on sectors like energy and oil production. The United States imposed sanctions on Russia, targeting sectors like energy and oil production. These \"sectoral sanctions\" restrict financing to specific oil companies and engagement in certain oil projects. The success of these sanctions has been difficult to determine due to the oil price decline, Russian tax system changes, and ruble devaluation. The collapse in oil prices affected Russia's economy, leading to slowed growth and contraction in 2015. However, with oil prices strengthening, Russia's economy grew by 1.5% in 2017. Technology-related sanctions aim to have a longer-term impact on Russian oil production. The technology-related sanctions on Russian oil production aim to limit access to U.S. and EU technology, with the overall effect expected to take years to materialize. In comparison, the United States has a history of utilizing sanctions on Iran to influence its behavior, with sanctions lifted in 2016 leading to an increase in Iran's crude production back to pre-sanctions levels. The Trump Administration announced the withdrawal from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, leading to the resumption of sanctions on Iran. These sanctions have impacted the Iranian economy, causing a decrease in crude oil exports. Waivers were initially issued to certain countries but were later revoked to increase pressure on the Iranian regime. Iran's exports fell to around 1 Mb/d in April 2019, while Venezuela has also experienced production declines due to sanctions. The Venezuelan government used oil revenues for social services, but lack of investment and corruption led to production declines from 2.5 Mb/d in 2015 to 1.5 Mb/d in 2018. The US imposed sanctions on Venezuela, restricting access to financial markets, increasing fiscal pressure. The US government expanded sanctions on Venezuela through executive orders, broadening the definition of 'Government of Venezuela.' US consumers can buy Venezuelan crude oil until April 28, 2019, with payments held in blocked accounts. A ban on US crude oil imports from Venezuela could impact the world oil market, leading to higher prices for US Gulf Coast refineries. However, the market may find alternative sources in the long term. The physical threats to oil supply still exist, particularly along certain trade routes like the Strait of Hormuz in the Persian Gulf, a key waterway for oil transit. Saudi Arabia has other outlets for oil exports, including the Bab al-Mandeb Strait. The Bab al-Mandeb Strait, a choke point for oil shipments, was temporarily suspended by Saudi Arabia in 2018 after attacks by Yemen's Houthis. Legislation has emphasized the need to defend critical choke points like the Bab al Mandab Strait and the Strait of Hormuz to ensure freedom of navigation. The U.S. maintains strategic relationships with Iran, Saudi Arabia, OPEC members, and China to secure oil trade routes. The Bab al-Mandeb and the Strait of Hormuz are critical choke points for oil shipments. Disruptions in these routes could lead to higher oil prices globally. Potential causes include conflicts in Yemen, Iran, and tensions in the South China Sea. The impact of oil price increases on other economic sectors is uncertain. Despite the US's oil abundance, disruptions in global supply routes could affect geopolitical relationships and secondary industries. In response to the 1973 OAPEC oil embargo, the United States joined the International Energy Program in 1974, requiring members to hold a 90-day supply of petroleum for emergencies. Congress has enacted laws to secure the nation's oil supply, especially during the 1970s in light of energy scarcity concerns. This demonstrates Congress's ongoing interest in addressing oil consumption and security. The Energy Policy and Conservation Act (EPCA) of 1975 established the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) to address supply shortages, with an initial capacity of up to 1 billion barrels. Congress later amended the EPCA to allow SPR drawdowns during economic stress, not just emergencies. The current inventory is around 650 million barrels, and the SPR now plays a role in ensuring oil supplies during natural disasters and stabilizing the oil market. The EPCA also set Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards for cars and light trucks starting in the late 1970s. CAFE standards, implemented in the late 1970s, require auto manufacturers to meet fuel economy targets for vehicles sold in the US. Vehicle miles per gallon have increased significantly since then, with a decrease in fuel use despite an increase in registered vehicles. Failure to meet CAFE standards results in financial penalties. In August 2018, the EPA and NHTSA proposed amendments to CAFE standards for MY 2021-2026, with the preferred alternative being to freeze standards at the existing level through MY 2026. Congress has passed laws providing tax credits for plug-in EVs, with the phaseout threshold changing from 250,000 to 200,000 vehicles per manufacturer. EVs may impact the future of oil in transportation. In the United States, EVs had less than 4% market share in 2017. Competitive gasoline prices and the higher cost of initial purchase for EVs may be factors contributing to slow growth in market share. In the 115th Congress, there were proposals to extend or repeal the plug-in EV tax credit. The Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) requires transportation fuel to contain renewable fuels like biofuel and biomass-based diesel. The Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) aims to diversify transportation fuels away from traditional gasoline and diesel, supporting the U.S. biofuel industry and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Implementation has faced challenges due to factors like infrastructure and limited federal assistance. Some Members of Congress are debating whether to amend or repeal the RFS, which could impact the world oil market. Policy changes, such as legislation to control emissions and expand oil production, can impact the world oil market. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 increased the 45Q tax credit for carbon dioxide (CO2) use in enhanced oil recovery. Other factors like tariffs on steel and international trade policies can also affect oil production costs."
