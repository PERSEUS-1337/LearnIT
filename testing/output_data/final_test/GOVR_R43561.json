    "content": "The 111th Congress debated the access of foreign nationals to benefits in the United States, especially in relation to immigration statuses and entitlement programs. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) was enacted, creating new responsibilities and benefits for individuals, such as the requirement to obtain health insurance and tax credits. The ACA created new responsibilities and benefits for individuals in the United States, including the requirement to obtain health insurance and tax credits. One issue that has arisen is the eligibility of foreign nationals for these provisions, with differing definitions of \"lawfully present\" causing complications. The ACA introduced new obligations and benefits for individuals in the US, such as the health insurance mandate and tax credits. This report examines the eligibility of foreign nationals for these provisions, considering restrictions based on immigration status and the alien-status verification process. Aliens are categorized into two groups for ACA eligibility: those eligible for the health insurance mandate, exchanges, and premium tax credits, and those who are not. Aliens are categorized into two groups for eligibility under the ACA: those \"lawfully present in the United States\" are eligible for provisions like subsidies, while those not \"lawfully present\" are ineligible. The definition of \"lawfully present\" includes immigrants, asylees/refugees, nonimmigrants, and other noncitizens with permission to stay temporarily in the US. This definition was first established for eligibility for high-risk pools and has since been referenced in all ACA regulations. The definition of \"lawfully present\" under the ACA is also used in CMS policy for Medicaid and CHIP eligibility, as well as Social Security. However, this term is not commonly found in the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), which categorizes foreign nationals as immigrants or nonimmigrants. The INA only defines \"lawfully present\" in relation to noncitizen eligibility for Social Security. The \"quasi-legal\" population, including those with temporary protected status, withholding of removal, Deferred Enforced Departure, and parole, are considered \"lawfully present\" for ACA purposes, despite being counted as part of the unauthorized population by DHS and Pew Research Center. The ACA includes the individual mandate, requiring minimum health insurance coverage from 2014 onwards, with penalties for noncompliance. Exemptions are available, but those without coverage or exemptions face penalties collected through federal tax filings by the IRS. The IRS can collect penalties by reducing tax refunds, but cannot garnish wages. Aliens are exempt from the individual mandate if not lawfully present or nonresident aliens. Nonresident aliens, both lawfully and non-lawfully present, are exempt. Other aliens must maintain health insurance unless exempt. Understanding U.S. tax treatment of noncitizens is crucial for ACA compliance. For federal tax purposes, foreign nationals are classified as resident or nonresident aliens based on specific tests. Noncitizens who are nonresident aliens are not subject to the individual mandate. The IRS may face challenges enforcing the mandate against taxpayers who do not receive tax refunds. Immigration statuses under the Immigration and Nationality Act do not directly align with tax law terms. The substantial presence test determines if an individual is a resident alien of the United States based on their presence in the country. Certain exceptions exist for individuals with closer ties to a foreign country or specific visa holders. Foreign students, teachers, and trainees on J-, M-, or Q-visas may be treated as nonresident aliens if they comply with visa requirements. This treatment applies for the first five years for students and the first two years for teachers and trainees. Other examples include regular commuters from Canada or Mexico. Income tax treaties between the U.S. and other countries may also impact residency status. Resident aliens are taxed like U.S. citizens on income from both U.S. and foreign sources. Nonresident aliens are subject to different treatment regarding income tax withholding and payments compared to U.S. citizens. Some income earned by nonresident aliens is excluded from U.S. taxation, including foreign-source income and compensation paid by a foreign employer. Nonresident aliens are not subject to the individual mandate penalty, so their withholding and refund rules differ. The ACA allows individuals and small businesses to buy health insurance through state exchanges, which are special marketplaces where insurance firms sell policies that meet federal guidelines. Open enrollment began on October 1, 2013, and all lawfully present noncitizens can purchase insurance through an exchange. A person is considered lawfully present if they are a U.S. citizen, national, or an alien lawfully present in the U.S. The shortest enrollment period is 12 months. Aliens who are not lawfully present are barred from obtaining insurance through an exchange. Lawfully present noncitizens, regardless of the length of admittance to the United States, can purchase insurance through an exchange. Certain individuals may qualify for a tax credit and subsidy for insurance purchased through an exchange based on their income. The tax credit is refundable and advanceable, available to taxpayers with low income. Subsidies help with cost-sharing expenses and are paid to the insurer. To qualify, household income must be between 100% and 400% of the federal poverty level. Lawfully present aliens meeting specific criteria are eligible for premium tax credits and cost-sharing subsidies if they lack access to affordable coverage from sources like Medicaid or employer-provided plans. Household income below 100% of the Federal Poverty Level is considered 100% if a family member is a lawfully present alien ineligible for Medicaid due to alien status. Those not lawfully present are not eligible for tax credits and subsidies as they cannot purchase insurance through exchanges. Individuals who are not lawfully present are prohibited from buying insurance through an exchange but can claim the credit or subsidy for eligible family members. Specific rules apply to mixed-status families, where premiums and income criteria are adjusted to account for non-lawfully present members. The ACA required state Medicaid programs to expand coverage to all eligible non-pregnant, non-elderly legal residents with incomes up to 138% of the federal poverty level. The Supreme Court ruled that withholding all Medicaid funds for non-compliance with the expansion violated the Tenth Amendment. The Supreme Court ruled that withholding Medicaid funds for non-compliance with the expansion violated the Tenth Amendment. 31 states and the District of Columbia have expanded Medicaid coverage, allowing all non-elderly U.S. citizens and certain noncitizens with income up to 138% of the federal poverty level to be eligible. This expansion also raised Medicaid's mandatory income eligibility level for certain existing groups to 138% of the federal poverty level. The expansion of Medicaid eligibility under the ACA increased coverage for individuals with income up to 138% of the federal poverty level. However, immigration status-based restrictions on Medicaid eligibility remain unchanged. Noncitizens' eligibility for Medicaid is largely determined by their immigration status, arrival date before August 22, 1996, and duration of residence and work in the U.S. Legal permanent residents arriving after August 22, 1996, are barred from Medicaid for five years before becoming eligible. Legal permanent residents arriving after August 22, 1996, are barred from Medicaid for five years, but states can use funds to cover pregnant women and children who are \"lawfully residing\" in the U.S. Refugees and asylees are eligible for Medicaid for seven years, while qualified aliens with a substantial U.S. work history or military connection can access Medicaid without the five-year bar. Nonimmigrants, \"quasi-legal\" migrants, and unauthorized aliens are not eligible for Medicaid. The ACA created inequality between U.S. citizens and some noncitizens with incomes at or below 138% of the federal poverty level regarding eligibility for Medicaid. Noncitizens may be eligible for state-only funded coverage. Qualifying individuals can receive tax credits and subsidies for exchange plans if their household income is between 100% and 400% of the FPL. Lawfully present noncitizens with household incomes below 100% of the FPL, who are ineligible for Medicaid due to their alien status, can receive premium credits and subsidies through an exchange. If deemed eligible for Medicaid, they will be enrolled in Medicaid instead. U.S. citizens and eligible noncitizens can participate in an exchange but will not receive premium credits or cost-sharing subsidies if eligible for Medicaid. The ACA requires verification of citizenship or immigration status for individuals seeking coverage through an exchange or claiming premium tax credits. The verification system uses personal data to confirm eligibility, similar to the DHS SAVE system. The ACA requires verification of citizenship or immigration status for individuals seeking exchange coverage. The attestation is considered substantiated if consistent with SSA or DHS data. Concerns about identity theft exist due to lack of biometric identifiers, but requiring them could lead to denial of credits to eligible persons. The ACA requires verification of citizenship or immigration status for exchange coverage, with concerns about identity theft due to lack of biometric identifiers. Requiring biometric identifiers could make it harder for some eligible U.S. citizens to access exchanges and claim subsidies. Researchers found that 6.2% of E-Verify queries relate to unauthorized aliens. Researchers found that about 54% of E-Verify queries related to unauthorized aliens result in inaccurate findings of work authorization, mainly due to identity theft. This leads to an estimated 3.3% of all queries receiving false positive verifications. To address identity fraud, DHS is enhancing E-Verify by adding more photographs and preventing stolen identities. Concerns have been raised about noncitizens in mixed-status families not applying for coverage through exchanges or for credits and subsidies. Some noncitizens in the United States are hesitant to apply for coverage through exchanges or for credits and subsidies due to concerns about triggering immigration enforcement actions. DHS has reassured that information for eligibility will not be used for enforcement. Exchange plan applications cannot request immigration status for individuals not seeking coverage. There are worries that enrolling in a plan may affect immigration status and deportability under the \"public charge\" ground. The Obama Administration FAQ clarifies that applying for Medicaid or CHIP, or receiving help with health insurance costs, does not impact one's chances of becoming a Lawful Permanent Resident or U.S. citizen, except for those receiving long-term care at government expense. \"Lawfully present\" under the ACA is defined as a qualified alien or an alien in nonimmigrant status. The Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act (PRWORA) outlines eligibility criteria for aliens in nonimmigrant status, including those paroled into the US under specific conditions or belonging to certain classes such as temporary residents, beneficiaries of Family Unity, or under Deferred Enforced Departure. Aliens currently under Deferred Enforced Departure (DED) or in deferred action status, approved visa petition with pending adjustment of status, pending asylum or withholding of removal application with employment authorization, granted withholding of removal under the Convention Against Torture, or a child with a pending application for Special Immigrant Juvenile status are considered to be lawfully present. In July 2015, there were approximately 43.3 million foreign-born persons in the U.S., making up 13.5% of the total population. Of these, 20.7 million were naturalized citizens and 22.6 million were noncitizens. The Pew Research Center estimated around 43.6 million unauthorized aliens in March 2014. The Pew Hispanic Trends Project estimated that in March 2014 there were approximately 43.6 million foreign-born persons in the United States. Of the noncitizen population, around 32.5 million were legal permanent residents (LPRs) and naturalized citizens, 1.7 million were nonimmigrants, and 11.1 million (25.5%) were unauthorized aliens. Some unauthorized aliens have legal documents, making them \"quasi-legal\" migrants, potentially accounting for up to 10% of the unauthorized population. The Department of Homeland Security issues temporary employment authorization documents (EADs) to some aliens who are not otherwise authorized to reside in the U.S. Aliens with EADs can legally obtain social security cards, falling into categories such as those with Temporary Protected Status, pending asylum cases, immediate family of legal permanent residents, or with pending petitions for adjustment of status. These aliens have not been formally approved to stay permanently, and many may be denied LPR status. Only about 25% of asylum seekers ultimately gain asylum. Approximately 80% to 85% of LPR petitions are approved, with some noncitizens considered lawfully present under ACA regulations."
