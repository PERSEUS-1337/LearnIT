    "content": "Health care reform is a top priority for the 111th Congress due to concerns about the uninsured and rising healthcare costs. Improving access and controlling costs will require changes to financing and delivery. The National Priorities Partnership identified four major challenges in delivering high-quality care, including improving patient safety and eradicating disparities in care. The challenges in delivering high-quality care include eradicating disparities in care, reducing the burden of chronic disease, and eliminating unnecessary and ineffective care. Initiatives to address these challenges have been proposed in the health reform debate. The current healthcare system focuses on specialty care over primary care, leading to fragmented care for patients with multiple chronic conditions. Care coordination is essential to avoid waste and improve outcomes. Health workforce policy is crucial in addressing these challenges and improving the delivery of high-quality care. Health workforce policy is a key component in transforming the healthcare delivery system to focus more on primary care, disease prevention, and chronic illness management. The debate includes concerns about a future physician shortage and the need to balance increasing physician numbers with cost and quality considerations. Physician distribution varies based on preferences rather than patient needs. Health policy analysts recommend training more primary care physicians and developing integrated care systems to improve patient outcomes and quality of care. Clinical preventive services, such as immunizations and screening tests, are key in reducing healthcare costs and improving health. Health policy analysts suggest training more primary care physicians and creating integrated care systems to enhance patient outcomes and quality of care. Delivery reform advocates the medical home concept, aiming to improve care quality through patient-physician partnerships. Disease management programs, like those for diabetes, help patients self-manage through education, symptom monitoring, and treatment adherence. These programs aim to address rising chronic disease costs and care coordination issues. Health care delivery reform requires mechanisms to drive change in care systems, including performance measurement, comparative effectiveness research, health information technology adoption, and aligning payment incentives with high-quality care. Improvements in care quality depend on providers having financial incentives to change their delivery methods, which is hindered by the fee-for-service payment model. Public and private payers are increasingly tying provider payments to performance on quality measures to incentivize changes in the health care delivery system. The use of performance measures to track care quality is growing, but concerns about data development and use persist. Public reporting of quality information is crucial for helping patients make informed decisions about health care services. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 allocated $17 billion for health care reform. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA; P.L. 111-5) allocated $17 billion for health care reform, including $1.1 billion for comparative effectiveness research and $2 billion for Health Information Technology (HIT) grant programs. HIT is essential for electronic sharing of clinical data among health care stakeholders. Health Information Technology (HIT) is a vital component of health care reform, involving electronic health records, national health information network, and clinical decision support systems. HIT can improve efficiency by eliminating paper records, reducing duplicate tests, identifying drug interactions, and managing patients with multiple conditions. It also enables data for research and performance measurement. The America's Affordable Health Choices Act of 2009 (H.R. 3200) was introduced by Representative Dingell to improve health care quality through comparative effectiveness research. The bill consists of three divisions, with Division A focusing on private health insurance, including the establishment of an insurance exchange and a public option. Division C of the America's Affordable Health Choices Act of 2009 focuses on public health and workforce development, aiming to increase the primary care and public health workforce, promote preventive services, and strengthen quality measurement. The provisions in Division C include the Public Health Investment Fund, health centers, and health workforce programs authorized under the Public Health Service Act. The Public Health Service Act authorizes various health programs, including those related to health care quality, disparities, prevention, emergency care, behavioral health, and pain management. References to the Secretary of Health and Human Services are common. The report also includes discussions on insurance, Medicare, and Medicaid provisions in H.R. 3200. The House legislation, H.R. 3200, includes provisions for a national insurance program for purchasing community living assistance services and supports (CLASS). It also amends various Public Health Service Act programs with new authorizations for appropriations through FY2014. The House legislation, H.R. 3200, includes provisions for a national insurance program for purchasing community living assistance services and supports (CLASS). It also establishes a multi-billion dollar Public Health Investment Fund to provide additional funds for specified PHSA programs through FY2014. The Fund would supplement regular appropriations and amounts would be deposited from general revenues of the Treasury for FY2010 to FY2014. The Public Health Investment Fund in H.R. 3200 allocates $7.8 billion for FY2013 and $9.0 billion for FY2014 to designated provisions. Appropriations from the Fund are conditional on meeting baseline funding requirements for specific healthcare programs. The Public Health Investment Fund in H.R. 3200 allocates $7.8 billion for FY2013 and $9.0 billion for FY2014 to designated provisions. For a given fiscal year, the amount appropriated to the Prevention and Wellness Fund under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act is $650 million. Any amounts appropriated under this section would not count toward the appropriations committee allocations under the budget resolution. PHSA Sec. 330 authorizes the health center program, providing grants to community health centers, migrant health centers, health centers for the homeless, and health centers for residents of public housing. Health centers are a key component of the nation's health care safety net, offering primary care and preventive services to the uninsured and underinsured, with a focus on medically underserved areas and target populations. Health centers in medically underserved areas receiving Sec. 330 funding have liability protection from medical malpractice claims under FTCA. This coverage extends to employees, board members, and certain contractors, but not to volunteer healthcare providers. Barriers to provider volunteerism include lack of malpractice coverage, time, licensure costs, misperceptions about litigiousness, and limited capacity of health centers to recruit and retain volunteers. The health center program has bipartisan support and has expanded in recent years. The health center program, with bipartisan support, has significantly expanded in recent years. The program was reauthorized in 2008, including a study on school-based health clinics. Health centers increase access to primary care, reducing disparities and costs by preventing expensive ER visits. Proposed amendments would authorize necessary funding for the program in FY2013 and FY2014. The section authorizes appropriations from the Public Health Investment Fund for FY2010 to FY2014, amending PHSA Sec. 224 to extend FTCA liability protections to volunteer practitioners at Sec. 330-funded health centers. It also establishes a new grant program for School-Based Health Centers (SBHCs) under PHSA Sec. 399Z-1, with specific criteria for eligibility and fund usage requirements. The Secretary would prioritize qualified applicants for School-Based Health Centers (SBHCs) based on their care for underserved children and adolescents. $50 million would be authorized for FY2010, and SSAN for FY2011 through FY2014 to establish a program for nurse-managed health centers. Eligible entities would need to match 20% of the grant amount from nonfederal sources. The Secretary would award NMHC planning and operating grants to entities that agree to assess and serve the medically underserved population, provide primary care regardless of insurance status, and match 20% of the grant amount from nonfederal sources. Existing health professions education and training programs under PHSA Title VII and VIII provide funding for medical schools, promote community-based and rural practice, primary care, and opportunities for minorities and disadvantaged students. The National Health Service Corps program offers scholarships and student loan repayments for medical students and nurse practitioners. Funding for these programs has decreased significantly over the years. The NHSC offers scholarships and loan repayments for medical students, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants who serve in Health Professional Shortage Areas. However, there is high demand for these opportunities, with only 8% of the need being met. Medicare subsidizes medical residency programs through the GME program. Direct GME payments cover residency training program costs, including salaries, benefits, and overhead expenses. IME payments compensate teaching hospitals for higher patient care costs due to factors like sicker patients and inexperienced residents ordering more tests. The GME program provides payments to teaching hospitals for resident training. Health policy analysts see it as a tool for shaping future health workforce policy by encouraging training in nonhospital settings and linking subsidies to delivery system reform. Proposed changes would allow NHSC service obligations to be fulfilled on a half-time basis. The proposed changes would allow NHSC service obligations to be fulfilled on a half-time basis, with individuals agreeing to double the period of obligated service or accepting reduced loan repayment amounts. Additionally, amendments would increase the maximum annual NHSC loan repayment amount to $50,000 and permit teaching to count for up to 20% of the service obligation. The Public Health Investment Fund would provide additional funding for the NHSC program, with specific amounts allocated for scholarship and loan repayment programs for FY2010 to FY2014. PHSA Title VII, Part A, authorizes student loan programs for health professions students. Title VII, Part C, Sec.747 authorizes grants for health professions schools to develop training programs in various medical fields. Title VII, Part D, Sec. 751 authorizes the AHEC grant program to support community-based primary care residency programs. The House legislation includes sections to establish or amend programs for increasing healthcare professionals. The curr_chunk discusses the establishment of a new loan repayment program for healthcare professionals in underserved areas, similar to the NHSC program. It would require the Secretary to designate \"health professional needs areas\" and define eligible primary health services. The PHSA Sec. 340I proposes a new loan repayment program for healthcare professionals in underserved areas. It requires individuals to serve in health professional needs areas for two or more years, with the Secretary paying a portion of their educational loans. The program mirrors the NHSC Loan Repayment Program, with individuals able to fulfill the service requirement at specified practice settings. The PHSA Sec. 340I proposes a new loan repayment program for healthcare professionals in underserved areas, requiring individuals to serve for two or more years in health professional needs areas. The program mirrors the NHSC Loan Repayment Program, with the Secretary paying a portion of their educational loans. PHSA Sec. 340J mandates an annual report to Congress on the Frontline Health Professional Loan Repayment Program, while PHSA Sec. 340K allocates funds for loan repayments, with 90% for physicians and primary health professionals and 10% for non-physicians. PHSA Sec. 735 establishes general provisions for the administration of the student loan fund for medical and health professions students. The proposed amendment to PHSA Sec. 735 would allow health professions schools to require loan applicants to submit financial information, taking into account the applicant's financial independence. It would eliminate the requirement to consider the financial contribution of family members. Additionally, the amendment to PHSA Sec. 747 would require the Secretary to award grants for training programs in primary care. The amendment would award grants to entities for training programs in primary care, with preference given to those training providers for underserved areas and minority groups. Only schools of medicine or osteopathic medicine would be eligible for capacity building grants. The amendment aims to award grants for primary care residency training programs in community-based settings, prioritizing Medicare GME-eligible non-hospital providers, teaching health centers, FQHCs, and rural health clinics that serve vulnerable populations. The amendment aims to award grants for primary care residency training programs in community-based settings, prioritizing providers serving vulnerable populations. It would add a new section to PHSA Title VII, Part C, requiring the Secretary to award grants for dental training programs for various types of dentists and hygienists. Eligible entities include accredited schools of dentistry and training programs. The amendment proposes grants for dental training programs for dentists and hygienists in community-based settings. Eligible entities include accredited schools of dentistry, training programs, hospitals, or consortia. Funding amounts are specified for fiscal years 2010-2014, with a preference for entities meeting specific criteria. The section reauthorizes PHSA Sec. 747 through FY2014 and requires a study on the effectiveness of NHSC and Frontline Health Provider programs. It evaluates the impact of scholarships and loan repayments on incentivizing and retaining primary care providers in underserved areas. PHSA Title VIII supports nursing workforce development through grant and scholarship programs for nursing education in various areas. The House legislation would modify and reauthorize these programs. The House legislation would modify and reauthorize existing nursing workforce development programs, including adding new programs for nursing training and retention. It would also amend PHSA Sec. 801 to include nurse-managed health centers and require annual reports on loan and grant programs in Title VIII. The legislation would amend various sections of Title VIII, including increasing loan funds for recipients, adding eligible entities for special consideration, and changing grant activity priorities to focus on coordinated care and quality nursing skills. The legislation would amend Title VIII to increase loan amounts for students, raise the Nurse Faculty Loan Program limit, and delete sections related to promoting nursing careers. Additionally, it would authorize appropriations for various nursing education grants through FY2014. Title VIII, Part H would be amended to authorize appropriations from the Public Health Investment Fund for Advanced Education Nursing Grants, Workforce Diversity Grants, and Nurse Education, Practice, and Retention Grants. The legislation would allocate $115 million for FY2010, increasing to $140 million for FY2014. A new partnership grant program would be established to support nurse education, practice, and retention, providing matching grants for nursing training programs. A new partnership grant program would be established to support nurse education, practice, and retention, providing matching grants for nursing training programs. Eligible entities include partnerships of health care providers, labor unions, and trade associations. Preference would be given to programs that improve nurse retention, increase diversity in the nursing workforce, and have demonstrated success in transitioning health care workers into nursing. Recipients would need to provide a dollar-for-dollar match. Authorized appropriations would be provided for this program. The Secretary of Education, in consultation with HHS, would establish a partnership grant program to reduce student-to-school nurse ratios in public schools. Eligible agencies must have a ratio of 750 or more students per nurse, with special consideration given to high-need agencies serving low-income families. Matching funds may be required for grants. The Secretary of Education could require non-federal matching contributions from grant recipients for programs related to public health workforce development. Appropriations authority for these programs has expired, but new sections would be added to address this issue. The curr_chunk discusses the establishment of a Public Health Workforce Corps (PHWC) to address critical public health workforce shortages. Members of the PHWC would receive scholarships during training and loan repayment in exchange for service in designated shortage areas. This section would also establish a grant program for health professions schools and other entities to develop public health training programs. The curr_chunk discusses amending PHSA Sec. 766 to award grants for Public Health Training Centers. Grants would be preferentially awarded to entities training professionals for underserved communities, minority groups, public health specialties with shortages, and governmental public health. This aims to develop public health training programs and assist students. The section amends PHSA Sec. 766 to replace Healthy People goals with the National Prevention and Wellness Strategy. It also replaces PHSA Sec. 768 with new language for grants in preventive medicine training. Eligible applicants include schools of public health, health departments, medical schools, hospitals, or consortia. Additionally, it authorizes appropriations through the Public Health Investment Fund for public health workforce provisions. The Public Health Investment Fund authorizes appropriations for various public health workforce provisions, including training grants, public health centers, traineeships, and preventive medicine training. Amounts authorized for appropriation from the Fund range from $51 million for FY2010 to $62 million for FY2014. Additionally, the Fund reauthorizes appropriations for specific PHSA sections through FY2014 to promote diversity in public health programs. Part B authorizes programs to promote diversity in the health workforce, including grants for Centers of Excellence, scholarships for disadvantaged students, and loan repayments for faculty members. Title VIII authorizes grants to increase nursing education opportunities for individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds. Title VII authorizes grant programs for interdisciplinary, community-based health workforce training. The House legislation includes amendments to existing workforce diversity and training programs. The proposed amendments aim to increase the annual loan repayment amount for health workforce diversity programs, eliminate certain requirements for nursing workforce grants, coordinate health workforce diversity programs, and require annual reporting on Centers of Excellence program. The proposed amendments aim to establish new training programs for cultural and linguistic competency, interdisciplinary and team-based care models, and workforce information and analysis projects in the healthcare sector. Grants will be awarded to develop and implement these programs at health professions schools and academic health centers. The House legislation proposes establishing an Advisory Committee on Health Workforce Evaluation and Assessment to improve health professions workforce information and analysis. This committee would recommend classifications, methodologies, and procedures for assessing the health workforce. The Secretary would need to submit recommendations on health workforce supply, diversity, distribution, and retention, consulting with other departments. Sec. 2271 would require data collection on the health workforce and individuals in specified programs, with the Secretary authorized to collaborate with entities for data collection activities. The Advisory Committee develops classifications, methodologies, and procedures for data collection under PHSA Sec. 761(a). Secs. 2261 and 2271 mandate annual reports to Congress on Advisory Committee activities and data collection. The bill would authorize appropriations from the Public Health Investment Fund for health professions training, diversity, and interdisciplinary programs. The Advisory Committee on Health Workforce Evaluation and Assessment would receive funding of $87 million for FY2010, increasing to $113 million for FY2014. Additional funding would be authorized for various health workforce programs through FY2014. Amendments would be made to grants for health professions education under the GME program. The GME program allows teaching hospitals to receive payments for resident training, with caps on resident numbers and redistribution options. However, there are no set targets for resident physician training types or goals linked to Medicare GME payments. Teaching hospitals can receive payments for residents rotating in nonhospital settings under certain conditions, but regulatory requirements discourage such rotations. The House legislation aims to address issues in the GME program by establishing criteria for residency limits, redistributing unused positions, and assigning slots to other qualifying facilities for training primary care physicians. This includes encouraging residents to gain experience in nonhospital settings and community health centers. The legislation aims to redistribute residency positions to qualifying facilities based on specific criteria, including maintaining primary care residents and filling positions in a timely manner. Preference is given to hospitals with reduced training slots, three-year primary care programs, formal arrangements for training in nonhospital settings, and those in states with low resident-to-population ratios. Criteria for calculating payments for redistributed positions would be established, along with modifications for residents training in nonhospital settings. The legislation aims to redistribute residency positions based on specific criteria, including maintaining primary care residents and filling positions in a timely manner. It would modify requirements for residents training in nonhospital settings, with all time spent counting towards GME and IME payments if the hospital covers costs. The HHS Inspector General would assess the increase in time spent by residents in nonhospital settings, and a demonstration project would allow teaching health centers to contract with teaching hospitals for primary care residency training. The legislation aims to redistribute residency positions based on specific criteria, including maintaining primary care residents and filling positions in a timely manner. It would allow teaching health centers to contract with teaching hospitals for primary care residency training, with the center responsible for residents' salary and benefits. Residents training at the center would not count towards the contracting hospital's GME program cap. Additionally, hospitals could count resident time spent in non-patient care activities towards IME and GME payments. The Secretary would establish a process to redistribute medical residency slots from recently closed hospitals. The legislation aims to redistribute residency positions from closed hospitals to other hospitals in the same state. It sets goals for medical residency training programs, including training residents to work in non-acute settings, coordinate patient care, understand costs, work in teams, identify errors in healthcare delivery, and use electronic health records. GAO will evaluate the programs' progress in meeting these goals within 18 months. The study will provide recommendations on curriculum requirements and assess accreditation processes for residency programs. Four workforce-related provisions were added to legislation, including addressing long-term care and family caregiving. Amendments would also impact the Workforce Investment Act. The National Family Caregiver Support Program (NFCSP) under OAA Title III, Part E provides direct support to informal caregivers of the elderly. Funding was authorized for FY2007 through FY2011. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 required the establishment of a National Clearinghouse for Long-Term Care Information. Amendments would require the Assistant Secretary on Aging to make recommendations to federal entities on identifying appropriate means for long-term care. The Assistant Secretary on Aging would establish a Personal Care Attendant Workforce Advisory Panel and pilot program to improve conditions for long-term care workers. Funding for the National Family Caregiver Support Program would increase to $250 million for FY2010 through FY2012, with an additional $10 million for the National Clearinghouse for Long-Term Care Information. The Workforce Investment Act provides job training services for unemployed individuals. The Workforce Investment Act (WIA) provides job training services to unemployed and underemployed individuals through the Department of Labor. WIA Title I, Sec. 171 establishes pilot programs to develop innovative approaches for employment and training services. PHSA Title VII, Sec. 761 focuses on analyzing the health professions workforce and addressing workforce-related issues to guide future directions in health professions and nursing programs. Grants and contracts are awarded for targeted information collection, research on workforce questions, and non-federal analytic and research development. The House legislation includes sections amending the Workforce Investment Act to establish new grant programs for workforce training in healthcare. Grants of up to $1 million annually would be available for nonprofit organizations to provide training programs for healthcare workers. Federal leadership for health workforce analysis is carried out by the HRSA's National Center for Health Workforce Analysis. The House legislation includes new grant programs for workforce training in healthcare. Grants would be awarded to AHECs or similar nonprofit organizations for training programs in health care occupations. The Secretary of Labor would establish a website for information on the health care labor market and educational opportunities. National Health Workforce Training Grants would be awarded to eligible entities for training individuals in health care occupations. The Secretary of Labor would award grants for workforce training in healthcare, including technical assistance and data collection. $50 million would be authorized for National Health Workforce Training Grants and $1 million for the Online Health Professions Training Program Clearinghouse. Stakeholders are working on improving healthcare quality metrics and reporting. Efforts to improve healthcare quality metrics and reporting have been ongoing, with some using metrics for payment policies. However, there is no unified strategy or entity guiding these efforts. The Secretary is required to contract with a consensus-based entity to develop a national strategy for healthcare performance measurement. AHRQ has statutory authority in this area. AHRQ has statutory authority to develop quality measures for healthcare improvement, including research, testing, and dissemination. Current law lacks a process for multi-stakeholder input in selecting quality measures for CMS programs like PQRI and RHQDAPU. The House legislation aims to establish a national effort for quality improvement in healthcare by developing a comprehensive set of quality measures with input from multiple stakeholders. It includes creating a mechanism for evaluating data collection methods, harmonizing measure requirements across settings, and establishing national priorities for performance improvement. The legislation aims to establish a national effort for quality improvement in healthcare by developing quality measures with input from stakeholders. It includes transferring funds from Medicare trust funds and authorizing appropriations for this purpose. The Secretary would enter into agreements with entities to develop quality measures for healthcare services in the United States. The legislation aims to establish a national effort for quality improvement in healthcare by developing and testing quality measures with input from stakeholders. It includes transferring funds from Medicare trust funds and authorizing appropriations for this purpose. GAO would evaluate the implementation of data collection processes for quality measures used by the Secretary. The legislation aims to establish a national effort for quality improvement in healthcare by developing and testing quality measures with input from stakeholders. It includes transferring funds from Medicare trust funds and authorizing appropriations for this purpose. GAO would evaluate the implementation of data collection processes for quality measures used by the Secretary and report findings to Congress and the Secretary. This section would amend SSA Sec. 1808 to establish a process for multi-stakeholder groups to provide input into the selection of Medicare quality measures, requiring the Secretary to publish a list of measures being considered for rulemaking and the NQF to convene groups for recommendations on quality measures. The section requires an open and transparent process for activities, including summarizing recommendations from multi-stakeholder groups and comments on proposed measures. It mandates the Secretary to transfer funds from Medicare trust funds and authorizes appropriations for quality measure selection in healthcare programs. The curr_chunk discusses requirements for selecting quality measures in healthcare programs, including the endorsement of measures by the Secretary and submission of non-endorsed measures to NQF for consideration. NQF is required to explain reasons for non-endorsement. The curr_chunk discusses amending SSA Sec. 1890(d) to transfer funds from Medicare trust funds for a consensus-based entity, developing quality indicators for Alzheimer's and dementia care, and conducting a study on the Five-Star Quality Rating System. The study will evaluate the Five-Star Quality Rating System, including the possibility of eliminating composite ratings, implementing an appeals process, and assessing the impact on Medicare and Medicaid nursing facilities. AHRQ has the authority to conduct research on health care quality and patient information acquisition. AHRQ has the authority to provide financial assistance for establishing new centers for health services research, evaluations, and policy analysis. They are also responsible for collecting and disseminating health statistics on the U.S. population. AHRQ submits annual reports to Congress on national trends in healthcare quality and disparities in healthcare delivery. NCHS supports activities to improve healthcare effectiveness and quality through statistical and epidemiological research. The National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) collects statistics on illness, disability, health hazards, determinants of health, health resources, healthcare utilization, costs, and family dynamics in the U.S. A new amendment would establish a Center for Quality Improvement within the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) to prioritize best practices for improving healthcare delivery. The Center for Quality Improvement within the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) would prioritize best practices for improving healthcare delivery. It would focus on key areas such as health care-associated infections, surgery, emergency room, obstetrics, and child health services. The Center would also disseminate information on best practices, submit annual reports to Congress and the Secretary, and establish national priorities for performance improvement. Additionally, a new HHS Assistant Secretary for Health Information would be created under PHSA Title XVII. A new HHS Assistant Secretary for Health Information would be established under PHSA Title XVII, responsible for collecting, reporting, and publishing key health indicators annually. The Assistant Secretary would also ensure data sharing between federal departments and develop standards for health data collection. $300,000,000 would be authorized for FY2010 from the Public Health Investment Fund. The Public Health Investment Fund allocates $300,000,000 annually from FY2010 to FY2014 for PHSA Title IX, Part D and Sec. 1709. Federal law does not mandate reporting of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs), but this section proposes requiring hospitals and ambulatory surgical centers to report certain HAIs to participate in Medicare and Medicaid. The Secretary would establish procedures for reporting healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) in facilities for comparison purposes. ARRA allocated funds for comparative effectiveness research and created a Center for Comparative Effectiveness Research within AHRQ. The Center for Comparative Effectiveness Research, overseen by a Commission, includes members appointed by the HHS Secretary representing various stakeholders. The Commission cannot mandate coverage or reimbursement policies, and research conducted cannot be used to deny care. CMS cannot use research data for coverage determinations under Medicare. The House legislation proposes establishing the Health Care Comparative Effectiveness Research Trust Fund (CERTF) to fund research activities for medical treatments under Medicare. Funding would come from transfers from Medicare trust funds and fees imposed on health insurance and self-insured plans. Additionally, the legislation includes accountability requirements for Medicare certified skilled nursing and Medicaid certified nursing facilities. The Secretary would enhance information on the Medicare Nursing Home Compare website for SNFs and nursing facilities, develop a standardized complaint form with whistle-blower protections, establish civil money penalties for quality of care deficiencies, and require facilities to add new staff compliance and ethics training programs. The Secretary would require SNFs and nursing facilities to enhance staff training in dementia and abuse prevention, evaluate additional training for nurse aides and supervisors, and ensure language interpretation services for patients with limited English proficiency. HHS regulations mandate meaningful access for LEP individuals receiving financial assistance from HHS, including hospitals, nursing homes, and other healthcare providers. Medicare Part B payments are not considered recipients of HHS assistance. Research shows that LEP Medicare beneficiaries face challenges accessing healthcare due to lack of language services. The Civil Rights Act requires providers to offer interpreters, but reimbursement issues and poor enforcement make it difficult for LEP patients to access translation services. The Secretary may conduct a study on Medicare providers' use of language services. The study will analyze payment systems for language services for Medicare providers, including on-site interpreters, off-site interpretation, and adjustments for LEP patients. It will explore funding options and potential variations based on service providers, delivery methods, and costs. The bill also authorizes the Secretary to apply sanctions for non-compliance. The bill authorizes the Secretary to apply sanctions to Medicare Advantage organizations that fail to provide language services to LEP beneficiaries. A demonstration program will award grants to eligible Medicare providers to improve communication with underserved minority populations. Grantees must provide annual reports on language services provided. The bill authorizes a demonstration program to improve communication with underserved minority populations by providing language services to Medicare beneficiaries. The program includes evaluation, reporting requirements, and funding of $16 million per fiscal year. Additionally, the Secretary must contract with the Institute of Medicine for a report on the impact of language access services on LEP populations' health and healthcare. Employer-provided \"wellness\" programs utilize clinical and community-based prevention interventions to improve health. Clinical preventive services like cancer screenings may not result in cost savings but rather a net cost. There is debate on whether these services could lead to savings in a broader context and what savings may accrue from expanding community-based prevention activities. Cost-sharing for beneficiaries can reduce the utilization of certain preventive services. Cost-sharing can decrease utilization of preventive services. The Task Force on Community Preventive Services recommends reducing beneficiary cost-sharing for screening mammography. Current law addresses prevention through coverage of clinical preventive services under Medicare and Medicaid, community-based research, and regulation of employer-provided wellness programs. Insufficient evidence exists for reducing cost-sharing for cervical or colorectal cancer screening. The federal law does not mandate coverage of preventive services for state and local government and private health insurance plans, but Medicare Part B covers various clinical preventive services including screenings and vaccines. Medicare Part D covers FDA-licensed vaccines. Congress has waived cost-sharing for some Medicare covered preventive services, and state Medicaid plans must cover preventive services for beneficiaries under 21 years of age. Section 100 of the bill defines \"qualified health benefits plans\" as plans that provide private and public insurance meeting federal requirements, including coverage of an essential benefits package. Section 122(b) outlines required elements of this package, such as preventive services without cost-sharing, recommended by the Task Force on Clinical Preventive Services and CDC vaccines. The bill requires the essential benefits package to include preventive services recommended by the CDC, mental health services, and substance abuse services. It also mandates well baby and child care for children under 21, and waives cost-sharing for Medicare covered preventive services. The bill clarifies that coinsurance and deductibles are waived for colorectal cancer screening services, regardless of the code used or procedures performed. It also expands Medicare Part B coverage to include all federally recommended vaccines and allows FQHCs to receive reimbursement for preventive services. Additionally, certified diabetes educators are designated as Medicare-certified providers for diabetes self-management training services. This section of the bill would require Medicaid state plans to cover preventive services recommended by the Task Force on Clinical Preventive Services or vaccines recommended by the CDC for all beneficiaries without cost-sharing. It also mandates state Medicaid plans to cover FDA-approved smoking cessation products, including non-prescription products. The provision in the bill establishes a new PHSA Title XXXI \u2013Prevention and Wellness, creating a Prevention and Wellness Trust funded by the Public Health Investment Fund. The Trust would receive appropriations totaling $15.400 billion from FY2010 to FY2014. The bill establishes a Prevention and Wellness Trust funded by the Public Health Investment Fund, receiving appropriations totaling $15.400 billion from FY2010 to FY2014. The Trust would have $3.455 billion for FY2013 and $3.600 billion for FY2014, available for carrying out specified activities. Subtitle B requires the Secretary to submit a National Prevention and Wellness Strategy to Congress, focusing on evidence-based prevention and wellness activities. Subtitle C mandates the establishment of two task forces to address prevention efforts. The bill establishes two task forces: a Task Force on Clinical Preventive Services and a Task Force on Community Preventive Services, each tasked with reviewing evidence and developing recommendations for preventive services. $30 million would be appropriated annually from FY2010 to FY2014 for this purpose. Subtitle D, Secs. 3141 and 3142 focus on research on prevention and wellness, requiring consideration of the National Prevention and Wellness Strategy and Task Forces recommendations. Funding amounts authorized for this research are $100 million for FY2010, $150 million for FY2011, $200 million for FY2012, $250 million for FY2013, and $300 million for FY2014. Subtitle E, Sec. 3151 addresses the delivery of Community Prevention and Wellness Services, with the Secretary tasked to award planning grants. Subtitle F, Secs. 3161 and 3162 focus on Core Public Health Infrastructure, authorizing grants to state health departments and competitive grants for public health programs. Funding amounts authorized are $1.065 billion for FY2010, $1.260 billion for FY2011, $1.365 billion for FY2012, $1.570 billion for FY2013, and $1.600 billion for FY2014. Subtitle F, Secs. 3161 and 3162 authorize grants for core public health infrastructure needs, including competitive grants to state, local, and tribal health departments. The Secretary would award grants with specified funding formulas and maintenance of effort requirements. Additionally, a program of voluntary accreditation for health departments and public health laboratories would be developed. Funding amounts authorized are $800 million for FY2010, $1.000 billion for FY2011, $1.100 billion for FY2012, $1.200 billion for FY2013, and $1.265 billion for FY2014. Subtitle G, Sec. 3171 of the bill provides definitions and procedures for transitioning existing preventive services task forces. Employer-sponsored wellness programs are subject to HIPAA's rules and may be affected by other statutes like the ADA. Employers are increasingly offering incentives for participation in health programs. HIPAA prohibits employer-sponsored health plans from discriminating based on health status, except for wellness programs that offer incentives for participation. Incentives for joining a program are allowed, but those based on achieving specific health outcomes must meet certain requirements to be considered nondiscriminatory. Employer-sponsored wellness programs must meet specific requirements to promote health and prevent disease, including offering a reasonable alternative for individuals with difficulties. The ADA exempts health programs if participation is voluntary and health information is kept confidential. However, offering incentives may make a wellness program involuntary if required for insurance participation. The HIPAA privacy rule protects individually identifiable health information acquired through employer-sponsored wellness programs. Entities operating wellness programs outside of the health plan must have a HIPAA-compliant business associate contract. ARRA strengthened the privacy rule's business associate requirements, making entities criminally liable for violations. Health plans can disclose health information to employers under certain conditions, with restrictions on using the information for employment-related actions. The Secretary of Labor would establish a grant program to assist employers. The Secretary of Labor would establish a grant program to help employers cover the costs of providing wellness programs to their employees. Qualified employers offering a qualified health benefits plan would be eligible for grants capped at $200 per employee for smaller employers and $100 per employee for larger employers, up to a total of $50,000 for an employer over three years. Grants would cover costs of a certified wellness program, excluding food expenses. The Secretary of Labor, in coordination with the Health Choices Commissioner and the CDC Director, would certify wellness programs meeting specific criteria, including evidence-based practices, cultural appropriateness, and required components like health awareness and employee engagement. Programs must have supportive work policies but cannot mandate participation or provide incentives. The FDA is responsible for ensuring the safety and effectiveness of medical products, which make up over 15% of healthcare costs. Their regulation impacts the cost, quality, and accessibility of healthcare. Qualified wellness programs must keep employee health information confidential, with employers having no access to the data. Entities offering wellness programs are considered business associates of the health plan. The FDA regulates medical products to ensure safety and quality, impacting healthcare costs and accessibility. House legislation includes provisions for a national medical device registry, nutrition labeling at restaurants and vending machines, and prohibiting activities that delay FDA approval of generics. The House legislation includes provisions for a national medical device registry, biosimilars licensure pathway, and tracking mechanisms for high-risk medical devices. The House legislation includes provisions for a national medical device registry to analyze postmarket safety data on certain medical devices. The Secretary would link device data with patient outcomes and adopt standards for electronic health records. Congress is considering options to promote healthy eating, including requiring nutrition labeling on some foods. One option for promoting healthy eating is to require nutrition labeling for foods exempted from regulations, such as those served in restaurants. States and localities are prohibited from establishing their own labeling requirements that differ from federal regulations. Chain restaurants with 20 or more locations would be required to provide nutrition labeling for standard menu items. Chain restaurants with 20 or more locations would be required to disclose the number of calories in standard menu items and provide detailed nutritional information upon request. Vending machine operators with 20 or more machines must display calorie information for each food item. The Secretary would establish standards for disclosing nutrient content for menu items with different flavors or varieties listed as a single item. The section requires disclosure of calorie information in food items before purchase, with the Secretary tasked to create regulations and provide progress reports to Congress. It amends FFDCA Sec. 403A to preempt state and local nutrition labeling requirements not identical to FFDCA Sec. 403(q), including new requirements for restaurants and retail food. The amendments are not to preempt state or local laws unless they create similar nutrition disclosures. Congressional interest in generic drugs has been sparked by reports of brand name manufacturers paying generic drug makers to delay market entry. Generics help control healthcare costs with lower prices due to lower development costs. Generic drugs offer cost-saving options for consumers but reduce revenue for brand name manufacturers, potentially impacting their ability to develop new drugs. Companies file Abbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDAs) with the FDA to market generics, which can lead to patent infringement litigation. Settlements between patent owners and ANDA applicants are not restricted by the FFDCA, but certain settlements must be reported to the DOJ and FTC under the MMA of 2003. The APA outlines procedures for FTC actions related to generic drug disputes. The APA Sec. 553 mandates agencies to publish a notice of proposed rulemaking in the Federal Register for comment. The proposed section in FFDCA Sec. 505 would make it unlawful for an ANDA applicant to receive anything of value in a patent infringement settlement that limits research, development, or sales of the drug. The proposal would allow the FTC to enforce provisions related to ANDA drug sales and patent infringement settlements, requiring filings with the DOJ and FTC. It also mandates GAO studies on pharmaceutical patent litigation and permits FTC exemptions for agreements promoting market competition and consumer benefit. The proposal aims to enforce rules for market competition and consumer benefit, including interpretive rules and policy statements. Biosimilars are similar to brand-name biologics, while generic drugs are identical to brand-name chemical drugs. Biologics are complex proteins made from living organisms, requiring special handling and administration methods. Comparing biosimilars to brand-name biologics is scientifically challenging due to their complex structures. The FDA may require additional clinical trials for biosimilars before approval, similar to generic chemical drugs. Congress is interested in an expedited approval pathway for biosimilars to achieve cost savings, similar to the Hatch-Waxman Act for generic drugs. This allows biosimilar companies to rely on the FDA's previous safety and effectiveness findings for the innovator drug, avoiding the need for costly clinical trials and initial research and development. The cost of brand-name biologics is often high, with drugs like Enbrel costing $16,000 per year. A pathway for FDA approval of biosimilars is being considered to promote market competition and lower prices. Biosimilars are defined as highly similar to brand-name products with no clinically meaningful differences. This would amend PHSA Sec. 351 to allow for biosimilar approval. The Secretary may determine that certain elements in the application for licensure of a biological product as biosimilar or interchangeable are unnecessary. Interchangeable products can be substituted without the intervention of a healthcare provider. Special requirements apply to biosimilars with higher risks. The first interchangeable biological product may have exclusive marketing rights and a 12-year data exclusivity period. The proposed legislation would provide a 12-year data exclusivity period for reference biological products, with an additional six months if pediatric studies show health benefits. The Secretary may publish guidance for public comment on biological product licensure, ensuring unique names for labeling and packaging. A process for patent infringement would also be established. The proposed legislation includes a 12-year data exclusivity period for reference biological products, with an additional six months for pediatric studies. It establishes a process for patent infringement claims against applicants for a biological product license and allows for the collection of user fees for biosimilar application reviews. Additionally, funding for trauma care research and grants for trauma centers affected by drug-related violence are authorized under PHSA Title XII. Many trauma experts believe the first 60 minutes after an injury are crucial for effective trauma care. Trauma systems aim to provide access to trauma centers within this \"golden hour\" to save lives. However, the distribution of trauma centers across states and regions varies, leading to disparities in access. While most U.S. residents can reach a level I or II trauma center within an hour, rural areas face challenges in access. Proposed legislation aims to amend provisions in the Public Health Service Act to address these issues. The proposed legislation aims to establish a grant program to fund existing trauma centers and establish new trauma centers in urban areas with a high level of trauma due to violent crimes. Trauma centers must be designated by the American College of Surgeons or state health authorities to be eligible for grants. The proposed legislation aims to establish a grant program for trauma centers. The Secretary would reserve funds for rural and urban trauma centers, give preference to areas with unmet needs, and require financial support from states and local entities. States without designated trauma center levels would be defined, with levels I and II as the highest. Preference would be given based on geography. The proposed legislation aims to establish a grant program for trauma centers, with preference given based on geography and need. Grantee trauma centers must participate in a professional trauma care system, maintain access to trauma services, and provide data to a national registry. Grants would be limited to three years, with 90% of funds allocated for core mission grants. The proposed legislation establishes a grant program for trauma centers, with 90% of funds for core mission grants and 10% for emergency relief and new centers. The Secretary must report to Congress biennially on the program. Authorization of appropriations includes $100 million for FY2010 and SSAN for FY2011-FY2015. Funds not used for emergencies or new centers will support existing trauma centers. A new Emergency Care Coordination Center will be established within the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response. The proposed legislation establishes a new Emergency Care Coordination Center within the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR). The Center Director would coordinate with the Federal Interagency Committee on Emergency Medical Services to promote research in emergency medicine and trauma care, regional partnerships in emergency medical systems, and preparedness. A Council of Emergency Care would advise the Director, and the Secretary must report to Congress on activities, including issues like emergency department crowding. Authorized appropriations for this section would be available for FY2010 through FY2014. The new Center established by this section would amend PHSA Title III, Part B by adding a new PHSA Sec. 315. It requires the Secretary to establish multi-year demonstration projects for innovative models of regionalized emergency care systems. Eligible entities would be partnerships between states and local governments. The projects would coordinate services, access to emergency medical systems, patient transportation, resource tracking, and hospital decisions. The Secretary is required to establish multi-year demonstration projects for innovative models of regionalized emergency care systems. Eligible entities must submit an application with required information and make nonfederal matching financial contributions. Grantees must submit an evaluation report within 90 days of project completion. Funding priority is given to entities serving medically underserved populations. An independent entity will evaluate the demonstration programs. The Secretary is required to establish a state grant program to assist veterans in becoming licensed EMTs after completing military emergency medical training. $12 million would be appropriated annually for FY2010 through FY2015, with 3% reserved for evaluation. Grants can be used for training, reimbursement of costs, and expediting licensure. Eligible states must contract with an independent entity to evaluate the demonstration programs. The state grant program aims to assist veterans in becoming licensed EMTs by providing funding for training and expediting the licensure process. States must demonstrate a shortage of EMTs to be eligible for the grant. GAO is required to conduct a study on barriers faced by veterans seeking to become licensed as civilian health professionals. Dental health facilities and assets are to be included in national public health emergency preparedness goals. The curr_chunk discusses amendments to various acts to include emergency dental personnel and facilities in public health emergency preparedness goals. It clarifies that training programs can be conducted at federal dental health facilities and designates the Chief Medical Officer of the Department of Homeland Security as the primary point of contact for public health emergencies. Existing behavioral health programs authorized under PHSA Title V and Title IX provide funding for prevention and treatment of mental health and substance abuse problems, administered by SAMHSA. Insurers offering behavioral health coverage must provide it on par with physical health coverage. In 2007, 11% of Americans experienced serious psychological distress, impacting daily activities. The House legislation addresses behavioral health issues, focusing on mental health parity, federally qualified behavioral health centers, training programs, and postpartum depression. QHBPs would need to comply with existing parity rules for mental health and substance abuse benefits, while the essential benefits package under the public health insurance option must include behavioral health coverage. The public health insurance option must include behavioral health services with full parity mental health and substance abuse treatment benefits. The provision establishes federally qualified behavioral health centers and requires certification every five years based on specified criteria. The provision establishes federally qualified behavioral health centers, requiring certification every five years based on specified criteria. It also amends various sections of the Public Health Service Act to support interdisciplinary mental and behavioral health training programs. Eligible entities include accredited schools or programs of psychology. The provision establishes federally qualified behavioral health centers, requiring certification every five years based on specified criteria. Eligible entities for funding include accredited schools or programs of psychology, psychiatry, social work, and other specified disciplines. Preference is given to applicants with a record of training health professionals for underserved communities, supporting teaching programs for vulnerable populations, and training individuals from underserved or disadvantaged backgrounds. Annual reporting to Congress is required, with $60 million authorized for each fiscal year from 2010 to 2014. The program allocates $60 million annually from FY2010 to FY2014, with 15% earmarked for psychology training. It aims to enhance research on postpartum conditions, improve screening and diagnostic techniques, and develop education programs. The Secretary must study and report on the benefits of screening for postpartum conditions within two years. Congress suggests conducting a longitudinal study on the mental health consequences of resolving pregnancies. Authorized funding is available for these initiatives. The Pain Consortium was established by NIH under general authorities in PHSA Title III and Title IV to enhance pain research and collaboration among researchers. PHSA Sec. 403 requires the NIH Director to submit a biennial report to the President and Congress on research activities, including pain and palliative care. The House legislation includes sections addressing pain research, education, and awareness as a national public health problem. The bill aims to address pain as a national public health issue by convening a Conference on Pain to increase recognition of pain in the US. It includes provisions for a report on the Conference's findings and authorizes $500,000 for FY2010 and FY2011. Additionally, it encourages the NIH Director to continue research on pain causes and treatments through the Pain Consortium. The bill aims to address pain as a national public health issue by establishing pain research initiatives funded by the PHSA Common Fund. It requires the Secretary to create an Interagency Pain Research Coordinating Committee and implement a national pain care education outreach campaign. Awards may be given to assist with the campaign's development and implementation. The bill authorizes appropriations for telehealth networks and resource centers, grants for telemedicine licensure coordination, and aims to reduce health disparities through telehealth technologies. The grants are administered by HRSA's Office for the Advancement of Telehealth (OAT). The bill aims to expand the eligibility criteria for facilities participating in telehealth networks and increase the activities for which funds can be used. It also establishes new criteria for funding preference and reporting requirements for telehealth grant programs, authorizing appropriations of $10 million for FY2010. The bill authorizes grants for telehealth licensure coordination among states, with $10 million for FY2010 and additional funding for FY2011 through FY2014. It includes grants for demonstration programs using schools as influenza vaccination centers, coordinating with various agencies to ensure coverage for vaccination costs. Participation is voluntary, and the program covers vaccine and administration costs for children not covered by existing programs or insurance. The bill authorizes grants for demonstration programs using schools as influenza vaccination centers. The program covers vaccine and administration costs for children not covered by existing programs or insurance. Grants are awarded to eligible partnerships in different states to conduct a two-year demonstration program. The Secretary must report to Congress on the program's impact on influenza vaccination rates. The bill authorizes grants for school vaccination programs for influenza, including pandemic response. It also reauthorizes the WISEWOMAN program for preventive health services for low-income women. Funding for the WISEWOMAN program expired in FY2003 but has continued. Currently, 19 states and two tribal organizations receive funding. The bill authorizes grants for school vaccination programs for influenza, including pandemic response. It also reauthorizes the WISEWOMAN program for preventive health services for low-income women. 19 states and two tribal organizations are receiving funding under the Secretary's general authority to award grants for public health programs. The section removes the three-state limit and authorizes specific amounts for the WISEWOMAN program for FY2010 to FY2014. Additionally, a new state grant program for evidence-based education programs to reduce teen pregnancy or sexually transmitted diseases is created, with funding based on the proportion of low-income children in each state. States must provide matching funds and use a portion of the grant for program evaluation. The Secretary would develop a registry of evidence-based programs for states to choose from using grant funds. $50 million would be authorized annually for FY2010 through FY2014 for programs related to autism spectrum disorder and other developmental disabilities. Grants would be provided for state epidemiological data collection on ASD, establishment of regional centers of excellence, and activities to increase public awareness and research on ASD and developmental disabilities. The Secretary is directed to increase public awareness of ASD and other developmental disabilities, promote early screening, and support evidence-based interventions. An Interagency Autism Coordinating Committee must be established to track research, monitor federal activities, and submit an annual research plan to Congress. Progress reports on activities related to ASD and developmental disabilities must be submitted to Congress, and appropriations are authorized for these activities. The section authorizes appropriations for activities related to autism and developmental disabilities through FY2011. It introduces a new National Training Initiative to award grants for interdisciplinary training and education programs. Up to 2% of funds will be reserved for a national organization to provide training and technical assistance to University Centers for Excellence in Developmental Disabilities. The section authorizes appropriations for activities related to autism and developmental disabilities through FY2011, including a new National Training Initiative to award grants for training programs. A national organization will provide training and technical assistance to University Centers for Excellence in Developmental Disabilities, with $17 million authorized for FY2011. If funds are less, competitive grants of at least $250,000 per grant will be awarded. Up to four additional grants will be awarded to expand the capacity of the existing national network. The curr_chunk discusses grants for medication management services provided by licensed pharmacists to ensure appropriate use of Medicare Part D drugs. It authorizes $2 million for grants from FY2011 to FY2015 and requires the Secretary to provide support for these services. CMS examined MTM models and concluded it's too early to determine their impact on clinical outcomes. AHRQ would establish an MTM grant program by May 1, 2010, requiring grantees to provide specified services to individuals taking four or more medications, including assessing health status, formulating treatment plans, monitoring therapy, and coordinating care. Pharmacists would deliver targeted MTM services to those on high-risk medications. The Secretary would assess and evaluate a program targeting individuals taking multiple medications, high-risk medications, or with chronic diseases. Grants would be awarded to promote positive health behaviors in underserved communities through community health workers providing education and outreach on health issues. The Secretary would prioritize grant applicants targeting underserved communities with high rates of uninsured residents, chronic diseases, and infant mortality. Applicants with experience in providing health and social services to underserved individuals would also be prioritized. The Secretary would prioritize grant applicants targeting underserved communities with high rates of uninsured residents, chronic diseases, and infant mortality. The grant program would encourage outcome-based payment systems for community health workers. $30 million would be authorized for the grant program annually from FY2010 to FY2014. States would only be eligible for federal funds if they agree to adhere to certain requirements. The Secretary is required to conduct a study and report to Congress on the potential duplication of grant programs within the bill. They must also report on neglected diseases of poverty, including parasitic diseases, and the need for primary eye and vision care. The report aims to enhance health policy to address these diseases effectively. The Secretary is mandated to conduct a study on primary eye and vision care, focusing on underserved populations, the role of optometrists in diagnosing and treating eye conditions, barriers to minority recruitment in optometry, and federal support for clinical optometric education. The report must be submitted to Congress within 18 months of enactment. The Secretary must report to Congress within 18 months of enactment on the study findings, stakeholder comments, and recommendations."
