    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Korean Immigration Commemorative Coin Act\". It includes findings related to the Act. Congress finds that on January 13, 2003, the 100th anniversary of the first wave of Korean immigration to the United States was commemorated by over 100 Korean American communities. In December 1902, 56 men, 21 women, and 25 children arrived in Honolulu, Hawaii, aboard the S.S. Gaelic, marking the beginning of Korean immigration to the US. Since then, approximately 1,000,000 Koreans have immigrated to the United States, with Korean Americans serving in the US Armed Forces in every war. Korean Americans have thrived in the United States through strong family ties, community support, and hard work. They have invigorated various communities and established themselves in professions such as medicine, law, finance, and government. The partnership between the US and Korea has promoted peace, stability, and economic benefits in the Asia Pacific region and beyond. SEC. 3. COIN SPECIFICATIONS.
