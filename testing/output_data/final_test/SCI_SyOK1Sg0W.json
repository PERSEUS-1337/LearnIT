This paper introduces adaptive quantization, a method that optimizes precision for each network parameter to minimize loss, addressing issues overlooked in previous studies. The proposed method introduces adaptive quantization to optimize precision for each network parameter, achieving near state-of-the-art reduction in model size with similar error rates. Experiments on various datasets show compressions close to floating-point methods without loss of accuracy in Deep Neural Networks applications. Neural network compression techniques aim to reduce model sizes for deployment in resource-constrained edge computing environments. Methods like weight quantization, pruning, sharing, and low rank approximation have shown promise in reducing model complexity. Recent advancements have explored training models with even lower bit precision parameters. However, these quantization methods have constraints that need to be addressed. In this paper, the authors propose adaptive quantization to address issues with current quantization methods. They aim to quantize each network parameter with a unique width based on its importance, allowing for higher precision representation of parameters that impact accuracy the most. This approach aims to overcome limitations in existing quantization techniques, which often ignore the degradation in accuracy during quantization and treat all parameters equally. The proposed method introduces adaptive quantization to address issues in current quantization techniques. It aims to represent high-impact parameters with higher precision while reducing the model size significantly. By incorporating the loss function into an optimization problem, the method determines the precision of each parameter based on its importance. This optimization problem has a closed-form approximate solution and can be iteratively applied to minimize the model size. Testing on classification benchmarks like MNIST, CIFAR-10, and SVHN shows near or better compressions achieved across all benchmarks. In this work, the method introduces adaptive quantization to reduce model size by representing important parameters with higher precision. It extends the study of redundancy to fixed-point quantization of network parameters, achieving compressions comparable to state-of-the-art pruning and weight-sharing techniques. Our approach aims to represent critical parameters with high precision, similar to weight pruning techniques. We define the problem of minimizing network size as an optimization task and propose a trust region technique for solving it. The algorithm's hyperparameters are chosen carefully, and the benefits of fine-grained quantization for performance are discussed, including storage advantages and reduced computation on compatible hardware. Our proposed quantization approach aims to reduce computation by utilizing non-standard quantization depths, ideal for FPGAs and specialized hardware. This approach allows for efficient computation units to process fixed-point quantized parameters, minimizing the overall number of bits processed for a network. A formal definition of the optimization problem and key characteristics of the objective function are derived. The optimization problem involves minimizing the aggregate bit-widths of network parameters while controlling quantization noise. Critical parameters are assigned high precision for accuracy, while ineffective ones are pruned. The problem is formally defined with key characteristics of the objective function. The optimization problem involves minimizing the total number of bits required to represent model parameters while controlling quantization noise. A smooth upper limit is derived for the objective function, with a constant upper bound on the loss of the neural network used to bound accuracy loss. This is the first time such a bound has been developed in the literature. The optimization problem aims to minimize the number of bits needed to represent model parameters while controlling quantization error. The quantization error is limited to \u03c4 i, and the problem can be solved using Algorithm 1. Previous research shows that DNNs can be quantized to 8 bits without significant accuracy loss. The minimization ensures the smallest N q (\u03c9 i) is chosen. The optimization problem involves minimizing the number of bits needed to represent model parameters while controlling quantization error. Algorithm 1 is used to solve this problem, ensuring the smallest N q (\u03c9 i) is chosen. Parameters are quantized for signed values by using one bit to represent the sign and scaling them to the range of [-1, 1]. The output of a quantized layer is multiplied by a scaling factor r. The objective function is non-smooth, presenting challenges in optimization. The optimization problem involves minimizing the number of bits needed to represent model parameters while controlling quantization error. A method is presented to address challenges posed by a non-smooth objective function and an unknown, non-linear constraint. The approach involves using the upper bound of the objective function to approximate the minimum of N Q (W) and finding the optimal T for \u03a6(T) to calculate quantized parameters. The optimization problem aims to minimize \u03a6(T) while ensuring the loss constraint is not violated. The difference between the objective function and \u03a6(T) allows for iterative reduction of N Q (W). The iterative algorithm aims to reduce N Q (W) by iteratively optimizing an approximation of the objective function using a linear bound of the loss function. Trust Region method is employed to monitor the accuracy of the model within a defined neighborhood. The algorithm uses a trust region method to optimize the constraint instead of the objective function. A spherical trust region is defined around a point where the loss function is accurately estimated. The constraint is equivalent to a specific condition, allowing for the extension of the result to any point in Rn. The algorithm utilizes a trust region method to optimize the constraint instead of the objective function. A spherical trust region is defined around a point where the loss function is accurately estimated, extending the result to any point in Rn. Algorithm 2 outlines the method for solving the original optimization problem, initializing the trust region radius and quantizing parameters with 32 bits. Subsequently, it iteratively solves the subproblem and calculates the quantized parameters. The algorithm uses a trust region method to optimize the constraint, adjusting the trust region size based on the accuracy of the linear estimation. Convergence is determined by the loss function and trust region radius, with updates made accordingly in each iteration. The algorithm utilizes trust region methods to optimize the constraint, adjusting the trust region size based on linear estimation accuracy. Singular points are handled by scaling the tolerance vector to ensure correct solutions. The algorithm adjusts trust region size using linear estimation accuracy and scales tolerance vector to handle singular points. Hyper-parameters determine convergence speed and classification accuracy, with smaller trust regions leading to slower convergence and larger regions to higher error rates. Loss bound affects model size reduction, with higher bounds decreasing accuracy. The algorithm dynamically chooses loss bound values during convergence. In the process of adaptive quantization, the loss bound is initially set to the loss of the floating-point model and then increased by a scale value. This iterative process is repeated a set number of times. The quantization is evaluated on image classification benchmarks by training a neural network in floating-point, compressing the model using a quantization algorithm, and fine-tuning the accuracy before reapplying the quantization process. After fine-tuning the model with algorithm 3, the process is repeated three times for each benchmark to create the smallest model. The accuracy and size of the quantized models are then evaluated, considering the reduction in model size achieved. It is important to assess potential overheads of bookkeeping for quantization widths, which can vary significantly depending on the hardware platform. Specialized hardware may offset all bookkeeping overheads, while CPU/GPU could require up to 60% additional storage. In this paper, the scope is limited to algorithm analysis using MNIST, CIFAR-10, and SVHN benchmarks. Different network architectures are employed for each dataset, with parameters in full precision. The only variation is the number of neurons used for CIFAR-10. In CIFAR-10, 4096 neurons are used instead of 1024 in BNN, without batch normalization layers. Models are trained with Cross entropy loss and L2 regularization. Computational load is mainly from back propagation and quantization, both with O(n) complexity. Quantization is implemented on Intel Core i7 CPU with Titan X GPU. Performance is evaluated by analyzing compression rate and error rates after quantization passes. The quantization algorithm aims to reduce parameter precisions while maintaining classification accuracy. Results show that error rates decrease with each pass of adaptive quantization and retraining on LeNet with the MNIST dataset. The highest compression rate is achieved after the third pass, but further improvements are limited. Increasing retraining epochs or choosing a lower cost bound can help improve error rates. The algorithm evaluates convergence speed by measuring compression rate. Model size reduces quickly initially but diminishes after 25 iterations. Trust region size is adjusted when steps fail the loss function test. The technique is adaptable to other models. The proposed technique is adaptable to other model compression techniques. It subsumes previous approaches and can be specialized to implement them more effectively. Pruning involves setting small model parameters to zero, reducing the number of connections in the network. Adaptive Quantization eliminates a significant portion of parameters in DNNs trained for different datasets. Adaptive Quantization eliminates fewer parameters compared to Deep Compression, which uses full precision for remaining parameters. This difference is due to how each technique identifies connections for elimination. For example, the CIFAR-10 model trained with L2 regularization has many small-value parameters, making Deep Compression less suitable. In the CIFAR-10 model, weight-sharing is used to create a small dictionary of parameters by grouping them into bins with the same value. Deep Compression implements weight-sharing through k-means clustering, while Adaptive Quantization produces bins without assuming a fixed number. Deep Compression does not assume the total number of bins and allocates a smaller dictionary for fully connected layers. Adaptive Quantization results show that fully connected layers require smaller quantization widths. Binarized Neural Networks BID4 and Quantized Neural Networks BID9 reduce model size with a trade-off between accuracy and error rate for benchmark datasets. MNIST, CIFAR-10, and SVHN achieve significant compression with optimal points highlighted in red. Our approach achieves competitive quantizations for MNIST, CIFAR-10, and SVHN datasets with a decrease in accuracy of 0.12%, -0.02%, and 0.7% respectively. Previous quantization techniques may be slower than full-precision training, but our method shows that through pruning and quantization, parameters can be quantized by equivalent of 0.03, 0.27, and 1.3 bits per parameter. Adaptive Quantization allows for unique quantization precisions for each parameter, leading to a notably smaller network without requiring quantized training. It outperforms previous methods in compressing neural network models, achieving 64\u00d7, 35\u00d7, and 14\u00d7 compression with optimal trade-offs between accuracy and model size. The proposed method achieves significant compression rates with minimal decrease in accuracy compared to state-of-the-art techniques like BNN and Deep Compression. Adaptive Quantization shows superior performance in model size reduction while maintaining error rates, especially in MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets. However, in SVHN, BNN slightly outperforms Adaptive Quantization due to differences in initial error rates. Comparing Adaptive Quantization to Deep Compression in MNIST, similarities are observed with slight advantages for deep compression. Deep Compression achieves slightly smaller error rates for the same model size compared to Adaptive Quantization. This is due to differences in their approaches, with Deep Compression using full-precision parameters and performing complete retraining after pruning, while Adaptive Quantization uses fixed-point quantized parameters and requires little retraining. Adaptive Quantization offers flexibility for specialized forms of quantization, such as identifying groups of parameters needing high-precision representation. In this work, neural network models are quantized to represent only critical parameters with high precision, aiming to minimize data movement and simplify computations for faster inference on resource-constrained hardware. The quantization process requires all parameters in the same layer to have the same quantization width, with Adaptive Quantization finding the best model by solving a minimization problem for each layer. This approach accelerates implementations by reducing the complexity of computations needed for inference. The proposed technique accelerates implementations on resource-constrained hardware by pruning unnecessary parameters or reducing their precisions. Combined with existing fixed-point computation techniques, small fixed-point models achieve fast inference with high accuracies. Experiments show that DNN model sizes can be significantly reduced without loss of accuracy, resulting in models smaller than state-of-the-art quantization techniques. Adaptive Quantization can provide similar results to floating-point model compression techniques."
