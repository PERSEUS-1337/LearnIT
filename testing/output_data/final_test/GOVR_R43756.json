    "content": "Since 9/11, Al Qaeda-affiliated groups have increased in the Middle East and Africa, with varying levels of operational integration. Some groups focus on local conflicts, posing a threat to the US and its allies. The Islamic State has also rapidly expanded in the region. The rise of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria unsettled Al Qaeda, leading to tensions between the two groups. However, as the Islamic State weakened, Al Qaeda may benefit in terms of recruits and resources. The campaign against the Islamic State has reignited debates on counterterrorism policies and legislation. Al Qaeda's internal debates on leadership and tactics may prompt a reexamination of the group's evolution since 9/11. Osama bin Laden established Al Qaeda in 1988 from Afghan insurgency veterans. After conducting terrorist attacks, Al Qaeda's leadership fled Afghanistan post-9/11, with Bin Laden being killed in Pakistan in 2011. Despite leadership decimation, affiliates have remained resilient, with groups in the Middle East and Africa pledging allegiance to Al Qaeda. Al Qaeda affiliates in the Middle East and Africa, including AQI and AQIM, pledged allegiance to Al Qaeda leaders. AQI, previously known as Tawhid wal Jihad, emerged in 2002 and rebranded as ISI after Zarqawi's death in 2006. AQIM, formerly GSPC, originated as an Islamist insurgent group. The Group for Preaching and Combat (GSPC) originated from an Islamist insurgent faction in Algeria's civil conflict. Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) formed in 2009 from a merger between Al Qaeda branches in Saudi Arabia and Yemen. Al Shabaab joined Al Qaeda in 2012, emerging as an offshoot of Somalia's Council of Islamic Courts. The Nusra Front emerged in Syria in late 2011 as an offshoot of the Islamic State of Iraq (ISI), later renaming itself Jabhat Fatah al Sham in 2016. In 2017, Jabhat Fatah al Sham merged with other groups to form Hay'at Tahrir al Sham. Al Qaeda's influence over affiliated groups is debated, with some seeing it as decentralized. Former National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC) Director Nicholas Rasmussen described Al Qaeda as a covert organization with barriers to entry, operating differently from the Islamic State. Divisions emerged between Al Qaeda's central leadership and the Islamic State of Iraq (ISI), leading to ISI becoming Al Qaeda's primary rival. This rift began over operations in Syria and escalated as ISI leader Abu Bakr al Baghdadi rejected Al Qaeda's authority. ISI leader Abu Bakr al Baghdadi rejected Al Qaeda leader Ayman al Zawahiri's authority, leading to the formation of the Nusra Front in Syria. The Nusra Front operated independently before Baghdadi revealed the link to ISI in 2013. The Islamic State of Iraq and the Al-Nusrah Front merged to form the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant [ISIL]. Nusra Front leader Jawlani and Al Qaeda leader Zawahiri opposed the merger. Zawahiri later severed ties with ISIL due to clashes and intra-jihadist violence. The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant [ISIL] was not consulted or informed about its establishment and has no organizational relationship with Al-Qa'ida. ISIL declared itself a sovereign political entity and established a caliphate in June 2014, expanding its territory in Syria and Iraq. Many foreign jihadists defected from the Nusra Front to join the Islamic State. In Syria, foreign jihadists defected from the Nusra Front to the Islamic State, leaving Nusra to regroup as a primarily Syrian organization. Nusra formed alliances with Syrian armed groups and focused on attacking the Asad government, aligning with Zawahiri's strategy for AQ-affiliated groups. Nusra's roots in Syria run deep with up to 70% Syrian membership, contrasting with the Islamic State's reliance on foreign fighters. As of early 2018, the Islamic State lost most of its Syrian territory, while Nusra's successor group, Hay'at Tahrir, continued the struggle against the Syrian government. In Syria, the Nusra Front's successor group, Hay'at Tahrir al Sham, remains active in opposition-held areas, facing challenges in managing differences with AQ leadership. AQ-IS competition is seen across the Middle East and Africa, with affiliates competing for resources and sometimes clashing with Islamic State rivals. U.S. officials emphasize the ongoing threat posed by Al Qaeda and its affiliates, even with the decline of IS territorial control in Syria and Iraq. In September 2016, NCTC Director Nicholas Rasmussen emphasized that despite efforts against ISIL, al-Qa'ida remains a top counterterrorism priority. One year later, he reiterated that Al Qaida continues to be a primary focus due to its resilience in recruitment and operations. Since 2016, there has been a resurgence of aviation threats, with both ISIS and Al Qaeda-aligned groups showing continued capability for aviation attacks. Despite reduced ability for large-scale attacks in the US, Al Qaeda remains a significant counterterrorism threat overseas, focusing on exploiting local conflicts. This evolution in Al Qaeda's methods and organization demonstrates its resiliency. Some observers challenge assessments of Al Qaeda's intent to carry out attacks, criticizing U.S. counterterrorism strategy for focusing too much on military action and not enough on deradicalization efforts. Former CIA deputy director Michael Morell highlights the need for a shift in approach. The Situation Room discusses counterterrorism strategies, including deradicalization efforts. U.S. counterterrorism efforts in 2017 have weakened Al Qaeda, questioning its relevance under Ayman al-Zawahiri's leadership. The 2018 National Defense Strategy prioritizes inter-state competition over terrorism. Uncertainty remains regarding resource allocation for counterterrorism versus inter-state threats. Al Qaeda had minimal presence post-2001 until 2015. In late 2015, U.S. officials discovered and destroyed a large Al Qaeda training camp in Qandahar Province, indicating an expansion of the group's presence in Afghanistan. By April 2016, U.S. commanders estimated between 100 to 300 AQ fighters in Afghanistan with a growing relationship between Al Qaeda and insurgent groups. General John Campbell warned of Al Qaeda rebuilding its capabilities to strike the U.S. homeland and Western interests. In December 2016, U.S. officials announced the killing or capture of 250 AQ operatives in 2016, including the AQ commander for northeast Afghanistan. Zawahiri formed Al Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent in 2014 in response to the rise of the Islamic State. Over 80 Al Qaeda members were killed in December 2017, including the deputy leader of AQIS. AQAP was described as the only known al-Qa'ida affiliate to have attempted a direct attack against the U.S. AQAP, the only known al-Qa'ida affiliate to have attempted a direct attack against the U.S., continues to threaten and call for attacks. Operating in Yemen since 2009, the group benefits from southern resentment towards the government. The ongoing conflict in Yemen has allowed AQAP to take and hold territory along the southern coast. AQAP has attempted attacks in the United States and Europe, including funding the Charlie Hebdo attack in Paris. They have also tried to down U.S.-bound airliners. AQIM, an Algerian-led network, has provided support to extremist groups in North and West Africa. They took advantage of uprisings in Tunisia and Libya in 2011. AQIM and local allies expanded safe-havens and influence after exploiting uprisings in Tunisia and Libya in 2011. They gained arms and recruits from the collapse of the Qadhafi regime in Libya and asserted control in Mali amid a separatist rebellion. AQIM conducted bombings, kidnappings for ransom, and mass-casualty attacks targeting foreigners in Algeria, Mali, Burkina Faso, and C\u00f4te d'Ivoire. They have pledged greater unity since 2015, possibly to outpace French counterterrorism operations and respond to competition from local groups aligned with the Islamic State. AQIM, a regionally-focused terrorist group, targets local and Western interests in North and West Africa, including U.S. interests. Despite French military operations in the Sahel, AQIM continues to pose a significant threat, expanding their operations into previously stable areas and carrying out attacks in Mali and neighboring countries. The Nusra Front, a prominent armed opposition group in Syria, has ties to Al Qaeda and is estimated to have 6,000 to 9,000 fighters. They have a stronghold in Idlib province, conduct military operations, and provide safe haven for experienced terrorists. Nusra is Al Qaeda's largest formal affiliate with direct ties to Ayman al Zawahiri. Nusra, Al Qaeda's largest formal affiliate, targeted U.S.-backed fighters in July 2015. This led to a reconfiguration of the Syria train-and-equip program. In July 2016, Nusra rebranded itself as Jabhat Fatah al Sham (JFS), claiming no affiliation with external entities, though Al Qaeda operatives still had a presence within JFS. The Nusra Front's rebranding as Jabhat Fatah al Sham (JFS) in 2016, severing ties with Al Qaeda, aimed to gain support from Syrian opposition groups by focusing attacks on the Syrian government. This move led to the formation of Hay'at Tahrir al Sham (HTS) in 2017, a coalition including JFS and other militant groups, indicating potential integration with the broader Syrian opposition. Nusra Front rebranded as JFS in 2016, leading to the formation of HTS in 2017. There are debates on whether HTS is truly independent or just a cover for Al Qaeda-linked militants. Mattis acknowledged the issue of groups changing names frequently. Presence of Al Qaeda operatives in Syria suggests ongoing links. In late 2017, assassinations and arrests targeting non-Syrian HTS members aligned with AQ may indicate growing differences between AQ and HTS. Some in HTS aim to position the coalition as a Syrian movement. AQ leader Zawahiri condemned Nusra's rebranding in November 2017, questioning the idea of cutting foreign links. The Nusra Front poses a challenge to the US as it threatens and coordinates with other Syrian opposition groups, some of which receive US support. The Nusra Front is closely linked with civilian and opposition groups, with troubling cooperation noted by Obama Administration officials. Al Shabaab remains a key terrorist threat in East Africa, conducting attacks in Somalia and neighboring countries, including Kenya and Djibouti. Al Shabaab, a terrorist group in East Africa, has conducted attacks in Somalia and neighboring countries. Despite being pushed out of major cities, they remain resilient. There are concerns that if AMISOM withdraws in 2018, Somalia could fall back under Al Shabaab control or ISIS influence. Al Shabaab has resisted Islamic State's attempts to gain a foothold in Somalia and has threatened attacks against the U.S. Several U.S. citizens have been killed in Al Shabaab attacks in East Africa since 2010. Al Shabaab has demonstrated its ability to conceal a bomb in a laptop computer and recruit foreign fighters, including U.S. citizens, in Somalia. Al Qaeda's focus shifted to clarifying jihad rules and discrediting the Islamic State's leadership. Zawahiri issued General Guidelines for Jihad in 2013, targeting America to exhaust and weaken it. Al Qaeda's focus shifted to clarifying jihad rules and discrediting the Islamic State's leadership. Zawahiri outlined a code of conduct for jihadist fighters, emphasizing avoiding clashes with local governments and not fighting certain sects unless attacked. He also instructed followers to create \"safe bases\" and to \"avoid meddling.\" Zawahiri instructed Al Qaeda followers to avoid targeting certain religious communities and to refrain from harming other Muslims or noncombatants. He emphasized the importance of living peacefully with these communities after establishing an Islamic state. Additionally, fighters were told to avoid attacking enemies in public spaces to prevent harm to innocent bystanders. Zawahiri criticized the Islamic State for declaring a caliphate by force without consultation with other jihadist authorities. He argued that a true caliphate should be established through consultation and consensus, not unilaterally. Zawahiri also stated that conditions are not yet right for the declaration of a caliphate and emphasized the importance of following the prophet's path, not resorting to violence. Zawahiri condemns infighting among jihadist factions, stating that killing Muslims and seizing resources from rival groups is not permissible. He warns that discord within jihadist ranks benefits the enemy, particularly the United States. With the decline of the Islamic State's caliphate, Al Qaeda may seize the opportunity to recruit new members. The decline of the Islamic State's caliphate may lead to Al Qaeda recruiting fighters and becoming a focus of U.S. counterterrorism efforts. Zawahiri criticizes the Islamic State's focus on territorial control and urges a guerrilla war approach instead. Al Qaeda supporters may directly combat the Islamic State, as differences between the two groups become more strategic. The differences between Al Qaeda and the Islamic State are more tactical than strategic. It is uncertain if a fundamental break will occur between the two groups or if Al Qaeda will revert to cooperation with IS. Al Qaeda's willingness to work with IS fighters could allow them to absorb some fighters if IS leadership is defeated. The U.S. strategy against Al Qaeda involves military deployments, training local forces, financial sanctions, and countering violent extremism programs. The U.S. strategy against Al Qaeda involves military deployments, training local forces, financial sanctions, and countering violent extremism programs. In Afghanistan, U.S. troops are conducting counterterrorism missions against Al Qaeda and Taliban targets. In Yemen, there were 114 U.S. strikes against AQAP in 2017, with a U.S. commando killed in a counterterrorism raid on AQAP militants in January 2017. In January 2017, a U.S. military casualty was killed in a counterterrorism raid on AQAP militants in Yemen. In Libya, a U.S. strike in June 2015 targeted Al Murabitoun leader Mokhtar Bel Mokhtar. In Somalia, U.S. military action has increased since 2015, with the Trump Administration authorizing lethal action against Al Shabaab. The tempo of U.S. air strikes in Somalia has been increasing since 2015, with a spike in 2017. In May 2017, the first U.S. combat death in Somalia since the early 1990s was announced during a joint operation with Somali forces against Al Shabaab. Additionally, U.S. military strikes targeted members of the Khorasan Group in Syria in 2015 and 2017. In North Africa and the Sahel, the U.S. military has been conducting intelligence activities out of Niger since 2013. The U.S. military has been conducting intelligence activities in Niger since 2013 and received approval to arm drones stationed there in 2017. Building partner capacity is a core component of U.S.-led counterterrorism strategy, aiming to enhance regional stability and security. The U.S. aims to enhance regional stability in the Middle East and North Africa by building capabilities to counter violent extremism and support partner forces in countries like Afghanistan, Yemen, and Somalia. This strategy aligns with the National Defense Strategy's priority of countering threats in Africa and the National Security Strategy's focus on assisting regional partners in strengthening their institutions for counterterrorism efforts. Capacity-building efforts in the Middle East and North Africa aim to help partners manage regional security challenges, sustain gains made by U.S. forces, and prevent the establishment of AQ safe havens. Some criticize the focus on military efforts over internal security services and protecting vulnerable populations. The executive branch has expanded the threshold for direct military action beyond targeting Al Qaeda, as seen in Somalia under the Obama Administration. The Obama Administration expanded U.S. military action in Somalia in 2015 to support Somali and AMISOM forces, increasing the number of U.S. military personnel on the ground. In Afghanistan, domestic security responsibilities were transferred to the ANDSF in 2014. President Trump announced further developments in August 2017. In August 2017, President Trump announced a new strategy for Afghanistan involving sending additional U.S. troops to assist in NATO's mission to train, advise, and assist the ANDSF. In Yemen, U.S. military personnel were authorized to support operations against AQAP. In North Africa and the Sahel, the U.S. focuses on bolstering domestic counterterrorism capabilities of countries where AQIM and affiliated groups operate. The U.S. partnership in North-West Africa includes military and police training programs, counter-radicalization efforts, and public diplomacy. The DOD provides additional assistance bilaterally and through regional programs. The growing scope of DOD \"advise and assist\" operations was highlighted in 2017 when four U.S. servicemembers were killed in Niger by an Islamic State-affiliated group. Conflict in Libya hinders partnership capacity building. U.S. efforts against Al Shabaab in Somalia involve limited military support. U.S. efforts against Al Shabaab in Somalia include a limited military mission involving training, advising, and accompanying Somali and AMISOM forces. A small number of U.S. forces were involved in ground raids against Al Shabaab militants. In 2017, a U.S. servicemember was killed while accompanying Somali forces in an operation against Al Shabaab. Additionally, the U.S. counterterrorism strategy against Al Qaeda focuses on limiting the group's ability to finance its operations. The House of Representatives Task Force report in 2016 identified common sources of terrorism financing, including state sponsors, private donors, and criminal activities. The Islamic State's unique fundraising methods set it apart from Al-Qaeda, with some AQ groups adopting similar tactics. Al Shabaab is noted as a financially capable terrorist group. Efforts to prevent Al Qaeda from accessing the U.S. financial system are crucial, as seen in the 9/11 attacks where funds passed through U.S. bank accounts. The 2015 assessment by the Department of the Treasury highlighted the U.S. financial system's vulnerability to terrorist financing due to the volume of international transactions passing through U.S. institutions. The Treasury uses targeted financial sanctions to prevent terrorists, including Al Qaeda affiliates, from accessing the U.S. financial system. Al Qaeda was designated as a Foreign Terrorist Organization in 1998, allowing for the freezing of U.S.-held assets. After the 9/11 attacks, Al Qaeda was designated as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist entity, allowing U.S. law enforcement to freeze any U.S.-held assets. Osama bin Laden was added to the Department of the Treasury's list of Specially Designated Nationals. In 2016, $6 million in Al Qaeda-linked funds in the United States were blocked under various programs. U.S. agencies have also worked with partner countries to target Al Qaeda financiers based outside the U.S. Outside of the United States, U.S. agencies have sought to build ties with partner countries to broaden the reach of financial sanctions. The United Nations Security Council established the Al Qaeda Sanctions Committee in 1999, requiring member states to freeze assets and prevent support for individuals associated with Al Qaeda or Osama bin Laden. The list was expanded in 2015 to include the Islamic State, now known as the ISIL & Al Qaeda Sanctions List, with 255 individuals and 80 entities sanctioned as of December 2017. The Al Qaeda Sanctions List, established by the United Nations Security Council in 1999, includes 255 individuals and 80 entities as of December 2017. The list imposes financial sanctions and travel restrictions to limit terrorist mobility. The State Department's Terrorist Interdiction Program provides funding and training for countries to screen passengers at ports of entry, including the PISCES screening system. The Obama Administration focused on countering violent extremism programs, while the Trump Administration planned to shift the focus of these programs. The Trump Administration planned to shift focus of counterterrorism programs to target \"radical Islamic terror\" or \"terrorism prevention,\" with a reduced budget request for FY2018. Efforts may be reprioritized under President Trump, while CVE-related material on the State Department website dates back to the Obama Administration. President Obama emphasized discrediting terrorist ideologies through better ideas, not guns, in a July 2015 speech. Ideologies are defeated by better ideas, not guns, according to Obama. The United States will collaborate with international partners and Muslim communities to counter terrorist propaganda. The State Department emphasizes building resistance to extremist propaganda and countering terrorist use of the internet. A joint strategy by the State Department and USAID defines CVE as proactive actions to counter violent extremism. This includes disrupting tactics used by violent extremists and addressing factors that facilitate recruitment and radicalization to violence. USAID oversees CVE programs in the Middle East and Africa to disrupt tactics used by violent extremists and build alternatives in targeted communities. The Department of Homeland Security focuses on outreach to domestic, particularly Muslim, communities. Some programs are designed to counter a range of violent extremists, including Al Qaeda. Funding in 2017 supported the expansion of the International Counterterrorism and Countering Violent Extremism Capacity Building Clearinghouse Mechanism. The USAID oversees CVE programs in the Middle East and Africa to disrupt tactics used by violent extremists and build alternatives in targeted communities. Funding in 2017 supported the expansion of the International Counterterrorism and Countering Violent Extremism Capacity Building Clearinghouse Mechanism for potential use in Lebanon, Mali, Somalia, and Jordan, among others. U.S. military action against Al Qaeda and its affiliates has continued for years in multiple countries located in several regions of the world, with ongoing debates over the authority and oversight of such actions. The role of Congress in overseeing and updating presidential authority to use military force has been a point of contention. Debate continues on the use of force against Al Qaeda and its affiliates, with concerns about the expansive concepts of presidential authority. The existing authorizations, such as the 2001 AUMF and the 2002 AUMF, have no termination date and have been relied upon for combatting terrorist groups. The geographic scope of military action against Al Qaeda and its affiliates has expanded significantly, with operations now spanning multiple countries in various regions. Concerns have been raised about the potential for these authorities to be used indefinitely by future administrations. The 2001 and 2002 AUMFs have been stretched to authorize military operations beyond their original intent, raising concerns about the need for updated authorizations to reflect current realities. Some argue that presidential authority under Article II of the Constitution has been used to justify military actions not initially contemplated. The 2001 AUMF has been expanded to justify military actions not originally intended by Congress. The President argues that his constitutional authority as Commander-in-Chief allows for military action against Al Qaeda and related groups, even without specific legislative authorization. This includes using military force in response to imminent threats to the US or its interests. The legal justifications for US strikes against Al Qaeda-linked groups are sometimes unclear. Some in Congress disagree with the Administration's interpretation of presidential power to conduct military strikes without clear legal justification. Members of Congress are calling for limits on the President's authority and proposing legislation to amend or repeal the 2001 and 2002 AUMFs. They argue that Congress needs to fulfill its constitutional role in declaring war and overseeing the President's use of military force. The Trump Administration officials support the use of the 2001 AUMF for military force against Al Qaeda and the Islamic State. Some Members of Congress are calling for a new AUMF without time constraints or geographical restrictions. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017 (P.L. 115-31, HR 244) allocated funds for foreign operations and defense in FY2017, with provisions carried over into FY2018. Specific requests related to Al Qaeda in the FY2018 budget include $3.5 million for Yemen counterterrorism efforts and $34.1 million for TSCTP activities in North-West Africa to counter terrorist threats. The FY2018 budget allocated funds for various counterterrorism efforts, including $10 million for the Partnership for East Africa Counter-Terrorism, $110 million for AMISOM and Somali security forces, $150 million for stabilizing parts of Syria, and $45.9 billion for Operation Freedom's Sentinel in Afghanistan. Al Qaeda and its affiliates are evolving, with possible future trends including an increase in small-scale attacks. Al Qaeda and its affiliates are shifting towards small-scale attacks to keep members engaged and compete with the Islamic State. AQIM claimed attacks on hotels in Ivory Coast, Burkina Faso, and Mali, as well as targeting UN peacekeeping missions in Mali. Concerns arise about AQ leadership finding sanctuary with the Taliban in Afghanistan. Al Qaeda has expanded its presence in Afghanistan since 2001, with AQ leadership pledging allegiance to Afghan Taliban leaders. The Arab Spring has provided opportunities for Al Qaeda to operate in safe havens, stretching U.S. resources. Former CIA Deputy Director Michael Morell argues that the Arab Spring has strengthened Al Qaeda by creating safe havens for the group to recruit, obtain money, and weapons. Al Qaeda's geographic dispersal has stretched U.S. resources, with some groups moving fluidly across terrain. Developing relationships with regional partners may be necessary to counter them effectively. The group's attempt to reassert leadership could accelerate the implementation of long-term goals. Despite competition with the Islamic State, shared objectives suggest potential collaboration. In the next five years, the Islamic State and Al Qaeda could establish tactical cooperation despite their differences. U.S. officials remain concerned about Al Qaeda's threat, especially after the Islamic State's collapse in Iraq and Syria. Policymakers need to assess the risks posed by both groups and adjust counterterrorism policies accordingly.
