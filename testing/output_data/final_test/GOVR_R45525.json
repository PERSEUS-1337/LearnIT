    "content": "Congress has been actively shaping federal agricultural policy since the 1930s through periodic farm legislation. The scope of policy areas covered in farm bills has expanded to include conservation, credit, rural development, nutrition assistance, trade, organic agriculture, forestry, and support for farmers and ranchers. The Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018, known as the \"2018 farm bill,\" was enacted on December 20, 2018. The Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018, known as the \"2018 farm bill,\" was enacted on December 20, 2018, after passing through various stages in the House and Senate. The 2018 farm bill, known as the Agriculture Improvement Act, establishes policy for agriculture and nutrition programs across 12 titles. The bill projects $428 billion in spending over five years, with 76% allocated to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and the remaining 24% for agricultural programs like crop insurance and conservation. The 2018 farm bill, also known as the Agriculture Improvement Act, covers agricultural programs such as crop insurance, farm commodity programs, and conservation. The bill is estimated to be budget neutral over a 10-year period, with an initial increase in spending of $1.8 billion in the first five years offset by savings in the following five years. The policymaking environment for this bill differed from the 2014 farm bill due to lower farm income levels and disruptions in agricultural exports. The decline in net cash farm income is attributed to lower farm prices for commodities and disruptions in farm exports due to trade disputes. This has led to tariffs being imposed on U.S. farm product exports by major trading partners. The enacted farm bill provides farmers and ranchers with continuity for the next five years amidst uncertainty about agricultural exports. The report analyzes the budget implications of the enacted 2018 farm bill compared to prior laws. It includes summaries of changes in the bill and tables with a title-by-title analysis. CBO estimates are used to measure federal spending and the impact on policy. The farm bill authorizes funding for mandatory outlays and sets parameters for discretionary programs. The 2018 farm bill sets parameters for discretionary programs and authorizes future appropriations but does not provide funding. Mandatory programs dominate the farm bill policy and budget debate, with a total of $428 billion projected over five years. The nutrition title is the largest component of the budget, followed by crop insurance, farm commodity programs, and conservation. Mandatory spending proposals are measured against the CBO baseline, which projects future federal spending on mandatory programs under current law. The CBO baseline used to develop the 2018 farm bill projected that farm bill programs would cost $867 billion over the next 10 years, with 77% allocated to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and 23% for agricultural programs. The 2018 farm bill primarily focused on agricultural programs such as crop insurance, farm commodity programs, and conservation. Changes in spending relative to the baseline were scored, with positive scores indicating an increase in spending and negative scores indicating a decrease. The enacted 2018 farm bill's impact on spending is detailed in Table 3 and Figure 3. The 2018 farm bill, including the House and Senate bills, was budget neutral over a 10-year period. The House bill would have decreased outlays by $1.8 billion, while the Senate bill was budget neutral. The enacted farm bill closely followed the Senate bill's score, with reductions mainly in the Rural Development title. Six titles saw increased spending over 10 years, including farm Commodities, Trade, Research, Energy, Horticulture, and Miscellaneous. The Conservation and Nutrition titles in the 2018 farm bill had increases over the first five years but were budget neutral over the 10-year period. The Conservation title reallocated spending across programs more than other titles. Some programs without baseline from the 2014 farm bill received continuing funding in the 2018 farm bill, with some even receiving permanent baseline. The 2018 farm bill included new programs and provisions, with the majority of the total amount allocated to the Nutrition title for SNAP. The projected outlays for agricultural programs totaled $102 billion over five years. The 2018 farm bill allocated $102 billion for agricultural programs, including crop insurance, farm commodity programs, and conservation. Title I authorizes support programs for dairy, sugar, and covered commodities, as well as disaster assistance. Major field-crop programs include PLC, ARC, and MAL. The dairy program protects the margin between milk and feed prices, while the sugar program provides price support and limits on imports. Disaster assistance programs focus on livestock and tree crops. The 2018 farm bill extends federal disaster assistance programs for farmers recovering from natural disasters, with modifications to commodity programs like ARC, PLC, and MAL. Producers were allowed to choose between ARC and PLC under the 2014 farm bill. The 2018 farm bill allows producers to switch between ARC and PLC coverage on a commodity-by-commodity basis, with the option to sign multi-year contracts. Base acres not planted to eligible commodities from 2009-2017 are not eligible for ARC and PLC payments. The 2018 farm bill allows producers to switch between ARC and PLC coverage on a commodity-by-commodity basis, with the option to sign multi-year contracts. Base acres not planted to eligible commodities from 2009-2017 are not eligible for ARC and PLC payments. However, these base acres may be enrolled in the Conservation Stewardship Program for five years at an annual program payment rate of $18 per acre. Changes to the PLC program include updating program yields based on 90% of the average yield for 2013-2017 and an escalator provision that could potentially raise a covered commodity's effective reference price by as much as 115% of the statutory PLC reference price. The 2018 farm bill also specifies changes to the ARC program. The 2018 farm bill brings changes to the ARC program, prioritizing data from USDA's Risk Management Agency for county average yields. This aims to enhance program integrity and prevent payment disparities between neighboring counties. Additionally, up to 25 counties meeting specific criteria may subdivide for ARC calculations. The 2018 farm bill brings changes to the ARC program, allowing for subdivision of acres for ARC benchmark calculations based on county average yields. ARC will now use trend-adjusted yields and increase the yield floor to 80% of transitional county yield. Marketing assistance loan rates are increased for various program crops, excluding some commodities like upland cotton and peanuts. The 2018 farm bill brings changes to the ARC program, allowing for subdivision of acres for ARC benchmark calculations based on county average yields. Marketing assistance loan rates are increased for various program crops, excluding upland cotton, peanuts, minor oilseeds, nongraded wool, mohair, and honey. Payment limits and AGI limits remain unchanged, but eligibility criteria for commodity program payment eligibility are modified. Family farm definition is expanded to include first cousins, nieces, and nephews. The enacted bill expands the family farm definition to include first cousins, nieces, and nephews, increasing the pool of individuals eligible for payment limits. It also amends agricultural disaster assistance programs, providing payments for livestock losses and expanding eligibility to include Indian tribes. Payment limits under disaster assistance programs are adjusted, with the Livestock Forage Program exempt from the $125,000/person limit. The Noninsured Crop Disaster Assistance Program is also amended to adjust crop eligibility. The enacted bill expands the family farm definition to include more relatives and amends agricultural disaster assistance programs. It adjusts crop eligibility for the Crop Disaster Assistance Program and revises the Margin Protection Program for milk producers to create the Dairy Margin Coverage program. The Dairy Margin Coverage (DMC) program allows dairy producers to purchase margin coverage from $4.00/cwt to $9.50/cwt on the first 5 million pounds of production. Producers can now cover from 5% to 95% of their production history, compared to 25% to 90% under the previous program. Premiums for Tier I coverage above $4.00/cwt are reduced to incentivize higher levels of margin coverage. Under the Dairy Margin Coverage (DMC) program, dairy producers can purchase margin coverage from $4.00/cwt to $9.50/cwt on the first 5 million pounds of production. Premiums for higher margin levels are reduced to encourage increased coverage. Producers can receive a 25% discount on premiums by locking in coverage levels for five years. Repayment of premiums paid under the previous program (MPP) is also available. The Dairy Margin Coverage (DMC) program allows dairy producers to purchase margin coverage from $4.00/cwt to $9.50/cwt on the first 5 million pounds of production. Producers can receive discounts on premiums by locking in coverage levels for five years and may opt for a direct cash payment of 50% of eligible repayments. The program also allows participation in both margin coverage and the Livestock Gross Margin-Dairy (LGM-D) insurance program. Additionally, the 2018 farm bill reauthorizes various dairy programs through FY2023 and establishes a milk donation program.

USDA administers agricultural conservation programs for private landowners. The 2018 farm bill focuses on working lands, land retirement, and easement programs, reallocating funding among conservation programs. It increases short-term funding by $555 million but reduces long-term funding by $6 million. The 2018 farm bill reallocates funding among conservation programs, reducing funding by $6 million in the long term (FY2019-FY2028). The two largest working lands programs, EQIP and CSP, see reductions in total funding compared to prior law. The enacted bill combines elements from both the House and Senate proposals regarding CSP and EQIP. The enacted 2018 farm bill reauthorizes the Conservation Stewardship Program (CSP) with amendments, shifting enrollment limits from acreage to funding levels. Savings from CSP limits are redirected to other conservation programs like EQIP. Changes include new ranking criteria, contract renewal requirements, and payments for various conservation practices. A grassland conservation initiative is added to CSP, while EQIP is reauthorized and expanded to provide financial and technical assistance to producers and landowners. The enacted bill increases EQIP funding from $1.75 billion in FY2019 to $2.025 billion in FY2023, with amendments focusing on water quality, soil health, and wildlife habitat. Allocation for livestock practices decreases to 50% while wildlife practices increase to 10%. Water conservation payments now include irrigation and drainage entities. Conservation Innovation Grants expand to include community colleges and soil health trials. Land retirement programs offer federal payments for land-use restrictions.
