Federal laws regulate online firearm sales similarly to other transactions, but enforcing these regulations may be challenging due to the unique nature of Internet transactions. The sale of ammunition online has come under scrutiny following a mass shooting in a Colorado movie theater in 2012. Legislation has been introduced to regulate online ammunition sales more strictly. The Gun Control Act (GCA) aims to prevent certain individuals from possessing firearms to combat crime in the United States. It prohibits nine classes of individuals from shipping, transporting, possessing, or receiving firearms in interstate commerce, including those convicted of a crime, fugitives, unlawful drug users, mentally defective individuals, and illegal aliens. The Gun Control Act prohibits nine categories of individuals from possessing firearms, including those convicted of a crime, fugitives, unlawful drug users, mentally defective individuals, illegal aliens, dishonorably discharged from the Armed Forces, renounced US citizenship, subject to a court order, and convicted of a misdemeanor domestic violence offense. The regulation of ammunition transfer and sale was initially similar to firearms but was relaxed with the Firearm Owners' Protection Act in 1986. The Gun Control Act prohibits certain individuals from possessing firearms. To enforce this, the Act imposes requirements on firearm transfers, including the need for Federal Firearms Licensees (FFLs) to conduct background checks, verify identities, maintain records, and report multiple handgun sales to the Attorney General. The Gun Control Act imposes requirements on firearm transfers, including background checks by FFLs and reporting multiple handgun sales to the Attorney General. Private sellers are exempt but prohibited from transferring firearms to disqualified persons. The GCA originally regulated ammunition sales similarly to firearms. In 1986, Congress repealed regulations for ammunition sales and transfer under the Firearm Owners' Protection Act. Sellers no longer need to be licensed or keep records of ammunition sales. While background checks for ammunition purchasers are not required by federal law, sellers are prohibited from transferring ammunition to prohibited possessors. Federal law imposes restrictions on the interstate transfer of firearms, particularly in the context of Internet-based sales. While licensed dealers can sell long guns to qualified individuals regardless of their state of residence, handguns can only be sold to residents of the dealer's state. Dealers are also prohibited from directly shipping firearms to consumers in other states. FFLs cannot ship firearms directly to consumers in other states. Instead, they must transfer the weapon to an FFL in the buyer's state for the transfer to take place after a background check. Non-FFL sellers are prohibited from selling firearms to non-residents directly, requiring the transfer to go through an FFL in the buyer's state. Ammunition sales are currently less regulated than firearm sales. Prior to 1986, ammunition sales were regulated similarly to firearm sales, with FFLs required to be licensed to deal in ammunition and prohibited from shipping to private individuals. However, after the repeal of these provisions in 1986, sellers no longer need a license to sell ammunition and can ship directly to private individuals regardless of their state of residence. While federal regulation of ammunition is minimal, some states have implemented laws requiring sellers and buyers to be licensed. The federal laws regulate firearm sales, including online transactions, requiring sellers and purchasers to be licensed. While not specifically addressing online sales, these laws cover all firearm transfers in interstate commerce. Even if negotiated online, transactions must adhere to the same requirements as traditional in-person sales. FFLs advertising firearms online are still prohibited from directly shipping to non-FFLs. Firearms sold online cannot be directly shipped to non-FFL purchasers. Out-of-state non-FFL buyers must have the firearm transferred to an FFL in their state for a background check. Private sellers can only transfer firearms to in-state purchasers. Ammunition sales online can be conducted freely by both FFL and non-FFL sellers to buyers in or out of state. The Gun Control Act (GCA) does not restrict online ammunition sales, allowing both FFL and non-FFL sellers to freely conduct transactions with in- or out-of-state purchasers. Concerns have been raised about potential abuse and violations of federal law in online firearm sales, with the Department of Justice highlighting issues such as prohibited individuals acquiring firearms and non-licensed sellers advertising and selling firearms without background checks or record-keeping requirements. The Department of Justice (DOJ) has raised concerns about potential abuse and violations of federal law in online firearm sales. Non-licensed individuals may illegally engage in selling firearms without background checks or record-keeping requirements, leading to an increase in violations of federal law. The Working Group on Unlawful Conduct on the Internet has stated that the sale of firearms over the Internet poses unique problems for law enforcement. The Working Group highlighted challenges for law enforcement in monitoring online firearm sales, such as the ability to advertise guns in hard-to-find locations and the lack of a fixed physical location for transactions. This makes it difficult for authorities to conduct inspections and review records, leading to potential difficulties in detecting illegal firearm transactions over the Internet. Additionally, there is uncertainty about law enforcement's resources and capabilities to enforce firearm laws online. The General Accounting Office (GAO) investigation in 2001 found no illegal activity in Internet-based firearm sales by FFLs. However, a more recent undercover investigation by the city of New York in December 2011 revealed illegal activity in online gun sales from private sellers. The city of New York's investigation into online gun sales by private sellers found that 77 out of 125 sellers agreed to sell a gun to someone who couldn't pass a background check. This raises concerns about the potential for abuse by private sellers in making unlawful firearm sales over the Internet. Senator Frank Lautenberg and Representative Carolyn McCarthy introduced legislation to regulate online ammunition sales in response to concerns raised after the Colorado movie theater shootings. The bill would require individuals selling ammunition to be licensed dealers, potentially preventing secondary sales between non-FFLs. The bill introduced by Senator Frank Lautenberg and Representative Carolyn McCarthy aims to regulate ammunition sales by requiring sellers to be licensed dealers. This would prevent secondary sales between non-FFLs and mandate licensees to verify the transferee's identification before transferring ammunition. Additionally, licensees would need to keep records of ammunition transfers and report multiple sales exceeding 1,000 rounds to authorities. Proposed gun control measures focus on extending background check requirements to private sellers, such as the Fix Gun Checks Act of 2011. These measures aim to require in-person contact through an FFL or law enforcement agency for every firearm sale, as most transactions are transferred through FFLs. Most firearm transactions are transferred through FFLs, except for intrastate sales between two non-FFLs."
