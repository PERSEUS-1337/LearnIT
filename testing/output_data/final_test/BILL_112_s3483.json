Federal fish management agencies will have the opportunity to provide advice on the release schedule. The Commissioner of Reclamation will coordinate with the Confederated Tribes of the Warm Springs Reservation of Oregon and the State of Oregon for downstream fish and wildlife needs. This does not affect the Commissioner's authority to perform other activities.

The plan developed under paragraph (1) recommends voluntary strategies, measures, and actions agreed upon by all parties. It is not mandatory or self-implementing. If eligible contract holders do not initiate contracting for water by June 1, the Secretary may release the water with voluntary agreement. The Secretary may release water for downstream fish and wildlife as described in section 7 of the Act. SEC. 7. RELATION TO EXISTING LAWS AND STATUTORY OBLIGATIONS. The Act does not give the Secretary authority to store or release \"first fill\" amounts for purposes other than those specified in the Act of August 6, 1956. Exceptions include instream use from conserved water projects, voluntary actions under dry-year Management, and releases for downstream fish and wildlife.
