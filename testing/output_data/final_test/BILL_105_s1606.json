    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Torture Victims Relief Act\". Congress finds that torture is abhorred by the American people and creates fear and insecurity globally. It causes long-term physical and mental damage, used by repressive governments to suppress opposition and democracy. Survivors of torture face ongoing threats, especially in communities where perpetrators go unpunished. Many torture survivors and their caregivers face threats of reprisals, including torture, for providing care. Refugees and asylees in the United States, many of whom are torture victims, should receive prompt consideration for political asylum. It is crucial to provide rehabilitation services to torture survivors in the US to help them integrate into society. The development of a treatment movement for torture survivors has created new opportunities for action by the United States and other nations to oppose state-sponsored torture. A comprehensive strategy is needed to protect and support torture victims and their treatment providers, along with efforts to eliminate torture globally. The United States can help heal the effects of torture and prevent its use worldwide by acting to heal survivors and protect their families. The United States became a party to the Convention Against Torture on November 20, 1994, but has not implemented Article 3 of the Convention. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. This Act defines terms based on the Immigration and Nationality Act and includes the definition of \"torture\" as per section 2340(1) of title 18, U.S. Code. SEC. 4. PROHIBITION ON INVOLUNTARY RETURN OF PERSONS FEARING SUBJECTION TO TORTURE. The United States is prohibited from involuntarily returning individuals to a country if there is substantial evidence that they would fear torture. \"To return involuntarily\" means sending someone back without their consent, even if not physically present in the US. SEC. 5. IMMIGRATION PROCEDURES FOR TORTURE VICTIMS. Aliens who claim to have been tortured or are believed to have been tortured are considered for refugee status, asylum, or withholding of removal. Officials must consider how torture may affect the applicant's responses and the challenges torture victims face in recounting their suffering. Victims' fear of returning to their country is also taken into account. Refugees who have been subjected to torture are considered refugees of special concern for expedited processing of admissions to the United States. Special procedures are in place for aliens who are victims of torture under the Immigration and Nationality Act. Refugees subjected to torture are eligible for expedited asylum procedures under the Immigration and Nationality Act. Refugees subjected to torture may have their asylum proceedings delayed if their mental or physical symptoms from torture are aggravated by removal under section 241(b)(3) of the Immigration and Nationality Act. Refugees who have been tortured may experience delays in their asylum proceedings due to their inability to recall or relate the events of torture, requiring more time for recovery or treatment before testifying. This finding can serve as a strong basis for granting parole instead of detention. Additionally, aliens described in the Torture Victims Relief Act may be exempt from expedited removal. The Torture Victims Relief Act calls for resources to maintain information on torture in foreign countries. SEC. 6. SPECIALIZED TRAINING FOR CONSULAR, IMMIGRATION, AND ASYLUM PERSONNEL. The Attorney General and the Secretary of State provide specialized training for immigration and consular officers on identifying torture, its effects on victims, and how to conduct interviews with victims without retraumatizing them. Gender-specific training on interacting with male and female victims of torture by rape or sexual violence is required during specialized training for immigration and consular officers. SEC. 7. DOMESTIC TREATMENT CENTERS. Amendment of the Immigration and Nationality Act to provide grants for treatment of torture victims, including rehabilitation, social and legal services, and research/training for healthcare providers. Funding authorization for the Department of Health. Funding authorization for the Department of Health and Human Services for fiscal years 1999-2001, excluding funds for the Office of Refugee Resettlement. Amounts authorized for assistance for domestic centers and programs for victims of torture: $5,000,000 for 1999, $7,500,000 for 2000, and $9,000,000 for 2001. Funds remain available until expended. Amendment effective on October 1, 1998. SEC. 8. FOREIGN TREATMENT CENTERS. Amendments of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to provide assistance for victims of torture. The President is authorized to provide assistance for the rehabilitation of victims of torture through grants to treatment centers and programs in foreign countries. The assistance can be used for direct services to victims of torture and to provide research and training to health care providers. Authorized appropriations for fiscal years 1999-2001 under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 include $5,000,000 for 1999, $7,500,000 for 2000, and $9,000,000 for 2001 for section 129 activities. Funds remain available until expended. The effective date of the amendment is October 1, 1998. SEC. 9. MULTILATERAL ASSISTANCE. Funding authorized for the United Nations Voluntary Fund for Victims of Torture for fiscal years 1999, 2000, and 2001: $3,000,000 each year. Funds remain available until expended. Congress urges the President to seek new ways to support and protect the Fund. The text chunk calls for the Fund to support treatment centers for torture victims, encourage new programs, back the Special Rapporteur on Torture, and establish a country rapporteur to investigate human rights violations. The text chunk indicates systematic torture practices in the country."
