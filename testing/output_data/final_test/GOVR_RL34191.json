    "content": "Recent high oil and gas prices have increased interest in ethanol and other biofuels as alternatives to petroleum products. The Western Hemisphere, led by Brazil and the United States, produces over 80% of the world's biofuels. There are arguments for increased biofuels production in Latin America to enhance energy security, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and promote rural development. However, concerns exist regarding the significant investment and subsidies required, as well as potential negative impacts on the environment, labor conditions, and food prices. The United States and Brazil have agreed to collaborate on promoting ethanol and other biofuels globally. The United States and Brazil have signed an agreement to promote ethanol and other biofuels globally, aiming to advance research, develop domestic biofuels industries in third countries, and work multilaterally for global biofuels development. This partnership is seen as a way to improve the U.S. image in Latin America and reduce the influence of President Ch\u00e1vez in the region. The agreement has already had a significant political impact in Latin America, with Brazil asserting regional leadership over Venezuela in the biofuels sector. Increasing biofuels cooperation with Brazil and other Latin American countries may challenge existing U.S. trade, energy, and agriculture policies, particularly regarding tariffs on foreign ethanol imports. Legislation has been proposed to eliminate these tariffs, with some Members of Congress supporting this move while others advocate for extending the tariffs. The report examines opportunities and barriers in increasing U.S. cooperation with other countries in the hemisphere on biofuels development, focusing on the U.S.-Brazil agreement. The curr_chunk discusses biofuels development in the Western hemisphere, particularly the U.S.-Brazil agreement. It highlights the ethanol industries in Brazil and the United States, as well as the potential for biofuels in the region. The term biofuels refers to motor fuels produced from agricultural commodities or biological materials. Ethanol, the most widely used biofuel, is typically made from sugar- or starch-based crops like sugarcane or corn. Cellulosic ethanol, produced from cellulose-based materials, is still in its early stages of development. The technology for cellulosic ethanol production is in its early stages, with no commercial-scale plants yet. Biofuels, including biodiesel and butanol, offer benefits such as reduced emissions of pollutants and greenhouse gases compared to petroleum fuels. They can also be domestically produced to lessen reliance on imported petroleum and decrease overall fossil energy consumption. However, there are potential drawbacks to biofuels. Biofuels have drawbacks such as higher production costs and infrastructure limitations. They also have environmental drawbacks like increased emissions of pollutants and greenhouse gases. The focus is on ethanol due to its widespread production and use, especially as a blending component with gasoline in vehicles. Latin American and Caribbean nations heavily rely on oil as their primary energy source, making them vulnerable to global oil price increases. Many countries in the region experienced significant energy bill hikes after oil prices surged in 2005, putting strain on government budgets in Central America and the Caribbean. Oil accounts for over 90% of total energy consumed in some Caribbean islands, while oil dependency ranges from 51% to 85% in Central American countries. Venezuelan President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez launched the PetroCaribe program in 2005 to offer oil on preferential terms to Central America and the Caribbean, extending his influence in the region. Mexico initiated the Meso-American Energy Integration Program (PIEM) in December 2005 to counter Venezuela's influence, supplying crude oil for a new refinery in Guatemala or Panama to meet Central America's energy needs. Some analysts suggest that biofuels could be a solution to Latin America's petroleum dependency, especially in countries like Venezuela, Mexico, and Bolivia. The region produces over 80% of the world's biofuels, with Brazil and the United States leading the way. Proponents argue that the climate and abundant arable land in Latin America make it ideal for expanding the biofuels industry, particularly in tropical countries with high crop yields and low land and labor costs. The Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) study highlights the interest and potential for biofuels development in Latin American and Caribbean countries beyond Brazil. The study suggests ways the IDB could support biofuels production in the region, including a development fund, regulatory frameworks, and research. Central America mainly reprocesses hydrous ethanol from Brazil or the EU for export to the US. The IDB study highlights the potential for sugar-based ethanol production in Central America, particularly in Costa Rica and Guatemala. These countries have efficient sugar industries and well-developed biofuels policies. Under CAFTA-DR, Central American countries have duty-free access for ethanol exports to the US, with specific allocations for Costa Rica and El Salvador. Jamaica is the largest ethanol exporter in the Caribbean under CBI. Future prospects include indigenous ethanol production in Central America. Trinidad and Tobago, Jamaica, and the Dominican Republic are key players in ethanol production in the Caribbean. Grenada also shows potential for sugar-based ethanol production. The United Nations is collaborating with Brazil to explore biodiesel production in Haiti using jatropha plants. In South America, Colombia and Argentina have significant government support for biofuels development. Tariff barriers in the US and EU limit biofuels exports from non-CBI countries. Colombia, Peru, Argentina, and Chile have potential for biofuels development. Brazil and the United States are the largest ethanol producers globally. The U.S. and Brazil produced 69% of the world's ethanol in 2006. Ethanol production in the U.S. is concentrated in the Midwest near corn feedstock sources. Ethanol production is mainly concentrated in the Midwest in the U.S. and S\u00e3o Paulo state in Brazil. The process involves fermenting sugars from corn or sugar with yeast, distilling the alcohol into wet ethanol, dehydrating it into dry ethanol for use in gasoline. Cellulosic ethanol production requires more processing and is currently not cost-competitive. Cellulosic ethanol production in the United States is currently uncompetitive due to high processing costs. The country is the largest producer and consumer of fuel ethanol globally, with most of it coming from corn in the Midwest. Over 99% of U.S. ethanol is blended into gasoline, with E10 being the most common blend. Some vehicles can use E85, a blend of 85% ethanol and 15% gasoline. Federal and state incentives promote ethanol production and use. Since the 1970s, ethanol blended into gasoline has received tax incentives in the United States. Currently, each gallon of pure ethanol blended into gasoline earns a tax credit of 51 cents. The Renewable Fuel Standard mandates a certain amount of renewable fuel, mostly ethanol, to be blended into gasoline each year. Ethanol production capacity in the US has grown rapidly, leading to increased demand for corn. The rapid growth in ethanol production has led to increased demand for corn and lower wholesale ethanol prices. The United States has surpassed Brazil as the largest producer of ethanol. Brazilian ethanol is mainly produced from sugar cane, with plants integrated with sugar plantations. Government support for ethanol in Brazil began in 1975 with the establishment of the Brazilian National Alcohol Program. The Brazilian National Alcohol Program, established in 1975, set a production target of 3 billion liters in 1980. The program expanded in 1979 to a goal of 10.7 billion liters by 1985. In 2006, Brazil produced 16.5 billion liters. Various policies were implemented to promote ethanol production, including requiring Petrobras to purchase ethanol and tying ethanol prices to gasoline prices. The Brazilian ethanol industry is thriving, with many Proalcool policies eliminated except for one key policy. In Brazil, Proalcool policies have been mostly eliminated, except for the requirement that all gasoline must contain 20%-25% ethanol. Ethanol accounts for over 40% of Brazilian gasoline demand due to flexible fuel vehicles. In contrast, the U.S. consumed 5.4 billion gallons of ethanol in 2006, representing only 4% of gasoline demand. Brazil consumed roughly 4 billion gallons of ethanol in 2006, equivalent to half of their passenger vehicle fuel supply. Ethanol makes up about 40% of Brazil's passenger vehicle fuel supply, despite having a smaller transportation sector compared to the U.S. In Brazil, diesel fuel consumption is much higher than in the U.S., representing nearly two-thirds of all motor fuel. While ethanol displaces half of passenger vehicle fuel consumption, it only accounts for about 20% of total highway fuel consumption in Brazil. Most Brazilian ethanol is produced for domestic use, but U.S. imports have increased in recent years, especially during times of tight domestic supply. The phase-out of MTBE led to a surge in ethanol blending by U.S. gasoline suppliers, but the domestic ethanol production capacity may not meet the demand. Importing ethanol from Brazil directly could be profitable when U.S. prices are high compared to Brazilian production costs, despite import tariffs. U.S. ethanol imports have fluctuated over the past eight years. In 2006, U.S. ethanol imports have fluctuated over the past eight years. Import data for 2007 suggest a decrease from 2006 levels but still high at around 450 million gallons. A Memorandum of Understanding was signed between the United States and Brazil in March 2007 to promote cooperation on ethanol and biofuels in the Western hemisphere, including technology-sharing, feasibility studies, and assistance to build biofuels industries in third countries. The agreement targets countries like the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Haiti, and St. Kitts and Nevis. Actions have been taken to advance the global development of biofuels since the agreement. The United States and Brazil have been actively advancing their agreement on biofuels through bilateral visits, exchanges, and cooperation with third countries like Haiti, the Dominican Republic, and El Salvador. Global efforts are also underway with other members to promote the development of biofuels. The United States and Brazil, along with other members of the International Biofuels Forum (IBF), are working to standardize biofuels codes by the end of 2007. Some believe this agreement could boost the biofuels industry in Latin America, while others are concerned about the significant investments required for biofuels production. The Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) estimates that $200 billion in new investments would be needed for biofuels to account for 5% of the region's transport energy by 2020. Some analysts worry about challenges to existing U.S. trade, energy, and agriculture policies due to increasing biofuels cooperation with Brazil and other Latin American countries. Ethanol prices in Brazil are lower than in the United States, with imports subject to tariffs and duties that offset U.S. tax incentives. However, ethanol imports from Caribbean Basin Initiative (CBI) countries can be granted tariff/duty-free status under certain conditions. Ethanol from Caribbean Basin Initiative (CBI) countries can be imported duty-free to the United States, even if produced elsewhere. CBI countries only participate in the final dehydration step before shipping ethanol to the U.S. Most CBI ethanol is now produced in Brazil, with Costa Rica and El Salvador having specific allocations within the 7% quota. Some view this treatment as a loophole to avoid duties on ethanol. Some stakeholders see the duty-free import of ethanol from CBI countries as a loophole to avoid duties. Proponents argue that it promotes economic development, even if not using local feedstocks. Concerns also arise over duty-free imports through a manufacturing drawback, where manufacturers can get a refund of up to 99% of duties paid by exporting a finished product. Special provisions exist for petroleum derivatives, with imported ethanol used as a blending component in gasoline. Critics question the effectiveness of ethanol duties and the CBI exemption, with some estimating that up to 75% of duties were eligible for drawback in 2006. Proponents argue for strengthening U.S. duties on imported ethanol to support the domestic industry, citing national security and energy independence benefits. Opponents suggest eliminating duties to diversify energy supply and promote environmentally friendly transportation fuels, favoring importing ethanol from Brazil. President Bush signed the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006, extending the duty on imported ethanol. The U.S. Congress is considering new energy legislation and a new Farm Bill that could impact biofuels production. The Senate-passed energy bill would increase the Renewable Fuel Standard mandate for renewable fuel use in gasoline, including advanced biofuels, by 2022. The new Renewable Fuel Standard mandate could lead to a rise in demand for non-corn-based biofuels like Brazilian sugar-based ethanol. The proposed 2007 farm bill includes funding for research and development of new biofuels and loan programs to support technology commercialization. The USDA is proposing new funding for cellulosic ethanol production in the 2007 Farm Bill, with a focus on non-corn-based biofuels. The bill includes $3.2 billion in funding for energy provisions over five years, directing most of it towards cellulosic-based biofuels production. Concerns about higher food prices due to increased biofuels production, as most ethanol is currently produced from food crops like corn. The expansion of corn-based ethanol production in 2006 led to a sharp rise in corn prices, impacting prices for poultry, hogs, and cattle. Analysts predict that high oil prices may further increase corn prices in the future. However, commodity prices are influenced by various factors, and recent predictions suggest a slight decrease in corn prices due to expected record crop yields in 2007. Since growers predicted record crop yields for 2007, wheat prices have risen due to production issues in many countries. U.S. households may handle food price increases from biofuels production, but low-income households in the U.S. and Latin America, where food costs are a significant portion of income, may struggle. In Mexico, corn price hikes caused unrest as corn tortilla prices surged by 30%. Latin America has seen inflation due to higher food prices driven by ethanol and biofuel demand. Critics argue that increased biofuels production may lead to higher global food prices, causing hunger and malnutrition in developing countries. Ethanol proponents believe there is enough arable land, especially in Latin America, for biofuels production without impacting other crops. They suggest that the food-versus-fuel debate is more relevant for corn than sugar, as sugarcane ethanol production has not significantly affected global sugar prices. Biofuels offer benefits like reduced petroleum consumption and air pollution, but also pose environmental drawbacks such as increased greenhouse gas emissions, surface water contamination, and pressure on land and water resources. The production process of biofuels can either increase or decrease greenhouse gas emissions compared to petroleum fuels. Emissions of carbon dioxide occur during the combustion of ethanol, and greenhouse gases are also emitted during the production and use of nitrogen-based fertilizers and fuels for farm equipment and transportation. Recent studies have shown that corn-based ethanol can result in 13% to 22% lower greenhouse gas emissions compared to gasoline. Ethanol from other feedstocks, such as sugar and cellulosic materials, can lead to even lower emissions. For example, sugarcane-based ethanol could reduce emissions by as much as 56%, and cellulosic ethanol by 90% relative to gasoline. Ethanol production processes themselves can also contribute to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Ethanol production processes can lead to air quality concerns, such as emissions of volatile organic compounds and greenhouse gases. Mechanized harvesting of sugarcane can improve emissions but may reduce jobs for cane cutters. There is a growing interest in moving away from corn ethanol to sugarcane or cellulosic ethanol due to their favorable emissions profile. Water quality is also a key environmental concern surrounding ethanol production. The key environmental concern surrounding ethanol production is its impact on water quality. In the United States, corn production requires a significant amount of chemical inputs, leading to runoff of fertilizers and pesticides into water sources. In Brazil, the discharge of nutrient-rich waste from ethanol production directly into streams or indirectly through soil contamination is a major issue. Legislation has been introduced to address this problem, but lax enforcement of environmental standards in Brazil may continue to cause pollution from ethanol production. Water consumption may also become a concern, especially as feedstock production expands into drier areas. As feedstock production expands into drier areas, more water may be needed, putting pressure on water resources. Concerns arise about the effects of biofuel production on land resources, such as shifting away from soybean production for corn ethanol, leading to lower soil nutrients and increased chemical inputs. Sustainability concerns also exist for cellulosic biofuels, especially if environmentally sensitive areas are used for bioenergy production. In Brazil, protection of habitats in the cerrado is a focus of concern. Expansion of sugarcane planting in Brazil has led to rapid depletion of wooded areas in the cerrado and the Amazon. The demand for soybeans for food and biodiesel production has also increased pressure to expand soybean production into the Amazon. The biofuels industry in Latin America is seen as a way to create jobs and promote rural development. UNICA estimates that the biofuels industry in Brazil has created roughly 1 million direct jobs and 3 million indirect jobs. The biofuels industry in Latin America creates jobs, with estimates of 2,333 jobs in Brazil for every 1 million tons of sugarcane harvested. Ethanol proponents believe that 14,000 jobs could be generated in Central America through increased E10 fuel production. However, skeptics question the quality and number of jobs created, suggesting that displacement of existing agricultural activities may limit net job gains. They also highlight the dominance of large agribusinesses in the industry and the need for government support for small-scale producers. The biofuels industry in Latin America generates jobs, with concerns raised about the quality of jobs created, particularly in sugarcane-producing countries like Brazil where low-paying and hazardous work is common. Instances of forced labor have been reported in some sugarcane properties. The U.S.-Brazil MOU on biofuels aims to have a political impact in the region. The new biofuels partnership with Brazil is seen as a way to improve the U.S. image in Latin America and reduce the influence of President Ch\u00e1vez. The U.S. views Brazil as a significant power and a stabilizing force in the region. Brazil has been using \"biofuels diplomacy\" to raise its profile globally and counter Ch\u00e1vez's influence. In Latin America, biofuels production and usage could diminish Ch\u00e1vez's regional influence. Despite his criticisms, President Correa of Ecuador signed a biofuels production agreement with Brazil. Competition between Brazil and Venezuela for leadership in the region has accelerated, with President Lula promoting biofuels production agreements in Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean, while President Ch\u00e1vez visited Argentina, Bolivia, Ecuador, and Uruguay to sign oil and gas agreements. In the past two years, there has been significant congressional interest in issues related to energy security in Latin America. Members are focused on ensuring reliable energy sources for the United States from countries in the Western Hemisphere. Cooperation among Latin American nations is also being promoted to support regional growth and development, with Brazil cited as a successful example in reducing reliance on foreign oil through alternative energies like biofuels. Some Members emphasize the importance of U.S. engagement in regional biofuels development efforts, following Brazil's example. A hearing on \"U.S.-Brazil Relations\" highlighted biofuels cooperation as a key aspect of the strategic relationship between the two countries. The U.S.-Brazil MOU on biofuels could enhance collaboration, but unresolved agricultural disputes, like U.S. subsidies and tariffs, pose a challenge. In the 109th and 110th Congress, there were debates over tariffs and duties on foreign ethanol imports. Legislation was introduced to eliminate these duties, but Congress voted to extend them through 2008. In the 110th Congress, there were proposals to extend the tariffs through 2011 or make them permanent. Additionally, there were initiatives for hemispheric cooperation on biofuels development and distribution, such as the Energy Diplomacy and Security Act of 2007. The Energy Diplomacy and Security Act of 2007 establishes the Hemisphere Energy Cooperation Forum and Hemisphere Energy Industry Group to promote renewable fuels development and partnerships in the Western Hemisphere. The bill was favorably reported by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on April 12, 2007. Another initiative, the United States-Brazil Energy Cooperation Pact of 2007, aims to work with Brazil and other countries on energy partnerships. The Energy Diplomacy and Security Act of 2007 aims to accelerate biofuels production partnerships with Brazil and other Western Hemisphere countries. H.Res. 651 recognizes the strong relationship between the U.S. and Brazil, commending Brazil for reducing oil dependency with alternative energies. Cooperation on biofuels technology and market expansion is crucial between the two leading biofuels producers. In the U.S.-Brazil MOU on biofuels, progress on technology-sharing and working multilaterally to advance biofuels is expected to happen quickly. Collaborative research on cellulosic ethanol technology could benefit both countries in the short to medium term. Establishing consistent ethanol standards globally is crucial for ethanol to become a traded energy commodity. The agreement may also stimulate viable biofuels markets in third countries. While the U.S.-Brazil MOU aims to advance biofuels technology and establish global ethanol standards, challenges in third countries include lack of resources, arable land, struggling sugar industries, and labor and environmental concerns. Feasibility studies for Haiti, the Dominican Republic, and El Salvador are ongoing. The St. Kitts study found that bio-electricity production is feasible for domestic use. The selection of countries for U.S.-Brazil technical assistance will be influenced by feasibility study results and government willingness. Brazilian officials are hesitant to allow U.S. influence in their sphere. Some Members of Congress support energy cooperation efforts, while others are concerned about impacts on U.S. corn-based ethanol producers. The U.S.-Brazil MOU does not address key issues hindering bilateral and regional expansion. Key issues hindering U.S.-Brazil biofuels cooperation include subsidies and tariffs protecting U.S. corn-based ethanol producers. Some Members of Congress may oppose the MOU due to Brazil's past agricultural trade positions. However, energy cooperation presents an opportunity to overcome trade disputes."
