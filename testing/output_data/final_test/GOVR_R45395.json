    "content": "The Hobbs Act is a federal statute that prosecutes obstruction of interstate commerce through robbery or extortion. It originated in 1934 as the Anti-Racketeering Act and was revised in 1946 and 1948. The Act has been used to prosecute various crimes, including robbery and extortion. The Hobbs Act is a federal statute that prosecutes obstruction of interstate commerce through robbery or extortion. The Act condemns robbery by obstructing, delaying, or affecting commerce through unlawful taking of property by force or fear. The Hobbs Act prohibits robbery or extortion that obstructs interstate commerce by unlawfully taking property through force or fear. Violators can face fines or up to twenty years in prison. Legal entities can also be held liable for violations committed by their officers, employees, or members. Commerce is defined as trade within or between states. The Hobbs Act defines \"commerce\" as trade within or between states, including commerce into or out of a state, within the District of Columbia or any U.S. territory, or all other commerce under U.S. jurisdiction. The Act aims to punish interference with interstate commerce through extortion, robbery, or violence. Congress's authority to regulate commerce is limited to channels, instrumentalities, or activities that substantially affect commerce. Activities that substantially affect commerce can be regulated even if their individual impact is minimal. The Hobbs Act allows Congress to regulate commerce that substantially affects interstate commerce, even if the impact in individual cases is minimal. Examples include robbery of businesses selling products from other states, temporary closures due to robbery, depletion of business assets, robbery of drug dealers, and targeting individuals related to commerce. Section 1951(b)(1) defines \"robbery\" as the unlawful taking of personal property. The Hobbs Act defines robbery as the unlawful taking of personal property through force, violence, or fear. A conviction requires proof of the use, threat, or fear of violent physical force, and likely evidence that the defendant committed robbery knowingly. The Act allows Congress to regulate commerce affecting interstate commerce, including robbery of businesses selling products from other states. The Hobbs Act defines robbery as the unlawful taking of personal property through force or violence. It condemns not just robbery, but also attempts and conspiracies to rob, with the same penalties. Aiding and abetting a Hobbs Act robbery is also prohibited, requiring an affirmative act with the intent to facilitate the offense. The Act encompasses both robbery and attempted robbery, making liability possible even without the actual commission of a crime. The Hobbs Act covers robbery and attempted robbery, allowing for aiding and abetting even if the robbery doesn't occur. To be convicted of an attempt, specific intent and a substantial step towards the offense are required. Factual impossibility, mistake of fact, and abandonment are not defenses once a substantial step is taken. \"A Hobbs Act robbery conspiracy requires an agreement between individuals, knowledge of the goal, and voluntary participation. Withdrawal from the conspiracy must be proven with an affirmative act disavowing criminal activity.\" The Hobbs Act robbery offenses can lead to imprisonment for up to 20 years, with the possibility of additional charges under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) for using a firearm during the crime. Courts have generally considered Hobbs Act robbery as a crime of violence for section 924(c) purposes. Withdrawal from a conspiracy requires an affirmative act disavowing criminal activity. The Supreme Court's decision in Session s v. Dimaya raised questions about the definition of a \"crime of violence\" under section 924(c). Despite the ruling in Dimaya, lower court cases have continued to recognize Hobbs Act robbery as a crime of violence under section 924(c). Application of section 924(c) is subject to constitutional rights such as the Sixth Amendment right to jury consideration and Fifth Amendment rights. Hobbs Act robbery is considered a RICO predicate offense, making it also a money laundering predicate offense under federal law. RICO violations can result in up to 20 years of imprisonment. Money laundering involving the proceeds of a predicate offense is prohibited under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1956, 1957. Money laundering involving Hobbs Act robbery proceeds is prohibited under federal law. Violations of section 1956 carry a penalty of up to 20 years imprisonment, while violations of section 1957 carry a penalty of up to 10 years. Hobbs Act extortion can involve violence or be committed \"under color of official right.\" Hobbs Act extortion involves obstructing, delaying, or affecting commerce through extortion, obtaining property with consent induced by force, violence, or fear, or under color of official right. Violators can face fines or up to twenty years in prison. The term \"whoever\" includes individuals and legal entities like corporations. The Hobbs Act defines \"whoever\" as individuals and legal entities like corporations, liable for criminal conduct of their officers or agents benefiting the entity. Extortion under the Hobbs Act aims to punish interference with interstate commerce, requiring only a minimal impact on commerce for convictions. The Hobbs Act extortion requires a potential impact on commerce, with the defendant acquiring property from the victim. The property must be transferrable and of value, tangible or intangible. There is no express state-of-mind element required for the defendant. The Hobbs Act extortion involves two forms: robbery-like extortion using force or fear, and bribery-like extortion involving public officials. Robbery-like extortion requires force, violence, or fear to induce the victim to surrender property, while bribery-like extortion involves corrupt officials receiving something in exchange for official acts. Extortion by force, violence, or fear requires evidence of knowing and willful actions, with the force, violence, or fear being wrongful. The Supreme Court's 1973 labor violence case, United States v. Enmons, complicates the description of Hobbs Act robbery-like extortion by defining \"wrongful\" as using force, violence, or fear to obtain property unlawfully. The Court ruled that the Act applies to personal payoffs extorted by union officials but not to violence for legitimate union objectives like higher wages. The lower federal courts have determined that Hobbs Act extortion involves the use of force, violence, or fear to obtain property wrongfully. This includes the use of economic threats to procure property without a legitimate claim of right. Additionally, Hobbs Act extortion under color of official right occurs when a public official accepts a payment for official acts to which they are not entitled, akin to bribery. The Hobbs Act defines extortion as using force, violence, or fear to obtain property wrongfully, including economic threats. It also covers extortion under color of official right, where a public official accepts payments for acts they are not entitled to, similar to bribery. The offense is completed when a public official receives a payment in exchange for agreeing to perform specific official acts, without requiring fulfillment of the quid pro quo. The term \"official act\" is defined by the bribery statute, involving decisions or actions on a question, matter, cause, suit, proceeding, or controversy. The definition of an \"official act\" under the bribery statute involves a public official making a decision or taking action on a specific matter or controversy that is pending or may be brought before them. This includes exerting pressure on another official to perform an official act or advising another official with the intention that it will lead to an official act. Simply setting up a meeting or talking to another official does not qualify as an official act. The federal criminal code prohibits obstructing commerce by means of extortion, and attempting or conspiring to do so. The crime of attempt requires culpable intent and conduct constituting a substantial step towards the crime. Factual impossibility and abandonment after a substantial step are not defenses. Conspiring to commit Hobbs Act extortion is complex. The crime of conspiring to commit Hobbs Act extortion involves a common purpose among conspirators, even if the victim's consent is minimal. This type of extortion is similar to bribery, where paying a bribe does not necessarily imply a conspiratorial agreement. The crime of conspiring to commit Hobbs Act extortion requires a unity of intent among conspirators, even if the victim consents to the demand. Unlike bribery, where paying a bribe does not imply a conspiracy, Hobbs Act extortion, attempts, and conspiracies can result in imprisonment for up to 20 years. Hobbs Act extortion qualifies as a predicate offense under RICO. Hobbs Act extortion is a predicate offense under RICO, money laundering statutes, and the Travel Act. It involves conducting illegal activities through a series of offenses, such as extortion. The proceeds from extortion can be used for money laundering and violating the Travel Act by promoting or distributing the illegal gains."
