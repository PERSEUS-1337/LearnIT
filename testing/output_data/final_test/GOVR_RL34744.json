The President and Senate share the power to appoint principal officers of the United States. The appointment process for principal officers of the United States involves three stages: selection, clearance, and nomination by the President; consideration by the Senate; and appointment by the President. The White House selects and clears nominees before formal nomination to the Senate, with input from interested parties and negotiations for political balance among members. The appointment process for principal officers of the United States involves negotiations over nominations with the opposition party in Congress, focusing on patronage and policy. The President submits multiple nominations together for agency positions, which are confirmed as a group by the Senate. Sometimes, only one or two nominations are submitted, leading to delays until additional nominations are added. Candidates go through a clearance process and submit various forms before confirmation. The clearance process for National Security Positions involves background investigations by various agencies like the FBI, IRS, and OGE. The Office of the Counsel to the President oversees this process, resolving conflicts if found. Once cleared, nominations are submitted to the Senate, but delays can occur, especially at the beginning of an Administration. Candidates for higher-level national security positions are given priority during the clearance process for new administrations. Presidents-elect are encouraged to submit potential nominees for security clearance soon after the election to reduce delays. The President typically nominates individuals recommended by Senators from the same party for positions within a state. If Senators are from the opposition party, the President may defer to recommendations from party leaders in the state. Before making a nomination to a federal position at the state or national level, the President considers how it will fare in the confirmation process. A nominee has no legal authority until Senate confirmation and presidential appointment. A nominee hired as a consultant while awaiting confirmation may only serve in an advisory capacity. The President may give a recess appointment if conditions permit, but this may have political consequences if seen as circumventing the Senate's role. The Senate confirmation process for federal positions involves scrutiny of nominees' views and qualifications, influenced by political circumstances and the President's involvement. The process is centered at the committee level. The Senate confirmation process for federal positions involves scrutiny of nominees' views and qualifications, influenced by political circumstances and the President's involvement. Nominations are referred to the appropriate committee based on Senate Rule XXV, with most nominations going to a single committee. Committee nomination activity includes investigation, hearing, and reporting stages. The Senate confirmation process for federal positions involves investigation, hearings, and reporting stages. Committees may gather information from the White House and hold public hearings to discuss nominees and related issues. Hearings allow Senators to assess qualifications, express policy views, and raise oversight concerns. Committees may choose to hold hearings for all or some nominations and can stop the process at any point. If the committee votes to report the nomination to the full Senate, it moves forward. The Senate confirmation process involves committees voting on nominations to report back to the full Senate favorably, unfavorably, or without recommendation. If a nomination is not confirmed, it usually fails in committee due to various reasons. Rejections can occur due to opposition, time constraints, or other factors. If a nomination is not acted upon by the Senate by the end of a Congress, it is not confirmed. In the final stage of the Senate confirmation process, the confirmed nominee receives a commission signed by the President and is sworn into office. The appointee then has full authority to carry out the responsibilities of the office. The President can make limited-term appointments without Senate confirmation during recesses, which expire at the end of the next full Senate session. Appendix C provides a table showing Senate recess dates for the 109th Congress and the number of recess appointments made by Presidents to regulatory and collegial boards. Congress has imposed restrictions on the President's recess appointment power, including salary prohibitions if the appointee is not confirmed by the Senate. The Senate imposes restrictions on the President's recess appointment power, including salary prohibitions if the appointee is not confirmed by the Senate. Recess appointments must be followed by a nomination within 40 days of the next session. Appointees whose nominations are rejected can continue to serve until the end of their recess appointment, but may not receive payments from appropriated funds.

Federal executive branch boards and commissions have members appointed by the President with Senate approval, serving fixed terms with staggered end dates to ensure continuity. A new commission or board member may be nominated and confirmed for a position from which someone has resigned (or died) with an unexpired term or for a position with a new term that is already underway. Occasionally, the President submits two nominations of the same person simultaneously for completing an unexpired term and a regular term of office. The chair on some commissions is subject to Senate confirmation and must be appointed from among the incumbent commissioners. If the President wishes to appoint someone who is not on the commission as chair, two nominations are submitted simultaneously for the nominee - one for member and the other for chair.
