    "content": "The \"Artists' Contribution to American Heritage Act of 2001\" allows for charitable contributions of certain items created by the taxpayer. The \"Artists' Contribution to American Heritage Act of 2001\" allows for charitable contributions of literary, musical, or artistic compositions with special rules for determining the fair market value of the property contributed. The \"Artists' Contribution to American Heritage Act of 2001\" defines a qualified artistic charitable contribution as a donation of literary, musical, artistic, or scholarly compositions created by the taxpayer at least 18 months prior, with a required qualified appraisal of the fair market value. The taxpayer must adhere to regulations, attach an appraisal to their tax return, donate to a qualifying organization, ensure the use of the property aligns with the donee's exempt purpose, and receive documentation from the donee. The taxpayer must receive a written statement from the donee ensuring the property's use aligns with regulations and provide evidence of similar donated property being owned and displayed by qualifying organizations. The increase in the deduction under this section for any taxable year is limited to the taxpayer's artistic adjusted gross income and cannot be carried over to the next year. The term 'artistic adjusted gross income' refers to the portion of a taxpayer's adjusted gross income related to income from the sale or use of property created by personal efforts and income from teaching or similar activities. This definition does not apply to certain contributions like letters or memoranda. The amendment made by this section applies to contributions made after the enactment of this Act, treating tangible artistic property and copyrights as separate properties for charitable contributions. Contributions made after the enactment of this Act in taxable years ending after such date."
