    "content": "In the 110th and 111th Congresses, the House of Representatives received a referral from the Judicial Conference regarding impeachment of Judge G. Thomas Porteous Jr. for various offenses. The House impeached him in the 111th Congress for accepting kickbacks, soliciting favors, falsifying documents, and making false statements. The House of Representatives impeached U.S. District Court Judge Samuel B. Kent of the Southern District of Texas. His Senate impeachment trial was dismissed after he resigned from office. The current statutory procedures for complaints against federal judges stem from the Judicial Improvements Act of 2002. The current statutory procedures for complaints against federal judges, including circuit judges, district judges, bankruptcy judges, and magistrate judges, do not apply to Justices of the U.S. Supreme Court. Other courts like the U.S. Court of Federal Claims, the Court of International Trade, and the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit have their own rules for handling complaints against their judges. The judicial discipline process for federal judges is initiated by filing a complaint alleging misconduct or inability to perform duties. The complaint is filed with the clerk of the court or identified by the chief judge of the circuit for review. The judicial discipline process for federal judges begins with filing a complaint alleging misconduct or inability to perform duties. The complaint is promptly transmitted to the chief judge of the circuit, except if the complaint concerns the chief judge, in which case it is sent to the next most senior circuit judge for review. The chief judge must review the complaint quickly to determine if corrective action can be taken without a formal investigation, and may request a written response from the judge in question. The chief judge reviews complaints of misconduct or inability to perform duties promptly. They may communicate with relevant parties, review evidence, and dismiss complaints that do not meet legal requirements or lack sufficient evidence of misconduct. The chief judge may conclude proceedings if corrective action is taken or if the complaint is no longer needed. Written orders are sent to the complainant and judge involved. A petition for review can be made to the judicial council if the chief judge's decision is denied. If the complaint is not dismissed, a special committee is appointed to investigate. A special committee, comprised of equal numbers of circuit judges and district judges, is appointed to investigate complaints. The committee conducts a thorough investigation, submits a written report with findings and recommendations to the judicial council, which then has the authority to take necessary actions. The judicial council may conduct additional investigations and take appropriate actions if a complaint is not dismissed, including ordering no further cases be assigned to the judge, censuring or reprimanding the judge privately or publicly, and certifying disability or requesting voluntary retirement of the judge. The judicial council may take various actions in response to a complaint, including ordering no further cases be assigned to the judge, censuring or reprimanding the judge privately or publicly, certifying disability, requesting voluntary retirement, or removal in accordance with specific statutes. Immediate written notice of the action taken must be provided to the complainant and the judge involved. The judicial council may refer complaints to the Judicial Conference of the United States if they involve conduct that could lead to impeachment under the U.S. Constitution. The council must certify its determination to the Judicial Conference if a judge's behavior raises impeachment grounds. The judicial council may refer complaints to the Judicial Conference of the United States if a judge's behavior raises impeachment grounds. If dissatisfied, the complainant or judge can petition the Judicial Conference for review. The Conference may grant a petition filed by a complainant or judge aggrieved by an action of the judicial council. If a petition for review is denied, the decision is final. The Judicial Conference considers referrals or certifications, conducts investigations, and may use subpoena power in the judicial discipline process. It can take action to ensure efficient court administration if a complaint is not dismissed. The Judicial Conference has the authority to take various actions in cases of judicial misconduct, including temporarily halting case assignments to the judge, censuring or reprimanding the judge privately or publicly, certifying disability, requesting voluntary retirement, or directing actions for magistrate judges. If impeachable offenses are suspected, the Judicial Conference can concur with the judicial council's determination. The Judicial Conference can take various actions in cases of judicial misconduct, including halting case assignments, censuring the judge, certifying disability, requesting retirement, or directing actions for magistrate judges. If impeachable offenses are suspected, the Judicial Conference can concur with the judicial council's determination and transmit it to the House of Representatives for necessary action. If a judge is convicted of a felony and all avenues of review have been exhausted, the Judicial Conference can transmit a determination of impeachment without referral from the judicial council. The relevant judicial council under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 354 may transmit a determination of impeachment to the House of Representatives if a judge has been convicted of a felony and all avenues of review have been exhausted. Once a judge is convicted and appeals have expired, their service cannot be counted towards years of service. Once a judge is convicted of a felony and all appeals have expired, their service cannot be counted towards years of service under relevant statutes. Additionally, judges under investigation cannot serve on certain committees until the investigation is completed, and no one can intervene in judicial discipline proceedings except for public disclosure of impeachment determinations. Confidentiality is maintained in judicial discipline proceedings under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 351-364, with limited exceptions for disclosure to specific parties or for impeachment investigations or trials. The process of judicial discipline proceedings under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 351-364 involves orders issued by judicial councils, the Judicial Conference, or standing committees, which are made public with written reasons. The Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts provides statistical information online regarding complaints against federal judges and disciplinary actions taken. In 2010, 1,448 complaints were reported. In the 2010 fiscal year, 1,448 complaints were filed against federal judges, with 1,159 complaints concluded and 1,143 pending resolution. The most common allegation was abuse of judicial power, followed by favoritism or animus towards litigants or attorneys. Most complaints are dismissed by the circuit chief judge. The federal judicial discipline framework provides a mechanism for considering complaints against federal judges, but it does not apply to U.S. Supreme Court Justices or certain other courts. Most complaints are dismissed by the circuit chief judge, with few leading to further action. The federal judicial discipline framework allows for investigation of complaints against federal judges, leading to disciplinary action if warranted. Cases like Judge G. Thomas Porteous Jr. and Judge Samuel B. Kent have shown that serious misconduct may result in impeachment referral to the U.S. House of Representatives."
