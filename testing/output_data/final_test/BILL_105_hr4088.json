Congress enacted the Indian Health Care Improvement Act in 1988 to establish a demonstration program for direct billing and receipt of payment for health services provided to eligible patients. The program, which began in 1989, resulted in increased collections and satisfaction among participants. The demonstration program for direct billing and receipt of payments for health services under medicare and medicaid programs has led to increased collections, reduced turnaround time for payments, and improved efficiency in tracking billings. Direct involvement of tribes and tribal organizations in billing and collections has been more beneficial than the current system managed by the Indian Health Service. Tribes managing their own medicare and medicaid billings and collections has been successful. The demonstration program for direct billing and receipt of payments for health services under medicare and medicaid programs has been successful. Allowing tribes to manage their own medicare and medicaid billings and collections has led to increased collections, reduced administrative costs, and improved efficiency. Congress extended the program to prevent interruptions while awaiting a recommendation on permanent authorization. It would be beneficial to make direct billing and collection permanent for the Indian Health Service and tribal organizations. The curr_chunk discusses extending participation in direct billing and collection to other Indian tribes, tribal organizations, and Alaska Native health organizations under the Indian Health Service. The curr_chunk discusses the permanent authorization for direct billing of Medicare, Medicaid, and other third-party payors under the Indian Health Care Improvement Act. The curr_chunk discusses the option for Indian tribes, tribal organizations, and Alaska Native health organizations to directly bill and receive payment for health care services provided under the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act from Medicare, Medicaid, or other third-party payors. The curr_chunk explains that health programs participating in a specific program can be reimbursed directly under Medicare and Medicaid for services provided, without certain restrictions. The funds reimbursed must first be used for improving health facilities or programs. The curr_chunk outlines the reimbursement process for health programs under Medicare and Medicaid, with excess funds required to be used for improving Indian tribe health resources. Audits are also required for the funds allocated to participating health programs. The curr_chunk discusses the auditing requirements and restrictions on payments from special funds for health programs participating in the program established under this section. Indian tribes, tribal organizations, or Alaska Native health organizations must submit a certification to the Secretary to be eligible for participation. The curr_chunk discusses the eligibility requirements for Indian tribes, tribal organizations, or Alaska Native health organizations to participate in a health program under the Medicare or Medicaid programs. Participants in the program authorized before the Alaska Native and American Indian Direct Reimbursement Act of 1998 are grandfathered in. Participants in the program do not need to submit a certification to participate and their certification will remain valid as long as they meet the requirements. The Secretary will continuously examine and implement any necessary administrative changes to facilitate direct billing and reimbursement, including agreements with States for direct billing under the Medicaid program. States may need to allow for direct billing under the Medicaid program. Participants can withdraw from the program as tribes can retrocede a contracted program. Cost accounting and billing authority will return to the Secretary upon withdrawal. Conforming amendments are made to the Social Security Act. The Social Security Act is amended to allow certain Indian tribes and organizations to directly bill for health care services. Effective date of the amendments is specified. The amendments made by this section will take effect on October 1, 1998."
