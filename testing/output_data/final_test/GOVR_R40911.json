    "content": "Congress is considering legislation on climate change, focusing on mitigation and adaptation measures. Mitigation aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, while adaptation improves coping mechanisms and takes advantage of potential benefits. Recent bills include provisions for increased research and programmatic attention to adaptation options. Mitigation and adaptation efforts are not mutually exclusive and can be complementary. The American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009 (H.R. 2454) and the Clean Energy, Jobs, and Power Act (S. 1733) aim to regulate greenhouse gas emissions through a cap-and-trade system. Both bills also include provisions for assessing and supporting adaptation to climate change impacts. This report compares adaptation-related provisions in H.R. 2454 and S. 1733, focusing on climate change adaptation domestically and internationally. It includes a side-by-side table in an Appendix for easy comparison. The provisions cover various areas such as public health, natural resources, state and tribal programs, and other climate change adaptation programs. Climate-related changes have been observed globally and in the United States, as documented by the U.S. Global Change Research Program. The US Global Change Research Program (USGCRP) documented the impacts of climate change in the United States, highlighting stress on water resources, coastal settlements at risk from sea-level rise, increased wildfires, and threats to human health. The report predicts intensifying impacts depending on the region, with population growth and resource use limiting adaptation efforts. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) emphasizes the need for adaptation to address impacts of climate change, including threats to forests, human health, crop and livestock production, and natural ecosystems. Adaptation is crucial to mitigate the effects of warming already unavoidable due to past emissions. Adaptation is essential to address the impacts of climate change on various sectors such as agriculture and coastal regions. Examples of adaptation measures include changing management practices in agriculture and improving shoreline protection in coastal areas. The costs of implementing adaptation measures are evaluated in relation to the value of the assets protected. The National Research Council (NRC) report highlights the lack of preparedness for climate change challenges. Current U.S. adaptation efforts are described as ad hoc, uncoordinated, underfunded, and lacking critical information for decision-making. The NRC report on climate change adaptation efforts highlighted constraints such as lack of site-specific data and clear roles among agencies. Recommendations include bolstering federal programs in climate science, strengthening research, initiating national climate assessments, and providing policymakers with relevant information. Adaptation initiatives are gaining traction at federal and state levels, with the DOI launching a strategy to address climate impacts. The DOI initiative aims to coordinate climate change strategies among Interior bureaus and NOAA's Regional Integrated Sciences and Assessments program supports research for adaptation. While federal agencies are recognizing the need to adapt to climate change, there is a lack of strategic coordination. Some states, like California, are making progress on adaptation independently and through partnerships. The state of California and Maryland are developing strategic plans for climate change adaptation, calling for more federal support and coordination. California released a draft California Climate Adaptation Strategy, the first operational plan for collaborative action by state agencies. Maryland is focusing on understanding climate change impacts on the economy and natural resources, particularly in the Chesapeake Bay region. Both states are advocating for federal support for research programs and an integrated national strategy on adaptation. The curr_chunk discusses the need for an integrated national strategy on climate change adaptation, including coordination among state and federal agencies and increased federal funding for programs to protect coastal communities and natural resources. There are differing opinions on the effectiveness of adaptation measures, with some skeptical of their wide-scale implementation. The report also compares the adaptation provisions in S. 1733 as reported by the Senate Environment and Public Works. The adaptation provisions in S. 1733 and H.R. 2454 differ in scope and emphasis, including distribution of emission allowance allocations. Both bills address international and domestic climate change adaptation, state and tribal programs, public health, and natural resources adaptation. S. 1733 includes additional provisions for drinking water utilities, water system partnerships, flood control, wildfire, and coastal adaptation. The Senate-reported bill (S. 1733) and the House-passed bill (H.R. 2454) do not include a federal process for developing a national strategic plan to address climate change impacts. Both bills lack explicit provisions for adaptation in key sectors like transportation, energy infrastructure, and agriculture. While forestry and agriculture are considered for emissions reductions, set-asides, and carbon offsets, these are not specifically related to adaptation. The Senate-reported bill and the House-passed bill do not focus on adaptation in key sectors like transportation, energy infrastructure, and agriculture. Both bills allocate allowances or auction revenues for adaptation activities, but the primary purpose is emissions mitigation, not adaptation. There are differences in how emission allowances are distributed between the two bills. The Senate bill and House bill differ in the availability of funds for adaptation provisions. The Senate bill allows automatic availability for specified purposes, while the House bill requires subsequent appropriations. H.R. 2454 allocates allowances directly and creates funds for proceeds from allowance sales, subject to future appropriations. The House bill uses hortatory language for adaptation provisions. The House bill relies on hortatory language for appropriations in adaptation provisions, while the Senate bill allows automatic availability of funds without further appropriation. This difference in funding mechanisms may be controversial. Developing countries and vulnerable communities are most at risk from climate change impacts, threatening survival. By 2020, crop yields in Africa could decrease by up to 50%. 20%-30% of plant and animal species worldwide may face extinction with a temperature increase of 1.5\u00b0C -2.5\u00b0C. The risk of extinction increases with global temperature rise above 1.5\u00b0C -2.5\u00b0C. Melting glaciers and snow cover will reduce water supply for over 1 billion people in mountain ranges like the Hindu Kush, Himalaya, and Andes. By 2050, around 200 million people may be displaced due to sudden climate disasters. Higher frequency and intensity of diseases like heat stroke, malaria, and diarrhea will lead to increased health impacts and mortality. Industrialized countries, including the United States, have committed to providing international assistance for adaptation to help vulnerable developing nations under the UNFCCC. Adaptation assistance is a major issue in international climate change negotiations. Estimates for annual adaptation costs for developing countries range from $4 billion to several hundred billion dollars by 2030. The World Bank estimates average annual adaptation costs from 2010 to 2050 to be between $75 billion to $100 billion. EU leaders have also agreed on the need for funding in this area. The World Bank estimates annual adaptation costs for developing countries from 2010 to 2050 to be between $75 billion to $100 billion. EU leaders agreed that developing nations would need $150 billion annually by 2020 to tackle climate change. Both House and Senate bills establish an International Climate Change Adaptation Program, with differences in programs to support international adaptation. H.R. 2454 and S. 1733 establish an International Climate Change Adaptation Program, with differences in funding distribution. H.R. 2454 requires 40% to 60% of funding to go to multilateral funds, limits bilateral assistance to 10% per country, and emphasizes the additionality of resources. S. 1733 does not have specific funding distribution requirements or limits. The International Climate Change Adaptation Program established by H.R. 2454 and S. 1733 involves various agencies with expertise in capacity-building, technology, and financing to assist in climate change adaptation. H.R. 2454 assigns oversight of funding distributions to the Secretary of State and the Administrator of USAID, while S. 1733 proposes a Strategic Interagency Board on International Climate Investment for this purpose. Adaptation efforts in the U.S. could include activities like climate observation services, research on climate change impacts, vulnerability assessments, and adaptation strategies. Both S. 1733 and H.R. 2454 aim to enhance federal efforts in climate change adaptation by developing vulnerability assessments, adaptation strategies, and infrastructure planning. The bills differ in their approaches and priorities, reflecting the need for a comprehensive climate adaptation strategy that includes cross-sectoral and interagency plans. Both the House and Senate bills aim to establish national \"climate services\" to support the development and execution of adaptation strategies at federal, state, local, and private levels. The bills prioritize state and tribal responsibility for developing most adaptation strategies, with financial support from federal greenhouse gas emission allowances. Additionally, S. 1733 requires states to allocate funding to localities for climate change adaptation. The House and Senate bills aim to establish sector-specific adaptation plans at the federal level to protect public health and natural resources. Both bills authorize expansion of the federal role in climate change adaptation, with S. 1733 proposing a new national adaptation program. The House and Senate bills aim to establish sector-specific adaptation plans at the federal level to protect public health and natural resources. S. 1733 proposes a new national climate change adaptation program to increase the overall effectiveness of Federal efforts, giving wide discretion to the President. H.R. 2454, passed by the House, does not explicitly provide similar broad authority to the President for such a program. Earlier versions of the House bill included provisions for a comprehensive federal adaptation program and strategy, but these were not included in the final version. H.R. 2454 expands the focus of the U.S. Global Change Research Program to include climate change adaptation, vulnerability assessments, and policy analysis. The coordinating committee would include agencies beyond science agencies, but federal adaptation efforts remain primarily a research effort. The White House Office of Science and Technology Policy would lead these efforts. S. 1733 proposes a National Climate Change Adaptation Program without funding authorization or emission allowance allocation. H.R. 2454 and S. 1733 propose national programs to develop climate change adaptation information, with H.R. 2454 including more detailed provisions and a National Climate Service within the USGCRP. The bills S. 1733 and H.R. 2454 differ in the design and location of the National Climate Service (NCS) office. S. 1733 places it within NOAA, while H.R. 2454 establishes a new interagency entity for the NCS. The implementation plan of the NCS would be coordinated by the Director of OSTP, with key recipients being states, localities, tribal governments, and the public. Both H.R. 2454 and S. 1733 focus on enabling stakeholders to develop and implement climate adaptation strategies. They emphasize the importance of training stakeholders in using climate information and dealing with uncertainty. The bills delegate authority for addressing climate change adaptation primarily to states, with a role for the Environmental Protection Agency. Both H.R. 2454 and S. 1733 focus on enabling stakeholders to develop and implement climate adaptation strategies. The bills delegate authority for addressing climate change adaptation primarily to states, with a role for the Environmental Protection Agency in reviewing and approving state plans. They also provide funding for state and tribal adaptation programs, specifying detailed roles for states and tribes in developing and implementing climate change adaptation plans. Financial resources are allocated to support adaptation planning, strategies, and implementation. The public health provisions in S. 1733 and H.R. 2454 aim to support states and tribes in adapting to climate change impacts, including air quality decline, extreme temperatures, wildfires, and spread of diseases. Both bills mandate measures to assist health professionals in developing preparedness plans for climate change threats. Both S. 1733 and H.R. 2454 require the Secretary of HHS to develop a national strategy for public health adaptation to climate change, with funding differences between the two bills. Adaptation to climate change is complex, with some measures already in place. Adaptation to climate change is already occurring, with trees in Alaska growing farther north and rodents in the Rockies at higher elevations. Ecosystems are changing, with fires and beetles causing destruction. Species are losing suitable habitat, posing threats to various sectors. Efforts are being made to mitigate negative effects, including planting different trees and mapping coastal areas for future changes. The House-passed and Senate-reported bills aim to support species and ecosystems in the face of climate change by encouraging federal and state strategies. Both bills focus on planning and creating new information sources, such as the National Climate Service. The Senate bill proposes funding natural resource adaptation activities through emission allowances, including a provision for land acquisition under the Land and Water Conservation Fund. Supporters argue for funding to protect rare ecosystems and recreational opportunities, while opponents raise concerns about oversight and federal spending limitations. Both S. 1733 and H.R. 2454 propose funding for natural resource adaptation programs, with S. 1733 lacking annual control by appropriations and budget committees while H.R. 2454 requires annual appropriations. Both bills also emphasize the use of geospatial information systems (GIS) for data dissemination, highlighting the importance of coordination for various purposes such as energy development and infrastructure planning. Coordination of geospatial data is seen as crucial for interagency and cross-sector planning. Both S. 1733 and H.R. 2454 focus on funding natural resource adaptation programs, with S. 1733 addressing climate-change-exacerbated wildfire threats and emphasizing the importance of coordination and planning. However, agricultural adaptation and the role of USDA's Natural Resources Conservation Service are notably absent in both bills. The proposed bill aims to provide grants and cost-share agreements to communities for fire readiness and mapping fire risk in priority areas. Climate change is expected to impact water availability, intensify water-related hazards, and affect water infrastructure and pollution levels. This is of interest to utility officials, federal agencies, and those involved in water management. Climate change impacts water infrastructure and management practices, leading to warmer water, changes in precipitation, loss of reservoir storage, sea level rise, and increased storm intensity. Adaptation measures include demand management, infrastructure investments, and ecosystem protection. Adapting to these effects poses significant challenges. Adapting to climate's water-related effects poses challenges due to the wide variety of entities involved in managing water and ecosystems. Congress is considering legislation, with S. 1733 including specific provisions for water-related adaptation, such as establishing research and grants programs for water utilities and states to address climate-related impacts. The legislation includes provisions for adapting to climate-related flood impacts and coastal states for climate change. Funding would come from the state climate change response account. The focus is on water quantity challenges rather than water quality. Adaptation planning and measures are also covered under broader provisions for state adaptation efforts. The bills provide funding for federal agencies to undertake aquatic ecosystem restoration and water-related natural resource adaptation actions. Federal water resource agencies are directed to adapt their plans, programs, and activities. It is unclear how much authority they will have due to project-specific authorization from Congress. The bills focus on federal agencies responsible for managing water resources, like the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the Bureau of Reclamation. However, agencies working with water users, such as the U.S. Department of Agriculture and Department of Energy, are not included. Agriculture and the energy sector are major water consumers, but independent entities like the Tennessee Valley Authority are not specifically addressed. The natural resources adaptation provisions in S. 1733 do not specifically address entities like the Tennessee Valley Authority. However, FEMA would be included in the adaptation panel, focusing on water quantity changes such as reduced municipal water supplies and increased flooding. S. 1733 also includes water-specific provisions not found in H.R. 2454, with less attention given to adapting federal water resources infrastructure to changes in water quantity. The bills S. 1733 and H.R. 2454 focus on adapting water resources infrastructure to changing water quantity and quality, but lack attention on managing adaptation in agriculture and energy sectors."
