    "content": "The \"Digital Global Access Policy Act of 2016\" or the \"Digital GAP Act\" aims to improve Internet access in developing countries to boost economic growth, job creation, health, education, financial services, poverty reduction, gender equality, disaster mitigation, democracy, governance, cybersecurity, and update the Department of State's structure for cyberspace policy. Since 2005, Internet users have tripled to 3.2 billion, but 4.2 billion people, mostly rural, female, elderly, illiterate, and low-income, remain offline. Studies show women in developing countries are 50% less likely to access the Internet than men, with significant economic implications. Bringing 600 million more women online could add $13-$18 billion to GDP in 144 developing countries. Internet access in developing countries is hindered by a lack of infrastructure and poor regulatory environments for investment. Build-once policies aim to minimize costs for installing high-speed Internet networks, serving as a development best practice. STATEMENT OF POLICY: The lack of infrastructure and poor regulatory environments in developing countries hinder internet access. Build-once policies aim to reduce costs for installing high-speed internet networks, serving as a development best practice. Congress declares its policy to partner with various entities to promote first-time Internet access for 1.5 billion people in developing countries by 2020, including deploying Internet infrastructure and encouraging build-once policies. The policy aims to deploy wireless facilities for broadband service in infrastructure projects funded by the US or international organizations, coordinating with telecommunications providers. It also involves partnering with governments and organizations to coordinate infrastructure development with the private sector for laying fiber optic cables. Promote policy changes to increase financial support for expanding internet connectivity in developing countries, including integrating universal and gender-equitable access goals into national plans and encouraging competition law reforms. Promote reforms in competition laws, spectrum allocation, procurement processes, tax, and regulatory barriers to enhance Internet access and economic growth. Encourage policies to remove restrictions on e-commerce, cross-border information flows, competitive marketplaces, entrepreneurship, and distance learning enabled by technology. Support the use of the Internet to strengthen democracy. Promote the use of the Internet to bolster democracy, government accountability, transparency, and human rights through policies, initiatives, and investments that support freedom of expression, religion, and association. Encourage the multistakeholder model of Internet governance and support programs, research, and technologies that safeguard human rights online and enable political organizing, activism, free speech, and religious expression in compliance with international standards. Promote Internet access and inclusion in policymaking for women, people with disabilities, minorities, low-income, and marginalized groups. Also, advocate for cybersecurity and data protection, utilizing industry-led standards like the NIST Framework. The Department of State organization is outlined in Section 5. The Department of State should redesignate an Assistant Secretary position to focus on diplomatic cyberspace policy, including cybersecurity and Internet freedom. They should also enhance training programs and recruit candidates with technical expertise. The Department of State will eliminate positions to offset costs for the designation of an Assistant Secretary for Cyberspace. The redesignation of the Assistant Secretary position will not increase the total number of Assistant Secretary positions above the current level of 24. SEC. 6. USAID. The sense of Congress is for the Administrator of USAID to integrate efforts to expand Internet access, enhance digital literacy, utilize information technologies in humanitarian aid, disaster relief, and security operations, and establish guidelines for personal information protection. The personal information of individuals served by humanitarian, disaster, and development programs is collected through contracts funded by the United States Government and international organizations. The Peace Corps Act is amended to emphasize the importance of technology in sectors like agriculture, education, and health where Volunteers work. The Peace Corps is urged to focus on leveraging technology for development and economic mobility in its programs. The President should direct US representatives to international bodies to advocate for increased gender-equitable Internet access, coordination with stakeholders, and integration into economic assessments. The President should direct US representatives to advocate for gender-equitable Internet access and integration into economic assessments. Additionally, provide technical assistance to regulatory authorities in developing countries to remove barriers to investment and strengthen regulations. To support market growth and development, clear, metric-based targets should be utilized to measure the effectiveness of efforts to promote Internet access. Human rights online, including freedoms of speech, assembly, association, religion, and belief, should be promoted and protected through various initiatives. SEC. 9. PARTNERSHIP FRAMEWORK. The President must provide plans to promote partnerships with development agencies for expanding Internet access in developing countries, including outreach methods for stakeholders and coordination with the private sector for financing infrastructure. Methods for early consultation with stakeholders in telecommunications and road construction projects for Internet infrastructure development. SEC. 10. REPORTING REQUIREMENT ON IMPLEMENTATION EFFORTS. Within 180 days of this Act's enactment, the President must report to the House Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations on efforts to implement policies for promoting Internet access in developing countries. This includes developing a technical roadmap, identifying regulatory barriers, and supporting regulations to incentivize market growth. To promote Internet access in developing countries, efforts include incentivizing market growth, encouraging investment in Internet infrastructure, increasing gender-equitable access, improving affordability, promoting technology and cybersecurity capacity building, and advocating for Internet freedom globally. The multistakeholder model is also emphasized. Promote multistakeholder model of Internet governance and participate in international fora like Internet Governance Forum. The President should include in the next White House Cyberspace Strategy methods to promote Internet access in developing countries, globally promote cybersecurity policy consistent with NIST Framework, and promote global Internet freedom principles. In this Act, \"build once policies and approaches\" refer to minimizing excavation and construction activities for installing telecommunications infrastructure. \"Cyberspace\" encompasses information technology networks, the Internet, and virtual interactions. \"Stakeholders\" include private sector, public sector, cooperatives, civil society, and technical community. The curr_chunk focuses on the technical community involved in developing Internet technologies, standards, implementation, operations, and applications, as well as groups working to increase Internet access or impacted by the lack of access in their communities.
