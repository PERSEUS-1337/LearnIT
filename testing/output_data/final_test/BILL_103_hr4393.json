    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Grant's Tomb National Memorial Act of 1994\". Ulysses S. Grant is recognized as a national hero for leading the Union army to victory in the Civil War, serving as the 18th President of the United States, protecting the rights of freed slaves, and working towards national unity and rebuilding. The Grant's Tomb National Memorial Act aims to pay tribute to Ulysses S. Grant, preserve the memorial and surrounding areas, and educate future generations about Grant's life and contributions to the United States. The Grant's Tomb National Memorial Act redesignates the memorial and administration of Grant's Tomb. The General Grant National Memorial in New York is redesignated as Grant's Tomb National Memorial, consisting of the tomb of Ulysses S. Grant and surrounding plaza area. The Secretary of the Interior will administer, promote, and maintain the memorial according to this Act and National Park System laws. The Secretary will design and build a visitors center at Grant's Tomb National Memorial to aid in interpretation and maintain historical significance. The center will be established in consultation with a study commission and designed to be consistent with the site's architectural and historical intent without detracting from its interpretation and scenic views. The Secretary will acquire non-Federal lands within the memorial boundaries through donation, purchase, or exchange. They may also lease or enter into cooperative agreements for land management. Additionally, a study commission will be established. The Secretary will establish a study commission of seven persons within 60 days of enacting the Act, composed of members of the Grant Monument Association, community representatives, and citizens with relevant expertise. Commission members will serve without pay and designate a chair. The Secretary will provide administrative support services upon request. The study commission, established by the Secretary, will review security, maintenance, and interpretive programs at the memorial. Within 180 days, they will submit a report with proposed measures for improvement based on original plans by architects John H. Duncan and John Russell Pope. The report will also include cost estimates for implementing these measures. The study commission will monitor repairs to the Tomb and submit progress reports to the Secretary and Congress. The Secretary will review the report and submit a final plan for projects at the memorial to be completed by April 27, 1997, unless aspects are deemed unreasonable or compromise the site's historical integrity. The study commission for the memorial will ensure repairs to the Tomb and provide progress reports to the Secretary and Congress. The final plan for projects must align with the commission's report, maintain historical integrity, and not detract from the memorial's significance. Meetings are open to the public, and the commission will terminate within three years of establishment. The Federal Advisory Committee Act does not apply to the study commission for the memorial. The Secretary of the Interior, in coordination with the Secretary of Defense, will provide three military guards to protect the memorial site 24/7 in perpetuity. Appropriations are authorized as needed to implement this Act."
