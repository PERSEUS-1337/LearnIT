    "content": "The Fair Pay Act of 1999, also known as the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, includes findings related to pay equity. The Congress finds wage differentials based on sex, race, and national origin depress wages, hinder labor utilization, cause disputes, burden commerce, and constitute unfair competition. Discrimination in hiring and promotion is also noted. Discrimination in hiring and promotion has contributed to a segregated workforce, with many women and people of color working in occupations dominated by individuals of their same sex, race, and national origin. Studies have shown wage differentials between white and non-white workers, with a significant portion unexplained and potentially due to discrimination. Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits discrimination in compensation based on race, color, religion, national origin, and sex. The Supreme Court's decision in County of Washington v. Gunther extended this prohibition to jobs that may not be considered \"equal work\" under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938. Further clarification of existing legislation is needed to fully implement this decision. Artificial barriers to eliminating discrimination in compensation based on sex, race, and national origin persist despite legislation from the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 and the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Removing these barriers would have positive effects on the economy, reduce reliance on public assistance for working women and people of color, and promote stable families by ensuring fair pay for all family members. SEC. 3. EQUAL PAY FOR EQUIVALENT JOBS. Amendment to Section 6 (29 U.S.C. 206) prohibits wage discrimination based on sex, race, or national origin. Employers must pay equal wages for equivalent jobs, except for seniority, merit, or productivity-based reasons. Labor organizations representing employees are also included in this provision. The labor organization representing employees must not cause discrimination against an employee. Any withheld amounts owed to an employee will be considered unpaid minimum wages or overtime compensation. The term \"labor organization\" refers to any organization dealing with employers on labor-related matters. The term \"equivalent jobs\" refers to jobs with similar requirements in skills, effort, responsibility, and working conditions. Section 13(a) is amended to include references to sections 6(d) and 6(g). SEC. 4. PROHIBITED ACTS. Section 15(a) (29 U.S.C. 215(a)) is amended to include protections against discrimination for individuals who oppose unlawful acts, make charges, testify, assist, or participate in investigations. It also prohibits discrimination against employees who inquire about or discuss wages. The employee exercised, enjoyed, aided, or encouraged any right protected by section 6(g). SEC. 5. REMEDIES. Amends Section 16 to allow expert fees in actions for violation of section 6(g) and permits class actions. Amends subsection (b) to include additional sections and clarifies exceptions for class actions. Section 11(c) (29 U.S.C. 211(c)) is amended to require employers subject to section 6(g) to preserve records documenting wage calculations and report annually to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission requires employers subject to section 6(g) to report annually on wage or salary rates by classification, position, and demographics, with the information being made public. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission can use information obtained under subparagraph (B) for statistical and research purposes. It must allow inspection of reports filed under subparagraph (B) and provide copies for a fee. Rules and regulations will be issued for the content and format of required reports. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission can issue rules and regulations for reports required under subparagraph (B) to prevent evasion. Simplified reports may be prescribed for small employers to reduce burden. SEC. 7. RESEARCH, EDUCATION, AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM; REPORT TO CONGRESS. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission will provide information and assistance to address wage discrimination based on sex, race, or national origin in equivalent jobs. This includes research, education, and technical support to eliminate such discrimination. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission is tasked with correcting conditions leading to section 6(g) by publishing findings, sponsoring educational programs, and providing technical assistance to promote compliance. The annual report to Congress includes an evaluation on these efforts. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission publishes an annual report to Congress that includes an evaluation of efforts to correct conditions leading to section 6(g). The amendments made by this Act will be effective one year after its enactment."
