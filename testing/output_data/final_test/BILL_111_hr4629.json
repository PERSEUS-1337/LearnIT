The Treasury establishes a revolving loan fund with an initial transfer of $20 billion from unobligated funds under the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008. An SPV may not make new loans under certain programs after the termination date. The Secretary will use the revolving loan fund for the loan program, depositing payments and interest back into the fund. After the termination date, no new loans can be made, and all fund amounts will be transferred to the Treasury's general fund. The collateral support program is outlined in Section 4. The collateral support program described in Section 4 allows a qualified manufacturer to receive a loan from a bank with collateral support from an SPV. The SPV deposits cash in an interest-bearing account to act as collateral for the loan, with interest paid to the SPV. The SPV draws down the deposited amount as the manufacturer repays the loan. Requirements include deposit limits, loan amount capped at $20,000,000, and fees not exceeding 3% of the loan. The SPV may charge a fee of up to 3% of the cash deposit annually, with options to purchase equity in the manufacturer. An exit fee of 5% is required if the manufacturer defaults. The SPV requires periodic reports from the bank during the loan term. The SPV requires periodic reports from the bank and the qualified manufacturer to maintain oversight during the loan term. SEC. 5. LOAN PARTICIPATION PROGRAM. Under this loan participation program, a qualified manufacturer can request a bank to seek loan participation from an SPV. The SPV may purchase between 1 to 49.9 percent of the loan, while the bank continues to service the entire loan. The SPV may also allow the manufacturer to defer interest payments in coordination with the bank. The loan participation program allows a qualified manufacturer to defer interest payments or principal payments for up to 3 years. The SPV may purchase up to $20,000,000 of loans for each manufacturer and charge a one-time fee as well as an annual fee. The SPV requires the bank to pay an annual fee of 0.5-2% of the loan amount purchased under the loan participation program. The bank must provide periodic reports to the SPV and other reports as deemed necessary for oversight. SEC. 6. REPORT.\n\nThe Secretary must issue a report to Congress every quarter while loans are outstanding under the program. The report will include a list of active participants in support programs and an estimate of the program's impact on the economy and job creation."
