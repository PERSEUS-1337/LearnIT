The final determination in an alien's case, number of cases closed due to policy directives, statistics on unlawfully present aliens released from detention centers since January 20, 2009, including those convicted of violent crimes, and detailed information on data compilation methods. The report required by subsection (a) shall be publicly available and submitted within 90 days of the enactment of this Act. The term \"removal of aliens from the United States\" excludes individuals denied admission at the border. SEC. 3. Accountability requirements for immigration policy directives. Treatment of an Immigration Policy Directive as a Rule: An immigration policy directive is to be treated as a rule for certain chapters of the United States Code.

The immigration policy directive will modify the status of certain states and assign new statuses to affected aliens. SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS. This Act defines \"immigration policy directive\" as any communication from the Department of Homeland Security regarding immigration law, and \"rule\" as defined in section 551 of title 5, United States Code."
