    "content": "Tax-exempt bond financing for specific electric facilities is addressed in Section 1. Permitted open access transactions related to electric output facilities are not considered private business use for tax-exempt bond financing. Providing open access transmission services and ancillary services for electric output facilities owned or leased by a governmental unit or in which a governmental unit has capacity rights, in accordance with Federal Energy Regulatory Commission requirements. The curr_chunk discusses the conditions for participation in an independent system operator agreement, regional transmission group, or power exchange agreement approved by the Commission, as well as the delivery of electric energy on an open access basis to end-users. The curr_chunk outlines conditions for open access service, including sales of electric output to specific purchasers and qualifying load loss sales, as well as other transactions regulated by the Secretary. For qualifying load loss sales by governmental units after 1997, certain conditions must be met, including being a new off-system sale, not exceeding lost load, having a sale term of no more than three years, and electing to suspend issuance of tax-exempt bonds. The term 'on-system purchaser' refers to a person buying electric energy from a governmental unit directly connected to transmission or distribution facilities owned or leased by the government. The term 'off-system purchaser' is also defined in the context of electric energy purchases. The term 'off-system purchaser' refers to a buyer of electric energy from a governmental unit that is not directly connected to transmission or distribution facilities owned or leased by the government. It includes existing off-system sales to buyers who purchased energy in the base year and new off-system sales to other buyers. The term 'new off-system sale' refers to an off-system sale other than an existing off-system sale. 'Lost load' is the amount by which the sum of on-system sales and existing off-system sales in a year is less than the sum of such sales in the base year, which is 1997. The text discusses the option for joint action agencies to transfer entitlement for a qualifying load loss sale. Additionally, it mentions the amendment allowing issuers to terminate or suspend tax-exempt bond financing for certain electric output facilities. An issuer can elect to terminate tax-exempt financing for electric output facilities, resulting in no new tax-exempt bonds for such facilities. Bonds issued before this election date with tax-exempt interest will not be treated as private activity bonds. An issuer may elect to suspend tax-exempt financing for electric output facilities, prohibiting the issuance of tax-exempt bonds for such facilities in that calendar year, with exceptions for certain types of bonds. An issuer can choose to suspend tax-exempt financing for electric output facilities, except for specific types of bonds like those for qualifying T&D facilities or repairs to pollution control equipment. Repairs must not significantly increase the facility's capacity. The election made by the issuer is binding on any successor. The term 'electric output facility' refers to electric generation, transmission, or distribution facilities. The term 'qualifying T&D facility' refers to transmission or distribution facilities providing specific services. The amendments made by this section take effect on the date of enactment of this Act, with the option for a governmental unit to apply certain sections of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 starting from July 9, 1996. References in the Act to sections of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 shall also include references to comparable sections of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954. The \"Private Use Competition Reform Act of 1998\" states that any activity not considered private business use before the effective date of the amendment will not be deemed as such after the enactment. Issuers electing under section 141(f) of the Internal Revenue Code will not be liable for any claims arising from the election."
