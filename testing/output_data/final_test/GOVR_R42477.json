It also increased penalties for domestic violence crimes and created protections for abused noncitizen spouses, including the U visa for victims assisting law enforcement. The Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) of 1994 and its reauthorizations in 2000 and 2005 provided funding for domestic violence enforcement, research, prevention programs, and victim services. The reauthorization in 2005 added protections and expanded eligibility for abused foreign nationals, including the U visa for victims assisting law enforcement. Authorization for appropriations for VAWA programs expired in 2011, but reauthorization efforts in the 112th Congress were stalled due to differences in provisions related to battered foreign nationals. The Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2013 (P.L. 113-4) added protections for foreign nationals who are victims of domestic abuse. Concerns have been raised about potential immigration fraud involving false domestic abuse claims for obtaining legal status in the U.S. through sham marriages or misrepresenting abuse. The extent of this fraud remains unclear. The Immigration and Naturalization Act includes provisions to prevent marriage fraud, such as face-to-face interviews with trained adjudicators. Concerns have been raised about potential marriage fraud facilitated by the VAWA provisions and the processing of VAWA petitions by USCIS. The report discusses VAWA immigration provisions, legislation in the 113th Congress, related policy issues, family sponsorship for lawful permanent residence, U visas, and the path to legal status through marriage. Conditional permanent residence status through marriage includes a two-year evaluation period to determine the legitimacy of the marriage. It grants the same rights as LPR status but requires a joint petition to remove conditions within 90 days before the two-year period ends. Failure to do so results in termination of lawful status and possible removal proceedings. This process allows USCIS to review new marriages for possible fraud. VAWA allows abused spouses, children, and parents of U.S. citizens and LPRs to petition for legal status independently. The self-petition replaces the initial petition filed by the sponsor. Eligible individuals include abused noncitizen spouses, parents, and children under 21. VAWA petitions require evidence of good faith marriage, relationship to abusive parent, and good moral character. Applicants submit Form I-360 to USCIS Vermont Service Center for review. A Prima Facie Determination Notice is issued if filing requirements are met. The Notice issued for an I-360 petition signifies a legitimate case but does not impact the petition's approval. If approved, the foreign national may receive deferred action status, allowing them to stay in the US. VAWA petition volume increased significantly from 1997 to 2011, with a fourfold rise in petitions submitted. Approval rates for I-360 VAWA petitions increased almost fourfold, from 2,491 to 9,209 over a 15-year period. The approval rates fluctuated between 67% and 85%, with no consistent trend. However, compared to all petition types, I-360 VAWA petitions had a lower average approval rate of 74%. Petitions that raised concerns were often assessed with requests for evidence. Despite the significant increase in petition volume, the rates at which petitions were reviewed or approved did not show a clear trend. Despite a fourfold increase in volume, the rates of reviewing or approving petitions did not show a clear trend. I-360 VAWA petitions had the highest proportion of requests for additional information, with an average rate of 68%. Requests for evidence do not measure fraud but reflect USCIS's need for more evidence before adjudicating a petition. Legislation in the 113th Congress continued VAWA programs, following actions from the 112th Congress. H.R. 4970 differed from S. 1925 in immigration provisions, with more restrictions to curb fraud and maintaining U visa limit at 10,000. Negotiations between chambers stalled, and neither bill passed. Rep. Gwen Moore introduced H.R. 11, while Sen. Patrick Leahy introduced S. 47, both titled Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2013. The Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2013, also known as S. 47, was passed by the Senate on February 12, 2013, and by the House on February 28, 2013. President Obama signed the bill into law on March 3, 2013. The act includes provisions related to immigration, such as maintaining the annual U visa limit at 10,000, adding \"stalking\" to the list of criminal activities covered under the U visa, and extending VAWA coverage to derivative children. It also requires DHS to report data on U visa and VAWA petitioners and processing times. The Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2013, P.L. 113-4, provides protections for foreign nationals under family-based provisions of the INA. It exempts VAWA self-petitioners, U visa petitioners, and battered foreign nationals from being classified as inadmissible for LPR status due to financial concerns. The act also protects U visa petitioners under age 21 and derivative children from aging out of eligibility, allows conditional LPRs in bigamous marriages to obtain hardship waivers, and requires extensive background checks for U.S. citizens petitioning for alien fianc\u00e9s. The Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2013, P.L. 113-4, imposes restrictions on international marriage brokers, prohibiting marketing information about foreign nationals under 18. It allows federal judges and the Department of Justice to penalize violations and fraudulent representations made by U.S. clients to foreign nationals. The Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2013, P.L. 113-4, mandates DOJ to determine responsibility for prosecuting violations of the International Marriage Broker Act of 2005. It also requires consultation with DHS and DOS for investigating and prosecuting violations. Additionally, the Comptroller General must conduct a study on the impact of IMBRA provisions and K nonimmigrant fianc\u00e9 visas within two years of enactment. The study will analyze international marriage broker-facilitated marriages and compliance with related provisions of the INA, including data on persons with a history of violence. The Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2013, P.L. 113-4, mandates a study to assess the accuracy of information provided by individuals with a history of violence using the K nonimmigrant visa process or international marriage brokers. It also extends VAWA protections to foreign nationals in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands and allows DHS to share VAWA petition information for national security purposes. The Senate approved a comprehensive immigration reform bill, S. 744, which includes VAWA-related provisions such as expanding U visas for victims, granting aging-out protection and work authorization to derivative children, allowing adjustment of status without family-based immigration limits, and providing access to assisted housing for battered immigrants. Issues surrounding VAWA immigration provisions involve balancing benefits with enforcement to prevent fraud and protect abused foreign nationals. Advocates seek changes to VAWA for expanded protection and an independent path to LPR status, while others warn of potential fraud undermining Congress's intent. P.L. 113-4 and S. 744 address some issues but not all, with debates ongoing on expanding eligibility and protections under VAWA. Advocates seek to expand VAWA eligibility for foreign nationals, including increasing U visas and law enforcement certifications. Opponents argue against VAWA serving as a form of asylum for noncitizens in abusive relationships. There are debates on extending conditional permanent residence status beyond two years to clarify marriage validity. P.L. 113-4 expands VAWA eligibility by including \"stalking\" in U visa coverage, extending benefits to derivative children, protecting U visa petitioners under 21 from aging out, and expanding protections to conditional LPRs. P.L. 113-4 expands VAWA protections by providing alien fianc\u00e9s with more information about potential abusers, imposing regulations on international marriage brokers, and allowing conditional LPRs in bigamous marriages to obtain hardship waivers. The annual number of U visas remains at 10,000. The VAWA expansion under P.L. 113-4 includes regulations on international marriage brokers, restrictions on marketing to minors, and analysis of past abusers using the K nonimmigrant visa process. The VAWA allows abused spouses, children, and parents of U.S. citizens and LPRs to petition for legal status independently. Approved petitioners can apply for deferred action, work authorization, and lawful permanent residence. However, advocates argue that the stringent requirements sometimes deter qualified applicants and prevent legitimate cases from being approved. Advocates have concerns about burdensome requirements for demonstrating good moral character in VAWA cases, especially for self-petitioners with past actions related to domestic violence. They argue that these requirements are unnecessary and cause delays in implementation by USCIS. The 2000 VAWA reauthorization included provisions for abused spouses of certain nonimmigrant visa holders to apply for work authorization, which has not been implemented. P.L. 113-4 includes reporting requirements for DHS on T, U, and VAWA petitioners, processing times, and efforts to reduce adjudication times. Advocates emphasize economic assistance for abused noncitizens, proposing accelerated processing for VAWA and U visa applications or established waiting times for work authorization. P.L. 113-4 addresses financial challenges faced by abused foreign nationals by exempting them from being classified as inadmissible for LPR status due to financial concerns. Reports suggest some foreign nationals may be using VAWA provisions for immigration marriage fraud and financial fraud on former spouses, but the extent of fraudulent cases is unknown. Despite media attention on immigration marriage fraud, reliable estimates on the number of spouses gaining LPR status fraudulently are scarce. Reasons for denial of lawful permanent residence status include entering the US without inspection or overstaying visas, as well as USCIS finding marriages not credible. Face-to-face interviews with USCIS may help detect fraudulent marriages. Some argue that VAWA provisions may encourage immigration fraud by allowing \"any credible evidence\" to establish spousal abuse, potentially leading to false claims of abuse to obtain immigration benefits. ICE is responsible for prosecuting immigration fraud but has prosecuted relatively few cases. The responsibility for prosecuting immigration fraud lies with ICE, which has handled few cases. Immigration marriage fraud may be linked to administrative issues at the Vermont Service Center (VSC), which processes VAWA petitions without face-to-face interviews. USCIS maintains that their standard procedures limit fraud by considering all evidence in the alien's file and interactions with USCIS, ICE, and CBP. Some immigration attorneys have raised concerns about potential fraud in VAWA petitions due to stringent evidence requirements and influence from USCIS District Offices. VAWA involves two USCIS petitions, the first requiring evidence of abuse, a genuine marriage, and good moral character. Approved VAWA petitions grant deferred action status, not LPR status. The second VAWA petition requires the self-petitioner to prove admissibility and undergo a face-to-face interview with a USCIS adjudicator. The final determination for adjustment of status cannot happen without this interview, regardless of current marital circumstances. Immigration attorneys believe that the VSC considers all grounds of inadmissibility, including previously denied petitions, when making a decision on deferred action status for VAWA self-petitioners. Immigration fraud via VAWA provisions involves fabricating evidence of abuse to obtain deferred action status. USCIS faces challenges in detecting and preventing such fraud, with face-to-face interviews being a critical protection. P.L. 113-4 does not directly address immigration fraud but allows DHS to share VAWA petition information. The USCIS faces challenges in detecting and preventing immigration fraud related to VAWA provisions. P.L. 113-4 allows DHS to share VAWA petition information for national security purposes, but concerns remain about USCIS's policies and procedures for adjudicating VAWA and U visa petitions and preventing fraud. The Vermont Service Center and Congress may be interested in how federal agencies complement USCIS enforcement functions, such as ICE investigating immigration fraud. Congress has enacted provisions to provide relief to abused noncitizen relatives, with the Violence Against Women Act of 1994 being a milestone in this legislative history. The Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) has been reauthorized multiple times, expanding protections for abused foreign nationals. The 2000 reauthorization extended benefits to victims of various crimes, including domestic violence. In 2005, additional protections were added for abused children and parents, allowing victims to apply for work authorization. The 2013 reauthorization included \"stalking\" in the criminal activity definition for U visas, extended coverage to derivative-status children, and provided waivers for disadvantaged VAWA petitioners facing inadmissibility. The 2013 reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) included protections for inadmissible immigrants due to financial hardship, children aging out of U visa petitions, victims of bigamous marriages, and foreign nationals under 18. It also required more extensive background checks for U.S. citizen petitioners of alien fianc\u00e9s, imposed harsher penalties for VAWA violations, and allowed DHS to share VAWA information for national security purposes. The goal of immigration policy is not only to provide relief to vulnerable populations but also to prevent fraud and deter illegal immigration. Anecdotal evidence suggests that marriage fraud and VAWA fraud remain prevalent issues. Anecdotal evidence indicates ongoing concerns about fraud in VAWA petitions, with a significant increase in filings from 1997 to 2011. Despite various factors influencing petition volume, denial rates remained relatively high. USCIS issued more Requests for Evidence for VAWA petitions compared to other applications. Making and implementing immigration policy for noncitizen victims of domestic violence involves balancing different goals and providing relief while preventing abuse of the system. Family reunification is a key aspect of U.S. immigration policy, granting lawful permanent residence to foreign national spouses of U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents. INA provisions emphasize the importance of being related to a U.S. citizen or LPR when seeking permanent residency. The first step is obtaining immigration preference status through petitions. After obtaining immigration preference status through petitions, relatives of lawful permanent residents must wait for the State Department to assign them an immigrant visa number. Spouses and children of LPRs are subject to visa allocation limits, while spouses and children of U.S. citizens are not. Foreign nationals subject to numerical immigration limits can receive a visa number once their petitions are approved. They may be eligible to adjust to LPR status in the US or apply for an immigrant visa at a consulate abroad. Admissibility to the US is required, and various factors can make a foreign national inadmissible. Noncitizen women married to U.S. citizens or LPRs may face increased risk of spousal abuse due to factors like poor English skills, unemployment, poverty, crowded living conditions, and economic dependence on their spouse. Remaining married is crucial for foreign national spouses seeking to adjust their immigration status, discouraging them from leaving abusive marriages. Congress has aimed to protect foreign nationals from abuse while preventing fraudulent marriages for immigration benefits. The Immigration Fraud Amendments (1986) aimed to address concerns about immigration-related marriage fraud by establishing a two-year conditional permanent residence status for foreign national spouses and children who obtained permanent residence through a new marriage with a U.S. citizen or LPR. This provision allowed time for the former INS (now DHS) to determine the legitimacy of the marriage. The Immigration Fraud Amendments (1986) established a two-year conditional permanent residence status for foreign national spouses and children to prevent marriage fraud. However, this requirement created unintended consequences for noncitizen victims of domestic violence, increasing the power of abusers and making it difficult for battered women to leave their abusive spouses. The Immigration Act of 1990 addressed issues faced by noncitizen victims of domestic violence by establishing a new battered spouse or child waiver, allowing them to obtain legal status without the joint petition requirement. The Immigration Act of 1990 (P.L. 101-649) established a new battered spouse or child waiver for foreign nationals who were victims of domestic violence by their U.S. citizen or LPR spouse or parent. The waiver required demonstrating good faith marriage, abuse, and lack of fault for not meeting joint petition requirement. Congressional intent was to prevent victims from being trapped in abusive relationships due to immigration status threats. The 1990 Immigration Act established a waiver for battered foreign nationals, requiring evidence of abuse and good faith marriage. Requests for waivers should only be denied in rare cases where the foreign national poses a significant detriment to national interest. Additional provisions were added to protect the confidentiality of abused spouses and children, and the requirement for terminating the marriage was eliminated for battered foreign nationals. The 1990 Immigration Act established a waiver for battered foreign nationals, allowing them to apply for the waiver regardless of who terminated the marriage and for what reason. The House Judiciary Committee report justified the changes by highlighting obstacles that prevent battered alien spouses from initiating divorce. In May 1991, the former INS issued an interim rule to implement the battered spouse or child waiver provisions. The INS rule allows battered conditional residents to establish eligibility for a waiver, preventing misuse of the benefit by defining terms like \"battered\" and \"extreme cruelty\" to include acts of violence, psychological abuse, and sexual exploitation. The INS rule defined acts of violence, including rape, molestation, incest (if the victim is a minor), or forced prostitution, as forms of extreme cruelty. Waiver applications based on physical abuse required evidence from various professionals, while those based on mental cruelty needed evaluation from licensed clinical professionals due to the difficulty in observing and identifying emotional abuse effects. Advocates criticized the INS evidentiary requirement for extreme cruelty, stating that few abused foreign nationals could afford mental evaluations. They argued that the focus on the applicant's mental state misunderstood abuse and hindered congressional intent for the battered spouse waiver. The Violence Against Women Act of 1994 included provisions for abused aliens, allowing them to self-petition for lawful status, clarify evidence requirements for joint petition waivers, and establish protections against deportation. Critics argued that the high standard of proof required for demonstrating abuse was contrary to congressional intent for the battered spouse waiver. Prior to 1994, family-based petitions for immigration preference status for battered noncitizens had to be filed by their U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident relatives. Abusers were less likely to petition for their noncitizen spouses and children, making it difficult for victims to seek relief due to fear of deportation or lack of knowledge about available services. Noncitizen victims of domestic violence were not eligible to apply for a battered spouse or child waiver of the joint petition requirement for conditional residents. VAWA Section 40701 allowed battered foreign national spouses (and their children) married to U.S. citizens or LPRs to self-petition for lawful permanent resident status independently. Self-petitioners had to meet certain criteria, including being married to a U.S. citizen or LPR, having good moral character, residing in the U.S. with their spouse, and entering into the marriage in good faith. The purpose was to prevent abuse and control by the sponsoring petitioner. VAWA Section 40701 allowed battered foreign national spouses (and their children) married to U.S. citizens or LPRs to self-petition for lawful permanent resident status independently. The criteria included being married in good faith, residing in the U.S., and demonstrating extreme hardship if removed. The Attorney General had sole discretion in determining credibility and weighing evidence for these petitions. In March 1996, INS published an interim rule detailing eligibility requirements for self-petitioning battered spouses and children. VAWA Section 40702 amended joint petition waiver provisions to consider any credible evidence relevant to the application, granting the Attorney General sole discretion. The credible evidence language applied to all joint petition waivers. Section 40703 established provisions for battered foreign national spouses and children to suspend deportation and obtain lawful permanent residence. The VAWA reduced the continuous residency requirement for deportation from seven years to three years. The IIRIRA of 1996 replaced \"suspension of deportation\" with \"cancellation of removal\" and introduced a special cancellation of removal rule for battered spouses or children. Prior to the Battered Immigrant Women Protection Act of 2000, applicants had to show they were abused in the US by a citizen or LPR spouse or parent to qualify for cancellation of removal. The cancellation of removal eligibility criteria included being physically present in the US for at least three years, demonstrating good moral character, not being inadmissible or deportable on certain grounds, and showing extreme hardship if removed. Approved applicants could adjust to LPR status immediately. The 1996 IIRIRA created barriers for abused spouses petitioning to remain in the US by imposing different eligibility requirements for cancellation of removal and self-petitioning for battered foreign national spouses. Battered foreign nationals applying for cancellation of removal could not include their children in their petitions, and eligibility for both procedures differed. The Violence Against Women Act of 2000 (VAWA 2000) addressed provisions related to foreign nationals, establishing special rules for noncitizen victims of domestic violence and creating the U visa for foreign national crime victims who assisted law enforcement. It aimed to prevent violence, provide economic security, and safety for battered foreign national women. The BIWPA included provisions for battered foreign national spouses. The U visa was created for foreign national victims of qualifying crimes to assist law enforcement. Successful U visa petitioners could become temporary nonimmigrants for up to four years and potentially adjust to LPR status after three years. The BIWPA created exemptions for battered foreign nationals facing removal proceedings, including waivers for continuous physical presence requirements and good moral character evaluations for certain domestic violence-related crimes. The BIWPA granted parole and allowed adjustment of legal status for foreign nationals connected to domestic violence crimes. It extended cancellation of removal to intended spouses and allowed battered spouses to include children in their applications. The BIWPA expanded VAWA self-petition eligibility to include \"intended spouses,\" former spouses, adult sons and daughters, and parents, allowing them to adjust to LPR status. It also addressed the aging out of abused children and extended coverage to foreign national spouses and children of U.S. citizens and LPRs affected by domestic violence. The BIWPA expanded VAWA self-petition eligibility to include various categories such as intended spouses, former spouses, adult sons and daughters, and parents. It introduced protections for battered self-petitioners whose abusers' citizenship or immigration status changed after filing petitions, eliminating previous requirements such as demonstrating extreme hardship or residing in the United States. BIWPA allowed children of U.S. citizens or LPRs to be petitioners for preference status, as unmarried or married sons or daughters, with the same priority date as the self-petitioner. It also provided inadmissibility waivers and exceptions for battered aliens, excluding benefits received as a result of the 1996 IIRIRA. The Attorney General could waive specified inadmissibility grounds for battered foreign nationals for humanitarian purposes or family unity. BIWPA amended provisions related to inadmissibility grounds for battered foreign nationals and children qualifying for immigration preference or cancellation of removal. It eliminated the requirement to show a connection between the battery/cruelty and unlawful entry/visa overstay. BIWPA also addressed unintended consequences of IIRIRA by allowing waivers for domestic violence-related convictions. The Violence Against Women and Department of Justice Reauthorization Act of 2005 (VAWA 2005) expanded protections for children by adding provisions to VAWA 2000 and extending aging out protections in the Child Status Protection Act for abused children and children of abused foreign national spouses. It also allowed discretionary relief for victims of domestic violence who may have committed violent acts in self-defense. The Violence Against Women and Department of Justice Reauthorization Act of 2005 (VAWA 2005) expanded protections for abused children and children of abused foreign national spouses. It removed custody and residence requirements for abused adopted children, expanded eligibility for self-petitioning to foreign nationals abused by their U.S. citizen sons and daughters, and allowed abused spouses of certain nonimmigrants to apply for work authorization. Additionally, VAWA 2005 included provisions to reduce immigration fraud by prohibiting VAWA self-petitioners or U visa foreign nationals from petitioning for their abusers' immigrant status or nonimmigrant admission. The legislation under the Violence Against Women and Department of Justice Reauthorization Act of 2005 included provisions for international marriage brokers, requiring disclosure of their involvement in relationships, background checks, and consent for sharing personal information. The U visa was created by Congress as part of the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000 to protect and assist victims of qualifying crimes who assist law enforcement. Foreign nationals who suffered abuse from a crime violating U.S. laws and have information about the crime can apply for the U visa if they are helpful in the investigation or prosecution of the crime. The U visa is available to foreign national victims of crimes that occurred in the United States or violated U.S. law. The number of U visas is capped at 10,000 per fiscal year, and applicants must provide certification from a U.S. law enforcement agency to demonstrate their assistance in the investigation or prosecution of the crime. Foreign national victims apply for a U visa using Form I-918 and supporting documentation, which undergo a de novo review by USCIS. Successful U visa petitioners receive temporary nonimmigrant status for up to four years. Denied applicants can appeal the decision and are not subject to removal unless they pose security threats or have serious immigration violations. Holders of U visas can apply for LPR status after living continuously in the U.S. for three years. U visa holders can adjust to LPR status after living in the U.S. for at least three years, meeting certain criteria. Family members of U visa holders may also be eligible for LPR status. The number of U visas processed has significantly increased from FY2009 to FY2012."
