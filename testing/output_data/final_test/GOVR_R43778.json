    "content": "Medicaid is a federal-state program that pays for healthcare for low-income individuals. States have the option to participate and can choose which groups and services to cover. Prescription drugs are optional but outpatient drugs are covered by all states. Federal rules ensure comprehensive coverage, even for those in Medicaid managed care plans. Since 1990, pharmaceutical manufacturers participating in Medicaid must rebate a portion of drug payments back to states, ensuring comprehensive coverage for beneficiaries. States share these rebates with the federal government, helping Medicaid programs receive manufacturers' lowest prices. Starting in 2010, manufacturers also had to pay rebates for drugs provided to Medicaid beneficiaries in managed care. Medicaid distinguishes between single source and innovator multiple source drugs for rebate purposes. Medicaid requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to provide rebates for drugs, with distinctions made between single source/innovator multiple source drugs and non-innovator multiple source drugs. Rebates for patented drugs include a basic rebate and an additional rebate based on price differences or inflation. Non-patented drugs have a flat percentage rebate. States also negotiate supplemental rebates with manufacturers. State Medicaid agencies reimburse retail pharmacies for outpatient prescription drugs dispensed to Medicaid beneficiaries. Payments to pharmacies have two components: one for the cost of the drug and another for the pharmacist's services. States set reimbursement amounts for both components, with dispensing fees covering various services and ingredient costs approximating a drug's market price. The federal law requires CMS to set maximum payments for multiple source drug ingredients to encourage substitution of lower-cost generic drugs. Medicaid FFS outpatient prescription drug expenditures were $16.2 billion in FY2013, down from $30.7 billion in FY2005. However, this decrease does not reflect an overall decrease in Medicaid prescription drug expenditures due to industry trends and statutory changes shifting expenses to other accounts. Beginning January 1, 2006, prescription drug coverage for disabled and elderly Medicaid beneficiaries was shifted from Medicaid to Medicare Part D, resulting in a decrease in Medicaid drug expenditures. States were required to continue paying the majority of dual eligible drug costs. The movement of Medicaid beneficiary drug coverage from fee-for-service to managed care contracts also contributed to the decline in drug expenditures. Managed care rebates grew, reaching $932 million in FY2011. In FY2011, states collected $932 million in managed care rebates, increasing to $4.7 billion in FY2013. The number of FFS drug claims decreased by almost 25% between FY2011-FY2012. Statutory changes and industry trends contributed to the decline in FFS drug expenditures, with states collecting a total of $17.2 billion in rebates in FY2013. The drug industry patent cliff reduced Medicaid FFS drug costs as blockbuster drugs became available as cheaper generics. Average per-person Medicaid prescription drug expenditures decreased from $1,509 in FY2005 to just over $926 in FY2013. Medicaid paid approximately $282 for single source prescription drug claims, $149 for innovator multiple source claims, and $18 for non-innovator multiple source drug claims in FY2012. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act made modifications to federal Medicaid law. In February 2012, a proposed rule provided guidance on implementing ACA changes. A final rule on new Medicaid drug requirements is pending. Sovaldi, a new drug for HCV, costs $1,000 per pill with total treatment costs ranging from $84,000 to $168,000. Medicaid covers many HCV patients, raising concerns due to Sovaldi's high price. Rebates will help reduce costs, but competition is needed for leverage. Medicaid's drug pricing policies aim to control costs by leveraging rebates and competition. Congress has established regulations to ensure Medicaid receives the lowest prescription drug prices. However, the movement of Medicaid enrollees to managed care with drug benefits may impact these efforts. If the pace of Medicaid enrollees moving to managed care with prescription drug benefits continues, oversight of prescription drug pricing may become more challenging. States may struggle to align rebates with managed care plan negotiations, as the current infrastructure was designed for fee-for-service. States delegate drug utilization review and claim oversight to managed care plans, raising concerns about monitoring and ensuring contract obligations are met. Monitoring of managed care claims is uncertain, as states' systems are tailored to fee-for-service claims. Medicaid drug pricing and policy is complex due to dynamic prescription drug markets. Drug manufacturers and wholesalers adapt to policy changes, creating new products and marketing approaches that may circumvent pricing rules. Medicaid pricing policies are based on competitive market transactions, but oversight of managed care claims may be challenging for states. In 2010, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that single source Medicaid drug rebates averaged approximately 57% of manufacturers' average prices. Medicaid beneficiaries receive drugs at retail pharmacies, with states bearing most of the cost and receiving discounts from manufacturers in the form of rebate payments. Since 2006, states and the federal government have seen a decrease in drug spending for Medicaid beneficiaries in fee-for-service (FFS) programs, while rebate collections have increased. The focus is on FFS prescription drug pricing and policy, with FFS drug spending accounting for the majority of Medicaid drug purchases in 2010. Medicaid managed care contracts with drug coverage have grown rapidly since then, but data on their expenditures are not as readily available as for FFS spending. The report includes Medicaid drug expenditure data, with a focus on fee-for-service (FFS) drug spending. Managed care prescription drug spending and utilization are mentioned but are generally outside the report's scope. The data presented is nominal and not adjusted for inflation, with plans for revisions as new information becomes available. Abbreviated Medicaid drug pricing terms are listed in Table 1, along with references to public laws in Table 2 and a glossary of terms in Appendix E. Table E-1 in Appendix E provides a glossary of selected Medicaid drug terms. Medicaid is a federal-state program that covers medical services for low-income individuals. In FY2013, federal expenditures for Medicaid benefits and administration were around $262 billion, with state expenditures adding an additional $192 billion, totaling approximately $454 billion. State Medicaid programs are administered by states under federal guidelines, with all states required to provide benefits to low-income individuals and may cover additional services. States have the option to cover other individuals and services beyond the basic requirements. Medicaid is a federal-state program that covers medical services for low-income individuals. States must cover basic services and can also cover additional services, setting provider payment rates subject to limitations and federal approval. There is variation in coverage across states, with some programs more generous than others. Medicaid is means-tested, with income and resources needing to meet program standards. Most enrollees have incomes below the federal poverty level. Until recently, Medicaid was primarily available to specific categories, but some exceptions exist. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) expanded Medicaid coverage to single adults up to age 65 with incomes not exceeding 133% of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL). Medicaid eligibility groups were historically categorized as the categorically needy and the medically needy, with the former receiving cash assistance payments. In 2009, 33 states covered medically needy individuals who accounted for 5% of national Medicaid enrollment and 11% of Medicaid expenditures. The distinction between categorically and medically needy eligibility became less useful over time, but it is still relevant for determining certain benefits. Most benefits are mandatory only for categorically needy individuals. States must cover benefits for categorically needy individuals, while they are optional for medically needy individuals. Optional benefits, such as outpatient prescription drugs, may be provided to either group. Coverage of outpatient prescription drugs is optional for state Medicaid programs, with most states covering them as a lower-cost alternative to other medical care. Medicaid prescription drug coverage is broad, encompassing most prescription drugs and many non-prescription drugs. States can use formularies to direct beneficiaries to lower-cost drugs, but health care providers can request medically necessary drugs not on the formulary. Managed care plans may have their own formularies but must provide a process for prescribing non-formulary drugs. Medicaid formularies allow states to establish lists of preferred drugs for beneficiaries, but providers can request non-formulary drugs deemed medically necessary. Medicaid formularies are less restrictive than closed formularies in private insurance, as states must cover requested non-formulary drugs through a prior authorization process. States must cover all drugs from manufacturers with rebate agreements, allowing formulary exclusions with explanations. Medicaid law permits states to exclude certain drugs, classes, or uses while still receiving federal funding. Additionally, states must cover three additional drugs or classes as required by federal law. Federal Medicaid law requires states to cover three additional drugs or drug classes. Many Medicaid managed care arrangements use primary care case management (PCCM) and limited-risk contracts. Providers are paid a fixed fee to manage patients' care. Prescription drug benefits are typically delivered and reimbursed as fee-for-service (FFS) benefits. Managed care plans may have exceptions from FFS drug coverage rules. Medicaid programs cover drugs and services through managed care contracts, including mental health and long-term care services. Since 2010, states have increasingly allowed managed care plans to use their own formularies for prescription drug coverage, even though federal Medicaid law requires coverage of certain drugs. Managed care contracts may include drug benefits, with some states carving them in and others carving them out. States can delegate formulary decisions to managed care plans, but plans must still provide access to all Medicaid covered drugs. Medicaid managed care plans must provide access to all Medicaid covered drugs, similar to FFS Medicaid. In 2011, Medicaid managed care enrollment was over 70%, but only accounted for about 25% of benefit expenditures, including drug expenditures. Comprehensive risk-based managed care contracts in 2011 accounted for about 50% of enrollment but constituted slightly less than 24% of benefit expenditures. Managed care was estimated to account for about 10% of Medicaid benefit expenditures. In 2010, managed care accounted for 10% of Medicaid prescription drug expenditures, increasing to 50% in 2013. State Medicaid programs cover various OTC drugs, with coverage limitations and restrictions. Medicaid agencies reimburse retail pharmacies for covered drugs dispensed to beneficiaries, not purchasing directly from manufacturers. The section discusses FFS Medicaid pharmacy reimbursement issues, including payments for ingredient costs and dispensing fees. States set reimbursement amounts for both components, with the ingredient cost approximating the drug's market price. Dispensing fees cover drug procurement and storage costs. States have flexibility in setting pharmacy payments but are subject to federal limitations to promote lower-cost drug substitution. The law requires the Secretary to establish a maximum payment amount for the federal share of certain multiple source drug ingredient costs\u2014the federal upper limit (FUL). The FUL program limits the federal share of Medicaid reimbursement for certain multiple source drugs to ensure prudent buying practices. Medicaid includes innovator and non-innovator multiple source drugs, with innovator drugs losing patent protection. CMS must set an appropriate reimbursement amount for these drugs. The FUL program sets maximum payment amounts for Medicaid reimbursement of multiple source drugs to ensure prudent buying practices. States must also set upper limits for certain drugs. FULs are applied in aggregate to state spending for drugs subject to limits, not to individual prescription claims. The FUL aggregate is determined by multiplying the FUL by the number of units dispensed for each drug and summing those amounts. This total represents the maximum amount eligible for federal matching funds. The FUL program sets maximum payment amounts for Medicaid reimbursement of multiple source drugs to ensure prudent buying practices. Drugs subject to FULs are those rated by the FDA as having three or more therapeutically and pharmaceutically equivalent products. CMS calculates maximum payment amounts by applying a percentage adjustment to the average manufacturer price (AMP) of the least costly therapeutic equivalent. The FUL percentage was decreased under an ACA provision from 250% of AMP to at least 175% of AMP. Drug manufacturers must report AMP, defined as the average price paid to the manufacturer by wholesalers for drugs distributed to retail community pharmacies. CMS has calculated draft FULs using the current law methodology since September 2011 but has not implemented the ACA FUL policy, so current FULs are based on 2009 prices. CMS announced in November 2013 that it would implement the ACA FUL policy on July 1, 2014, but later delayed its implementation without specifying the length of the delay. Federal Medicaid law also sets upper limits for other drugs, including brand-name drugs that were certified. The FUL for other drugs is determined by the actual acquisition cost (AAC) plus a professional dispensing fee established by the state Medicaid agency or the pharmacies' usual and customary charges. States have flexibility in setting the payment for other drugs as long as it meets certain criteria. States have flexibility in determining the estimated acquisition cost (EAC) for drugs, often using average wholesale price (AWP) or wholesale acquisition cost (WAC) from industry compendia. These prices are not based on actual sales transactions and are subject to manufacturers' decisions. AWP is typically a price for wholesalers to charge retailers. States have the flexibility to set reimbursement amounts for drugs through MAC programs, which can result in additional savings by setting lower prices for multiple source drugs compared to FUL prices. CMS identified 45 states with MACs in June 2014, and states are not required to use FULs as the basis for reimbursing pharmacies for outpatient drugs dispensed to Medicaid beneficiaries. Federal rules only require that drug prices do not exceed FULs to ensure federal matching funds are not used. States have the flexibility to set reimbursement amounts for drugs through MAC programs, which can result in additional savings by setting lower prices for multiple source drugs compared to FUL prices. Payment methodologies are approved by CMS through the state plan amendment (SPA) process, with states estimating current market prices using benchmarks to approximate pharmacies' acquisition costs. AWP was historically used as the primary drug pricing benchmark by state Medicaid. There has been disagreement on setting Medicaid multisource drug ingredient reimbursement since statutory changes in DRA. In FY2009, state Medicaid pharmacy directors suggested developing a single national pricing benchmark based on average drug ingredient acquisition costs for better estimates. The Medicaid pharmacy directors argued for better accuracy and transparency in drug pricing by using actual drug purchases to determine costs. They requested a national pricing benchmark to replace artificially inflated AWPs, which led to Medicaid overpayments. The Secretary is required to disclose pricing data reported by manufacturers monthly to help states determine reimbursement costs. The DRA allowed the Secretary to conduct a retail price survey and disclose results to states and the public. CMS started a NADAC survey to identify RCP drug acquisition costs. State Medicaid directors updated on AAC use in setting reimbursement rates, with seven states using an ACC-based rate in 2014. States are transitioning to AAC-based methodologies for Medicaid drug reimbursement, with increased dispensing fees to offset lower ingredient payments to pharmacies. States have discretion to adjust published prices based on drug categories, such as generic versus brand, physician-administered, and blood clotting factors. Dispensing fees are determined by states and must be \"reasonable.\" Dispensing fees for Medicaid drug reimbursement vary by state and can range from $1.00 to $10.00 per prescription. Factors such as pharmacy location, type, and prescription volume can influence the fee amount. States may set higher fees to offset pharmacy costs and encourage generic substitution. In 1990, Congress amended the Social Security Act to add the Medicaid Drug Rebate program, requiring drug manufacturers to provide rebates on drugs purchased for Medicaid beneficiaries to ensure the lowest price. Rebates are exempt for drugs provided in certain settings like hospitals and physicians' offices. In 2014, CMS reported around 610 drug manufacturers participating in the Medicaid drug rebate program, with rebates totaling approximately $12.4 billion in FY2013. Rebates are shared between states and the federal government based on the state federal medical assistance percentage (FMAP). Drug manufacturers calculate quarterly rebate amounts using utilization data provided by states. The Medicaid drug rebate program involves manufacturers providing rebates based on utilization data from states. Federal law distinguishes between single source and multiple source drugs for rebate purposes, with additional categories added by the ACA. These include line extensions, clotting factors, and pediatric drugs, each with different rebate formulas. The Medicaid drug rebate program requires manufacturers to pay rebates for different drug types, including single source and innovator multiple source drugs. The basic rebate is determined by comparing a drug's per unit AMP to its best price, with an increased specified percentage of AMP under the ACA. Additional rebates are owed if a drug's price rises faster than inflation, calculated based on the difference between quarterly reported AMP and inflation-adjusted base period AMP. The Medicaid drug rebate program requires manufacturers to pay rebates for different drug types. The total rebate is determined by multiplying the unit rebate amount by the number of units purchased. For line extension products, any version of the original product's base AMP can be used to calculate the rebate. Single source and innovator multiple source drugs use 17.1% to determine the basic rebate amount. Manufacturers' total rebate obligation is limited for each dosage form and strength. The Medicaid drug rebate program requires manufacturers to pay rebates for different drug types. Rebates for non-innovator multiple source drugs are 13% of the drug's AMP. States negotiate supplemental rebate agreements with drug manufacturers, with 45 states participating in Medicaid outpatient drug SRAs. States can participate in multi-state purchasing pools to negotiate greater rebates for Medicaid drugs. Some states also have intra-state pools for drug price negotiations. States must submit SPAs to CMS for SRA arrangements. Before the ACA, drug manufacturers didn't pay rebates for drugs bought by managed care plans for Medicaid beneficiaries. States excluded drug benefits from capitation agreements to collect rebates for managed care beneficiaries. Since the implementation of the ACA in 2010, prescription drug manufacturers are required to pay rebates on drugs provided to Medicaid beneficiaries in managed care plans. States have incorporated drug benefits into managed care contracts, leading to increased Medicaid managed care rebates. In FY2013, total Medicaid FFS outpatient prescription drug expenditures were approximately $19.8 billion before rebates, with states collecting around $12.4 billion in rebates. In FY2013, states collected $12.4 billion in FFS drug rebates from manufacturers, including $726 million in supplemental rebates. Net Medicaid drug expenditures were approximately $7.4 billion after all rebates. The ACA increased rebate percentages and extended rebate obligations to line extensions, with retroactive changes to January 1, 2010. Implementation of ACA rebate changes may have caused delays in reporting. Additionally, states were authorized to collect rebates on drugs for full-risk Medicaid managed care beneficiaries starting in 2010, potentially leading to delays in rebate collection. In FY2013, states collected $726 million in supplemental FFS rebates, with California accounting for 23% of the total. Medicaid FFS drug expenditures have decreased since FY2006 due to policy changes shifting drug spending to Medicare and managed care plans. This section discusses recent Medicaid FFS drug expenditures and patterns. In FY2013, total FFS outpatient prescription drug expenditures for Medicaid were about $16.2 billion, accounting for less than 4% of benefit expenditures. The variation in prescription drug expenditures was influenced by factors such as patent expiration and increasing managed care enrollment. The Medicaid FFS outpatient prescription drug expenditures decreased significantly after amendments to Medicaid drug law, with a notable drop in 2006 when dual eligible drug expenditures shifted to Medicare Part D. This led to a reduction in drug expenditures from approximately $30.7 billion in 2005 to $23.1 billion in 2006. In 2010, adjusted Medicaid drug expenditures decreased to $19.7 billion due to fiscal relief provided to states through ARRA's temporary FMAP increase. This led to a decline in state drug expenditures, shifting prescription drug costs from state and federal Medicaid matching funds to federal economic recovery funding. Net FFS drug expenditures in FY2011 returned to the FY2009 level after deducting rebates and factoring in the PSC amount for dual eligible drug expenditures. In FY2011, Medicaid drug expenditures increased to $23.1 billion from $19.7 billion in FY2010, likely due to reporting delays of ACA rebate increases. However, in FY2012 and FY2013, drug expenditures decreased to about $18.4 billion and $16.2 billion, respectively, partly due to ACA rebate increases and Medicaid beneficiaries moving to managed care coverage. These changes did not reduce prescription drug expenditures but shifted drug costs. In FY2011, Medicaid drug expenditures increased to $23.1 billion from $19.7 billion in FY2010, likely due to reporting delays of ACA rebate increases. However, in FY2012 and FY2013, drug expenditures decreased to about $18.4 billion and $16.2 billion, partly due to ACA rebate increases and Medicaid beneficiaries moving to managed care coverage. These changes did not reduce prescription drug expenditures but shifted drug costs. Looking at state Medicaid drug utilization reports, estimated total Medicaid expenditures for FFS and managed care were higher and consistent with historic drug spending patterns. Medicaid drug expenditures for both managed care and FFS appear to be close to their historic levels, with a decline between FY2012 and FY2013 in similar ways for both managed care and FFS drug spending. The decrease could be attributable to different data sources, reporting lags, and the patent cliff. Additional data from Medicaid financial reports can provide insight into how Medicaid FFS drug expenditures have changed over time. The net FFS drug expenditure data can be estimated by aggregating drug expenditures and rebates, adjusting for Medicaid drug expenditures moved to Medicare Part D. Comparing data from FY2012 and FY2013 shows a decrease in FFS drug spending primarily due to lower prescription drug expenditures, not increased rebate collections. Medicaid FFS drug expenditures in FY2012 and FY2013 decreased by 20% and 12% respectively, possibly due to factors like Medicaid managed care enrollment growth. Total Medicaid FFS drug rebate collections also decreased in the same period. The drug expenditure patterns among major Medicaid eligibility groups in FY2005 and FY2010 show changes in drug utilization, with more spending on children and adults and less on the elderly and disabled groups. This shift may be attributed to the movement of drug coverage for dual eligible beneficiaries from Medicaid to Medicare Part D. In FY2005, 71% of elderly Medicaid beneficiaries had drug expenditures averaging $2,943 annually. By FY2010, this decreased to 45% with average payments of $451, mainly due to the shift of drug coverage for dual eligibles to Medicare Part D. In FY2005, costs for dual eligibles were shifted to Medicare Part D, with states still paying the majority of these costs. Table 11 shows that children had the lowest average spending, while blind or disabled enrollees had the highest. Average spending for blind or disabled enrollees decreased from $3,793 in FY2005 to $2,692 in FY2010. For children, average annual spending on drugs increased from $323 in FY2005 to $379 in FY2010. These data provide insight into FFS spending among different eligibility groups in Medicaid. In FY2005, Medicaid beneficiaries spent an average of $1,509 annually on prescription drugs, which decreased to $926 by FY2010. Factors contributing to this decline include the shift of dual eligible drug coverage to Medicare Part D, Medicaid drug pricing changes, increased availability of generic drugs, and other trends. State Medicaid programs' drug prescription mix impacts FFS drug expenditures, with single source drugs being more costly than innovator drugs. Medicaid FFS drug expenditures vary by drug type, with single source drugs costing more than innovator and non-innovator multiple source drugs. In FY2012, Medicaid agencies processed over 323.5 million prescription claims, with an average payment of $72 per claim. State per prescription payments ranged from $131 in Colorado to $35 in Nevada. The average payment for single source prescription claims was $282, while generic prescriptions averaged $18. Table 13 shows the percentage of Medicaid FFS drug claims for FY2011 and FY2012 by drug category. In FY2011 to FY2012, the percentage of claims for single source products decreased from 19% to 16%, while non-innovator multiple source prescription claims increased from 72% to 75%. The overall volume of FFS claims declined by 17% from 389 million to 324 million claims, possibly due to beneficiaries shifting to managed care plans. The increase in generic versus brand products is attributed to the patent cliff. Table 14 displays Medicaid FFS drug expenditures by drug category for FY2011 and FY2012. In FY2011 to FY2012, national total Medicaid FFS drug expenditures decreased by 18% from $28.4 billion to $23.2 billion. Single source drug expenditures represent over 60% of Medicaid FFS drug spending, despite accounting for less than 20% of total drug claims. Rebates play a significant role in the differences between single source and multiple source drug expenditures. Medicaid's drug expenditures decreased in FY2011 to FY2012, with single source drugs accounting for over 60% of spending. Rebates for single source drugs are higher, averaging 57% of manufacturers' prices. States can use various techniques, such as formularies and limits, to control drug spending. These policies are used by all insurers providing prescription drug coverage. States utilize various cost and utilization processes for Medicaid drug coverage, including prior authorization and preferred drug lists. These policies aim to control spending by approving clinically effective, lower-cost drugs for Medicaid beneficiaries. Non-preferred drugs may still be covered but require specific approval from the Medicaid agency. States may establish prior authorization programs under Medicaid for non-PDL drugs, requiring approval from the Medicaid agency before dispensing. Providers must request permission for non-PDL drugs, with a 24-hour response time for approval. Dispensing limits and quantity restrictions on prescription drugs are common, with states often limiting the amount of certain drugs that can be dispensed per prescription. In 2010, some states limited the amount and number of prescriptions dispensed per beneficiary. 14 states capped the total number of prescriptions, while four states limited the monthly number. States use policies to control outpatient prescription drug use and have programs to assess pharmaceutical program quality, including drug use review programs required by OBRA1990. The DUR program aims to improve pharmaceutical care quality and cost containment. Key features include education for pharmacists and physicians on identifying fraud and abuse, enhanced communication, and pharmacy counseling. States must include prospective and retrospective drug review in their Medicaid plans and establish DUR boards with healthcare professionals. State DUR programs aim to improve pharmaceutical care quality and cost containment by including healthcare professionals on DUR boards. States must submit annual reports on DUR activities and outpatient drug utilization to the Secretary. Most state DUR programs are operated by vendors, with the national average generic prescribing rate around 74-76%. State Medicaid programs also use prior authorization, utilization review, and beneficiary cost-sharing to control drug use and spending. Many state Medicaid programs impose beneficiary cost-sharing to control drug use and spending. States can require beneficiaries to pay out-of-pocket costs to encourage cost-effective prescription drug use. Copayments for non-preferred drugs may be as high as 20% for those with incomes above 150% of FPL. States must specify preferred and non-preferred drugs, and can establish different copayments for mail-order drugs. DRA amended the SSA to allow increased Medicaid prescription drug cost-sharing for beneficiaries. The Deficit Reduction Act (DRA) introduced new cost-sharing options for states regarding Medicaid beneficiaries. States can now set cost-sharing amounts exceeding nominal copayments and vary them among beneficiary classes or service types. For outpatient prescription drugs, states can impose higher copayments for non-preferred drugs and lower copayments for preferred drugs. There are limits on cost-sharing based on income levels, with a maximum of 10% for those with income between 100% and 150% of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL) and 20% for those with income over 150% of FPL. Medicaid beneficiaries can face cost-sharing for services based on income levels, with a maximum of 10% for those with income between 100% and 150% of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL) and 20% for those with income over 150% of FPL. Some states use Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs) to manage drug costs, which can provide discounts for pharmaceuticals and administrative services to control costs. Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs) handle pharmacy operations, formulary development, manufacturer rebate negotiation, and prescription checks for adverse drug interactions. They administer a significant portion of private health insurance prescription drug benefits and manage Medicaid drug benefits for some states. The Medicaid rebate program was established by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (OBRA90, P.L. 101-508) and underwent changes in 1992 with the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992 (P.L. 102-585). Subsequent federal statutory changes occurred in 2003 with the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA, P.L. 108-173), which was the first of five laws that reshaped Medicaid drug pricing policy to increase rebates collected by states and the federal government. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (OBRA90, P.L. 101-508) established the Medicaid drug rebate program to ensure Medicaid programs receive the best price for prescription drugs. Recent changes have been made to improve earlier amendments, with each state having discretion in implementing and enforcing pricing changes. Medicaid prescription drug policies are complex due to the dynamic market with many private purchasers and sellers. Major legislative changes have been made to Medicaid drug pricing and rebates to strengthen compliance monitoring and enforcement by states and federal policy makers. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (OBRA90) established the Medicaid drug rebate program to ensure Medicaid programs receive the best price for prescription drugs. Drug manufacturers must enter rebate agreements with the Secretary on behalf of states, providing rebates on drugs purchased for Medicaid beneficiaries. This led to unintended consequences of higher drug prices for certain public health programs like the Department of Veteran's Health Affairs (VHA) and the Department of Defense (DOD) due to Medicaid best price requirements. After the implementation of the Medicaid best price provision in 1990, drug manufacturers increased prices for DOD, VHA, and PHS providers. Congress later amended the Social Security Act to exclude certain sales from the Medicaid best price determination. The Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 made significant changes to Medicare programs, including the addition of voluntary outpatient services. The Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 introduced the voluntary outpatient prescription drug benefit for Medicare beneficiaries, Part D. It also shifted outpatient drug coverage for full benefit dual eligibles from Medicaid to Medicare Part D. The act required states to continue paying the majority of dual eligibles' prescription drug costs. Additionally, the act revised the formula for setting multiple source drug Federal Upper Limits (FULs) under the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005. The new FUL formula, effective January 1, 2007, was to be 250% of the AMP of the least costly therapeutic equivalent. Two national pharmacy associations challenged the new FULs, arguing they would be below community pharmacies' drug acquisition costs. A preliminary injunction in December 2007 prohibited CMS from setting FULs based on AMP data. The injunction, in place until the ACA became law on March 23, 2010, has since been lifted. CMS lacked authority to use the pre-DRA formula for setting FULs after September 30, 2009. CMS was unable to use the pre-DRA formula for setting FULs after September 30, 2009, due to the expiration of the authority. The DRA made changes such as reducing the required number of multiple source products and requiring manufacturers to report AMP to HHS. MIPPA Section 203 required the Secretary to disclose AMP to states and the public, revise the AMP definition, and collect data on physician-administered drugs. MIPPA Section 203 mandated the use of the pre-DRA FUL formula for federal multiple source drug reimbursement until September 30, 2009. This formula set FULs at 150% of the lowest therapeutic equivalent price. The Secretary was also restricted from disclosing AMP prices until September 30, 2009. The ARRA Section 5001 protected states from FMAP decreases and increased federal matching rates during the recession period from FY2009 to FY2011. Beginning January 1, 2010, ACA Section 2501 increased Medicaid's rebate percentages for certain prescription drugs. The ARRA temporary FMAP increase was extended until June 30, 2011 by the EJMAA. The ACA required the Secretary to recover additional funds from states received from drug manufacturers through increased Medicaid rebates. The Secretary can reduce Medicaid payments to states for the additional prescription drug rebates based on specific percentages of the Average Manufacturer Price (AMP). Adjustments are made if previous rebate estimates were underestimated, and state payment reductions are considered overpayments offset against regular Medicaid draw. The ACA required drug manufacturers to pay rebates to states on drugs dispensed to Medicaid beneficiaries in managed care plans. Medicaid capitation rates paid to managed care plans were adjusted to include these rebates. Managed care plans have additional reporting requirements, including submitting data on covered outpatient drugs. Formularies can be used with exception processes for excluded drugs. Additional rebates were required for new drugs under the ACA. The ACA required drug manufacturers to pay rebates for new formulations of single source or innovator multiple source drugs, known as line extensions. The additional rebates for line extensions were calculated based on the original product's rebate or the new drug's AMP multiplied by the highest rebate for the original product. The total rebate liability for each drug was limited to 100% of the drug's AMP. Other aspects of the drug rebate program, like Medicaid's best price requirement, remained unchanged. ACA amended the calculation of additional rebates for new drug formulations, required coverage of certain drugs under Medicaid, and established FULs for multiple source drugs. ACA Section 2503 made changes to the FUL formula, including a smoothing process to reduce volatility and clarifying that AMP excludes certain discounts and payments. ACA Section 2503 revised the AMP definition by replacing retail class of trade with RCPs, excluding sales to non-traditional outlets from AMP calculation. It also expanded drug pricing disclosure requirements and changed the definition of multiple source drugs. Manufacturers must report monthly weighted average AMPs and retail survey prices within 30 days of each rebate period. The EJMAA Section 202 amended ACA to include sales of 5i drugs in the AMP calculation, even if not dispensed through retail pharmacies. It addresses Medicaid drug pricing issues, including new drug prices and pending ACA changes. Rising drug costs and the potential influx of new drugs to the market are key concerns. Manufacturers' pipelines are filling with new drugs, especially biologic products, leading to concerns about rising drug prices. When launching new single-source drugs, manufacturers have control over pricing without regulatory limits. The FDA approved 27 new drugs in 2013 and 39 in 2012, many of which are expensive. Initial high prices do not prevent further price increases post-launch. Many stakeholders are worried about rising prescription drug costs, especially with the introduction of new, expensive drugs like those for HIV/AIDS and hepatitis C. Reports have shown significant price hikes for brand-name drugs due to various factors like lack of alternatives and industry consolidation. The launch of more effective drugs has reignited concerns about excessive new drug costs. Gilead Sciences received FDA approval for Sovaldi and Harvoni, new drugs for treating hepatitis C virus. Sovaldi costs around $84,000 for a 12-week treatment, while Harvoni is priced at $1,125 per pill, totaling about $95,000 for a 12-week course. These drugs are expensive but offer effective treatment options. The launch of Sovaldi differed from other drugs due to factors such as a shortage of alternatives, increased HCV awareness, and a backlog of diagnosed cases. This surge in demand for treatment put financial pressure on payers, especially Medicaid and Medicare. The timing of Sovaldi's FDA approval may have contributed to the financial strain on Medicaid. Sovaldi's fast-track approval in December 2013 caught Medicaid and other payers off guard, leading to financial strain. State budgets were unprepared for the costs of covering Sovaldi, impacting Medicaid programs. Medicaid programs, including Sovaldi, face financial strain due to high drug prices. Concerns have been raised by Congress and private organizations about the impact on federal and state budgets. Gilead participates in the Medicaid rebate program, covering Sovaldi. Gilead's participation in the Medicaid rebate program ensures that Sovaldi is a covered drug. Medicaid agencies purchasing Sovaldi for beneficiaries will receive rebates based on the drug's price and AMP. Gilead will report Sovaldi's base-period AMP after its launch, and will not owe additional rebates unless the price increases faster than inflation-adjusted AMP. In the short term, Medicaid rebates will help offset initial costs for treating HCV-positive beneficiaries, but anticipate budget impacts. Long-term, competition from new therapeutically equivalent products may decrease Sovaldi's cost for Medicaid. Other drug makers have promising drugs in late-stage development for HCV treatment, allowing Medicaid to negotiate with multiple manufacturers. Medicaid programs can negotiate better deals on HCV drugs by offering SRAs for therapeutically comparable products and using PDLs to reduce Sovaldi expenditures. Medicaid managed care plans and multi-state purchasing pools can also increase states' leverage in negotiating manufacturer price concessions. States may limit access to Sovaldi by requiring it only in specific situations, Gilead's launch price process is not public. Drug manufacturers consider costs their products offset, like reducing the need for surgeries or liver transplants. High drug prices are attributed to how the healthcare industry pays for services rather than drug companies. Medicaid's drug pricing policies, particularly the two-tiered rebate system, may indirectly incentivize manufacturers to set higher launch prices for drugs like Sovaldi to offset Medicaid rebate costs. This strategy allows manufacturers to avoid additional rebate obligations and maximize profits, especially for drugs with little competition and high demand at launch. The manufacturer of Sovaldi may raise prices modestly to avoid most or all of Medicaid's additional inflation rebate. Competition may lead to price concessions to maintain market position, allowing for negotiation room for state rebates without reducing profit margins. Gilead could potentially raise prices faster in the future, building room for inflation adjustments before triggering the rebate. It is unclear if drug makers are concerned about recovering Medicaid rebates. The CMS published a proposed rule in 2012 for the Medicaid drug rebate program under the ACA, offering guidance on statutory changes. A final rule is expected in 2015, with modifications to CFR sections. Industry feedback was sought on various issues, and the rule aims to implement ACA Sections 2501, 2503, 3301, 1101, and 1206. The proposed rule by CMS in 2012 for the Medicaid drug rebate program under the ACA requested industry feedback on various issues. The rule aimed to clarify existing guidance, align policies with FDA drug guidance, and make substantial changes to AMP and best price calculations. Three new sections were added to the CFR subpart, including Identification of 5i Drugs, Medicaid Drug Rebate, and Requirements for States. A potential major change would be the inclusion of territories as states, requiring compliance from territory Medicaid programs. The proposed rule by CMS in 2012 for the Medicaid drug rebate program under the ACA aimed to align policies with FDA drug guidance and make substantial changes to AMP and best price calculations. It included the inclusion of territories as states, which would require compliance from territory Medicaid programs. CMS estimated that states and the federal government would save $17.7 billion over five years from the proposed changes. Congress has played a key role in establishing Medicaid drug authority to ensure lower prescription drug prices. Congress authorized the creation of infrastructure to manage, monitor, and enforce prescription drug pricing, extending Medicaid's authority to receive rebates on drugs for beneficiaries in managed care. This shift has led to a decrease in FFS prescription drug claims from 10% in 2010 to less than 50% in 2013. The movement to managed care plans may complicate oversight of the Medicaid prescription drug benefit. States can collect rebates under managed care contracts, but it is unclear how state supplemental rebates will align with negotiations between managed care plans (or PBMs) and drug wholesalers/manufacturers. States typically delegate some or all DUR and program integrity oversight to managed care under these contracts. States delegate DUR and program integrity oversight to managed care plans for Medicaid prescription drug benefits. The shift to managed care has reduced FFS drug claims. Questions arise about states' ability to monitor drug benefits and whether savings will come from cost reduction or utilization controls.
