    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Transforming Energy Now Act of 2006\". Congress finds that the United States is dangerously dependent on foreign oil, importing nearly 60 percent of the oil used, with that expected to increase to almost 70 percent by 2025. Approximately 2,500,000 barrels of oil per day are imported from the Persian Gulf region, contributing to nearly 30 percent of the trade deficit. By increasing production and commercialization of alternative liquid fuels, the US can reduce its dependence on foreign oil, as only 4 percent of gasoline sold was derived from renewable fuel in April 2006. The United States aims to increase ethanol production to 14 billion gallons by 2016, surpassing the renewable fuels mandate. This aggressive renewable fuel production schedule will reduce dependence on foreign oil, with a goal of having 10% of the nation's motor vehicle fuel supply be renewable by 2016. The United States aims to increase ethanol production to 14 billion gallons by 2016, surpassing the renewable fuels mandate. Setting a goal of 19 billion gallons of ethanol by 2016 would require an aggressive increase in renewable fuels production without significant ethanol imports. The Clean Air Act is amended to require motor vehicle fuel in the US to contain a minimum of 10% renewable fuel by volume. The Administrator must issue regulations within a year to implement this change. Additionally, there is an increase in the alternative fuel vehicle refueling property credit. SEC. 4 amends the Internal Revenue Code to increase the alternative fuel vehicle refueling property credit from 30% to 50%. This change applies to property placed in service after December 31, 2005. Section 32912 of title 49, United States Code, is amended to establish the Alternative Fueling Infrastructure Trust Fund, funded by 90% of civil penalties collected under this section. The Secretary of Transportation will administer a grant program from this fund. The Trust Fund established under Section 32912 of title 49, United States Code, will be used to create a grant program for increasing the availability of alternative transportation fuels. Grants will be awarded to individual fueling stations and corporations with experience in administering grant funding for alternative fueling infrastructure. The Secretary of Energy gives priority to non-profit corporations with experience in alternative fueling infrastructure. Consideration is given to the number of vehicles produced for each specific alternative fuel type. Grant funds must be used for the establishment of alternative fueling infrastructure. Grant funds under this subsection can be used for constructing new alternative fuel facilities, upgrading existing ones, or purchasing equipment and turnkey fueling services. Recipients must provide a $1 non-Federal contribution for every $3 of grant funds received. Each grant recipient must select locations for alternative fuel stations based on public demand and the opportunity to create fueling corridors. Administrative expenses cannot exceed 10% of the total award. Facilities constructed or upgraded with grant funds must provide alternative fuel to the public for at least 4 years, have a marketing plan to promote alternative fuels, display prices prominently, offer point of sale materials, label dispensers clearly, price fuel at the same margin as gasoline, and utilize available tax incentives. The grant recipient must notify the Secretary of Energy when an alternative fuel station opens to the public and provide semi-annual reports after receiving a grant award. After receiving a grant award, grant recipients must submit reports every 6 months to the Secretary of Energy detailing the status of alternative fuel stations built with grant funds, the amount of alternative fuel dispensed at each station, and the average price per gallon of the alternative fuel sold. The term 'alternative fuel' is defined for this subsection. The term 'alternative fuel' is defined as a fuel consisting of ethanol, natural gas, compressed natural gas, liquefied natural gas, liquefied petroleum gas, hydrogen, or a mixture of biodiesel and diesel fuel with at least 20 percent biodiesel. SEC. 6. Low-interest loan and grant program for retail delivery of E-85 fuel, including infrastructure for pump stations. The Secretary will establish a low-interest loan and grant program to help farmer-owned ethanol producers develop infrastructure for retail delivery of fuel containing at least 85% ethanol. Loan repayment will be spread over the project's life, with a fixed interest rate not exceeding 5%. Appropriations are authorized for this program. The Secretary of Agriculture will promulgate regulations to carry out amendments made by this section, with necessary appropriations authorized."
