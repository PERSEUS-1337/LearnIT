    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Sage-Grouse Accountability and Private Conservation Act of 2014\". Congress finds that the Secretary is scheduled to decide on listing the greater sage-grouse as threatened or endangered by September 30, 2015, after substantial federal investments in conservation efforts. State wildlife management agencies are implementing sage-grouse conservation plans to complement federal efforts, with significant private investment in conservation. Progress is being made through a combination of federal, state, and private initiatives. State management plans and new Federal conservation programs are crucial for providing certainty to farmers, ranchers, developers, and small businesses regarding the likelihood of a listing decision. The term \"Secretary\" in this Act refers to the Secretary of the Interior. The Secretary must submit a report on greater sage-grouse conservation efforts to Congress by December 15, 2014. The report should include descriptions of public and private programs, State and Federal Government agencies' expenditures, State management plans, Bureau of Land Management plans, and metrics for conservation efforts. The Secretary will report on greater sage-grouse conservation efforts to Congress, including metrics for determining listing under the Endangered Species Act and recommendations for legislative actions to support conservation efforts. Reported metrics may include the quantity of acres enrolled in habitat protection programs. The curr_chunk provides data on various conservation efforts, including habitat restoration, mine reclamation, conifer removal, presuppression fire efforts, and fuels management programs. The curr_chunk lists data on various conservation efforts, such as fire breaks, habitat restoration, structure modifications, livestock management, travel management, sage-grouse translocation, and other relevant metrics. The Secretary may consider various data and metrics when deciding whether to list the greater sage-grouse as a threatened or endangered species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973. The Food Security Act of 1985 is amended to include land with greater or Gunnison sage-grouse habitat of special environmental significance for agricultural land easements. Considerations now include maximizing the protection of greater or Gunnison sage-grouse habitat."
