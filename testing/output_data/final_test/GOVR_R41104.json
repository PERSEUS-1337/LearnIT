    "content": "The terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, led to changes in U.S. immigration policy regarding visa issuances and exclusion of foreign nationals. However, laws enacted in the 1990s also played a significant role in shaping current visa policy. Legislative developments over the past 20 years and statistical trends in visa issuances and denials are analyzed in this report, providing a nuanced study of U.S. visa policy and exclusion grounds. Advocates of comprehensive immigration reform may consider revisiting some provisions related to the exclusion of foreign nationals enacted in the past two decades. The legislative proposals may ease provisions related to the exclusion of foreign nationals, including waiving the inadmissibility provision for those unlawfully present for over 180 days. The case of Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab has increased scrutiny on visa processes and exclusion grounds. Foreign nationals can be admitted temporarily or permanently as immigrants or legal permanent residents (LPRs). Foreign nationals can be admitted as immigrants or legal permanent residents (LPRs) or on a temporary basis as nonimmigrants. Those wishing to come to the United States must obtain a visa and meet specific criteria under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). The Department of State (DOS), Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and Department of Justice (DOJ) play key roles in administering admission policies. The Department of State (DOS), Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and Department of Justice (DOJ) are key in administering immigration policies. DOS issues visas, USCIS approves immigrant petitions, and CBP inspects people entering the US. The Attorney General and EOIR adjudicate immigration cases and rule on immigration law questions. Visa requirements are detailed in the INA, with more extensive paperwork for permanent residents compared to visitors. The visa issuance process in the United States involves extensive paperwork and adjudication procedures, similar to the IRS tax forms. Different types of visas require varying levels of documentation, with over 70 USCIS and DOS forms involved. Visa application files are stored electronically for immigration adjudicators and officers to access. The visa issuance process in the United States involves submitting required documents such as photographs, full name, age, gender, and birth details. Certain documents need to be certified by government authorities depending on the visa category. Physical and mental examinations are mandatory for prospective LPRs, and nonimmigrants may also be required to undergo these examinations. Consular officers have the authority to disqualify visa applicants if they are deemed ineligible under section 212 of the statute. The visa issuance process in the United States involves submitting required documents such as photographs, full name, age, gender, and birth details. Physical and mental examinations are mandatory for prospective LPRs, and nonimmigrants may also be required to undergo these examinations. Consular officers have the authority to disqualify visa applicants if they are deemed ineligible under section 212 of the statute. The determinations for disqualification are based on eligibility criteria of various visa categories, with shorthand reference \u00a7221(g) in the INA. In addition to visa qualification, a decision must be made on the admissibility or excludability of foreign nationals under INA \u00a7212(a), which includes health and criminal history grounds. Foreign nationals seeking to live permanently in the United States must meet criteria outlined in \u00a7212(a) of the INA, including health, criminal history, security concerns, and more. Consular officers have the authority to disqualify visa applicants based on these grounds, with decisions not subject to judicial appeals. To qualify as a family-based LPR, individuals must have specific relationships with U.S. citizens or legal permanent residents. To qualify for employment-based LPR status, a foreign national must be approved by the Department of Labor, have extraordinary abilities, be an investor creating jobs, or fit the \"special immigrant\" category. LPR visas are also granted through the diversity lottery. Petitions for LPR status are filed with USCIS by a sponsoring relative or employer in the U.S., with the process called \"adjustment of status\" if the immigrant is already in the U.S. If not, the petition goes to Consular Affairs. After a foreign national is approved for employment-based LPR status, the petition is sent to Consular Affairs in their home country or reviewed by USCIS if adjusting status in the U.S. A personal interview is required for all prospective LPRs to establish eligibility for the visa. The burden of proof lies with the applicant to confirm their qualification for the visa. Foreign nationals approved for employment-based LPR status must confirm their qualification for the visa, ensuring they are not ineligible under grounds for inadmissibility. The number of immigrant visas issued annually has remained around 0.4 to 0.5 million in the past 15 years, with FY1998 and FY2003 having the fewest visas issued. Disqualifications under INA \u00a7221(g) show a trend opposite to visa issuances from FY1994 to FY2008. In FY1998, there were 256,706 disqualifications for visas, with 89,848 exclusions under INA \u00a7212(a). FY1998 and FY1999 had the highest percentage of exclusions at 12.3% and 12.4% respectively. Nonimmigrants are aliens admitted to the US temporarily for specific reasons. Nonimmigrant visas are temporary and issued for specific purposes. There are 24 major categories and over 70 types of nonimmigrant visas. Applicants must prove eligibility and the purpose of their visit. The burden of proof lies with the applicant. Personal interviews are typically required for foreign nationals applying for nonimmigrant visas, although they may be waived in certain cases. Following the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, the number of personal interviews increased significantly to enhance national security measures. In 2003, the Department of State implemented regulations that tightened requirements for personal interviews and limited the class of nonimmigrants eligible for interview waivers. Congress later mandated in-person consular interviews for most nonimmigrant visa applicants aged 14 to 79. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 mandated personal interviews for most nonimmigrant visa applicants aged 14 to 79, tightening requirements and limiting interview waivers. The Immigration and Nationality Act presumes all aliens seek to live permanently in the US, requiring nonimmigrant visa applicants to prove otherwise. Some visas allow for simultaneous seeking of Lawful Permanent Resident status. Nonimmigrant visas like H-1, L, and V are provisional, allowing visa holders to seek LPR status concurrently. USCIS and CBP determine eligibility for certain visas. Changing nonimmigrant categories requires filing a change of status application with USCIS. Leaving the US while the application is pending is considered relinquishing it. DOS issues around 5 to 6 million nonimmigrant visas annually, with validity depending on the visa category and country of origin. The trend analysis for nonimmigrant visa determinations shows variations over 15 years. In FY2001, a significant number of visas were issued and applicants were deemed ineligible based on presumed immigrant status. FY1996 had the highest percentage of nonimmigrant visas issued at 80.0%. The growth in nonimmigrant visas during 1998-2001 was due to new border crossing cards and temporary ceiling lifts. The trend analysis for nonimmigrant visa determinations over 15 years showed variations. In FY2001, many visas were issued, but applicants were deemed ineligible due to presumed immigrant status. The highest percentage of nonimmigrant visas was in FY1996 at 80.0%. Growth in visas during 1998-2001 was due to new border crossing cards and temporary ceiling lifts. Throughout the 15-year span, \u00a7214(b) presumption was the most common basis for rejecting nonimmigrant visa applicants. \u00a7212(a) exclusions were minimal, never exceeding one-half of one percent. In FY2008, \u00a7212(a) exclusions of nonimmigrant visas peaked at 35,403, surpassing the prior high point in FY1998. For prospective LPRs, exclusions peaked in FY1998 and FY1999, reaching over 89,000 in both years. The exclusions of prospective LPRs fell from FY2000 through FY2003, then began climbing to reach 77,080 in FY2008. The trends challenge the assumption that the 9/11 attacks were the watershed moment for U.S. visa policy. All visa applicants undergo admissibility reviews by DOS consular officers. All aliens seeking visas must undergo admissibility reviews by DOS consular officers to ensure they are not ineligible under grounds for inadmissibility in the INA. Consular decisions are not appealable, but some applicants can provide additional information to overcome a refusal. Grounds for inadmissibility include health, criminal history, security concerns, public charge, unauthorized work, illegal entry, and previous removal. These criteria were established in the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952. The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 established 31 grounds for exclusion of aliens. The Immigration Amendments Act of 1990 consolidated these into nine categories for inadmissibility. The Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 revised national security and criminal grounds for inadmissibility. The IIRIRA and other subsequent acts strengthened inadmissibility provisions for immigrants in the United States, including biometric identifiers on visas and expanded terror-related grounds for exclusion. In 2005, P.L. 109-13 expanded terror-related grounds for inadmissibility and deportability. The 110th Congress revised exclusion policies for aliens linked to terrorist organizations and health-related grounds of inadmissibility. Questions on public charge inadmissibility arose in the 111th Congress regarding Medicaid and CHIP. Exclusion of aliens based on health or communicable diseases dates back to the Immigration Act of 1891. Since the Immigration Act of 1891, exclusion of aliens based on health or communicable diseases has been authorized. The Immigration Amendments of 1990 expanded this to include aliens with communicable diseases of public health significance, defined by the Secretary of Health and Human Services. The regulation lists diseases like chancroid, gonorrhea, and tuberculosis, but is not exhaustive. The regulatory definition of communicable diseases includes diseases listed in a Presidential executive order, such as cholera, diphtheria, and influenza caused by novel viruses. It also covers diseases that may pose a public health emergency of international concern, as determined by the CDC Director based on seriousness, unusual emergence, and risk of spread. The risk of disease spread in the United States is determined by factors like transmissibility and virulence, posing a potential threat to public health. Foreign nationals seeking visas undergo medical examinations by designated in-country physicians, as required by HHS regulations. Costs for testing are generally covered by individuals, except for refugees whose expenses are covered by the U.S. government. Foreign nationals seeking visas undergo medical examinations by designated in-country physicians, with costs generally covered by individuals except for refugees, whose expenses are covered by the U.S. government. Applicants for temporary admission as nonimmigrants may be tested for infections at the discretion of the consular officer or CBP inspector. Children under 15 require a general physical examination and proof of immunizations, with discretionary waivers available for health-related grounds for inadmissibility under certain circumstances. Waivers are available for certain individuals who are inadmissible due to lack of vaccination or a physical/mental disorder. The Secretary may waive health-related grounds for inadmissibility if it is in the national interest. Criminal offenses in immigration law include violations of federal, state, and foreign laws, particularly those involving moral turpitude or aggravated felonies. It does not cover violations such as working without authorization or overstaying a visa. Foreign nationals may be excluded from the United States based on criminal history, including convictions for crimes involving moral turpitude or controlled substances. This also applies to those who have aided or abetted in illicit drug trafficking. Foreign nationals may be excluded from the United States based on criminal history, including convictions for serious crimes or human trafficking offenses. This also applies to those who have aided or benefitted from illicit activity. Foreign nationals may be excluded from the United States based on criminal history, including convictions for serious crimes or human trafficking offenses. The INA allows consular officers or immigration officers to exclude individuals engaged in money laundering or aiding such activities. Waivers under \u00a7212(h) are available for certain criminal grounds of inadmissibility, except for murder or torture-related offenses. Inadmissibility may also apply to those opposing or seeking to overthrow the government. Foreign nationals may be excluded from the United States based on criminal history, including convictions for serious crimes or human trafficking offenses. The INA allows exclusion of individuals engaged in money laundering or aiding such activities. If the Secretary of State has reasonable grounds to believe an alien's activities would have adverse foreign policy consequences, they may be deemed inadmissible or deportable. Aliens generally cannot be deported for beliefs, statements, or associations lawful in the US, unless it compromises a compelling foreign policy interest. Foreign officials or candidates cannot be denied entry solely based on past, current, or expected actions. Since 1990, the INA has provisions for excluding aliens engaged in terrorist activities, either individually or as part of a terrorist organization. Amendments have made it easier to deem aliens inadmissible or deportable for supporting terrorist activities. The Secretary of State or Secretary of Homeland Security can waive certain provisions regarding terrorists in consultation with the Attorney General. The INA allows for the waiver of terrorist activity under certain conditions, but not for those who engage in terrorist activities after entering the US or have ties to designated terrorist organizations. The exclusion of foreign paupers and those likely to become a public charge has historical roots dating back to colonial times. Applicants for immigrant status can overcome the public charge ground for exclusion. Applicants for immigrant status can overcome the public charge ground for exclusion by demonstrating their own funds, prearranged or prospective employment, or through an affidavit of support from a U.S. sponsor. The affidavit of support is a legally binding contract that requires the sponsor to ensure the new immigrant does not become a public charge. Sponsors must meet income requirements or share liability with joint sponsors. The law requires sponsors to provide affidavits of support for family-based immigrants to prevent them from becoming public charges. Employment-based LPRs usually do not need affidavits unless the employer is a relative. The INA exempts refugees, asylees, and special cases from the public charge ground. Immigrants seeking entry for labor must have certification from the Secretary of Labor. The Secretary of Labor must certify that there are not enough U.S. workers available and that hiring the alien will not harm wages or working conditions. The foreign labor certification program ensures that foreign workers do not negatively impact U.S. workers. The labor market protections of \u00a7212(a)(5) do not apply to most foreign nationals seeking to immigrate to the United States. Only employers of certain employment-based LPRs and certain temporary workers seeking H visas are required to be certified by the DOL. LPRs entering as priority workers who are persons of extraordinary ability in the arts, sciences, education, business, or athletics; outstanding professors and researchers; and certain multinational executives and managers are exempt from labor certification. Foreign nationals who fail to attend removal proceedings without reasonable cause are inadmissible for five years. The burden of proof is on the alien to demonstrate reasonable cause. This provision dates back to the IIRIRA of 1996. Since the 1952 act, foreign nationals who commit fraud or willful misrepresentation to gain entry or benefits in the United States are inadmissible. Falsely claiming U.S. citizenship also results in lifetime inadmissibility, with limited exceptions. There is no immigrant waiver for making false citizenship claims. The \"ineligible for citizenship\" ground bars entry for individuals who deserted military service or evaded the draft based on alienage. Foreign nationals exempt from military service due to alienage become excludable and ineligible for citizenship. Deported foreign nationals face re-entry bans based on removal reasons. Deportation procedures are outlined in INA \u00a7237 and \u00a7240, with provisions for expedited removal in INA \u00a7235. In removal proceedings, an immigration judge determines admissibility or removability of aliens. A final removal order is not necessary for an inadmissibility determination. The INA prohibits re-entry of aliens ordered removed within 5 years, or 20 years for subsequent removals or for aggravated felony convictions. The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) specifies that aliens ordered removed or who departed the United States while an order of removal was outstanding are inadmissible for certain periods. Unlawfully present aliens face admissibility restrictions based on the length of their unlawful presence. The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) specifies that aliens ordered removed or departed the United States while an order of removal was outstanding are inadmissible for certain periods. Inadmissibility can be waived for a spouse or child of a citizen or permanent resident if refusal of admission would result in extreme hardship. Additionally, aliens who have been ordered removed or have been unlawfully present for an extended period are indefinitely inadmissible. The Immigration and Nationality Act specifies that aliens ordered removed or unlawfully present for over a year are inadmissible. The inadmissibility period can be waived in certain cases. The IIRIRA increases the inadmissibility period for aliens previously removed on arrival. The Immigration and Nationality Act sets periods for inadmissibility for aliens removed more than once and those convicted of aggravated felonies. The Attorney General can waive these provisions and grant exceptions. CRS analyzed visa determinations from FY1996 to FY2008 to understand grounds for inadmissibility. Immigrant and nonimmigrant determinations were analyzed separately. In FY1996 to FY2008, visa determinations showed public charge as a top reason for denial, followed by lack of labor certification. Trends shifted in the late 1990s and 2000s, with public charge exclusions dominating. Over half of all exclusions were due to public charge grounds. The proportion of public charge exclusions as a basis for denial fell by FY2004 but remained the top reason. However, by FY2008, illegal presence and previous removals became the leading grounds for exclusion, with public charge accounting for less than 10% of exclusions. Labor market protections and illegal presence were also significant reasons for exclusion. Refusals of nonimmigrant petitions showed violations of immigration law as the leading category in earlier years, but illegal presence and prior removal became more prominent by FY2008. In FY2008, illegal presence and prior removal became the leading grounds for nonimmigrant visa refusals, with criminal grounds growing as a common basis for exclusion. Violations of immigration law accounted for 47.7% of all exclusions over a 15-year period, but fell to the second ranking by FY2008. The criminal grounds represented a larger portion of exclusions among nonimmigrant petitioners (29.8% in FY2008) compared to immigrant petitioners (2.8% in FY2008). The rise and fall of the public charge ground is the most striking feature of the 15-year trend analysis. Many applicants initially had insufficient affidavits of support after IIRIRA went into effect, but over time, they may have submitted more complete financial data. The statutory change in IIRIRA made affidavits of support legally binding, leading potential sponsors to be less likely to petition for family members if they lacked adequate resources. Exclusions based on past illegal presence and prior removal have steadily risen due to the statutory change in IIRIRA since 1996. The increase in immigrant exclusions is largely due to the statutory change in IIRIRA, which made foreign nationals unlawfully present in the US inadmissible for 3 or 10 years. Database improvements and access to law enforcement databases have helped consular officers identify inadmissible visa applicants. The growth in demand for foreign workers and competition for visas also contribute to the rise in immigrant exclusions. Consular officers use the Consular Consolidated Database (CCD) to screen visa applicants, which stores records of all visa applications dating back to the mid-1990s. The CCD includes photographs and 10-finger scans of applicants, links with other databases like IDENT and IAFIS, and flags issues that may impact visa issuance. Consular officers use the Consular Consolidated Database (CCD) to screen visa applicants, which includes links to databases like IDENT and IAFIS. The CCD also connects to the DHS's Traveler Enforcement Compliance System (TECS) and some consular officers now have access to the Arrival Departure Information System (ADIS) to track foreign nationals' entries and exits from the United States. The CLASS database, containing over 26 million records in 2009, is used to check the background of aliens for any issues. The quantity and quality of CLASS records have increased significantly since September 11, 2001. The increase in the quantity and quality of CLASS records is due to improved data sharing between the Department of State and other government agencies. Almost 70 percent of CLASS records now come from other agencies, up from 25 percent in 2001. The Security Advisory Opinion (SAO) system requires consular officers to refer selected visa cases for greater review by intelligence and law enforcement agencies. The Visa Viper system, established after the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, alerts officials about foreign nationals who may be suspected terrorists. Consular posts send Visa Viper communications to NCTC for foreign nationals of concern. Consular officers also send suspect names to FBI through Visa Condor. The Terrorist Exclusion List includes individuals associated with terrorist-supporting organizations. Not all aliens need visas to enter the US, as most visitors use the Visa Waiver Program. The Visa Waiver Program (VWP) allows visitors from 35 countries to enter the US without a visa. CBP inspectors at the port of entry conduct background checks for admissibility. A waiver authority was created to admit countries with refusal rates under 10% to the VWP. The ESTA system allows foreign nationals to provide biographical information before travel to check for security risks. Exceptions to visa requirements can be made for unforeseen emergencies. In 2003, the Administration limited the circumstances for waiving visa and passport requirements. In 2004, Congress enacted the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative, which scaled back visa and passport waivers. The law required travelers entering the US to have a passport or other approved documents denoting identity and citizenship. The President was restricted from waiving documentary requirements for US citizens, except in specific circumstances. The Secretary of Homeland Security can waive documentary requirements for entering or departing the United States in certain circumstances, such as unforeseen emergencies or humanitarian reasons."
