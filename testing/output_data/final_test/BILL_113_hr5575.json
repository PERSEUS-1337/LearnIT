    "content": "The \"Peaceful Learning Act of 2014\" may be cited as the official title of this Act. It includes definitions for key terms used within the legislation. The \"Peaceful Learning Act of 2014\" includes definitions for key terms such as local educational agency, rail operator, railway noise, and school. The \"Peaceful Learning Act of 2014\" defines key terms related to education and railway noise (20 U.S.C. 7801). The \"Peaceful Learning Act of 2014\" defines key terms related to education and railway noise. SEC. 3. RAILWAY NOISE STUDY. The Secretary of Transportation will collaborate with the National Academy of Sciences to conduct a study on railway noise in the United States. The study will examine the impact of railway noise on schools, the effectiveness of noise abatement programs, and the Department of Transportation's noise assessment practices. A report on the study's results is due within 12 months. The National Academy of Sciences will submit a report on the railway noise study to the Secretary, who will then share it with Congress. SEC. 4. NOISE MEASUREMENT AND EXPOSURE SYSTEMS. The Secretary of Transportation must establish a single system for measuring and determining exposure to railway noise near urbanized areas within 12 months of submitting a report. This system should have a reliable relationship between projected noise exposure and individual reactions, and be applied uniformly. The Secretary of Transportation will set minimum standards for railway noise levels near urban schools based on a required report. The Secretary of Transportation will establish noise exposure maps. Rail operators must submit noise exposure maps to the Secretary of Transportation showing areas with nonconforming noise levels that impact urban schools due to their operations. If changes in operations create new noise levels at schools or reduce existing levels, revised maps must be submitted. SEC. 6. NOISE COMPATIBILITY PROGRAMS. Rail operators can submit a noise compatibility program to the Secretary of Transportation after consulting with public agencies and planning authorities, and providing notice and a public hearing. The program must outline measures to reduce existing nonconforming noise levels near schools and prevent new nonconforming noise levels. The Secretary must approve or disapprove the program within 180 days. The Secretary may approve a noise compatibility program submitted by rail operators within 180 days if it aims to reduce nonconforming noise levels near schools and allows for necessary revisions. Grants may be provided to carry out approved projects, including cooperation with local educational agencies. The Federal share of a project for which a grant is made under subsection (d) is 80 percent of the cost of the project. SEC. 7. Nonadmissibility of noise exposure map and related information as evidence. No part of a noise exposure map or related information submitted to or prepared by the Secretary of Transportation, or a list of land uses identified as compatible with noise exposures, can be used as evidence in a civil action for noise from a fixed rail public transportation facility. SEC. 8. Authorization of appropriations. Funds from the Mass Transit Account of the Highway Trust Fund can be appropriated as needed to implement this Act."
