    "content": "From the mid-1970s until 2007, world markets experienced five significant spikes in crude oil and petroleum prices due to supply disruptions and international conflicts. These price increases have consequences for the United States, affecting trade balance and disposable income. The U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve was established in response to the 1973 Arab-Israeli War and the oil embargo imposed by OAPEC. The 1973 Arab-Israeli War led to a rise in crude oil prices, prompting the establishment of the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve to mitigate the impact of supply disruptions and international conflicts on the economy. The reserve aimed to deter the use of oil as a political weapon and lessen the economic effects of oil shortages caused by global events. The U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve was established in response to the 1973 Arab oil embargo to prevent economic dislocation caused by oil shortages. It was designed to contain enough crude oil to replace imports for 90 days, with plans for expansion to 1 billion barrels. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) is authorized for expansion to 1 billion barrels, managed by the Department of Energy (DOE). It consists of five underground storage facilities in Texas and Louisiana, created from salt domes. The caverns were finished by injecting water and removing brine, with oil removed by displacing it with water injection. The capacity reached 727 million barrels by 2005, with an inventory of nearly 700 million barrels before Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005. Some crude was loaned to refiners after the storms. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) reached its capacity of 726 million barrels by the end of 2009. SPR oil is loaned to refiners and sold competitively through a Notice of Sale issued by the Department of Energy. Bids are reviewed, and oil could enter the market roughly two weeks after the sale notice. The SPR could be drawn down initially at a rate of 4.4 mbd for up to 90 days. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) was established in the 1980s to address concerns about oil withdrawal readiness. The Life Extension Program in 1993 upgraded SPR facilities for readiness until 2025. The Arab oil embargo led to the creation of the International Energy Agency (IEA) to manage energy crises, including strategic stockpiles. IEA members commit to maintaining 90 days of emergency reserves and coordinating oil deliveries during crises. The United States has more than 100 days' cushion of net imports for compliance with IEA requirements, but only about 20% of privately held stocks would be available in an emergency. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve could provide roughly 70 days of net import protection at full capacity, assuming a total cessation of oil supply. This scenario is unlikely, especially for the United States, as Canada is its main source of crude oil. Canada is the nation's main source of crude oil. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 requires the expansion of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) to 1 billion barrels. Congress approved funds for expansion activities, including evaluating a site in Richton, MS, and purchasing a cavern at Bayou Choctaw. The conferees accepted language in the Senate version of the bill that prohibits SPR appropriations expended to anyone engaged in providing refined products to Iran or contributing to the expansion of refining capacity in Iran. This prohibition also includes firms providing or insuring tankers carrying refined products to Iran. The Energy Policy and Conservation Act authorized the drawdown of the Reserve in case of a severe energy supply interruption. Congress enacted additional drawdown authority in 1990 (Energy Policy and Conservation Act Amendments of 1990, P.L. 101-383) after the Exxon Valdez oil spill, allowing the President to use the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) for a short period without declaring a severe energy supply interruption. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 made these authorities permanent, ensuring U.S. participation in managing petroleum product price increases. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 made the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) authorities permanent, allowing for U.S. participation in emergency-sharing activities without violating antitrust laws. This authority permits a limited use of the SPR in the event of a significant energy supply shortage, with a maximum sale of 30 million barrels over 60 days. The Bush Administration utilized this authority in 2005 by offering 30 million barrels of SPR oil. The American Clean Energy Leadership Act of 2009 (S. 1462) proposes significant changes to the authorities governing drawdown and sale from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR). It includes provisions for 30 million barrels of refined product, transfers drawdown authority from the President to the Secretary of Energy, and allows for drawdown and sale in the event of a severe energy market supply interruption causing a significant price increase. The proposed changes in S. 1462 allow for drawdown and sale from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in the event of a severe energy market disruption caused by a significant increase in petroleum product prices, with the goal of mitigating economic impacts. The authorities deliberately avoided using price as grounds for a drawdown from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to prevent influencing private sector inventory practices. High prices in 2008 were driven by international supply concerns rather than physical shortages. Some policymakers suggested releasing crude from the SPR, but a drawdown was unlikely. The Bush Administration was urged to release crude from the SPR, but a drawdown was unlikely to significantly affect prices. Slumping demand and pessimistic economic forecasts led to a drop in crude oil prices, which eventually affected product prices. Legislation would require a report to Congress on acquiring refined products for the Reserve at minimal cost and disruption of markets, including assessing storage options and potential locations of facilities. Analysis would be needed to identify regions most likely affected by distribution issues and seasonal differences in products. The report would assess exchanging crude oil in the SPR for refined products to establish a refined product reserve. Arguments for include efficiency in market calming and addressing compromised refineries or pipelines. Arguments against include potential market disruption and overwhelming port facilities. Arguments against establishing a product reserve include the potential increase in availability of gasoline from abroad due to European diesel vehicle demand, the higher cost of storing refined products compared to crude, the need to periodically replace deteriorating products, and the complexity of storing different gasoline blends. Holding conventional gasoline in a product reserve with the expectation of EPA waivers during emergencies is suggested as a simpler alternative. The Bush Administration announced plans to purchase oil for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) in January 2009, including replacing oil sold after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, returning borrowed oil from refiners after Hurricane Gustav, delivering deferred royalty-in-kind (RIK) oil, and resuming RIK fill in May 2009. The government announced plans to fill the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) by resuming RIK fill in May 2009 at a volume of 26,000 barrels per day, totaling over 6.1 million barrels to be delivered by January 2010. This initiative aims to reach the SPR's capacity of 727 million barrels by early 2010. Secretary of Energy Bill Richardson requested $100 million in the FY2000 budget for oil purchases to support domestic producers. The proposal was rejected, leading to a plan for royalty-in-kind (RIK) oil payments from Gulf of Mexico leases. Despite initial resistance, a plan was announced in February 1999, with legislation introduced in Congress to support the initiative. Oil producers favored this approach due to concerns about the valuation system at the wellhead. The system for valuation of oil at the wellhead is complex and flawed. President Bush ordered the fill of the SPR to 700 million barrels using oil acquired as royalty-in-kind (RIK). Controversy arose when crude prices began to rise sharply in 2002, with some policymakers and analysts arguing that diverting RIK oil to the SPR instead of selling it in the open market was putting pressure on crude prices. The Administration disagreed with claims that RIK fill was responsible for the spike in crude prices. Legislative attempts to suspend RIK fill began in 2004. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 required the Secretary of Energy to develop procedures for filling the SPR considering various factors. DOE issued its final rule on the acquisition of petroleum for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve on November 8, 2006. In 2007, DOE resumed RIK fill of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve despite high gasoline prices. Congress passed P.L. 110-232 in response to rising prices. DOE rejected tying oil acquisition decisions to specific price differentials. Deliveries to the SPR totaled 140 million barrels through FY2007, costing the Department of Interior $4.6 billion in forgone receipts. Opponents of RIK fill in the 110th Congress were not necessarily opposed to the concept of an SPR. Objections were also ideological, contending that a government-owned strategic stock of petroleum is inappropriate and burdens the public sector with expenses that could be borne by the private sector. RIK fill resumed in 2009 and will end in early 2010, pending additional storage establishment. Richton, MS, is being evaluated as a possible expansion site for the SPR. The site in Richton, MS, is being considered for expanding the SPR, with $25 million allocated in the FY2010 budget. There have been debates over what constitutes a \"severe energy supply interruption\" and proposed legislation in the 111th Congress aims to amend drawdown authorities for the SPR and Northeast Heating Oil Reserve. The proposed legislation in the 111th Congress aims to allow a drawdown of the SPR and NHOR in the event of a \"severe energy supply disruption,\" with language including a price component in the definition of such a disruption. The debate over when to initiate a drawdown of SPR oil reflects shifts in oil markets after the 1970s experiences and deregulation. The rise in oil prices from 2005-2008 renewed interest in the debate over the appropriate time to call upon the SPR. The Reagan Administration's Drawdown Plan in late 1982 allowed for price-competitive sale of SPR oil without conditioning distribution on a trigger. Analysts agreed that marketplace reliance during shortages would be less disruptive than regulations. Some argued for early SPR drawdown to moderate price effects during shortages. The Administration revised its position in January 1984. In January 1984, the Reagan Administration announced a new policy for early drawdown of the SPR during disruptions, easing congressional discontent. Analysts emphasized the need for global coordination to prevent stock transfers during emergencies. The International Energy Agency agreed \"in principle\" to early drawdowns in July 1984, with decisions reserved for specific situations. This debate resurfaced after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in August 1990. The debate on whether to use the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) to address the gasoline price increase after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in August 1990. The George H. W. Bush Administration decided not to draw down the SPR to lower prices without a physical shortage. Some argued that a perceived shortage causes immediate damage and using the SPR to calm markets would have been beneficial. During the Gulf War crisis in 1990, the decision not to use the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) to lower prices was made. However, in January 1991, after the first air strike against Iraq, President Bush authorized a drawdown of the SPR. This led to a significant drop in crude oil prices due to optimistic reports about the allied forces' progress in crippling Iraqi air power. Despite criticism, the SPR drawdown was not necessary to stabilize markets. During the Persian Gulf War crisis in 1990, the decision not to use the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) to lower prices was criticized. However, in early 1991, more than 30 million barrels of SPR oil was put out to bid, with 17.3 million barrels sold and delivered. Legislation enacted by the 101st and 102nd Congress broadened the drawdown authority of the SPR to prevent shortages and price increases. The Energy Policy and Conservation Act (EPCA) allows exchanges of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) to acquire additional oil during supply shortages. Between 1996 and 2005, there were seven exchanges, with the most recent one in June 2006. ConocoPhillips and Citgo borrowed 750 thousand barrels of sour crude for refineries affected by a temporary closure. The Clinton Administration proposed selling 7 million barrels from the SPR in its FY1996 budget to help finance the program. Between 1996 and 2005, there were three sales of Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) oil totaling 28.1 million barrels, raising $544.7 million. The sales were for decommissioning, reducing the federal budget deficit, and offsetting appropriations. The SPR was filled with RIK oil to replace the sold volume. Prior to Hurricanes Ivan, Katrina, and Rita in 2005, oil demand was straining U.S. refinery capacity, altering the historic correlation between crude oil and refined products. The historic correlation between crude oil and refined oil product prices was altered in the early 2000s due to pressure on product supplies and international tensions. This led to a divorce in the traditional relationship between crude and product prices, as seen during Hurricanes Katrina and Rita when product shortages, not crude shortages, drove up prices. The rise in crude prices to over $140/barrel by the summer of 2008 was due to increasing international demand and concerns about outstripping world production. Market conditions were described as \"tight,\" with little spare production capacity. Refinery outages and weekly reports of U.S. crude stocks could lead to spikes in prices. Some argued that market conditions did not support the high prices. Significant and sustained increases in oil prices were observed in the absence of severe energy supply interruptions. Legislation in the Senate (S. 1462) proposed a price basis for authorizing a drawdown of the SPR. Some policymakers urged the Administration to release oil from the SPR during the spring and summer of 2008, but an SPR release may not necessarily lower prices. By mid-July 2008, U.S. gasoline prices were exceeding expectations. In mid-July 2008, U.S. gasoline prices surpassed $4.00/gallon and diesel fuel averaged $4.75/gallon as crude oil prices fluctuated. The price surge was influenced by factors like limited oil production capacity globally, inelastic demand for oil products, international tensions, the U.S. dollar value, and potential hurricane threats in the Gulf of Mexico. In July 2008, legislation to require a 10% drawdown of SPR oil failed in the House. The bill included a sale of 70 million barrels of light grade petroleum from the SPR within six months, with 20 million barrels to be offered for sale in the first 60 days. The oil would be replaced with \"sour\" crude within five years. The proposal for a 10% drawdown of SPR oil was partly based on a report by the Government Accountability Office, highlighting issues with the current oil grades in the SPR not aligning with refinery capabilities. Refiners mentioned potential penalties in gasoline and diesel production if lighter crude was used in units designed for heavier crudes. The impact of a 70 million barrel draw on prices was uncertain, as oil companies may not be interested in SPR oil without spare refining capacity. SPR oil is not sold below-market prices, and bids are only accepted under certain conditions. The announcement of tapping into the SPR may not lower oil prices if the oil industry shows limited interest in bidding on the supply. It is difficult to predict the impact of an SPR drawdown on oil prices due to various influencing factors. A unilateral drawdown of U.S. stocks may have less impact on the global oil market compared to a coordinated international drawdown like after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005. It may be unwise for the U.S. to draw down its strategic oil stocks while other nations maintain theirs. The SPR is seen as a defensive tool against high oil prices, but if used without impacting prices, it could lose its leverage. Lawmakers were concerned about the lower level of middle distillate contributing to high home heating oil prices in 1999-2000. The lower level of middle distillate stocks drew lawmakers' attention, leading to the establishment of a regional reserve for home heating oil. The Northeast Heating Oil Reserve (NHOR) was funded with $8 million in FY2001 and filled by October 2000 to provide 10 days of Northeast home heating oil demand. Controversy arose over the language governing the regional reserve for home heating oil. Opponents feared it could be used inappropriately and deter private sector inventory maintenance. The criteria for tapping into the reserve included a significant supply shortage or a price differential increase. The threshold was set high to avoid discouraging stockbuilding. The President could authorize a release in case of a regional supply shortage. During a general strike in Venezuela in late 2002, the United States experienced a loss of up to 1.5 million barrels of daily crude supply, leading to lower refinery utilization and reliance on refined product inventories for home heating oil during a cold winter. Prices remained stable despite a breach in the 60% differential due to a decline in crude prices. During a cold winter, the United States had to rely on refined product inventories to meet demand as prices rose. Calls were made for the use of the NHOR, but the price of heating oil fell short of the guidelines for a drawdown. Congress requested DOE to advise on NHOR usage, indicating dissatisfaction with the current formula. Despite rising home heating oil prices in 2005, the threshold for NHOR activation will increase. The President can still authorize an NHOR drawdown regardless of price. S. 283, introduced in 2009, allows NHOR drawdown based on price and supply. If home heating oil price exceeds $4.00/gallon in the Northeast, 20% of Reserve oil will be released on November 1, with additional releases if price remains high in December through March."
