    "content": "The Depository Institution Service Corporation Reform Act of 1994, also known as the Bank Service Corporation Act Amendments, includes reforms to the Bank Service Corporation Act. The Depository Institutions Service Corporation Act, also known as the Bank Service Corporation Act Amendments, defines key terms such as 'appropriate Federal banking agency', 'depository institution service corporation', 'Board', 'depository institution', 'insured depository institution', and 'institution-affiliated party'. The term 'invest' in the Federal Deposit Insurance Act includes any advance of funds to a depository institution service corporation. The term 'principal investor' refers to the insured depository institution with the largest dollar amount invested in the capital stock of the corporation. If multiple institutions have equal investments, the corporation must select one as its principal investor before commencing operations. The corporation must select an insured depository institution as its principal investor and inform the depository institution's Federal banking agency within 5 business days. The amount of investment in the depository institution service corporation is specified in Section 2. Depository institutions can invest in depository institution service corporations with certain limitations on the amount of investment allowed. An insured depository institution can invest up to 10% in a single corporation, 20% in multiple corporations, or 3% of its total assets in these corporations. Additionally, depository institution service corporations are restricted from paying management fees without prior approval from the appropriate Federal banking agency. Depository institutions can invest in depository institution service corporations with limitations on the amount of investment. These corporations are restricted from paying management fees to institution-affiliated parties without prior approval. Depository institutions can invest in depository institution service corporations to perform specific services for depository institutions, such as check sorting, interest computation, and mailing services. These corporations are also allowed to provide similar functions for other persons. A depository institution service corporation can provide authorized services to any person except taking deposits. They must adhere to services permissible for a national bank unless waived by the appropriate Federal banking agency under certain conditions. A depository institution service corporation can provide authorized services at any geographic location, excluding deposit taking, as determined by the Board to be permissible for a bank holding company under certain conditions. Prior approval is required for investments in depository institution service corporations. No insured depository institution can invest in a depository institution service corporation without prior approval from the appropriate Federal banking agency or the Board. Approval is based on financial and managerial considerations. The appropriate Federal banking agency or the Board must approve any investment by an insured depository institution in a depository institution service corporation. Approval is contingent on evaluating financial and managerial resources, future prospects, and potential adverse effects. If there is no action taken on an application within ninety days, it is automatically approved. SEC. 6. SERVICES TO NONSTOCKHOLDERS. No depository institution service corporation shall unreasonably discriminate in providing services to nonstockholding institutions based on competition with stockholding institutions, except if pricing reflects all costs or if comparable services are available elsewhere. Comparable services may be available from another source at competitive costs, or if providing services would exceed the practical capacity of the service corporation. SEC. 7. REGULATION AND EXAMINATION OF DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION SERVICE CORPORATIONS. Depository institution service corporations are subject to examination and regulation by the Federal banking agency of their principal investor. The agency of the principal shareholder can authorize other agencies to conduct examinations. These corporations are also subject to the provisions of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act as if they were insured depository institutions. The appropriate Federal banking agency is determined by the principal investor of the corporation. The depository institution service corporation, regularly examined by a Federal banking agency, must notify the agency within thirty days of any services performed by contract or otherwise, subject to regulation and examination to the same extent as if performed by the institution itself. The Board and the appropriate Federal banking agencies can issue regulations and orders to administer and carry out the purposes of this chapter and prevent evasions thereof."
