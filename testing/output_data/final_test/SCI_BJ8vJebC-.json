    "content": "Character-based neural machine translation models are effective but fragile when faced with noisy data. State-of-the-art models struggle with moderately noisy texts that humans can easily understand. To improve model robustness, two approaches are explored: structure-invariant word representations and robust training on noisy texts. A model based on a character convolutional neural network shows promise in learning representations resilient to various types of noise. Humans have robust language processing systems that can handle typos, misspellings, and even missing letters effortlessly. The psychology literature has shown that humans have a robust language processing system that can handle various forms of noise, such as typos, misspellings, and even missing letters. Studies have found that people can still comprehend text even when letters are jumbled or audio is played backwards. This robustness extends to reading in noisy environments, where comprehension only slows by 11%. The exact mechanisms of this system are not fully understood, but evidence suggests that we rely on word shape and can switch between whole word recognition and piecing words together from letters. Despite the robust language processing system in humans that can handle noise like typos and misspellings, neural machine translation systems are brittle and often produce unintelligible translations. Character-based NMT is a move to address the long-tailed distribution of out-of-vocabulary words. Neural Machine Translation (NMT) is crucial for handling out-of-vocabulary words and reducing computation load. Models based on characters and sub-word units excel in generalizing to unseen words and conjugations across various languages. However, training on clean data can make NMT models brittle and unsuitable for broad deployment. Performance degradation in translating German to English is observed with different types of noise, such as word permutation, letter swapping, and human errors. Even small amounts of noise can significantly decrease performance in Neural Machine Translation (NMT). Strategies for increasing model robustness include using structure-invariant representations and robust training on noisy data. A character CNN representation trained on various noise types proves to be robust. The goal is to spark discussions on robust training and modeling techniques in NMT and encourage the development of more resilient models. The conversation focuses on robust training and modeling techniques in NMT and the creation of linguistically accurate artificial noise. Adversarial examples show the dangers of using brittle machine learning systems, where small input changes can lead to model failures. White-box and black-box attacks are discussed, with a focus on potential malicious attacks using adversarial examples. In the realm of NLP, adversarial examples have been explored using various techniques such as the fast gradient sign method. Different approaches have been taken for white-box and black-box attacks in text classification and NLP evaluation. Character-based models have been evaluated for noise in morphological tagging and MT, with a focus on handling noise in memes through spelling correction. Simple methods for generating adversarial examples in NMT without access to model gradients are devised. Training with adversarial examples can improve model robustness by exposing it to different types of noise during training. Ensemble adversarial training, which involves training on examples from multiple pre-trained models, can further enhance the model's ability to handle adversarial examples. This approach is sensitive to the type of adversarial examples seen during training but can be made more robust through ensemble training with various types of noise. This method of training with noise serves as a form of regularization and ensures the model is better prepared to handle adversarial scenarios. The rise of end-to-end models in neural machine translation has sparked interest in understanding how these models learn linguistic properties at different levels. Character-level information is crucial in these models, and our study explores methods to increase their robustness by presenting them with noisy examples. We experiment with three NMT systems, including a fully character-level model trained on char2char sequences with attention. The model described in the curr_chunk is a character-level neural machine translation model trained on char2char sequences. It utilizes a complex encoder with convolutional, highway, and recurrent layers, along with a standard recurrent decoder. The model has shown excellent performance on German\u2192English and Czech\u2192English language pairs. Additionally, the use of Nematus, a popular NMT toolkit, with sequence-to-sequence architecture modifications operating on sub-word units using byte-pair encoding (BPE), was explored. The study experimented with both single best and ensemble BPE models but found no significant difference in performance under noise, reporting results with the single best WMT models for German/Czech\u2192English translation. The attentional sequence-to-sequence model with a charCNN word representation performs well on morphologically-rich languages. It has two LSTM layers in the encoder and decoder, using CNN over characters in each word with 1000 filters. The model is trained on the TED talks parallel corpus for testing. The TED talks parallel corpus is used for testing NMT systems and training charCNN models. The corpus is tokenized with the Moses tokenizer. Natural errors are harvested from available corpora to build a look-up table of lexical replacements. French BID25 collected Wikipedia edit histories to create the WiCoPaCo corpus, focusing on diacritics, homophones, and grammatical errors. German data combines projects from RWSE Wikipedia. The German data combines two projects: RWSE Wikipedia Revision Dataset BID54 and The MERLIN corpus of language learners BID52. The Czech errors come from manually annotated essays written by non-native speakers, revealing a diverse set of errors such as capitalization, consonant replacements, and inflection errors. This analysis provides insight into the difficulty of generating natural errors synthetically. The study involves inserting errors into parallel data in German and Czech by replacing words with errors from a dataset. Despite small datasets, up to half of the words in the corpus can be replaced with errors. Synthetic noise types are also experimented with. According to a study from Cambridge University, the order of letters in a word doesn't matter as long as the first and last letters are in the correct place. Swapping two letters is a common source of noise, especially when typing quickly. When typing quickly, swapping two letters is a common source of noise. Different types of noise can be applied to words, such as middle randomization, full randomization, and keyboard typos. These methods alter the order of letters in a word, except for the first and last letters, to introduce errors. Models trained on clean texts and tested on noisy texts show a significant drop in translation quality, with random scrambling producing the lowest BLEU scores. Humans are able to understand noisy texts better than machines, as shown in a comparison with a German native-speaker's translation. The study compared the translation performance of state-of-the-art systems with a German native-speaker, who had no trouble understanding and translating the text. They tested the effectiveness of spell-checkers on correcting natural errors in texts, finding that in French and German, there was often only a single predicted correction leading to improved BLEU scores. However, in Czech, a rich grammatical model would be necessary due to the multiple possible corrections. The three NMT models are sensitive to word structure, with char2char and charCNN models using convolutional layers on character sequences, while Nematus relies on sub-word units obtained with BPE. These models are sensitive to noise generated by character scrambling, and a potential model for improving robustness is meanChar, which averages character embeddings for word representation. The meanChar model, which averages character embeddings for word representation, is insensitive to scrambling but sensitive to other types of noise. It performs well on translating scrambled texts, outperforming charCNN on noisy texts. However, its performance degrades quickly on other types of noise like Nat and Key. The meanChar model is sensitive to Nat and Key types of noise, leading to decreased performance. To improve model robustness, black-box adversarial training is used with noisy training sets. Training on noisy text can enhance performance, with variations in effectiveness across different languages. The charCNN model trained on noisy text shows varying robustness to different types of noise. Models trained on specific noise types perform well on the same noise at test time. However, models trained on one type of noise do not generalize well to other types. Models trained on mixed noise are slightly worse than models trained on unmixed noise, but they are robust to the specific types of noise they were trained on. Models trained on mixed noise, including Rand, Key, and Nat noise, are robust to all noise kinds. Despite not excelling in any specific noise type, these models achieve the best overall results. The charCNN model, trained on a mix of noise types, performs well on scrambled characters, even though its convolutions are typically sensitive to character order. The model's ability to handle various noise types simultaneously is speculated to be due to different convolutional mechanisms. Different convolutional filters in charCNN models are speculated to learn to be robust to different kinds of noise. The weights learned by models trained on completely scrambled words, keyboard typos, natural human errors, and a mix of noise types are analyzed for variance across filter width and character embedding dimensions. This variance indicates how much a filter learns a uniform vs. non-uniform combination of characters. The weights learned by different convolutional filters in charCNN models are analyzed for variance across filter width and character embedding dimensions. The Rand model shows smaller variances compared to other settings, as random scrambling provides no patterns to detect. The Key and Nat settings introduce new patterns, leading to high variances. The ensemble model trained on mixed noise captures both uniform relationships and diverse patterns. The variance of variances in different character embedding dimensions is smallest in the Rand setting, larger in the mixed noise model, and largest in Key and Nat models. Filters in Key and Nat models are more different from each other, while in the Rand model, learned weights are of small variance. Models trained only on synthetic noise struggle with natural noise, which contains phonetic sources of noise. The most common sources of noise in the German dataset are phonetic or phonological phenomena and character omissions. Examples of noise include incorrect morphological conjugations, key swaps, character insertions, and orthographic variants. Synthetic noise generation does not capture phonological and omission errors well, leading to models struggling with natural noise. Character-based NMT models are fragile and break when exposed to different types of noise. Increasing robustness can be achieved by using a structure-invariant word representation. Future work is needed to make NMT models more robust against natural noise. Current methods focus on using structure-invariant word representation and ensemble training on adversarial examples. However, existing models struggle to capture rich characteristics of human errors. One potential approach is to explore using phonetic and syntactic structure to generate more realistic synthetic noise. Another direction is to design NMT architectures that are inherently robust to noise without explicit training data. Insights from psychology on how humans cope with natural noise could provide solutions to this challenge."
