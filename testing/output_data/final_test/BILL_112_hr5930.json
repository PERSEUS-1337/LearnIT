    "content": "The \"Preserving America's Downtowns and Heritage Act of 2012\" increases the rehabilitation credit for commercial buildings, with a 12.5 percent credit for buildings other than certified historic structures and a 25 percent credit for certified historic structures. The Act also introduces a rehabilitation credit for historic principal residences. The \"Preserving America's Downtowns and Heritage Act of 2012\" introduces a rehabilitation credit for historic principal residences under section 25E of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The \"Preserving America's Downtowns and Heritage Act of 2012\" introduces a 20 percent tax credit for qualified rehabilitation expenditures on historic homes. Qualified expenditures must be related to the certified rehabilitation of a historic home and eligible for depreciation under section 168. Certain expenditures are excluded from this credit. The rules of clauses (ii) and (iii) of section 47(c)(2)(B) apply to mixed-use or multifamily buildings. Only qualified rehabilitation expenditures properly allocable to the portion used as the taxpayer's principal residence are considered. Certified rehabilitation is defined as per section 47(c)(2)(C) and includes certification by a State Historic Preservation Officer with an approved program. The Secretary of the Interior approves rehabilitation of buildings for historic preservation, either through the National Historic Preservation Act or by certified local governments. Definitions and special rules apply, including the term \"qualified historic home\" for certified historic structures. A \"qualified historic home\" is a certified historic structure that has been substantially rehabilitated and is used as the taxpayer's principal residence. The term \"certified historic structure\" refers to any building and its structural components. The text chunk discusses the criteria for a building to be considered a \"qualified historic home,\" including being listed in the National Register or located in a registered historic district certified by the Secretary of the Interior. It also mentions that rehabilitation must be completed before certification and addresses ownership in cooperative housing corporations. The text discusses the limitations on the tax credit allowed for a taxable year, based on the regular tax liability and other credits available. It also mentions the carryforward of any unused credit to the following year. The excess tax credit for a taxable year can be carried forward to the next 5 years, with limitations on the amount that can be used each year. The excess tax credit for a taxable year can be carried forward to the next 5 years, with limitations on the amount that can be used each year. The applicable tax limit is defined as the limitation imposed by section 26(a)(2) for the taxable year reduced by the sum of the credits allowable under this subpart. Qualified rehabilitation expenditures are treated as made when the rehabilitation is completed or when properly chargeable to capital account as per regulations. Regulations also include a rule for recapture if property no longer qualifies for progress expenditures. The recapture provision applies if the taxpayer disposes of the building or if it ceases to be used as a principal residence or a certified historic structure within 5 years of completion. The taxpayer's tax for the year of disposition or cessation is increased by the recapture percentage of the credit allowed for prior years. The recapture percentage is determined according to a table, with amendments made for disposition or cessation events. Transfer between spouses or incident to divorce is exempt from these provisions. The subsections discuss tax treatment for transferred property, basis adjustments for credits, state processing fees for rehabilitation applications, and denial of double benefits under section 47. The Secretary will prescribe regulations for this section, including cases where part of a building is used as a principal residence and multiple taxpayers use the same dwelling unit. Conforming amendments are made to various sections of the Code by inserting references to section 25E. The Code is amended to include references to section 25E in various sections, such as 1400C(d) and 1016. Additionally, a clerical amendment is made to the table of sections. The amendments made by section 25E apply to rehabilitations starting after the enactment of the Act."
