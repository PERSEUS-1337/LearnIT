    "content": "The Act titled \"G.I. Advanced Education in Science and Technology Act\" aims to address the decline in US dominance in science and technology by creating a doctoral study program in engineering, mathematics, and technology for veterans. This decline is seen as a threat to jobs, industry, and national security. The G.I. Advanced Education in Science and Technology Act introduces stipends for veterans pursuing doctoral degrees in science or technology under a new subchapter in Chapter 30 of title 38, United States Code. The G.I. Advanced Education in Science and Technology Act establishes stipends for eligible doctoral candidates pursuing full-time doctoral degrees in engineering, mathematics, or technology disciplines. Eligible candidates must meet specific requirements outlined in the subchapter. The G.I. Advanced Education in Science and Technology Act provides stipends for eligible doctoral candidates pursuing full-time doctoral degrees in engineering, mathematics, or technology disciplines. Payments are in addition to other educational assistance programs and can be made for up to 60 months. The Secretary will pay eligible candidates pursuing a doctoral degree at an institution of higher learning. The G.I. Advanced Education in Science and Technology Act provides stipends for eligible doctoral candidates pursuing full-time doctoral degrees in engineering, mathematics, or technology disciplines at a monthly rate of $1,200. The Secretary adjusts the rate for inflation annually based on the Consumer Price Index. Payments are subject to certain requirements for eligible doctoral candidates. The G.I. Advanced Education in Science and Technology Act stipulates that eligible doctoral candidates must be accepted into an accredited doctoral program, provide annual documentation of full-time enrollment, and maintain good academic standing to receive stipends. Payments are limited to a 10-year period after discharge from active duty in the Armed Forces. Amendments are made to ensure consistency within the subchapter. Amendments are made to change references from \"education assistance under this chapter\" to \"educational assistance under this subchapter\" in various sections of title 38, United States Code. Additionally, a clerical amendment is made to the table of sections at the beginning of chapter 30 to reflect these changes. \"Subchapter V outlines stipends for veterans pursuing doctoral degrees in science or technology, including details on duration, amount, requirements, and time limitations for payments.\""
