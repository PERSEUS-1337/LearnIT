    "content": "The people of California enact the following. Section 10010 of the Elections Code in California is amended to require a political subdivision transitioning to district-based elections to hold at least two public hearings before drawing draft maps of district boundaries. Public outreach, including to non-English-speaking communities, is encouraged to explain the districting process and encourage public participation. The political subdivision must publish at least one draft map and hold two additional hearings for public input on the draft map and election sequence. Draft maps must be published at least seven days before a hearing and revised maps must be available for public review for seven days before adoption. In determining the final sequence of district elections for staggered terms, the governing body must consider the California Voting Rights Act and district members' preferences. This applies to transitioning from at-large to district-based elections, with defined terms for each method. Before taking legal action to enforce Sections 14027 and 14028 of the California Voting Rights Act, a prospective plaintiff must send a written notice to the political subdivision by certified mail. The political subdivision has 45 days to respond or may pass a resolution to transition from at-large to district-based elections within that time frame. If a political subdivision passes a resolution to transition to district-based elections, a prospective plaintiff cannot enforce Sections 14027 and 14028 for 90 days after the resolution's passage. If a political subdivision adopts district-based elections, a prospective plaintiff can demand reimbursement for work product costs within 30 days. The demand must be substantiated with financial documentation, and reimbursement should be made within 45 days, except in certain circumstances. The reimbursement amount requested must be supported by financial documentation and should be paid within 45 days, with a cap on the maximum reimbursement specified. The political subdivision must reimburse prospective plaintiffs in the order they sent notice, with a 45-day time limit for the first plaintiff. Reimbursements are capped at $30,000 annually adjusted to the Consumer Price Index. If the Commission on State Mandates finds that this act imposes state-mandated costs, reimbursement to local agencies and school districts will be provided according to the Government Code."
