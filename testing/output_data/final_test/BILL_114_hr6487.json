The Federal Housing Finance Agency will establish pilot programs for small lender risk transfer and mortgage insurance risk transfer, requiring enterprises to engage in front-end risk sharing transactions with eligible mortgage originators for the next 5 years. The Director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency will require enterprises to establish a 5-year pilot program to increase risk transfer using private mortgage insurance. The program mandates the enterprises to purchase qualifying loans or loan pools annually to transfer risk. The enterprises must maintain a principal balance of qualifying loans totaling at least $50,000,000,000. The Director and Secretary of the Treasury can reduce the required loan purchases if necessary to prevent a negative impact on the housing market. Additionally, for each transaction in the pilot program involving a qualifying loan, mortgage insurance must be selected. Under the pilot program, the loan originator selects an eligible mortgage insurance provider for qualifying loans. Mortgage insurance premiums for purchased loans must comply with State laws. The enterprises will establish guarantee fees based on reduced credit risk from new risk-transfer transactions. The Director will submit a report to Congress after the fifth year of the pilot program to assess its effectiveness. The pilot program assesses credit risk transfer, reduced guarantee fees, and benefits for borrowers. The Director may extend the program if deemed in the public interest. Additional requirements can be imposed to mitigate counterparty risk. Definitions are provided for clarity.
