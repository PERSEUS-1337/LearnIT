The section is titled the \"Immigrants to New Americans Act\" and highlights the significant increase in the foreign-born population in the United States, with projections showing that immigrants will contribute to 75 percent of the country's population growth over the next 50 years. The wave of immigrants in the United States has positively influenced the nation's image and relationship with other countries. The diverse cultural heritage of immigrants has shaped the nation's culture, customs, economy, and communities. There is a critical shortage of teachers with the skills needed to educate immigrant students and their families in various communities. The influx of immigrant families settling into high-poverty areas presents a national dilemma as the number of families requiring assistance in schools is increasing without enough teachers with the necessary skills to accommodate their needs. Funding for programs to support immigrant students and their families in schools and communities is inadequate. The influx of immigrant families settling in the United States is often due to local employers valuing immigrant labor. These employers benefit from a committed workforce and new market opportunities. However, communities need assistance to support immigrant students and families in schools and communities. The purpose of this section is to establish a grant program that provides funding to partnerships of local educational agencies and community-based organizations for the development of model programs to support immigrant students and their families in elementary and secondary schools in the United States. The Secretary of Education is authorized to award grants to partnerships for model programs to assist immigrant students in achieving success in U.S. schools through various educational services. The Secretary of Education awards grants to partnerships for model programs to assist immigrant students in U.S. schools. Grants support services like parent education, literacy development, and community social services. Each grant lasts up to 5 years, with funds available for planning and program design in the first year. Partnerships must submit grant applications as required by the Secretary. To be eligible for a grant under this section, partnerships must include a local educational agency and a community-based organization, and may also involve other entities with expertise in working with immigrants. Each application must include documentation showing the partnership has qualified personnel. The partnership must have qualified personnel for the proposed program and the leadership of each participating school must be involved in the program's development. The application should include a list of partnering organizations and a description of the need for the program, including data on immigrant students and those with limited English proficiency. The program must consider students' native languages, English proficiency, achievement data in reading, language arts, and mathematics, as well as their previous schooling experiences. It should also outline program goals and how funds will be utilized. The grant application must include a description of how funds will supplement basic services for immigrant students, activities planned by the partnership, involvement of parents and community members, methods to enhance academic achievement, and teacher training. The grant application must include methods of teacher training, parent education, dissemination of information to immigrant parents, coordinating community social services, and evaluating progress towards program goals. The grant application must include methods of teacher training, parent education, dissemination of information to immigrant parents, coordinating community social services, and evaluating progress towards program goals. The program should also describe how information on model programs will be shared with other educational agencies, provide annual program effectiveness information to the Secretary, and include any additional information required by the Secretary for grant selection. The Secretary will select partnerships for grants based on program quality, addressing language and cultural differences, activities proposed, parental and community involvement, availability of social services, and plan for measuring success. The Secretary will approve applications ensuring programs serve diverse areas of the nation, including immigrant communities. Each partnership receiving a grant must conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the program. The program under this section must conduct an evaluation report on its impact, including data on progress towards program goals and student performance standards. The program must provide data on student academic achievement in reading, language arts, and mathematics, as well as coordination with the school's overall program and other educational services. Additionally, data on access to community social services for families served by the program must be included. The Secretary may require comprehensive community social services information and up to 5% of grant funds for administrative purposes. $10,000,000 is authorized for fiscal year 2001 for this program."
