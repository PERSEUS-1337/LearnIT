    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Military Spouse Education and Employment Act of 2008\" and includes definitions. SEC. 2 of the \"Military Spouse Education and Employment Act of 2008\" defines \"congressional defense committees\" as specific Senate and House committees and \"qualified military spouse\" as a spouse of a member of the Armed Forces on extended active duty. SEC. 3. Eligibility of spouses of military personnel for the work opportunity credit. The amendment to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 allows for a new category of eligible individuals, including qualified military spouses and eligible teleworking military spouses. This expands the eligibility for the work opportunity credit. The term 'qualified military spouse' refers to an individual certified by a local agency as the spouse of a member of the Armed Forces on extended active duty. An enhanced credit is provided for eligible teleworking military spouses. The credit for eligible teleworking military spouses is equal to 40 percent of qualified wages paid by the employer during the eligibility period. An eligible teleworking military spouse is defined as a spouse of a member of the Armed Forces, whose employment with an employer is primarily at their principal residence, and who receives qualified wages. An eligible teleworking military spouse must have qualified wages that are expected to exceed 150 percent of the median annual earnings in the United States. The period begins on the hiring date of the individual and ends on the last day of employment or the last day of the taxable year when the spouse stops being a member of the Armed Forces. If employment and wage requirements are not met, certain clauses apply. If employment and wage requirements are not met, an individual will cease to be an eligible teleworking military spouse with the employer at the beginning of the taxable year. The employer cannot treat the individual as an eligible teleworking military spouse for any subsequent taxable year, except in cases of unforeseen circumstances or beyond the employer's control. The term 'qualified wages' for eligible teleworking military spouses is defined in subsection (b)(1) with a maximum limit of $12,000. The amendments in this section apply to individuals who start working for the employer after the enactment date. Federal employment preferences are outlined in Section 4. Military spouses are now eligible for preference in federal employment. The amendment allows the wife or husband of an individual serving on active duty or with orders for active duty over 90 days to receive preference. Additionally, preference eligible individuals under specific sections can now receive 5 extra points on competitive service examinations. SEC. 5. TRANSFERABILITY OF ENTITLEMENT TO BASIC EDUCATIONAL ASSISTANCE. Transferability as Incentive To Reenlist for Third Term of Service in the Armed Forces is amended to apply to members who have completed two terms of service and reenlisted for a third term. The text chunk involves amending terms of service for members reenlisting for a third term in the Armed Forces. It includes changes to the number of terms required for reenlistment. SEC. 6.
