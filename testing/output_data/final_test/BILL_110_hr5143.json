    "content": "The Act titled \"Securing Success for Veterans on Campus Act of 2008\" establishes Centers of Excellence for Veteran Student Success under the Higher Education Act of 1965. Model programs for these centers are outlined in the legislation. The Act aims to establish model programs at institutions of higher education to support veteran student success by addressing their academic, financial, physical, and social needs through grants awarded for a 3-year period. The Act aims to establish a Center of Excellence for Veteran Student Success on campus, a support team for veteran students, and provide a coordinator for comprehensive support services. The Center of Excellence for Veteran Student Success on campus will have a coordinator responsible for coordinating the model program, monitoring veteran student enrollment, persistence, and completion rates, and developing a sustainability plan. Additionally, the grant can be used for outreach, recruitment, and supportive services for veteran students. The program offers personal, academic, and career counseling, tutoring, assistance with admissions and credit transfer, student financial aid, housing support, cultural events, and support for veteran student organizations. The institution of higher education must provide support for veteran student organizations, coordinate academic advising with military bases, and offer other necessary services to ensure the success of veteran students in achieving their educational and career goals. To be considered for a grant, the institution must submit an application to the Secretary and selection considerations will be based on specified criteria. The Secretary will consider the number of veteran students enrolled, the need for model programs at various types of institutions, equitable distribution of grants, evaluation, and accountability plan for funded programs. Develop an evaluation and accountability plan for model programs funded under this section to measure the impact on postsecondary education enrollment, persistence, and completion for veterans. Authorization of appropriations for fiscal year 2009 and the following 4 years is provided."
