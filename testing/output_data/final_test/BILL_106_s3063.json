Key factors are listed in order of importance based on their effects on the credit score. Consumer reporting agencies are required to disclose credit scores under the Fair Credit Reporting Act. Consumer reporting agencies must disclose credit scores under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, including the consumer's current or most recent credit score, the range of possible credit scores, key factors affecting the score, the date the score was created, and the entity that provided the credit score. Consumer reporting agencies are required to disclose credit scores under the Fair Credit Reporting Act.
