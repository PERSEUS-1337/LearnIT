    "content": "Congress has authorized student loan repayments for highly qualified employees in the executive and legislative branches, including the House of Representatives, the Senate, and various government agencies. Repayments can be up to $10,000 annually and $60,000 in total for some agencies, while others have different limits. A service agreement of at least three years is required in the executive branch. The executive branch requires a service agreement of at least three years for student loan repayments. The Volcker Commission recommended establishing a federal service loan forgiveness program for federal service. The commission focused on strengthening the effectiveness of career services in government. The federal government faces challenges in recruiting and retaining a quality workforce due to inadequate compensation and unattractiveness of government employment to recent college graduates. Student loan repayments were authorized by Congress to address these issues, along with concerns about a potential wave of retirements in the next few years. Legislative branch also implemented similar repayment programs to tackle recruitment and retention problems. The report examines branch implementation and oversight of student loan repayments. Senator Ted Stevens introduced a bill to authorize repayment of student loans for federal employees to improve recruitment of top college graduates. Agencies would have discretion to use the authority to recruit highly qualified individuals important to their mission. Agencies would be required to absorb the expense of loan repayment from their existing payroll budget. Senator Stevens introduced a bill authorizing repayment of student loans for federal employees to improve recruitment. The provision requires agencies to absorb loan repayment expenses from their existing payroll budget, ensuring the authority is used sparingly. The bill also includes provisions for at least three years of service, acceptable performance levels, and cessation of loan repayments if the employee separates from federal service. Senator Pryor emphasized agencies' discretion in determining repayment amounts and employee commitment length. The bill introduced by Senator Stevens authorizes repayment of student loans for federal employees, with agencies required to absorb the costs. Representative Gilman introduced a similar bill in the House of Representatives, aiming to make the Federal Government an employer of choice for top students. Repayment would come from existing funds at the time of appointment. The Public Service Education Assistance Act of 1990 (H.R. 2544) was discussed in a hearing by the Civil Service Subcommittee. Representative Ford described it as a \"GI bill for civil servants.\" OPM Director Constance Newman expressed concerns about the student loan repayment provisions in the bill. The concerns related to student loan repayment provisions in H.R. 2544 include issues with inducing people to work for the government temporarily for loan repayment, equity of recruitment incentives, limiting coverage to occupations with difficulty in recruiting critical skills, administrative feasibility, lack of central regulatory authority, employee repayment responsibility, and lack of limit on repayment commitment size. The concerns related to student loan repayment provisions in H.R. 2544 include issues with inducing people to work for the government temporarily for loan repayment and ensuring that participants have a genuine intent to serve the public. The legislation is seen as a way to enrich the talent pool of government and help young people start their careers. According to witnesses, entry-level government pay is not competitive with the private sector, leading to unattractive career choices for young people with student loans. Suggestions were made to increase repayments for longer government service to encourage retention. The legislation raises concerns about borrower record documentation, correct application of federal loan checks, accountability for delinquency due to paperwork errors, and potential employee default on loans. The bill H.R. 2544 addresses concerns about employee delinquency or default on loans due to performance issues or separation from government service. It differs from the Senate bill by excluding state government student loans and emphasizes the need for a balanced workforce in government service. H.R. 2544 authorized OPM to set regulations for uniformity in programs to address difficulties in recruiting and retaining skilled personnel in the federal government. This was based on findings from the Volcker Commission and reports highlighting pay disparities, negative public service image, and lack of career information as hindrances to attracting top candidates. The authority aims to recruit top candidates for federal government employment through a repayment program as a recruiting tool for critical skills. The committee acknowledges criticisms of potential disparate treatment based on indebtedness but emphasizes the need for remedies in the federal compensation system. It intends to balance high loan indebtedness with limited resources for new initiatives and employee benefits. The Congressional Budget Office estimated the cost of the student loan repayment program in 1991 to be between $2 and $3 million, potentially increasing to $10 to $15 million by 1995. The Department of Education and the Department of Justice opposed the provisions of H.R. 2544 to establish the program, citing concerns about high costs and overly generous repayment amounts. The Department of Education and the Department of Justice opposed the student loan repayment program due to concerns about high costs, overly generous repayment amounts, and setting a dangerous precedent. They believed the program would not significantly impact recruitment needs or students' decisions to enter the Federal service. The student loan repayment program offers a potential windfall for employees, aggravating retention issues as some may leave after completing three years to take advantage of the program. The program authorizes payments up to $6,000 per year, exceeding cash awards or merit pay bonuses, potentially disadvantaging employees without student loans. The student loan repayment program may lead to inequity and demoralization among federal employees not participating in the program, potentially causing retention problems. The Federal government should not penalize employees who did not finance their education through student loans. The Department of Justice also expressed concerns about the program's effectiveness in recruitment and retention. The student loan repayment program may lead to inequity and demoralization among federal employees not participating in the program, potentially causing retention problems. Justice believed that the program would require treating candidates differently based on their indebtedness, which could outweigh the minimal benefits gained. Representative Gilman offered provisions to be applied systemwide to all Federal agencies. Representative Gilman offered provisions to be applied systemwide to all Federal agencies, with the Department of Defense supporting the amendment as an important tool for recruiting and retaining qualified personnel. The National Commission on the Public Service also praised the provisions as a step forward in ensuring government services are performed by competent personnel. The House approved the amendment on September 11, 1990, and it became law on November 5, 1990. The President signed H.R. 4739 on November 5, 1990, becoming P.L. 101-510, which included a student loan repayment program. OPM proposed regulations for the program in June 2000, with final regulations taking effect on April 12, 2001. Senator Richard Durbin later offered an amendment to expand the program in the Floyd D. Spence National Defense Authorization Act for FY2001. The amendment No. 3480 broadened student loan repayment programs, extending eligibility to non-GS federal employees and expanding the types of loans eligible for repayment. The Senate approved the amendment on June 20, 2000, and it became law under H.R. 4205 on October 30, 2000. OPM proposed regulations for the program on March 16, 2001, which became effective on August 30, 2001. During its first session in 2001, the 107th Congress passed legislation to extend the student loan repayment program to specific legislative branch entities. The FY2002 Legislative Branch Appropriations Act authorized Senate employing offices to establish a program for Senate employees, while the FY2002 Department of Defense Appropriations Act granted authority to the U.S. Capitol Police to offer a student loan repayment program for recruitment and retention purposes. The House of Representatives attempted but failed to establish a similar program for House employees. The FY2002 Legislative Branch Appropriations Bill, H.R. 2647, was introduced to include legislative branch employees in the federal agency student loan repayment program. Despite initial resistance, Representative James Moran advocated for a uniform policy and urged the Committee on House Administration to develop guidelines promptly. However, the bill did not ultimately provide for this benefit. The Consolidated Appropriations Resolution, 2003 (P.L. 108-7) provided authority for a student loan repayment program for House employees. Additionally, P.L. 108-7 granted authority to the U.S. Capitol Police to establish a similar program. Legislation (S. 926) increased the annual and aggregate limitations on student loan repayments to $10,000 per year and $60,000 in total. Legislation (S. 926) increased the student loan repayment amount for employees in the executive branch, GAO, GPO, and the Library of Congress from $6,000 to $10,000 per year and from $40,000 to $60,000 in total. The cost of implementing the legislation was estimated to be less than $500,000 a year. The amendments were made to address the increase in annual college tuition costs since 1991 to maintain the competitive value of the recruitment and retention tool. The House of Representatives passed S. 926 by voice vote on October 28, 2003. The House of Representatives passed legislation (S. 926) to increase student loan repayment amounts for government employees, citing the need to attract public service-minded individuals. Representative Danny Davis highlighted the underutilization of the program due to limited agency funding, emphasizing the importance of promoting Federal civil service to compete for top talents. Agencies would fund student loan repayments from their own budgets under the proposed bill. The National Defense Authorization Act for FY2004 increased student loan repayment amounts from $6,000 to $10,000 per year, effective January 1, 2004. Regulations implementing the higher amounts were published in April 2004. Different legislative branch agencies have established student loan repayment programs at various stages. Legislators sought uniform guidelines to assist agencies in writing regulations and service agreements. The FY2002 Legislative Branch appropriations bill directed the Legislative Branch Financial Managers Council to develop controls and criteria for student loan repayment program implementation. The LBFMC consulted with legislative branch entities, performed a comparative analysis, and reported recommendations to the House and Senate appropriations subcommittees by March 1, 2002. In 2002, the LBFMC reported analysis and recommendations to House and Senate appropriations subcommittees on legislative branch agencies following recommended guidelines. The student loan repayment program is authorized by 5 U.S.C. \u00a75379 for federal employees including permanent, temporary, term, and excepted appointments. The student loan repayment program for federal employees allows for repayments of up to $10,000 annually and $60,000 in total. This benefit can be used in conjunction with other recruitment and retention incentives. Repayments are not subject to the Title 5 provision limiting employee pay. Employees must sign an agreement to work for the agency. An employee seeking student loan repayment must sign a written agreement to work for the agency repaying the loan for at least three years. The agreement specifies employment conditions such as position, duties, work schedule, and performance level. If the employee voluntarily separates from the agency, fails to maintain performance standards, or violates the agreement, they become ineligible for loan repayment benefits. An employee who fails to complete the required period of service must reimburse the agency for any repayment benefits received, through debt collection procedures. Reimbursement is not required if the employee is involuntarily separated for reasons other than misconduct or performance. The agency head may waive the right of recovery if it goes against equity or the public interest. The agency head must establish a student loan repayment plan with specific elements, including designating officials, criteria for repayments, procedures, fair selection of employees, service agreements, and recovery provisions for employees who do not complete the required service period. The OPM regulations establish criteria for loan repayments based on the agency's need to fill or retain highly qualified candidates. Written determinations must be made before recruitment or retention of employees. The OPM regulations establish criteria for loan repayments based on the agency's need to retain highly qualified employees. Written determinations must be made before recruitment or retention of employees, considering the essential need for the employee's services and the potential impact on the agency's mission. Eligible student loans for repayment include those made, insured, or guaranteed under specific titles of the Higher Education Act of 1965. Agencies must also consider maintaining a balanced workforce with appropriate representation of women and minority groups. The OPM regulations establish criteria for loan repayments based on the agency's need to retain highly qualified employees. Eligible student loans for repayment include various federal loan programs such as Federal Family Education Loans, Federal Stafford Loans, Federal PLUS Loans, Federal Consolidation Loans, and others under the Higher Education Act of 1965 and the Public Health Service Act. The OPM regulations outline criteria for loan repayments based on agency needs to retain qualified employees. Eligible loans include LDS, PCL, NSL, HPSL, and HEAL. Student loan repayments by federal entities are subject to tax liability, with details on reporting, withholding, and tax calculations provided by the IRS. An example shows a single employee with taxable income between $31,850 and $77,100 facing a 25% federal income tax rate for a $10,000 repayment. A bill is pending in the Senate to exclude student loan repayments from gross income for federal income tax purposes. Senator George Voinovich introduced the Generating Opportunity by Forgiving Educational Debt for Service Act of 2007. The bill aims to help Federal agencies and the Armed Forces recruit talented individuals. S. 1047 aims to exclude student loan repayments from gross income for federal income tax purposes, as well as from the definition of wages under the Internal Revenue Code and Social Security. The bill requires OPM to report annually to Congress on the implementation of student loan repayment programs in federal agencies. Legislation (H.R. 1765, Section 3, 109th Congress) would have required the OPM report to include information on agencies without student loan repayment programs. Senator Akaka introduced S. 2450, the Homeland Security Education Act, which proposed a pilot program to repay student loans for federal employees with specific skills. The legislation proposed a student loan repayment program for federal employees with critical skills, allowing agencies to set aside funds to repay eligible student loans. Repayments would be direct payments made on behalf of employees, with agencies required to allocate enough funds to repay loans for at least half of the employees with identified critical skills needed. Eligible loans included those under Title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965 and health education assistance loans under the Public Health Service Act. The proposed program under Section 5379a of Title VII or Title VIII of the Public Health Service Act would have provided benefits to employees recruited with critical skills for a five-year period. The OPM Director would have proposed regulations within 60 days of enactment, with final regulations issued within 180 days. Reporting on the program's implementation to Congress would have been required within 180 days of enactment. The proposed Section 5379a program would have required OPM to report on its impact in recruiting and retaining employees with critical skills. Agencies would need to provide necessary information to OPM for the program. Appropriations would be authorized to enable the recruitment and retention of employees with critical skills. OPM also published proposed regulations to revise rules governing student loan repayments. The actions taken in approving a student loan repayment include restrictions on using it for recruitment, specifying eligible loans, counting the full gross amount towards the benefit cap, and allowing modifications for additional repayments by mutual agreement between the agency and the employee. The curr_chunk discusses the requirements for service agreements related to student loan repayments, including provisions for additional repayments, conditions for repayment if an employee transfers to a different agency, consequences for violating conditions, reimbursement for incomplete service periods, record retention, and agency responsibilities. The curr_chunk discusses the flexibility of executive branch agencies in implementing student loan repayment programs, including sample repayment plans and agency best practices. OPM reports to Congress on student loan repayments based on agency reports. In FY2005, 28 executive branch agencies made repayments to 4,171 employees at a total cost of $26,663,897, an increase from FY2004. All 15 cabinet agencies implemented repayment programs, with an average payment of $6,009 for cabinet agencies and $8,405 for non-cabinet agencies. In FY2001, OPM reported one student loan repayment made by the Department of Health and Human Services for $6,000. By FY2003, 22 executive branch agencies made repayments to 1,802 employees at a total cost of $7,984,207. Table A-1 in the Appendix provides data on repayments in executive and legislative branch agencies. The top four agencies in FY2005 were the Department of Justice with 1,092 employees receiving repayments. In FY2005, the Department of Justice had the greatest increase in the number of recipients for student loan repayments, followed by the Departments of Defense, State, and the Securities and Exchange Commission. Other executive branch agencies with more than 50 employees receiving repayments included the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the Department of Veterans Affairs, and the Department of Health and Human Services. In FY2005, the Department of Justice, Defense, State, and the Securities and Exchange Commission had the highest costs for student loan repayments. The cost of repayments increased significantly at Justice, Defense, and the Securities and Exchange Commission from FY2004 to FY2005. About 21% of recipients work as attorneys or criminal investigators. The OPM report provides information on the occupations of recipients in agencies with the largest participation in the student loan repayment program. At the Department of Justice, repayments were mainly given to special agents, intelligence analysts, trial attorneys, investigative specialists, and support service clerks/technicians. FBI employees make up 90.5% of recipients. At the Department of Defense, mechanical engineers, contract specialists, nuclear engineers, information technology specialists, and electrical/electronics engineers received the most repayments. At the Department of State, 599 recipients were identified. At the Department of State, 599 recipients were members of the Foreign Service and 210 were General Schedule civil service employees. The largest number of recipients were in positions such as Political Affairs Officer, Economics Officer, Public Diplomacy Officer, Administrative Management, and Consular Officer. At the Securities and Exchange Commission, repayments were used primarily to recruit and retain attorney-advisers, staff accountants, and securities compliance examiners. Approximately 77% of repayments made by the SEC were at the annual maximum amount of $10,000. Some executive branch agencies have not offered student loan repayments, citing reasons such as higher-graded positions being filled by individuals with no student loan debts, recruitment not being an issue, and meeting hiring targets. OPM reported positive feedback on the impact of student loan repayments on recruitment and retention in its FY2005 report. The Department of the Interior, Department of Labor, and NASA utilize repayment programs to attract and retain skilled employees in various fields such as engineering, environmental science, and financial analysis. NASA specifically uses the program for recruiting highly skilled individuals. NASA utilizes its repayment program to recruit highly skilled graduates from undergraduate and graduate school programs, targeting benefits for participants in various programs. In 2004, 21 out of 27 agencies reported a positive impact on recruitment and retention efforts through student loan repayment. DOD provided an example of recruiting 335 college graduates in various fields over two years, meeting recruitment goals in science, engineering, and information technology. Several agencies, including the Department of Education and Department of Energy, have reported success in recruiting and retaining highly skilled personnel through student loan repayment programs. For example, the Department of Education recruited eight skilled PMFs and the Department of Energy hired four Technical Interns using this program. Overall, agencies have found that the program has assisted them in recruiting and retaining qualified employees. The program has helped agencies recruit and retain highly qualified personnel. Comments from agencies using the program mentioned that repayments allowed them to compete with the private sector in recruiting top employees, increased interest at college campuses, and improved workforce diversity. For retention, repayments reduced attrition among new hires, helped fill positions requiring specific skills, and boosted employee morale. Most agencies in FY2004 did not have specific metrics to measure the effectiveness of student loan repayments, but some had established metrics or were working on it. HUD, OPM, and other agencies are implementing repayment programs with baseline metrics on employee satisfaction, retention rates, and service agreement statistics. Administrative burden is a common challenge, with tasks like verifying loan information and ensuring proper payments placing heavy demands on staff resources. Some agencies delegate approval to lower management levels and provide lump sum repayments to recipients. In FY2005, agencies varied in how they administered funding for repayment programs. Examples included HUD centrally allocating funds, State Department centrally funding and administering repayments based on recruitment needs, and Federal Energy Regulatory Commission delegating salary funds to program offices. Repayment eligibility is determined by recruitment and retention difficulty factors, with amounts depending on annual funding and employee eligibility. The Commission allocates salary funds to program offices based on employment totals, which then manage repayments. Treasury Department reserves funds for incentives like student loan repayments. DOD justifies repayments for recruitment and retention needs. Export-Import Bank reviews requests based on recruitment challenges and availability of funds. OPM notes agencies delegate budgeting decisions for student loan repayments. OPM assists agencies in budget planning for student loan repayments, citing fiscal constraints as a major barrier. Lack of funding, tax liability, and service agreement requirements are key obstacles. 18 out of 22 agencies reported fiscal constraints as a hindrance to using student loan repayments in FY2005. In FY2005, lack of funding was a major impediment to using student loan repayments. Some agencies recommended eliminating tax liability and reducing the service requirement. Legislation would be needed to make these changes. H.R. 1765 and S. 1255, pending in the 109th Congress, aim to address the tax liability issue. In FY2003, agencies used various methods to publicize their repayment programs for recruitment and retention purposes. OPM hosted a focus group on student loan repayments in September 2004, and two interagency forums were conducted in August and December 2005 to exchange information on program implementation. OPM established an interagency working group and email list server in 2005 to share information on student loan repayment programs. The group has met multiple times, with plans for increased use of repayments in FY2006. GAO recommended improvements in program efficiency and administration, including streamlining tasks and creating a central database of student loan lenders. Examples of program improvements include creating a central database of student loan lender information and establishing a shared service center arrangement for student loan repayments. Efforts to provide agencies assistance and facilitate coordination of leading practices, help agencies monitor long-term program effects on recruitment and retention needs. This could provide a consistent set of governmentwide indicators for OPM to assess and report to Congress on the program's overall results. OPM concurred with GAO's recommendations and addressed data requirements and indicators as part of its comments on the report. The EHRI data warehouse will enhance OPM's ability to track the success of the student loan repayment program. The HR Line of Business initiative aims to consolidate and automate the program cost-effectively. OPM hosted forums to discuss GAO recommendations, including employees' responsibility to have their loan papers in order. Departments were encouraged to develop budget plans for recruitment and retention. OPM encouraged departments and agencies to develop a budget plan for using recruitment and retention incentives, including student loan repayments. Director Linda Springer requested FY2005 data for the annual report on student loan repayments and ways OPM could assist with programs. Interest in student loan repayment exists in the legislative branch, but no single policy applies evenly. The 1990 student loan repayment statute provided authority to GAO, GPO, and the Library of Congress. The FY2002 Legislative Branch Appropriations Act (P.L. 107-68, H.R. 2647) authorized student loan repayment programs for the Senate and CBO, while the Department of Defense Appropriations Act (P.L. 107-117, H.R. 3338) extended similar authority to the U.S. Capitol Police. In the 108th Congress, legislation was passed authorizing a program for House employees under P.L. 108-7. The Legislative Branch Financial Managers Council (LBFMC) was directed to develop controls and criteria for student loan repayment program implementation in consultation with all Legislative Branch entities. They conducted a comparative analysis, consulted with each entity, and recommended governing controls and criteria for the repayment programs. The recommendations were reported to the House and Senate appropriations subcommittees on February 27, 2002. The recommendations for the student loan repayment program in the legislative branch include criteria for authorizing officials, service agreements, repayment amounts, eligibility, eligible loans, exceptions, records, and program review. The duration of service agreements varies from one to three years, with flexibility for different branches due to election cycles. The program aims to attract highly qualified individuals with competitive benefits packages. The legislative branch agencies have service agreements ranging from one to three years, with a one-year agreement for the House and Senate due to election cycle impacts. Some Members support student loan repayment programs to address high turnover and \"brain drain\" among younger congressional staff with significant student loan debt. The Staff Employment Study by the Congressional Management Foundation found that a high percentage of Senate and House staff hold bachelor's or advanced degrees. There is a debate about the necessity of a student loan forgiveness program as a recruitment incentive for congressional jobs, with some arguing that these positions are already highly desirable. Congressional staff tenure is relatively short. Congressional staff tenure is short due to low salaries, long hours, and heavy workload. Despite this, many highly qualified individuals seek opportunities on Capitol Hill to influence public policy and shape laws. While recruitment is not an issue, retention is a challenge, with 50% of Senate staff having less than one year of experience in their current positions. Results of the CMF 2004 House study show high turnover rates among House staff, with many having two or fewer years of experience in their current positions. This turnover not only impacts individual offices but also Congress as an institution. To address this issue, the Senate and House have established student loan repayment programs. The Senate has the authority to establish a student loan repayment program for recruitment and retention purposes under the FY2002 Legislative Branch Appropriations Act (P.L. 107-68). The program allows Senate employing offices to repay student loan debt through direct payments on behalf of employees. The program's funding is allocated based on the total sums appropriated for salaries in different Senate offices, with a central account established by the Secretary of the Senate for this purpose. The Senate established a student loan repayment program for staff in FY2002. Repayments are made from a central account with sub-accounts for each office. The program requires a minimum one-year service agreement with a monthly maximum of $500 and a total limit of $40,000. There are no current plans to increase repayment amounts. The Senate established a student loan repayment program for staff in FY2002, requiring a minimum one-year service agreement with a monthly maximum of $500 and a total limit of $40,000. Repayments are made from a central account with sub-accounts for each office. The program guidelines include the requirement for employees to repay the benefit if they do not fulfill the service agreement terms. Repayments are made directly to the lender by the Senate Disbursing Office. The FY2006 appropriations bill included a survey on the Senate student loan program, with 60 out of 140 Senate offices responding positively. While there is no statistical evidence of its effectiveness, anecdotal evidence suggests Senate offices find it beneficial. Each office sets its own benefit amounts, up to $500 a month, with 126 offices providing the benefit to nearly 900 employees at a cost of $3 million annually. The program administration is complex. The Senate student loan repayment program is complex, with up to 100 lenders to pay. Efforts are being made to streamline the process. Senator Durbin hopes to prevent abuses and waste in the program. The House was granted authority to establish a similar program for its employees under the Consolidated Appropriations Resolution, 2003. The Chief Administrative Officer was directed to design and administer the program. The House program, modeled after the Senate's, requires a one-year service agreement with the possibility of additional agreements. The maximum monthly payment is $500 ($6,000 annual) with a total limit of $40,000 per employee. Costs are covered by a central account administered by the CAO, not from MRA or office budgets. Personal offices receive 2% of the average MRA, while other House offices receive 2% of salaries and expenses. The House program requires a one-year service agreement with a maximum monthly payment of $500 ($6,000 annually) and a total limit of $40,000 per employee. Repayments are made directly to the lender for specified loans only, and are granted only to full-time employees, not interns, volunteers, unpaid staff, or Members. The decision to grant the benefit is at the discretion of each employing office, and if the employee violates the agreement, they must repay the benefit. The House program for student loan repayment requires a one-year service agreement with a maximum monthly payment of $500 ($6,000 annually) and a total limit of $40,000 per employee. Repayments are made directly to the lender for specified loans only, counted as taxable income. The House Committees on Appropriations and House Administration receive annual reports on student loan repayments made on behalf of House employees. In FY2004, 2,102 House employees received repayments ranging from $300 to $500 a month, totaling $7,075,000 for the program. In FY2005, the House program for student loan repayment had a total monthly limit of $2,147 per individual employee. The program is seen as beneficial for recruitment and retention, with 63% believing it helps in these areas. Concerns about impending retirements in the federal workforce and legislative branch have led to the consideration of student loan repayment programs. Legislative branch entities are preparing for significant retirements in the coming years. Many federal agencies are facing substantial retirements in the next few years, with a significant percentage of employees eligible to retire by specific dates. Strategic plans are being developed to replace retiring employees with highly qualified personnel. Some agencies are considering student loan repayment programs as an attractive benefit for potential candidates. The U.S. Capitol Police has established a student loan repayment program to recruit and retain qualified personnel, offering repayments of up to $10,000 annually and up to $40,000 in total per employee. The U.S. Capitol Police's student loan repayment program offers up to $10,000 annually and $40,000 in total per employee. The program aims to recruit and retain highly qualified employees, including law enforcement professionals, human resources, and information technology specialists. In FY2004, 107 employees received repayment benefits totaling $944,000. The program's budget request for FY2006 is $1,383,000. No studies on the program's effectiveness in recruitment or retention are currently available. The Capitol Police's student loan repayment program, established under the FY2002 Legislative Branch Appropriations Act, offers repayments of up to $6,000 annually and $40,000 in total per employee. Anecdotal evidence suggests the program is attracting law enforcement candidates and reducing attrition. Sworn officers recruited through the program tend to hold degrees, aiding in the agency's competition for law enforcement professionals. The Capitol Police's student loan repayment program offers repayments of up to $6,000 annually and $40,000 in total per employee. CBO established guidelines for the program in February 2003, focusing on health, finance, and tax analysts. Funding for the program was $30,000 in FY2003, with requests for $25,000 in subsequent years. GAO also has a student loan repayment program under P.L. 101-510, allocating funds based on estimates of program participation. In FY2002-2006, GAO reported student loan repayments to OPM: FY2002 - 169 recipients, $602,662; FY2003 - 231 recipients, $945,206; FY2004 - 237 recipients, $1,142,295; FY2005 - 218 recipients, $1,170,876; FY2006 - 286 recipients, $1,396,538. Demographic breakdown for FY2006 recipients: 59% headquarters, 41% field; 26% minorities; 43% over 3 years with GAO, 57% under 3 years. Repayments ranged from <$4,500 to $8,000 for hard-to-fill positions. Evaluation of FY2003 program conducted in 2004. The FY2003 repayment program evaluation in a web survey showed that the student loan repayment program had varying levels of influence on employees' decision to stay at GAO. GPO implemented the program in April 2002, with 52 employees receiving repayments since then. In FY2004, 28 employees benefited from the program at a cost of $253,638. The estimate for FY2005 is to provide 25 employees with repayments. The Library of Congress established a student loan repayment program under P.L. 101-510. Final regulations were issued in 2002 and revised in 2004. Funding was not approved for a pilot program in FY2005. Library offices are covering costs within their budgets. In FY2003, two employees received benefits, and in FY2004, eight employees did at a cost of $46,000. No funds were requested for FY2006. The Library of Congress established a student loan repayment program under P.L. 101-510, with funding provided to employees in FY2004 and FY2005. The program is seen as a recruitment and retention tool by the Architect of the Capitol and the Office of Compliance. The Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts also considered a similar program for judicial law clerks in the past. The Judiciary seeks authority to offer interest-free student loans to federal judges for up to three years to compete with law firms in hiring new attorneys as clerks. Unlike executive branch agencies, the Judiciary has not used appropriated funds for student loan repayment programs. Considerations for implementing such programs include funding, service agreement length, eligibility criteria, and data collection. The law allows executive and legislative support agencies to establish student loan repayment programs without funding. Some agencies receive specific appropriations for repayments, like the Department of State. The Judiciary seeks authority for interest-free student loans for federal judges. Funding, service agreement length, eligibility criteria, and data collection are considerations for implementing such programs. The U.S. Commission on National Security/21st Century recommended providing additional funds to maximize agencies' options in recruiting and retaining high-quality personnel, including student loan repayments. Lack of funds has hindered agency use of incentive programs, as administrators must balance incentives with salaries from existing pay and benefits programs. The U.S. Commission on National Security/21st Century recommended additional funds for agencies to recruit and retain personnel, including student loan forgiveness for those in science, math, and engineering entering government or military service. Service agreements in the executive and legislative branches vary in length, with factors like recruitment, training costs, and employee interest influencing the decision. The length of service agreements in government agencies can impact employee interest. Factors like recruitment success, labor market conditions, and training costs are considered when determining loan repayments. OPM's final regulations removed overly restrictive factors for payment criteria. In final regulations, OPM removed overly restrictive factors for loan repayment criteria but retained requirements for written determinations of repayment need based on recruitment and retention. OPM did not define \"highly qualified personnel\" to allow agencies flexibility in determining eligibility. Agencies have wide latitude in determining if an employee would likely leave government service without the repayment benefit. The OPM regulations give agencies flexibility in using student loan repayments as a retention incentive without requiring proof from private sector employers. Agencies can consider various factors in deciding whether repayments or other incentives are best, such as eligibility criteria, pay grade impact, and reporting requirements to OPM. The regulations define \"cost\" as the total amount of student loan repayments, not including administrative costs. Agencies must maintain records on repayments for three years or until OPM evaluates the program. OPM must report annually to Congress on agencies' use of repayments. It is suggested that OPM's annual report include information on the costs of administering the programs for a more comprehensive indicator of expenses. The Senate Disbursing Office reports annually to the Committee on Appropriations and the Committee on Rules and Administration on loan repayments made to Senate employees. The Office of the Chief Administrative Officer reports annually to the Committee on Appropriations and the Committee on House Administration on repayments made to House employees. One way to assess the effectiveness of the repayments as a recruitment and retention tool could be a survey of the employing offices providing repayment benefits that would detail similar elements as presented in the OPM report. Agencies might examine whether student loan repayment records should be maintained beyond the period prescribed by regulation for evaluating the cost and desirability. The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) may need to expand the information in its annual report to Congress regarding student loan repayment programs. This could include data on program administration costs, individuals leaving government service after receiving repayments, waivers granted for not fulfilling service agreements, and employee attrition rates. Pilot programs testing repayment effectiveness could serve as models for other agencies considering similar programs. The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) may need to include more data in its annual report to Congress on student loan repayment programs. This could involve details on program costs, attrition rates of employees receiving repayments, and the composition of recipients by sex and race for equitable administration. Agencies could consider posting individual reports on their websites to enhance oversight of repayment programs. Several agencies have anecdotal evidence on the effectiveness of their student loan repayment programs, with some agencies having up to four years of experience. To further assess the impact of repayments, agencies may conduct systematic entrance and exit interviews with employees. Comparing recruitment and retention results for new hires who received repayments versus those who did not could help determine the effectiveness of the program. Additionally, agencies could identify specific recruitment and retention challenges they are trying to address through these programs. The Departments of Justice, Defense, Securities and Exchange Commission, and State have been leading student loan repayment programs since FY2002-2003, with 81.3% of recipients and 84.1% of total costs in FY2005. OPM's annual report could provide Congress with a more complete measure of program efficiency by including detailed information on administrative practices and outcomes at these agencies."
