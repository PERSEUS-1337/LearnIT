    "content": "The \"Reducing Special Education Through Prevention Act\" is cited as the short title of the Act. Part D of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act is amended to include grants for improving school-based early intervention services for children with emotional disturbances. During 2002-2001, 472,932 children aged 6-21 receiving special education were identified with emotional disturbances, a 21.8% increase from 1990-1991. These children represent 7.7% of all disabled children and 1% of the US population. Up to 19% of elementary and secondary students show symptoms of emotional disturbance, but only 1% are properly identified and receive support. Children with emotional disturbances face challenges in school, including failing more classes, missing more days, lower grades, higher retention rates, dropout rates, and lower graduation rates compared to other students with disabilities. The Surgeon General highlighted the need for better prevention, early identification, and resources for children with emotional disturbances. The goal is to improve the assessment and recognition of mental health needs in children. Improving outcomes for children with emotional disturbances involves early identification of mental health needs in various systems and promoting proactive behavior support in schools. Universal prevention methods should be emphasized, with individual support for students with more intense needs. Promoting effective coordination among schools, families, and systems providing services for children with emotional disturbances leads to increased retention in school, improved educational outcomes, and enhanced cognitive, emotional, and behavioral development. Positive outcomes include increased academic performance, improved attendance, engagement in academic activities, and fewer disruptions in the learning environment when a continuum of services is offered for these children. Services such as prevention, early intervention, and treatment for mental health problems in children are crucial. Surveys show that behavioral issues, lack of discipline, and violence in schools are major concerns. Effective early intervention strategies exist to help children with emotional disturbances. The 2002 report by the National Academy of Sciences emphasized the importance of early intervention for children at risk of behavioral problems. The purpose of the subpart is to reduce the number of children with emotional disturbances requiring special education services. The Secretary is authorized to make grants to State and local educational agencies to reduce emotional disturbances in children, prioritizing those providing additional reports. Application details are outlined in section 693. The State or local educational agency seeking a grant under this subpart must submit an application to the Secretary, including a plan for activities, descriptions of current services, and outcome measures. The application for a grant under this subpart must include a plan for activities, outcome measures, funding structure, cultural competence assurances, and compliance with matching requirements. Amounts received must supplement, not supplant, other funding sources. \"SEC. 694. USE OF AMOUNTS.\" A State or local educational agency receiving a grant under this subpart can use the funds for activities like universal prevention strategies at schools, early intervention services for children at risk of emotional disturbances, and coordinating services for these children. The agency must coordinate activities with social services, health providers, child welfare organizations, and juvenile justice organizations. They should ensure measurable results and limit services to no more than 5 percent of the total amount. The agency must ensure that no more than 5 percent of the grant is used for administrative expenses, activities should not negatively impact students' attendance, behavior, or academic achievement, should not increase segregation of students, and should be culturally competent and evidence-based. The Secretary requires a matching requirement for grants to educational agencies, with non-Federal contributions increasing over three years. Administrative expenses are limited to 10% of the grant amount, and reports must be submitted to the Secretary. The State or local educational agencies receiving grants must submit annual reports to the Secretary, including data collection for compliance. The Secretary will conduct evaluations of grant activities, and reports to Congress will be made. The Secretary must submit an annual report to Congress summarizing data from previous reports and evaluations conducted. Authorization of appropriations is provided for fiscal years 2003 through 2007. Subpart 3 focuses on grants to improve school-based early intervention services for children with emotional disturbances. It includes sections on findings, authorization, application, use of amounts, matching requirement, administrative expenses, reports to Secretary, evaluations, reports to Congress, and authorization of appropriations."
