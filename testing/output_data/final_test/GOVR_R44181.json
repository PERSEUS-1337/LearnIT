    "content": "Vessels discharge various wastes and contaminants into U.S. and international waters, including nutrients, oil, metals, chemicals, and invasive species. These discharges come from activities like shower water, bilgewater, and ballast water. The diverse range of vessels releasing these pollutants includes commercial fishing vessels, cruise ships, tankers, cargo ships, and recreational vessels, totaling in the millions. Ballast water discharges from vessels, including recreational vessels, have raised concerns due to the introduction of invasive species into U.S. waters, leading to ecological disturbances and economic losses. The arrival of zebra mussels in the Great Lakes in the late 1980s brought national attention to the issue. These mussels attach to surfaces like water intake pipes, causing reduced pumping capacity and plant shutdowns. Ballast water is a major pathway for the introduction of aquatic invasive species. The practice of using ballast water to stabilize vessels during transport is essential for their proper functioning. However, the discharge of ballast water can introduce non-native species into aquatic ecosystems, leading to ecological disturbances. Stakeholders agree on the need for strong measures to control vessel discharges, especially ballast water discharges, but there are differing views on how to do so. Vessel discharge requirements in the United States are regulated by the U.S. Coast Guard, EPA, and individual states, as well as international agreements from the International Maritime Organization. Legislation in the 114th Congress, such as the Vessel Incidental Discharge Act, addresses the combination of regulations and standards for ballast water concerns. Federal authority for this issue is outlined in the Nonindigenous Aquatic Nuisance Prevention and Control Act. The United States regulates vessel discharge through the Nonindigenous Aquatic Nuisance Prevention and Control Act, administered by the Coast Guard. Initially focused on preventing invasive species in the Great Lakes, regulations now apply to all U.S. ports. Ballast water exchange is required for ships entering U.S. waters, but its effectiveness is limited. In 2012, the Coast Guard implemented new ballast water management rules. The Coast Guard established new requirements for ballast water management, including numeric standards for living organisms and human health indicator microorganisms. The rule applies to all U.S. and foreign vessels with ballast tanks in U.S. waters, estimated at 3,046 vessels over 10 years. Compliance depends on vessel construction date and ballast water capacity. The Coast Guard rule for ballast water management includes compliance options such as eliminating discharge, using onshore facilities or approved treatment systems, and drawing water from U.S. public systems. It also outlines procedures for testing and approval of treatment technology. The numeric standards align with those of the IMO, specifying organisms and human health indicator microbes concentrations for management systems to achieve before discharge. The EPA has authority to regulate vessel discharges, including ballast water, under the Clean Water Act. Vessels are considered point sources of pollution, but historically, the EPA excluded ballast water from permitting requirements due to the challenges of regulating mobile vessels across different jurisdictions. This regulation was challenged in federal court. The 1973 regulation excluding ballast water from permitting requirements was challenged in federal court and ultimately vacated in 2008. This ruling affected a large number of vessels, leading Congress to enact two bills to restrict the population subject to regulation. The Clean Boating Act of 2008 provided a permanent exemption for recreational vessels, while a second measure imposed a two-year moratorium on permitting requirements. The 2008 Vessel General Permit (VGP) issued by the EPA covered 72,000 vessels, including tankers, freighters, barges, and cruise ships. It included requirements for various pollutant discharge types, such as ballast water, with minimal regulations. The moratorium on CWA permitting for certain discharges from commercial fishing vessels and non-recreational vessels was extended multiple times until December 2017. The 2008 Vessel General Permit (VGP) issued by the EPA mandated mid-ocean ballast water exchange for ships outside the EEZ of the United States. Stakeholders requested numeric ballast water discharge standards, but EPA did not include them due to lack of commercially available treatment technologies. Instead, the VGP specified ballast water best management practices and monitoring requirements. In 2013, EPA re-issued the Vessel General Permit (VGP) with ballast water numeric discharge limits, based on available treatment technologies. The 2013 VGP aligns with Coast Guard and IMO standards, with implementation timelines for new and existing vessels. The Coast Guard rule and EPA permit differ in coverage and exemptions. The Coast Guard rule applies to 3,050 vessels with ballast tanks, while the EPA permit covers 72,000 vessels, including those without ballast water discharges. The Coast Guard rule focuses solely on ballast water, while the EPA permit includes 26 other waste streams. Both have similar ballast water requirements but are not identical. The Coast Guard rule and EPA permit have similar ballast water requirements but differ in monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting. The Coast Guard mandates certified ballast water management technology, while the EPA permit requires \"best available technology\" without certification. The Coast Guard can grant temporary exemptions for unavailable technology. The Coast Guard has granted two-year exemptions to nearly 350 vessels as no technological system has received approval yet. EPA does not have authority to grant exemptions from VGP requirements. Coast Guard and EPA have enforcement authority under NISA and CWA, including civil and criminal sanctions. Citizen suits are only authorized under the CWA for enforcing effluent limitations. States can regulate vessel discharges beyond federal requirements, with authority deriving from NISA. State and local programs to control AIS are permitted under the current ballast water management program implemented by the Coast Guard. States like Michigan, California, and others have developed ballast water management programs with standards more comprehensive than the Coast Guard's rules, permitted under the CWA. States have the authority to regulate vessel discharges beyond federal requirements, allowing them to tailor their implementation of water quality programs to address local conditions. Several states, including Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan, and Hawaii, have issued state permits under this authority. Under the Clean Water Act, states like Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan, and Hawaii have issued state permits to regulate ballast water discharges independently of the federal Vessel General Permit (VGP). States also have the power to impose conditions on federal permits through Section 401, allowing them to set additional limitations on discharges. Twenty-five states and Tribes certified the 2013 re-issued VGP with extra permit conditions. Some states certified the 2013 re-issued VGP with additional conditions for effluent streams, including stricter discharge standards for ballast water and specific pollutant discharges like chlorine. Oregon and Washington implemented reporting, recordkeeping, and inspection requirements, along with ballast water exchange measures. New York and California adopted more stringent ballast water treatment standards than the EPA and Coast Guard. New York and California have set standards for ballast water treatment that are significantly more stringent than EPA and Coast Guard regulations. Despite challenges from the commercial shipping industry and environmental groups, courts have generally upheld these state permits. Michigan and New York's certification of the 2008 EPA permit were also upheld after challenges from shipping industry groups. The combination of federal and state requirements presents various related issues that have been addressed in legislation. The maritime industry has long argued for harmonization of federal rules for vessel discharges, particularly ballast water discharges. Many believe centralizing responsibilities with the Coast Guard could reduce confusion, but questions remain about non-ballast water management. The maritime industry has advocated for centralizing federal regulations for vessel discharges, especially ballast water. However, questions remain about how non-ballast water waste streams included in the EPA's permit would be regulated. Options include centralizing them with the Coast Guard or having EPA continue to regulate them. Some groups prefer EPA due to its focus on public health and the environment, while the Coast Guard has multiple missions and responsibilities. The maritime industry is concerned about regulation under the Clean Water Act due to potential citizen suit enforcement. Shipping groups object to state conditions attached to EPA permits, arguing it creates inconsistent and cumbersome requirements. A federal court ruled that EPA cannot amend or reject state certifications under Section 401 of the CWA. The Coast Guard cannot preempt state action to regulate ballast water discharges within state waters, citing a provision of NANPCA that saves states' authority to adopt control measures for aquatic nuisance species. States with conflicting regulations are seen as burdening interstate commerce and creating confusion in addressing AIS invasions. States with conflicting regulations strongly oppose proposals to preempt their authority over species of fish and wildlife. The Coast Guard and EPA have implemented numeric standards for ballast water discharges, but industry groups disagree on the achievability of these standards. Some states and environmental groups push for stricter standards to prevent aquatic invasive species. New York and California support their stringent standards, currently deferred. The Coast Guard and EPA plan to review their standards by 2018. Congress enacted a temporary moratorium on EPA permitting for commercial fishing and small vessels until December 2017. In 2014, Congress enacted a temporary moratorium on EPA permitting for commercial fishing and small vessels until December 2017. The Senate Commerce Subcommittee held a hearing on regulation of vessel discharges in February 2015, leading to the approval of the Vessel Incidental Discharge Act. The Vessel Incidental Discharge Act (S. 373) was approved by the Senate Commerce Committee. The Coast Guard Authorization Act of 2015 (S. 1611) also includes the text of S. 373. Similar legislation has been introduced in the House (H.R. 980). The House passed the National Defense Authorization Act for FY2017 (H.R. 4909) with a provision identical to H.R. 980, which the Administration objected to. The current legislation aims to establish a federal ballast water management standard. The legislation aims to establish a single federal ballast water management standard based on the Coast Guard's 2012 numeric standards. It would supersede existing state standards and EPA requirements. The Coast Guard may adopt more stringent standards within eight years, and manufacturers can only sell technology certified by the Coast Guard. States can enforce stricter standards if approved by the Coast Guard. The Senate legislation aims to establish a federal ballast water management standard based on the Coast Guard's 2012 numeric standards. It would supersede state standards and EPA requirements. The Coast Guard may adopt more stringent standards within eight years, and states can enforce stricter standards if approved. The legislation also includes provisions on key definitions related to ballast water management. The Senate legislation aims to establish a federal ballast water management standard based on the Coast Guard's 2012 numeric standards. It includes a specific list of discharges considered incidental to the normal operation of a vessel, excluding certain regulated discharges like rubbish, oil, sewage, and air pollutants. Vessels subject to the bill's requirements are defined as watercraft used for transportation on water, excluding Coast Guard and Department of Defense vessels. The Senate legislation establishes federal ballast water management standards based on Coast Guard's 2012 numeric standards. It excludes certain regulated discharges and directs the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard operates to establish uniform national standards for vessel discharges. Enforcement is by the Coast Guard and states, with no delegation of enforcement authority to states. Uniform national standards and requirements are detailed in Section 5. The bill directs the Coast Guard to review the feasibility of achieving revised ballast water performance standards by January 2020, which could be 100 times more stringent than the existing standards. It outlines criteria for the feasibility review and instructs the Coast Guard to revise the standards accordingly based on the findings. The bill outlines procedures for the Coast Guard to establish compliance schedules and grant extensions to vessel owners. It also authorizes the Coast Guard to establish compliance programs as alternatives to regulations, including for small vessels and those discharging ballast water on-shore. EPA is directed to set standards for on-shore facilities receiving ballast water. The Coast Guard must review ballast water performance standards every 10 years and initiate rulemaking if necessary. The bill focuses on reviewing ballast water performance standards every 10 years and initiating rulemaking if further revision would substantially reduce the risk of introducing aquatic nuisance species. It also addresses non-ballast water vessel discharges by directing the Coast Guard to establish best management practices for these discharges. The bill requires the Coast Guard to review ballast water standards every 10 years and may revise BMPs for non-ballast water vessel discharges. Vessels must conduct saltwater flushing of ballast water tanks before entering the Great Lakes. EPA and the Coast Guard will develop protocols for certifying ballast water treatment technologies. The bill prohibits the sale of ballast water technology without certification one year after testing protocols are issued. Vessel owners/operators cannot use unapproved technology unless it is being evaluated under the Coast Guard Shipboard Technology Evaluation Program. Section 7 of the bill makes permanent the current permit moratorium for small vessels regarding ballast water management systems. It also codifies exemptions for vessels that do not discharge ballast water, operate in specific areas, or have ballast water suitable for human consumption. Section 9 of the bill establishes rules for judicial review in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals for final regulations under the Vessel Incidental Discharge Act. The Coast Guard does not have express authority in the bill to enforce its provisions. Section 10 prohibits states from adopting or enforcing laws concerning vessel discharges, with exceptions for ballast water management. The bill allows states to enforce stricter ballast water laws if approved by the Coast Guard. States can petition the Coast Guard for approval within 90 days. The legislation will be the sole authority for federal regulation of vessel discharges. Legislation introduced in Congress aims to strengthen regulation of ballast water discharges to prevent non-native aquatic invasive species in U.S. waters. Proposals include specific treatment performance standards for vessels. Some proposals have evolved to address administrative aspects of ballast water regulation, clarifying federal and state requirements. While the maritime industry generally supports this legislation, some states and environmental groups have concerns. While the maritime industry generally supports the legislation to regulate ballast water discharges, some states and environmental groups oppose certain aspects of the proposals. The Administration's stance on the legislation remains unknown."
