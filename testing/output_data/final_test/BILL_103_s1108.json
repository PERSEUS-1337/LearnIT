    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Canyon Ferry Recreation, Tourism, and Economic Development Management Act\" and includes findings. Congress acknowledges the Federal responsibility to promote public recreation, tourism, and economic development at Federal water projects. Certain provisions of the Federal Water Project Recreation Act are seen as overly restrictive, particularly at the Canyon Ferry Recreation Management Area. Non-Federal entities bear a significant portion of the costs for operating, maintaining, and replacing facilities on Federal lands in this area. The management burden at Canyon Ferry Recreation Area is unfair for non-Federal managers due to old facilities, lack of access for the disabled, and complex responsibilities. Cooperative efforts involving multiple entities are needed to meet recreational, tourism, and economic development needs. The Secretary of the Interior may enter into agreements through the Bureau of Reclamation and Bureau of Land Management to carry out the purposes of the Act. Management responsibilities for lands withdrawn or acquired for reclamation purposes must align with the statutory authority of the Bureau of Land Management. SEC. 4. PROTECTION OF AUTHORIZED PURPOSES OF RECLAMATION PROJECTS. This Act does not alter the authorized purposes of the Canyon Ferry Unit or change the responsibility of the Bureau of Reclamation for the Canyon Ferry Dam and Reservoir. It also does not authorize any actions that would affect the water supply from the Canyon Ferry Unit. The Secretary manages lands and facilities in the area for recreation, tourism, and economic development under the Canyon Ferry Resources Management Plan. The Area is exempt from certain provisions of the Federal Water Project Recreation Act. Recreation user fees collected are used for operation, maintenance, and development of the Canyon Ferry Recreation Area. The cooperative agreements for the Canyon Ferry Recreation Area outline the responsibilities of the Bureau of Land Management in managing the public lands for recreation, tourism, and economic development. Recreation user fees collected for various purposes are considered as part of the agreement. Authorization of appropriations is granted for the Act, with funds available until expended, focusing on the first 10 years for crucial management, maintenance, and construction activities."
