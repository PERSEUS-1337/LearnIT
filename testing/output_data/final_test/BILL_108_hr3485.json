    "content": "The \"Affordable Housing Preservation Tax Relief Act of 2003\" is introduced as a new section in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, providing a tax credit for affordable housing preservation. The Affordable Housing Preservation Tax Relief Act of 2003 introduces a tax credit for affordable housing preservation. The credit is determined by the preservation allocation amount from a qualified preservation sale, limited to the gain recognized by the taxpayer. The preservation allocation amount is the amount allocated to the taxpayer by a housing credit agency and is subject to certain limitations. The Affordable Housing Preservation Tax Relief Act of 2003 introduces a tax credit for affordable housing preservation through a qualified preservation sale to a preservation entity. The sale must maintain affordability and use restrictions for a specified term. The Affordable Housing Preservation Tax Relief Act of 2003 allows for the sale of eligible multifamily housing properties to preservation entities under certain conditions. The restrictions on the property must be legally enforceable, consistent with long-term viability, and recorded as a restrictive covenant. Eligible properties include those assisted under specific sections of the National Housing Act. The Affordable Housing Preservation Tax Relief Act of 2003 defines affordable housing as qualified low-income housing projects, including properties assisted under various housing acts. The term 'extended use period' refers to the period after the sale of a property, lasting either 30 years or until the property is acquired through foreclosure. The term 'preservation entity' is defined as a housing credit agency or an approved organization committed to acquiring and preserving eligible multifamily housing. The preservation entity must be independent from the seller partnership or its affiliates. Housing credit agencies allocate preservation credits based on the State preservation credit ceiling for each calendar year. If a State has multiple housing credit agencies, they are treated as a single agency for allocation purposes. The State preservation credit ceiling for each calendar year is determined by adding the unused credit ceiling from the previous year, $1.00 multiplied by the State population, $1,000,000, returned credit ceiling, and any amount allocated by the Secretary. Multiple housing credit agencies in a State are considered as a single agency for allocation purposes. The State preservation credit ceiling for a calendar year is calculated by adding various amounts, including unused credit from the previous year, $1.00 per State population, returned credit ceiling, and allocations by the Secretary. Any unallocated credit is distributed to qualified States for the following year. The State preservation credit allocation is based on the unused preservation credit carryover from the previous year. The allocated amount is determined by the Secretary to maintain a specific ratio to the aggregate preservation credit dollar amount. The Secretary allocates preservation credits based on the population ratio of each State. Housing credit agencies are responsible for ensuring the viability of rehabilitation plans for eligible multifamily housing properties for at least 30 years.
