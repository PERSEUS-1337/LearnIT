    "content": "Article II, Section 2, Clause 1 of the Constitution outlines the President's power to grant pardons for offenses against the United States, excluding cases of impeachment. This power was established based on English custom and the belief that mercy may be warranted in certain circumstances. Alexander Hamilton argued that this power should be vested in the President. The Framers decided to vest the power of granting pardons in the President, believing that a single individual is better suited to weigh the reasons for and against forgiveness. They rejected proposals for limitations on this power, giving the President essentially unfettered authority to pardon federal offenses. Clemency in American law includes five types: pardon, amnesty, commutation, remission of fines, and reprieve. Pardon and amnesty have similar effects, while commutation is a milder punishment substitution. Pardon exempts from punishment, while commutation only reduces the penalty. The power of pardon in American law exempts individuals from punishment and can be granted unconditionally or with conditions attached. Presidents have historically used this power to grant pardons for a wide range of offenses, even before legal proceedings or after conviction. The Sedition Acts granted amnesty to those who assisted the Confederacy after the Civil War, with the condition of upholding the Constitution. Presidents like Lincoln, Johnson, Ford, and George H. W. Bush have issued pardons for various offenses, including the Watergate Scandal and Iran-Contra affair. The Office of the Pardon Attorney reviews and recommends applications for presidential clemency. The Department of Justice (DOJ) reviews applications for clemency and issues regulations for seeking executive clemency. A waiting period of at least five years is required before filing a petition for a pardon. The Pardon Attorney conducts an investigation with the help of agencies like the FBI and presents the petition to the Attorney General for a recommendation. The Pardon Attorney investigates pardon petitions and sends a recommendation to the Attorney General for review. The Attorney General then makes a final decision on whether to approve or disapprove the petition, submitting a written recommendation to the President. DOJ's regulations on pardon petitions are advisory and do not restrict the Pardon Attorney's discretion. The process does not create legally enforceable rights and does not limit the President's power to grant pardons. The President has plenary power to grant pardons and reprieves without the need for a pardon petition. The Department of Justice considers factors like post-conviction conduct, seriousness of the offense, and official recommendations when reviewing pardon petitions. Commutation of sentence is seen as an extraordinary remedy, with factors including disparity of sentence and meritorious service to the government. The Department of Justice announced a new clemency initiative in April 2014, prioritizing federal inmates who meet six criteria for commutation of sentence. Factors include serving a lower sentence today, being a nonviolent offender, and having served at least 10 years. The Department of Justice introduced a clemency initiative in 2014 for federal inmates meeting specific criteria for commutation of sentence, including ties to criminal organizations, good conduct in prison, and no history of violence. President Obama received more petitions for commutation under this initiative. A pardon requires physical delivery to be legally effective, and the recipient can reject it. A pardon must be physically delivered for legal effect and can be rejected by the recipient. The court cannot force acceptance, and the pardon is a private act not officially communicated to the court. In Burdick v. United States, the right to refuse a pardon was upheld, emphasizing the importance of delivery and acceptance. DOJ regulations require a warrant of pardon to be mailed to the petitioner, and it can also be revoked. A warrant of pardon can be revoked before delivery. In a case involving President Andrew Johnson and Ulysses S. Grant, a pardon was revoked before delivery. Similarly, President George W. Bush revoked a pardon for Isaac R. Toussie after sending a master warrant of clemency. Mr. Toussie's clemency application was initially reviewed by the White House Counsel, but the President directed it to be reviewed by the Pardon Attorney following concerns about false documents and political contributions. The Supreme Court has historically viewed pardons as releasing both punishment and guilt. A pardon releases the offender from punishment and guilt, restoring civil rights and creating a new legal status. It does not, however, restore forfeited offices or property vested in others. The Supreme Court views pardons as wiping out the offense, allowing the assertion of legal rights. A full pardon restores civil rights such as voting, serving on juries, and working in certain professions. However, recipients may still face limitations based on state or federal laws. The Supreme Court's stance on pardons wiping out guilt has evolved, with a 1915 case affirming that a full pardon absolves the individual from consequences. The Supreme Court has acknowledged that accepting a full pardon implies a confession of guilt. In Carlesi v. New York, the Court ruled that a presidential pardon does not prevent a state from considering the pardoned offense for enhanced sentencing. In Schick v. Reed (1974), the Court affirmed the President's authority to commute a sentence. The Supreme Court in Schick v. Reed affirmed the President's authority to commute a sentence, but did not address whether this power includes erasing guilt or conviction. Scholars suggest a shift in the Court's view on the effect of a pardon, indicating that it may not wipe away all guilt. The case examined commutation, where it may have been clear that the altered sentence did not erase guilt. Many courts adhere to the view that a presidential pardon obliterates the conviction but guilt remains. Two court decisions related to the Iran-Contra Affair illustrate this hybrid view of a pardon's effect. The recipient of a pardon, a former CIA official, sought attorneys' fees under the Ethics in Government Act. The D.C. Circuit ruled that a pardon does not erase guilt, so the petitioner was not entitled to fees despite receiving a pardon from President George H.W. Bush. The court held that a pardon does not nullify an indictment, preventing the petitioner from recovering attorneys' fees. In a similar case, the court ruled that a pardon does not erase guilt or affect bar discipline for criminal acts. The court held that a full presidential pardon restores federal and state civil rights, removing legal disabilities such as firearm possession restrictions for individuals with felony convictions. The court also ordered the petitioner to be publicly censured, considering the commission of his pardoned offense in assessing his moral character. A full presidential pardon restores federal and state civil rights, including removing firearm possession restrictions for individuals with felony convictions. Federal firearms laws state that a person pardoned or with restored civil rights shall not be considered a convicted felon for firearm possession purposes. Express provisions regarding the effect of a pardon on eligibility may not be necessary due to the principle that a pardon removes legal disabilities resulting from a conviction. There is no general federal statutory process for restoring civil rights lost due to a federal conviction. A presidential pardon is the only method for restoring rights under federal law, as civil rights lost due to a federal conviction may be restored or judicial records expunged. However, a pardon does not guarantee eligibility for certain purposes, as demonstrated in cases like In re North and In re Abrams. For example, a federal court upheld the denial of an individual's post-pardon application for registration as a floor broker based on the conduct underlying the pardoned offense. The court upheld the denial of a post-pardon application for registration as a floor broker, stating that the CFTC could consider the conduct underlying the pardoned conviction to determine the applicant's fitness. Federal law allows the Attorney General to consider past drug-related convictions when issuing licenses, even if the applicant has received a presidential pardon for a federal drug offense. This would not violate the pardon power as the denial may be related to the applicant's suitability for the license. The denial of a post-pardon application for registration as a floor broker was upheld by the court, stating that the conduct underlying the pardoned conviction could be considered to determine the applicant's fitness. Even if a federal felon receives a pardon, they may still be disqualified from certain positions or programs based on character requirements. Expungements and other avenues may help restore some civil rights for federal felons. A presidential pardon does not erase a federal felon's conviction record, affecting their civil rights even after receiving a pardon. The conviction and pardon notation will still be reported in background checks, potentially impacting eligibility for certain positions or programs. An expungement goes beyond a pardon by removing the record of the conviction and underlying guilt, potentially helping individuals regain civil rights or legal privileges. Expungement may help regain civil rights lost due to a federal conviction by removing the conviction from background checks. In some cases, expungement may be necessary even after receiving a pardon, as seen in Utah where a pardon does not remove the legal disability of serving as a juror without expungement. Expungement is not automatically granted with a pardon, as federal courts have stated that pardons do not have the power to order expunction of court records. Unlike states, there is no general federal statutory procedure for federal felons to seek expungement. Regaining certain rights, such as voting or serving on a jury, may vary by state through their restoration of rights process. State laws determine voter qualifications for federal and state elections, including how felony convictions affect voting rights. Some states allow felons to vote from prison by absentee ballot, while others impose permanent disenfranchisement unless restored by executive pardon. Processes for restoring voting rights vary by state, with some automatically restoring rights upon completion of a sentence. Utah, for example, restores voting rights for felons on probation, parole, or after completing their sentence. Some states allow felons to vote from prison by absentee ballot, while others impose permanent disenfranchisement unless restored by executive pardon. State laws vary on juror qualifications for ex-felons, with some requiring individual application to the governor for restoration of rights. Federal law also has limited circumstances for regaining eligibility after a certain amount of time. Individuals may have their eligibility for certain activities suspended if convicted of a controlled substance offense, but they can regain eligibility after meeting specific conditions, such as completing a drug rehabilitation program. In some cases, waivers can be granted to allow eligibility despite a disqualifying conviction. The President's pardon power cannot be restricted by Congress. The President's pardon power, as established by the Constitution, cannot be limited or controlled by Congress, as affirmed by various court cases such as Garland, United States v. Klein, and Schick. Congress cannot restrict the effect of a presidential pardon, and the pardon power is solely derived from the Constitution, not from legislative actions. The President's pardon power cannot be limited by Congress, as affirmed by court cases. Congress cannot restrict the effect of a presidential pardon, and the pardon power is solely derived from the Constitution. Congress may express opinions on pardons, but it is unclear if they can expand the effect of a pardon. Some states have laws clarifying the effects of pardons. The President's pardon power cannot be limited by Congress, as affirmed by court cases. Congress may express opinions on pardons, but it is unclear if they can expand the effect of a pardon. Collateral consequences of a conviction can be removed by a presidential pardon unless specified otherwise. Congress could potentially modify the effect of a presidential pardon by specifying collateral consequences to be restored. This could include erasing both the guilt and the federal offense itself. While a pardon does not automatically expunge criminal records, Congress could allow for expungement upon application by the pardon recipient. A pardon recipient could avoid background check hurdles by obtaining an expungement order from a federal court. Congress could also consider implementing \"ban the box\" legislation to prevent employers from inquiring about criminal history early in the hiring process. President Obama directed the Office of Personnel Management to delay criminal history inquiries in federal hiring processes. In May 2016, a proposed rule was issued to federal agencies stating that background information cannot be collected until a conditional offer of employment is made to an applicant. Bills in the 114th Congress aim to prevent federal agencies and contractors from asking about criminal history before a conditional offer is made."
