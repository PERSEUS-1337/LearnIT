    "content": "The State of California enacts the following. The State of California enacts Section 712.5 in the Public Utilities Code, requiring an assessment of economic impacts if the Diablo Canyon powerplant shuts down before its licenses expire. The assessment will be conducted by an independent third party to review potential actions for mitigating adverse economic effects. The assessment required by Section 712.5 of the Public Utilities Code includes estimates of changes in tax revenues, workforce populations, and impacts on ratepayers from a shutdown. It also reviews the economic impacts of decommissioning the San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station and similar regions in the United States. The commission will issue a request for proposal for an independent third party to review and analyze data related to the economic impacts of a shutdown. The third party will consult with various entities to assess the impacts on tax revenues, workforce, and entities receiving enhanced tax revenue. The commission will publicly release the assessment on its website, distribute copies to relevant jurisdictions, and hold a public forum in San Luis Obispo County on the findings and recommendations. The Diablo Canyon Units 1 and 2 powerplant, the last operating nuclear powerplant in California, will not renew its licenses, set to expire in 2024 and 2025. A joint proposal for closure includes replacing electricity from non-greenhouse gas emitting sources and an employee retention program. Local communities were caught off guard by the sudden closure of the San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station. The economic impact of a potential shutdown of the Diablo Canyon Units 1 and 2 powerplant is being assessed to help the state and local communities prepare for the loss of baseline electricity. The findings and recommendations aim to minimize the local economic impacts of the planned closure without interfering with the joint proposal for closure. The Public Utilities Commission approves the withdrawal of $400,000 from the nuclear decommissioning trust funds for Diablo Canyon Units 1 and 2 powerplant. The funds will be used for additional staffing to expedite a third-party assessment. This act is an urgency statute for the immediate preservation of public peace, health, or safety. The Pacific Gas and Electric Company will not renew licenses for Diablo Canyon Units 1 and 2. The Public Utilities Commission needs to select an independent third party for an economic assessment promptly."
