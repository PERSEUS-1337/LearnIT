    "content": "The \"Community Security Act of 1993\" may be cited as the short title. The Act includes a program by the Department of Defense to help discharged members of the armed forces obtain training and employment as law enforcement officers. The \"Community Security Act of 1993\" establishes a program to assist involuntarily separated members of the armed forces in obtaining training and employment as law enforcement officers with local government units. The \"Community Security Act of 1993\" establishes a program to assist separated members of the armed forces in training and employment as law enforcement officers with local government units. Within one year of separation, members are ineligible for stipends, and local governments must agree to employ them for at least two years. The \"Community Security Act of 1993\" allows separated members of the armed forces to be employed as law enforcement officers by local governments. The Secretary of Defense certifies eligibility, and agreements are made with high crime areas for employment. The Secretary agrees to pay the local government based on the officer's salary. The Secretary of Defense agrees to pay a percentage of the basic salary to law enforcement officers employed by local governments under the \"Community Security Act of 1993\". Payment rates decrease over the years of employment, starting at 100% for the first year and decreasing to 20% for the fifth year. Payments can be made in installments as determined by the Secretary. The Secretary of Defense may reimburse local governments for advance payments if a law enforcement officer leaves before the payment period ends. Agreements cannot be made if a previous officer was terminated to make room for a new hire. Priority is given to high-violent crime areas when entering agreements with local governments. The Attorney General has identified a high rate of violent crimes. Assistance for training and employment as law enforcement officers is subject to the availability of appropriations. Each state can have a specific number of armed forces members selected for training and employment. The selection of law enforcement officers from each state is based on the population ratio. 25 percent of participants are chosen competitively without state limitations. Participants must enter into an agreement with the local government. The Secretary of Defense requires members of the armed forces to enter into an agreement with a local government to receive training as a law enforcement officer and commit to working for the government for at least two years. The Secretary of Defense will provide a stipend of up to $5,000 to cover training costs for selected members. Members of the armed forces receiving training as law enforcement officers must commit to working for a local government for two years. If they fail to complete training or leave employment early, they must reimburse the Secretary of Defense for any stipend received. The obligation to reimburse the Secretary of Defense for any stipend received is considered a debt owed to the United States, not dischargeable in bankruptcy. The amount owed accrues interest and can be collected through the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Exceptions to reimbursement provisions exist for certain members. Exceptions to reimbursement provisions for members of the armed forces include pursuing full-time law enforcement study, active duty service, employment as a law enforcement officer in a high crime area, temporary total disability, and inability to secure employment due to caring for a spouse. The Secretary of Defense may prescribe additional reimbursement exceptions for members of the armed forces. Reimbursement under subsection (i) can be waived for individuals who become permanently totally disabled or face extreme hardship. Information on training and placement opportunities must be provided to service members during preseparation counseling. The Secretary of Defense may enter agreements with local governments for training and employment of eligible armed forces members. Special eligibility is granted to those separated between 1990-1993. The program may be expanded based on the number of eligible members selected. The Secretary may authorize local governments to select civilian employees of the Department of Defense or private defense contractors who are terminated due to defense spending reductions or contract terminations for a training and placement program. The Department of Energy or a private defense contractor employee terminated for cause is not eligible for a stipend under subsection (h), and a local government providing training or employment to such an employee will not receive assistance under this section. Definitions include the term 'State' encompassing various regions and 'unit of local government' referring to different political subdivisions. The term 'law enforcement officer' refers to individuals involved in crime control, while 'high crime area' is defined by the Attorney General. A 'private defense contractor' provides services to the Department of Defense under a contract. Members of the armed forces cannot receive training and employment as law enforcement officers after September 30, 1999. Section 1152 of title 10, United States Code, allows training and placement of involuntarily separated members as law enforcement officers, effective October 1, 1993."
