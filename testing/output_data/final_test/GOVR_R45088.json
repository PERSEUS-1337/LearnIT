    "content": "The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) was created by the Department of Defense in 1958 in response to the Soviet Union's launch of the first Sputnik satellite. DARPA focuses on investing in breakthrough technologies for national security. This report provides an overview of DARPA's organizational structure, characteristics, strategic priorities, funding trends, and select issues for congressional consideration. DARPA is focused on transformative research and development to maintain U.S. military technological superiority. It aims for revolutionary advancements that challenge current understanding and lead to new frontiers in various scientific and engineering fields. DARPA-funded research has made significant contributions in computer science, telecommunications, and material sciences. DARPA investments in military technology have led to breakthroughs in precision guided munitions, stealth technology, unmanned aerial vehicles, and infrared night vision. They have also contributed to commercial products like the internet, GPS, voice recognition, and personal electronics. However, DARPA's high-risk approach has resulted in some failed projects, such as research into paranormal phenomena and a \"mechanical elephant\" for jungle transportation in Vietnam. The Total Information Awareness program aimed to enhance the US's ability to detect foreign terrorists by creating a large database for intelligence mining. However, it faced criticism for privacy infringement, leading Congress to limit its funding in the FY2003 appropriations bill (P.L. 108-7). In 2011, the Falcon Hypersonic Technology Vehicle 2 program ended after a test flight failure. Despite setbacks, DARPA is known for high-risk, high-reward R&D and is seen as a model for innovation. The DARPA model has influenced other federal agencies like IARPA and ARPA-E, focusing on high-risk, high-reward research. DARPA is an independent R&D agency under the Department of Defense, with leadership reporting to the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering. DARPA, under the USD R&E, maintains independence and focuses on transformative R&D with 200 employees and a $3 billion budget. It operates through contracts with various entities and consists of different technical program offices. The program offices under DARPA focus on biotechnology, mathematics, cyber research, microsystems, and network-centric technologies to enhance military capabilities and effectiveness. The Tactical Technology Office at DARPA focuses on developing new platforms in ground, maritime, air, and space systems, including autonomous and unmanned platforms. Other DARPA offices include the Adaptive Execution Office for technology transition, Aerospace Projects Office for advanced aircraft technologies, and Strategic Resources Office for agency support activities. The DARPA model is often referenced in discussions on military technology development. The \"DARPA model\" is frequently mentioned in discussions on improving federal government innovation through R&D investments. DARPA's unique organizational structure, small size, and flat hierarchy allow for flexibility and quick decision-making. Dr. Richard Van Atta highlighted DARPA's ability to reinvent itself and adapt to new challenges as key to its success in innovation. DARPA attributes its innovation success to factors such as trust. DARPA's success in innovation is attributed to factors like trust, autonomy, limited tenure, a sense of mission, and risk-taking. The agency's program managers play a crucial role in project direction, with unique levels of trust and autonomy. They are responsible for creating and funding innovative projects, with the freedom to select proposals without mandatory peer review. DARPA's program managers have the autonomy to select and terminate projects, unlike NSF program managers who rely on peer review panels. DARPA hires managers for limited tenures of 3-5 years to bring in new ideas and personnel. This turnover rate of 25% annually is intentional to infuse the agency with fresh perspectives and quickly turn ideas into reality. At DARPA, high turnover rate of program managers can lead to duplicative efforts and concerns about gender imbalance in recruitment. Limited tenure and urgency are reflected in how projects are funded, typically lasting three to five years before termination if deemed unsuccessful. DARPA's program managers can quickly terminate projects and redirect funds to more promising ones based on pre-established milestones. The agency's mission to prevent technological surprises drives innovation, inspiring people to work towards impactful goals. DARPA's unique approach to risk is a key element of its success. DARPA's culture of risk-taking and tolerance for failure, along with its willingness to reallocate funds from underperforming projects, are key factors in its success. Congress and others seek to replicate DARPA's model in other federal agencies supporting R&D. Important contributors to DARPA's success include multigenerational technology thrusts, connection to the innovation ecosystem, ties to DOD leadership, and its role as an initial market creator. DARPA's success is attributed to its culture of risk-taking, tolerance for failure, and ability to reallocate funds. Congress has granted DARPA additional authorities, such as flexibility in hiring and acquiring goods, essential for innovation. Former DARPA Director Dr. Arati Prabhakar emphasized the importance of bringing in diverse technical expertise to maintain a culture of innovation. In 1998, Congress established a program for DARPA to directly hire experts in science and engineering from outside the federal government for limited term appointments, allowing the agency to streamline its hiring process and offer competitive compensation to recruit top talent. Congress granted DARPA flexibility in hiring to recruit and retain scientific and technical experts. The hiring authority was made permanent in 2017. DARPA also received \"other transactions (OT) authority\" in 1989, allowing for acquisition mechanisms outside traditional methods. OTs do not have to comply with government procurement regulations. The government granted DARPA \"other transactions (OT) authority\" in 1989 to obtain R&D from commercial sources. This authority was made permanent in 1991 and extended to the entire DOD in 1993. DARPA's R&D efforts focus on long-term projects with unclear initial national security needs, producing results that are not immediately tangible. DARPA, established in 1958 as an independent R&D agency, focuses on fundamental research and early technology development to push the boundaries of what is possible. With a mission to work on high-risk projects with the potential for revolutionary capabilities, DARPA operates outside formal military requirements, allowing for innovative and groundbreaking advancements in technology. DARPA operates independently from the military services, exploring unconventional concepts for revolutionary technological advances. The agency takes a portfolio approach to R&D investments, with program managers selecting projects based on their expertise and proximity to technical challenges. DARPA engages with the R&D and entrepreneurial community to drive innovation and risk-taking. The agency holds conferences, sponsors workshops, and supports travel to stay informed of cutting-edge technologies. DARPA leadership sets priorities and investments, focusing on four main areas outlined in a 2015 document. DARPA is focusing its investments in four main areas: rethinking complex military systems for faster development, mastering the information explosion with big-data tools, ensuring data and systems trustworthiness, and addressing the need for privacy. DARPA is addressing the need for privacy by ensuring data and systems trustworthiness through innovative bio-based programs and leveraging breakthroughs in neuroscience and genetics. DARPA is focusing on national security needs by applying deep mathematics, inventing new chemistries, and harnessing quantum physics. Dr. Steven Walker highlighted research areas like artificial intelligence and autonomous systems as crucial for the future of technology. Congress repealed a provision for DARPA to submit a biennial strategic plan in 2015. DARPA's funding is appropriated through the Defense-wide Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDT&E) account, which includes 17 other DOD organizations. Program elements within the account support specific RDT&E activities, including basic research. DARPA's funding primarily falls under basic research, applied research, and advanced technology development categories. The science and technology budget is a significant portion of DOD's funding and is crucial for developing future military systems. DARPA also allocates funding for management support, including personnel salaries and benefits. DARPA supports R&D through contracts with various performers, mainly industry, accounting for 70% of R&D in FY2017. In FY2017, DARPA's R&D funding was mainly performed by industry (70%), followed by universities and colleges (15%), intramural R&D performers (7%), other nonprofits (4%), FFRDCs (3%), and foreign entities (1%). DARPA's overall funding has increased by 51% from FY1996 to FY2019 in current dollars, with a slight decrease in constant dollars. In constant dollars, DARPA funding has remained relatively steady, decreasing by less than 1% from $3.35 billion in FY1996 to $3.32 billion in FY2019. Funding for basic research has increased over time, accounting for 14% of DARPA funding in FY2019, up from 3% in FY1996. However, the proportion of funding for basic research in FY2019 saw a 10% decline compared to FY2018. Funding for applied research has fluctuated, averaging 42% between FY1996 and FY2019. In FY2019, DARPA funding for applied research averaged 42%, while funding for advanced technology development averaged 45%. Management support funding remained steady, peaking at 8% in FY2010 but dropping to 2% in FY2019. DARPA aims to ensure the U.S. military leads in technological advancements. Between FY1996 and FY2019, DARPA's share of DOD RDT&E funding declined from 6.4% to 3.6%, while its share of Defense S&T funding remained relatively steady between 22% and 25% from FY2000 to FY2017. In FY2019, DARPA's share of Defense S&T funding increased to 21.5%. Congressional considerations include the level of funding DARPA should receive, its technology transfer activities, and its role under the DOD Under Secretary for Research and Engineering. DARPA's role in maintaining technological superiority within the DOD is crucial, with a focus on high-risk, high-reward research. The level of support for disruptive R&D is reflected in DARPA's funding, which is seen as essential for U.S. economic competitiveness and national security. The National Academy of Sciences recommends allocating 8% of agency budgets to high-risk, high-reward research to drive technological advancements in the military. DARPA's share of DOD RDT&E funding has been below 7% since FY1996, averaging 4.3% between FY1996 and FY2019. In FY2019, it is 3.6% of the agency's RDT&E funding. DARPA's funding has been on a downward trend since FY1996, with a 2017 report showing that innovative companies invest 80% of their R&D on incremental improvements and 20% on high-risk, high-reward research. DARPA's share of Defense S&T funding has remained steady at 22-25% from FY2000 to FY2019, similar to leading innovative companies' R&D allocation. Disruptive R&D is conducted independently, resembling corporate research organizations. The appropriate funding level for DARPA depends on the perspective used for analysis. The appropriate funding level for DARPA depends on the perspective used for analysis, considering DARPA's share of the Defense S&T budget and the goals of Congress. Increased funding may be necessary to maintain technological superiority and address concerns about losing the U.S. military's advantage over adversaries. Technology transfer from DARPA to acquisition programs is a challenge. Technology transfer from DARPA to acquisition programs is a challenge due to barriers such as administrative, funding, cultural, and programmatic issues. DARPA's goal of creating disruptive technologies can also face resistance from military services, as seen with the Air Force's initial reluctance towards stealth technologies for aircraft. DARPA's funding supports basic research, applied research, and advanced technology development but not advanced component development and prototypes or system development and demonstration. Companies fund disruptive technology projects through demonstration to overcome resistance. Recent prototyping initiatives in the Air Force aim to address these challenges. Recent prototyping initiatives like the Air Force Experimentation Initiative and the Army Technology Maturation Initiative aim to bridge the gap in technology maturation funding between DARPA and the department's acquisition programs. Barriers to technology transfer include developing technologies outside a service's mission and lacking a clear customer. However, DARPA has successfully transitioned some technologies to the military and private sector by meeting factors like demand, sustained interest, collaboration, and technical goals. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) has raised concerns about DARPA's technology transfer efforts, noting inconsistencies in reporting and collection of information. DARPA's leadership has been criticized for not assessing technology transition strategies effectively, with responsibilities falling on program managers who may not be adequately trained. Congress may review the effectiveness of DARPA's Adaptive Execution Office in implementing technology transition strategies. The Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (USD R&E) was established in 2016 to address concerns about the U.S. military losing technical superiority. The role of the USD(R&E) is to focus on technology transition strategies and incorporate commercial innovations effectively. The USD R&E works with agencies like DARPA, Defense Threat Reduction Agency, and Missile Defense Agency to maintain U.S. defense technological dominance. Congress may need to define DARPA's role in this effort by examining its past roles in technology development. DARPA is a supporter of experimental and advanced concepts for weapons and systems, developer of operational capabilities for military conflicts, funder of research for defense technologies, and supporter of fundamental knowledge. DARPA's success is linked to a clearly defined mission. The Trump Administration prioritizes emerging technologies for economic growth and security. The Trump Administration prioritizes emerging technologies for economic growth and security, including data science, encryption, autonomous technologies, gene editing, new materials, nanotechnology, advanced computing technologies, and artificial intelligence. The implementation of this strategic vision across DOD's R&D organizations, including DARPA, remains unclear. Questions about DARPA's focus, potential impact of technologies, interaction with the commercial sector, investment scale and risk, and pursuit of ambitious programs are still relevant today. The 2003 report by IDA highlighted the importance of strong support from OSD for DARPA's success. Developments in R&D and technology can raise ethical, legal, and societal concerns, especially regarding the impact of artificial intelligence and neurotechnologies on privacy and individual identity. The application of these technologies in a military context further elevates these concerns. In 2013, DARPA began neurotechnology programs under the BRAIN Initiative, focusing on brain-computer interfaces for enhancing neural function and performance. The Presidential Commission for Bioethical Issues recommended early integration of ethics in neuroscience research. DARPA requires ethical panels for R&D projects and plans a national ethics workshop. The National Academy of Sciences (NAS) highlighted the lack of ethical considerations in DARPA's R&D projects, especially those for military purposes. NAS recommended five processes to address ethical, legal, and societal issues in agency's research portfolios. DARPA has implemented a strategy to address ethical, legal, and societal (ELS) concerns early on in R&D projects. The agency conducts reviews, engages with the public, and periodically reviews ELS-related processes. DARPA asserts that the strategy has been effective based on positive feedback from the ELS community. Congress may consider oversight on DARPA's integration of ELS considerations. Congress may consider oversight on DARPA's integration of ethical, legal, and societal considerations into its R&D portfolio."
