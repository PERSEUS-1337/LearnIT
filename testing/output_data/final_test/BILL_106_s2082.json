    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Presidential Sites Improvement Act of 2000\" and includes findings. Congress finds that there are numerous Presidential sites in the United States, mostly owned and maintained by non-Federal entities, which are costly to upkeep and in need of improvements due to insufficient funding. This is to promote understanding of U.S. history by preserving these historic sites. The Federal Government should provide grants for the maintenance and improvement of Presidential sites to preserve historic sites linked to Presidents of the United States. The Act defines key terms such as \"Grant Commission,\" \"Presidential site,\" and \"Secretary.\" It establishes the Grant Commission for Presidential sites and outlines criteria for sites eligible for grants. The Secretary awards grants for maintenance and improvement projects at Presidential sites. Grant funds can be used for repairs, capital improvements, and modifications to achieve compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act. The Secretary awards grants for maintenance and improvement projects at Presidential sites, with funds allocated for emergency projects and grants for sites with an annual operating budget of less than $700,000.

The Secretary may use unexpended funds for grants in another project category. Owners of Presidential sites can apply for grants, which are then forwarded to the Grant Commission for consideration within 60 days. The Grant Commission must return the application to the Secretary with a recommendation within 60 days.
