    "content": "The \"Consumer Automobile Lease Advertising Act of 1998\" is referred to as the Short Title. Any amendments or repeals in the Act are considered to be made to a section of the Consumer Credit Protection Act. The Findings and Purpose of the Act are outlined in Section 2. The Congress finds that consumers are increasingly leasing automobiles instead of buying them on credit, with leases now accounting for over one-third of new car transactions. Current leasing practices lack transparency, making it difficult for consumers to compare lease offers. Advertisements for automobile leases often mislead consumers by emphasizing attractive terms without providing full disclosure. With leases representing a significant portion of new car transactions, there is a growing need for more transparent and easily understandable information in lease advertising. This will enable consumers to make informed decisions when evaluating lease offers, comparing terms from different dealerships, and weighing the benefits of leasing versus buying. The purpose of amendments made by this Act is to simplify and standardize automobile lease advertising to provide consumers with clear information on lease terms and costs early in the process, allowing for comparison between lease and purchase options. SEC. 3 of the Consumer Credit Protection Act is amended to increase the limit on contractual obligations to $50,000, with annual adjustments based on the Consumer Price Index. Amendments to Section 184(a) of the Consumer Credit Protection Act include renumbering paragraphs, requiring disclosure in the same language as the advertisement, and mandating lease identification in both audio and video of television ads. These requirements apply to all forms of advertising. Amendments to Section 184(a) of the Consumer Credit Protection Act include renumbering paragraphs, requiring disclosure in the same language as the advertisement, and mandating lease identification in both audio and video of television ads. This applies to all forms of advertising, including publications, newsletters, fliers, computer programs, internet ads, and toll-free telephone numbers. Conforming amendments are made to Section 184(c) as well. SEC. 5. ALTERNATIVE LEASE DISCLOSURES. Section 184(c) (15 U.S.C. 1667c(C)) is amended to update language regarding radio broadcasts to include television broadcasts and provide clearer guidelines for recorded messages. The text chunk amends paragraph (2)(B) to include an option for consumers to request information in written form by mail from a toll-free number established in accordance with subparagraph (A). It also adds a clause to exclude marketing and sales promotional information from the information provided by the toll-free telephone. SEC. 6. ADVERTISEMENT FOR AUTOMOBILE LEASE. Section 184 (15 U.S.C. 1667c) is amended to prohibit certain practices in automobile lease advertisements, including misleading statements about downpayments and the inclusion of specific lease terms. The amendment to Section 184 (15 U.S.C. 1667c) prohibits misleading statements in automobile lease advertisements, including offering lease terms not typically available to customers for vehicles of the same make, model, and year. The Board will calculate lease payment amounts based on a formula outlined in regulations, considering the total cost of the advertised vehicle model, a 24-month lease term, and a mileage allowance of 24,000 miles. An advertisement promoting a lease for an automobile must clearly state that the lease payment amount applies to a 24-month consumer lease with no downpayment, trade-in, and an annual mileage allowance of 12,000 miles. Additionally, the advertisement may state a different lease payment amount for the same vehicle model under certain conditions. The advertisement must clearly identify lease terms and payment amounts, ensuring that the lease payment amount is not more prominent than the required amount stated. SEC. 7. AVAILABILITY OF WRITTEN INFORMATION. Section 184 (15 U.S.C. 1667c) is amended to require automobile dealers to provide written information in advertisements promoting consumer leases for automobiles. This includes a statement for each promoted automobile that accurately sets out lease payment amounts. The amended Section 184 (15 U.S.C. 1667c) requires automobile dealers to provide written information in advertisements for consumer automobile leases. This information must include a clear summary of payment amounts, terms, vehicle description, capitalized cost, total lease payments, and calculation details for advertised monthly payments. The amended Section 184 (15 U.S.C. 1667c) mandates automobile dealers to disclose detailed lease information in advertisements, including fees, interest charges, total amount due at lease inception, and customer incentives. This information must be prominently displayed in the dealership and provided to any customer upon request. The amended Section 184 mandates automobile dealers to disclose detailed lease information, including customer incentives like special interest rates and cash rebates, in a prominent location at the dealership. The amended Section 184 requires automobile dealers to disclose special incentives and lease terms offered to consumers, including vehicle discounts and promotions. SEC. 8. DEFINITIONS. Section 184 (15 U.S.C. 1667c) is amended to include new requirements for clearly and conspicuously displaying lease terms in print and video advertisements to ensure they are easily noticeable and understandable to consumers. In advertisements, required disclosures must be easily noticeable and understandable to consumers in various formats such as television, radio, and internet ads. The disclosures should be delivered in a way that is readily noticeable, hearable, and comprehensible to an ordinary consumer, and should be separated from marketing information on the internet. In advertisements, required disclosures must be easily noticeable and understandable to consumers in various formats such as television, radio, and internet ads. The disclosures should not be obscured or detracted from by any advertising techniques. SEC. 9. ADMINISTRATIVE ENFORCEMENT. Chapter 5 of the Consumer Credit Protection Act is amended to include a new section, Sec. 187, regarding Administrative Enforcement by the Federal Trade Commission. Compliance with section 184 will be enforced by the FTC, with all its functions and powers available to ensure compliance. Violation of section 184 will be considered an unfair or deceptive act under the Federal Trade Commission Act. The Federal Trade Commission Act grants the FTC the authority to enforce violations of section 184 as if they were violations of FTC trade regulation rules. SEC. 10. CIVIL LIABILITY. Amends the Truth in Lending Act to limit civil liability for violations to $10,000. SEC. 11. REGULATIONS. The Federal Reserve Board must issue regulations within 6 months of the enactment of the Act to implement the amendments. These regulations will update and clarify lease disclosure requirements and other consumer leasing issues to ensure compliance with the Act's intent and prevent circumvention."
