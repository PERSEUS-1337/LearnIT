Health-care expenses could constitute over 12% of the DOD's budget by 2015, impacting spending on other defense programs. The Defense health system serves 9.3 million potential beneficiaries with varying types of care. Tricare provides healthcare benefits for retired military personnel and their dependents, including a program for those eligible for Medicare called Tricare for Life (TFL) and a premium-based option for reservists and their families. Military retirees aged 65 and above can also receive treatment in military medical facilities. Tricare beneficiaries are divided into different plans, with Tricare Prime being a health maintenance organization (HMO) required for active duty personnel. Tricare offers healthcare benefits through different plans like Tricare Prime, Tricare Extra, and Tricare Standard. Tricare for Life (TFL) serves as a supplemental payer to Medicare. Prescriptions can be obtained from military or civilian pharmacies with low co-payments. Special versions of these plans are available for beneficiaries in overseas and remote areas, leading to current and projected cost growth. Factors contributing to cost growth in Tricare plans include increases in medical service and prescription costs, the establishment of Tricare for Life in FY2001, expanded access for non-active duty reservists, and changes in co-payments and catastrophic caps. The catastrophic cap for retirees under Tricare has been reduced from $7,500 to $3,000, increasing costs for the Department of Defense. Concerns about defense health care costs stem from the generous benefits provided with limited contributions and co-payments, mainly directed towards dependents and retirees rather than combat injuries. The system focuses on care for dependents, especially in obstetrics and pediatrics, and retirees with increasing medical needs. Despite the need for treating injuries from military operations, the majority of DOD medical care goes to dependents and retirees, not the operating forces. In Tricare, medical care is provided to dependents and retirees, with higher utilization rates compared to civilian HMOs due to lower out-of-pocket costs. Many retirees with civilian jobs choose Tricare over their employer's plans. Employers cannot provide special supplements for Tricare beneficiaries as it is illegal. DOD proposed changes in the FY2007 budget to constrain health care costs by focusing on care for retirees and their dependents. DOD proposed cost-saving measures in health care for retirees and their dependents not eligible for Medicare, including annual enrollment fees for Tricare Standard and increased fees for Tricare Prime. No changes were suggested for active duty military or retirees eligible for Medicare. TFL-eligible beneficiaries faced higher co-payments for some prescriptions, with DOD recommending annual inflation adjustments for cost shares. Tricare Prime enrollment fees were set at $230 for individuals and $460 for individuals and dependents in 1995. The Bush Administration proposed benefit reforms to save $1.8 billion in FY2008 and endorsed increased Tricare premiums for $1.2 billion in savings in FY2009. The 10th Quadrennial Review of Military Compensation recommended setting Tricare Prime premiums for single retirees under 65 at 40% of Medicare Part B. The 10th Quadrennial Review of Military Compensation recommended setting Tricare Prime premiums for single retirees under 65 at 40% of Medicare Part B premiums. Tricare Standard/Extra premiums for single retirees would be set at 15% of Part B premiums, with family rates at twice the single rate. Tricare deductibles would be linked to Medicare rates, with copayments waived for preventive care and prescription drug payments limited. Health care for retirees under 65 would be financed through accrual accounting to assess future costs. The 10th Quadrennial Review of Military Compensation recommended changes to Tricare premiums and cost-sharing arrangements. The DOD is seeking congressional authority to adjust fees and co-pays to balance healthcare benefits and costs. The Obama Administration's 2010 Budget does not include proposals to increase Tricare fees. Secretary Gates expressed concerns about rising healthcare costs impacting the DOD budget. The FY2010 Budget Summary Justification highlights concerns about the increasing costs of military healthcare, projecting a 5 to 7 percent annual cost increase through FY2015. This growth is attributed to higher utilization of healthcare services, expanded benefits like TRICARE for Reservists, and a potential shift of budget towards healthcare from warfighting capabilities. The DOD's strategy is to link weapons cuts to health care costs and a need for fee increases. Pentagon officials plan to highlight the cancellation or delay of weapons systems and other large cuts in military spending, arguing that soaring health care costs are a reason for these cuts. Congress may decide to increase Tricare fees, which have not changed since the mid-1990s. Congress previously prohibited DOD from increasing premiums, deductibles, and other charges through September 30, 2009. Provisions were enacted in 2006 to prohibit civilian employers from encouraging retired servicemembers to rely on Tricare. The FY2007 national defense authorization required the establishment of a DOD Task Force on the Future of Military Health Care to examine efforts to improve defense health care. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) and Congressional Budget Office (CBO) audited the costs of health care for DOD and beneficiaries from 1995 to 2005. The Task Force on the Future of Military Health Care recommended changes in enrollment fees and deductibles to restore cost-sharing relationships. GAO released a report in May 2007 stating that TRICARE cost-sharing proposals could help offset increasing health care spending, but projected savings may be overestimated. The GAO report in May 2007 found that DOD overestimated savings from cost-shares, but proposed fee increases could save $2.3 billion over five years. Despite Congress rejecting fee hikes for FY2009, preventive health measures were enacted to reduce future healthcare usage. The Tricare program implemented preventive health measures for eligible beneficiaries, including cancer screening, annual physical exams, and vaccinations. A military health risk management project evaluated incentives for healthy behaviors, a smoking cessation program was introduced, and a preventive health allowance demonstration project aimed to increase the use of preventive services. Additional studies and demonstration projects were authorized to improve health and medical care delivery. The results of these initiatives could inform future policy decisions. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) cost estimate does not project any savings for the military health-care financing proposals. Different approaches, such as retirees foregoing defense health care until age 65 in exchange for a lump-sum payment, have been suggested to reduce costs for the Department of Defense (DOD) over the long term. Congress may revisit fee increases as part of comprehensive changes in defense health-care budgeting. One approach to reduce costs for the Department of Defense (DOD) is to offer retirees a \"cafeteria plan\" with an annual cash allowance for health care. This would allow retirees to establish health savings accounts (HSAs) and could potentially reduce DOD's outlays by 25%. However, the acceptability of this approach to retirees is uncertain and HSAs are controversial. The Obama Administration has chosen not to propose any Tricare user fee increases for FY2010, but the budget submission does propose to reduce spending for high profile weapons acquisitions. Some argue for readjusting budget categories to remove health-care spending for retirees from defense appropriation acts, while others believe this would obscure the true costs of decisions affecting military manpower. Legislators may consider using cost savings from the Tricare program to restore funding for proposed cuts. Retiree organizations argue against proposed fee hikes, citing unique military service requirements and sacrifices made in Iraq and Afghanistan. There are complex considerations regarding adjustments to enrollment fees and co-payments. The growth of military medical spending raises complex considerations, especially for retired servicemembers and their dependents. Some argue for limited funds for medical care due to competing defense requirements. These issues have persisted since DOD proposed fee increases in 2006 and are ongoing."
