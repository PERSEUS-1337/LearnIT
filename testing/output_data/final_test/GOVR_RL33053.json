    "content": "The Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act authorizes the President to issue declarations for disasters, emergencies, and fire management, allowing federal agencies to assist overwhelmed state and local governments. The Act includes titles covering definitions, preparedness, administrative provisions, major disaster assistance, emergency assistance, and emergency preparedness. Titles IV and V specify the types of assistance and any limitations. The Stafford Act authorizes the President to issue declarations for disasters, emergencies, and fire management, allowing federal agencies to assist overwhelmed state and local governments. Most presidential authority is delegated to administration officials, with definitions establishing eligibility for assistance and conditions for presidential action. Presidents Bush and Obama issued 55 major disaster declarations. In 2009, Presidents Bush and Obama issued major disaster declarations and emergency declarations for various incidents, including winter storms and a refinery explosion. They also provided fire suppression assistance to prevent forest fires. Stafford Act assistance funding is derived from these declarations. Stafford Act assistance funding is derived from declarations issued by Presidents Bush and Obama in 2009 for various incidents, including winter storms and a refinery explosion. This funding provides grants for mass care, restoration of facilities, debris clearance, and aid for uninsured critical needs. Loans are also authorized for communities with significant revenue losses due to disasters. Additionally, federal agencies can provide technical assistance, personnel, and resources to support state and local response efforts. The Stafford Act, enacted in 1974 with amendments over the years, outlines administrative provisions for federal disaster assistance. Federal aid cannot duplicate other sources, and agency heads can waive administrative requirements. A federal coordinating officer ensures coordination of assistance in disaster areas. Applicants must have insurance, and Title III of the statute details administrative requirements and limitations. The Stafford Act, enacted in 1974 with amendments over the years, outlines administrative provisions for federal disaster assistance. It provides various types of assistance, expands eligibility for non-profit organizations, and coordinates Stafford assistance with other federal authorities. The act supplements state and local relief efforts, triggered by a presidential declaration following a gubernatorial request. Over the years, the scope of the statute has expanded to provide grants for individuals, families, community organizations, and government operations. Amendments post-Hurricane Katrina addressed administrative concerns and established new levels of assistance. The Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act of 2006 expanded FEMA's authority to provide assistance and imposed requirements on federal officials for effective pre-disaster preparation. It included enhancements such as assistance for service animals and pets, evacuation planning, and individual case management while maintaining state and local emergency management responsibility. The Post-Katrina Act of 2006 expanded the President's federal disaster assistance authority under the Stafford Act. Changes included expedited federal assistance for precautionary evacuation measures and aid to disabled individuals for housing assistance. The Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990 ensures accommodation for individuals with disabilities during emergencies, including providing durable medical equipment. The amendments also prohibit discrimination towards the disabled, those with special needs, and those with limited English proficiency. The FEMA Administrator must ensure information is accessible to those with limited English proficiency and develop guidelines for state and local governments. The Pets Evacuation and Transportation Standards Act of 2006 authorizes grants for emergency shelters to accommodate pets and service animals. The 2006 amendments expanded federal housing assistance for disaster victims, including improved emergency shelters for pets and service animals. The President can provide transportation aid for displaced individuals to move between temporary shelters or return home, as well as case management services for organizations assisting victims. Eligibility for housing assistance now includes disabled individuals unable to access their homes. The 2006 amendments expanded federal housing assistance for disaster victims, including improved emergency shelters for pets and service animals. Alternative housing sites must meet accessibility requirements. Statutory ceilings on financial aid for housing repair were eliminated, with a cap of $25,000 per individual or household. The President can provide semi-permanent housing where no alternatives exist. Newly eligible housing-assistance costs include utility costs and security deposits. FEMA trailers disposal is coordinated with federal agencies. A demonstration project, the Individuals and Households Pilot, was established. The 2006 amendments expanded federal housing assistance for disaster victims, including improved emergency shelters for pets and service animals. A demonstration project, the Individuals and Households Pilot Program, aimed to increase the use of existing rental housing for disaster victims. Public assistance grants are available for building new facilities in different locations if damaged facilities cannot be repaired or replaced. The 2006 amendment in the SAFE Ports Act expanded federal housing assistance for disaster victims and authorized expedited payments for debris removal. It also amended the Community Disaster Loan provisions by authorizing loans to local governments that suffer significant losses in tax revenue due to a major disaster. Additionally, the amendment required the President to conduct a pilot program of incentives for disaster preparedness. The President authorized a pilot program for incentives in debris removal and repair work for local and state governments. Changes were made to federal aid for nonprofit organizations affected by disasters, including defining facilities that provide essential services and adding \"education\" to eligible services. The amendments to the law added \"education\" to the critical services eligible for FEMA grants, allowing private nonprofit education organizations to apply directly. The Post-Katrina Act adjusted the percentage amounts for Hazard Mitigation Grant Program awards based on the total Stafford Act assistance provided for disasters. The 2006 amendments to the Stafford Act include changes such as appointing one Federal Coordinating Officer for multi-state events, designating a Small State and Rural Advocate in FEMA, and authorizing the President to establish national response teams. The 2006 amendments to the Stafford Act include changes such as appointing one Federal Coordinating Officer for multi-state events, designating a Small State and Rural Advocate in FEMA, and authorizing the President to establish national response teams. FEMA team members must possess essential capabilities, training skills, and equipment. The SAFE Ports Act amended the Stafford Act by adding a new definition for \"essential service providers\" who help restore essential services in disaster areas. Legislation in the 111th Congress could expand federal assistance categories in the Stafford Act, with examples like H.R. 888 and S. 763 authorizing temporary mortgage and rental assistance for disaster victims. The 2000 amendments to the Stafford Act limited assistance for disaster victims, but new bills like H.R. 941 and S. 1069 aim to provide grants for repairing damaged electric utility facilities. Another bill, H.R. 1239, allows states to establish revolving loan funds for hazard mitigation. The legislation aims to establish revolving loan funds for hazard mitigation activities for homeowners and businesses. It would amend the pre-disaster mitigation authority and draw on experience from a pilot program for severe repetitive loss properties. Two bills, S. 713 and H.R. 3437, propose modifications to disaster housing provisions, including developing lifecycle plans for mobile housing units and repairing units hazardous to occupants' health before use for disaster-related housing needs. S. 713 and H.R. 3437 propose modifications to disaster housing provisions, including evaluating existing stock of temporary housing units and increasing individual and household assistance to $50,000 for lower income residents in high-cost living states. H.R. 3466 authorizes the President to consolidate funds for public infrastructure restoration with no cost share required from state or local governments. H.R. 3377 makes changes to the Stafford Act, authorizing funding for the Pre-Disaster Mitigation program through FY2012 and requiring modernization of federal public warning systems. In the 111th Congress, measures were proposed to modernize FEMA's public warning system, reauthorize the Mortgage and Rental Assistance program, provide federal health benefits to disaster assistance employees, authorize the National Urban Search and Rescue Response system, and increase grants for hazard mitigation. Additionally, two public laws were enacted that affected the administration of the Stafford Act. In the 111th Congress, measures were proposed to modernize FEMA's public warning system, reauthorize the Mortgage and Rental Assistance program, provide federal health benefits to disaster assistance employees, authorize the National Urban Search and Rescue Response system, and increase grants for hazard mitigation. The FY2010 appropriations statute for DHS authorizes the reemployment of retired administrative law judges to settle disputes related to the arbitration panels established in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 in order to expedite recovery from Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. Major disaster and emergency declarations are two of the five types of actions that may be taken under authority of the Stafford Act. The Stafford Act allows the President to direct the Department of Defense for emergency work after a catastrophe at the request of a governor. It also authorizes the President to provide fire management assistance to communities facing threats of destruction from fires on public or private property. FEMA may determine the need for DOD aid to save lives and protect property in the immediate aftermath of an incident. The implementation of a major disaster declaration by FEMA officials requires a gubernatorial request during an uncontrolled fire. State applications must meet cost thresholds set by FEMA for approval. The Secretary of DHS can pre-position employees and supplies when a disaster is imminent but not yet declared. The FEMA Administrator deploys teams and resources for federal response, including evacuation preparedness assistance. The Stafford Act authorizes the President to issue major disaster and emergency declarations after incidents overwhelm state and local resources. Major disaster declarations can be issued for natural catastrophes or other events, based on a request from the affected state's governor. FEMA evaluates gubernatorial requests for disaster declarations based on factors like per capita impact, insurance coverage, hazard mitigation, and previous disasters. Factors for federal assistance include damages concentration, injuries, essential service disruptions, and special population needs. The declaration process for emergencies is similar to major disasters but with less specific criteria. The President can issue an emergency declaration without a gubernatorial request if federal responsibility is primary. FEMA assesses needs such as disaster housing, financial assistance, and other factors. FEMA officials assess resources before recommending emergency declaration. Stafford Act determines eligible applicants. Aid is provided based on need after declaration. Not all affected entities may receive assistance. Eligibility depends on insurance and housing options. Local governments must meet FEMA guidelines for aid. The extent of assistance available from FEMA varies based on the type of disaster and the extent of damage. Local jurisdictions may be eligible for Individual Assistance or Public Assistance programs depending on the level of damage to homes or infrastructure. Assistance may also be provided for specific activities such as debris removal. The Stafford Act authorizes the President to determine eligibility for federal relief through disaster declarations. A major disaster declaration allows for various types of federal assistance, including general support for state and local governments, resources for evacuations and recovery efforts, and technical help. The Stafford Act authorizes federal assistance through disaster declarations, including aid distribution, life-saving assistance, debris clearance, search and rescue missions, and hazard mitigation grants. Federal facilities can be repaired or replaced before legislation is enacted, and funds can be transferred from other accounts if necessary. Assistance for repair, restoration, and replacement of damaged facilities is provided through the Public Assistance (PA) program. This includes repairing or rebuilding public facilities and infrastructure systems owned by state and local governments, as well as private nonprofit facilities. Debris removal can be funded through federal resources or grants to state and local governments. Financial assistance for individuals and households includes grants for alternative housing, temporary housing units, and limited assistance for housing repairs and replacement. Financial assistance for housing repairs, uninsured medical, dental, funeral, personal property, transportation, and other expenses is available. Unemployment assistance is provided for up to 26 weeks for individuals unemployed due to a disaster. Grants are offered to assist low-income migrant and seasonal farmworkers affected by emergencies. Food coupons, distribution, commodities, legal services, crisis counseling, and training grants are also available for those in need. The major disaster declaration specifies the type of incident covered, time period, types of assistance available, units of local government included, and federal coordinating officer's name. It may be amended over time to modify assistance types and areas included. The major disaster declaration specifies the incident covered, assistance types, local government units, and federal coordinating officer's name. Emergency declarations provide less assistance and include activities to support state and local emergency assistance, coordination of disaster relief, technical assistance, debris removal, grants for housing and personal needs, and distribution of essential supplies. FEMA requires contractual agreements before providing federal assistance under Stafford Act authority. Under Stafford Act authority, FEMA and states must finalize contractual agreements for distributing disaster assistance funding to eligible applicants. Federal assistance programs have fixed dollar amount or percentage limits on eligible costs, with a minimum federal share of 75% for certain activities. Cost share requirements are established for federal, state, and local entities according to statutory provisions. The federal share for repair, restoration, or replacement of public facilities must be at least 75% of eligible costs, but can be reduced to 25% under certain conditions. Federal aid may be reduced if facilities in flood hazard areas lack flood insurance. Cost estimation requirements must be followed, with the President able to approve costs exceeding limitations. \"Associated costs\" like national guard forces' employment may be reimbursed. Congressional notification is required for over $20 million in facility repairs. Debris removal also requires a federal share. The federal government provides financial assistance for repairing, restoring, or replacing facilities after disasters. Debris removal requires a federal share of at least 75% of eligible costs. Individual and household assistance includes temporary housing units for up to 18 months, with fair market rents charged after. Financial assistance is also provided for uninsured medical, dental, funeral, transportation, and personal property needs. The federal share for Other Needs Assistance is capped at 75% of eligible costs, with a maximum of $25,000 under the Individuals and Household Program. Federal assistance for facility repair or replacement, essential assistance, debris removal, or emergency assistance is capped at $35,000 annually. Emergency declaration assistance requires a federal share of 75% of eligible costs, with a limit of $5 million per declaration unless extended by the President. The state-local match requirement may be waived in certain circumstances, except for the 25% state-local requirement for Individual Assistance programs. The federal government provides grants for hazard mitigation and pre-disaster mitigation under the Individual Assistance Program. States or local governments can request a reduction in their federal cost-share if the disaster's economic impact warrants it. Adjustments in the cost-share requirement can be made for extraordinary disasters under specific thresholds. Mitigation grants (HMGP and PDM) are provided by the federal government to state and local governments to reduce the impact of future disasters. HMGP funds are allocated to states with declared disasters and can be used for any eligible hazard mitigation activity. PDM grants, on the other hand, are not related to disaster declarations. HMGP funding was authorized in 1988 and has been amended multiple times to increase federal assistance and establish criteria for awards. The federal government provides mitigation grants (HMGP and PDM) to state and local governments to reduce the impact of future disasters. HMGP funds come from the Disaster Relief Fund and do not have a set percentage for funding disasters over $35.333 billion. Project Impact was a program initiated during the Clinton Administration to promote pre-disaster mitigation efforts, with Congress considering legislation for funding but not approving it. The 106th Congress approved legislation to expand federal pre-disaster mitigation assistance through the DMA of 2000, aiming to reduce disaster relief costs, save lives, and protect property. The PDM grant program established by the DMA helps state and local governments implement cost-effective hazard mitigation measures to reduce injuries, loss of life, and property damage after natural disasters. Successful applicants must demonstrate the ability to develop effective public-private natural disaster hazard mitigation partnerships. The legislation emphasizes strong state and local planning processes for natural disaster mitigation partnerships. Funding for PDM grants and the Disaster Relief Fund remains available until expended. Congress appropriates money to ensure federal assistance for individuals and communities affected by disasters. Supplemental appropriations are generally required each fiscal year for catastrophic disasters. The 2009 hurricane season had no major disaster declarations for named hurricanes. The 2009 hurricane season had no major disaster declarations for named hurricanes, but 56 severe storms caused significant destruction, leading to the appropriation of $1.6 billion in regular appropriations for FY2010. An additional $5.5 billion was allocated through P.L. 111-112 for Gulf Coast recovery projects. The impact of an arbitration panel's decisions on the appropriation of supplemental FY2010 funds for the Disaster Relief Fund is discussed in the \"Appeal Process\" section of the report. The increased cost of federal disaster assistance authorized by the Stafford Act has expanded categories of aid and eligibility. Congress has broadened the basic authority since 1950 to include housing, infrastructure repair grants, aid to individuals, loans for lost revenue, and more. The Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) funds \"mission assignments\" by FEMA to other federal agencies for post-disaster assistance. Mission assignments allow any federal agency to perform activities to save lives, protect property, or provide authorized assistance. The Stafford Act authorizes federal disaster assistance and mission assignments to other agencies, eliminating the need for specific appropriations by Congress. For example, FEMA's Operation Blue Roof is assigned to the US Army Corps of Engineers for temporary roof repairs. Other activities under mission assignments include search and rescue, disease prevention, and medical support. Legislation may amend Stafford Act provisions on eligibility. The legislation introduced would amend provisions of the Stafford Act to expand eligibility for assistance to certain private nonprofit organizations providing essential government services. This proposed change would breach the longstanding division between public and for-profit entities. Members of the 112th Congress may need to consider further legislative changes. The legislation introduced aims to expand eligibility for Stafford Act assistance to certain private for-profit entities, breaking the longstanding division between public and for-profit organizations. This change is prompted by the recognition of the vital role played by private sector entities in community recovery post-disaster. Some suggest a different approach to extending assistance beyond pre-paid insurance or loans. The Congress is considering different approaches to extending Stafford Act assistance, including expanding eligibility to heirs of deceased property owners and modifying the definition of \"major disaster\" to include other catastrophes. Various bills propose changes such as authorizing declarations for terrorist attacks or contamination, updating criteria for disaster declarations, and considering the needs of rural areas. The pending legislation (H.R. 4297) aims to expand eligibility for federal disaster relief assistance by considering the needs of rural areas with less dense land development. This could lead to increased aid proposals but opponents argue it may result in higher federal expenditures. Some suggest balancing increased aid with cost-cutting measures, similar to the 2000 amendments that expanded assistance and reduced costs in some areas. The pending legislation (H.R. 4297) aims to expand eligibility for federal disaster relief assistance by considering the needs of rural areas with less dense land development. Some argue for balancing increased aid proposals with cost-cutting measures, while others believe amendments expanding eligibility are necessary due to budget problems, increased costs, and more stringent requirements. This is consistent with congressional findings and past precedent of providing assistance. In response to disasters, Congress has provided funds to assist private corporations affected, such as utility companies after ice storms in 1998 and companies impacted by the 2001 terrorist attacks in New York City. The Texas Medical Center also received assistance under Stafford Act eligibility criteria. The ice storm in 1998 damaged electricity infrastructure, leading Congress to allocate funds to prevent passing repair costs to customers. In response to disasters, Congress provided funding in the omnibus appropriations act for FY1999 for the Community Development Block Grant program administered by HUD. Disagreement arose over the use of funds due to lack of specificity in the statute. Billions of dollars in federal assistance were allocated to New York City after the 9/11 attacks, but private for-profit communications networks were not eligible for assistance. Congress appropriated $783 million for rebuilding efforts in Lower Manhattan after the 9/11 attacks, including restoring utility infrastructure. Private for-profit communications networks were not eligible for assistance under the Stafford Act. The conferees allocated an additional $33 million to support businesses in New York City affected by the 9/11 attacks, with a focus on firms that suffered significant loss of life. They expect these funds to assist companies intending to re-establish operations in the city. President Bush declared a major disaster in the state in June 2001. In early June 2001, President Bush issued a disaster declaration for Texas due to flooding from Tropical Storm Allison. The Texas Medical Center, a health care complex with 13 hospitals, was initially ineligible for Stafford Act assistance due to its for-profit status. However, a provision in an appropriations statute made TMC eligible for FEMA grants. Members of Congress could support or oppose legislation to expand Stafford Act assistance eligibility. One option for Members of Congress is to integrate existing loan authority with grant-in-aid provisions in the Stafford Act. Congress may consider modifying thresholds for assistance by authorizing grants for businesses before obtaining loans or eliminating the requirement of being found ineligible for aid. Currently, there are no federal grants programs available. Legislative change is recommended to convert federal small business assistance from loans to grants, based on business size and history. Integration of SBA disaster loan authority and Stafford Act grant-in-aid assistance has been previously considered by Congress. President Nixon and President Carter proposed similar integrations, but Congress did not act on the proposals. President Jimmy Carter reorganized federal emergency management authorities in 1978 through the creation of FEMA, separating the loan-making authority and resources of the SBA from FEMA. One Senator argued for a single accountable official with broad coordination authority over all disaster relief programs, advocating for the separation of FEMA's coordination authority from the SBA loan authority. The 112th Congress may reopen the debate on loan authority and grant-in-aid eligibility for disaster relief. Federal assistance after a catastrophic disaster could lead to promises of restoring the area. Congressional action is stimulated by disrupted families, compromised livelihoods, and threatened governance to ensure past precedents are followed and additional aid is provided. The ongoing debate in the 112th Congress revolves around reducing federal expenditures for disaster assistance, potentially by eliminating or reducing benefits authorized by the Stafford Act. Members of Congress are considering changes to address the federal deficit while still providing necessary aid. Following the high costs of Hurricane Andrew in 1992, a Senate bipartisan task force was formed to evaluate federal disaster assistance programs and propose alternative financing approaches. The final report included a proposal to establish more explicit criteria for providing federal disaster assistance, focusing on the criteria considered by the President in issuing major disaster declarations. Legislation in the 111th Congress aimed to update criteria for major disaster declaration assistance, potentially leading to reduced federal expenditures or expanded eligibility. Analytical studies have questioned the need for federal aid after disasters, with concerns about political influences on decision-making. Some studies suggest that political considerations play a significant role in the costs of disaster relief. Research has shown that states politically important to the president or with congressional representation on FEMA oversight committees tend to receive higher disaster declarations and expenditures. Additionally, states with competitive presidential contests are more likely to receive disaster declarations, regardless of actual need. This issue has been examined in various studies, including one by the Government Accountability Office in 1989. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) conducted a study on the effects of politics on disaster declarations, finding no evidence that party affiliation influences White House decisions. Suggestions were made to amend the Stafford Act to limit the President's discretion in issuing declarations, potentially by implementing quantitative measures of need or requiring congressional review. Stafford Act assistance has never been means tested, making all residents in declared disaster areas eligible for aid. Disaster survivors in declared areas remain eligible for assistance without means testing, as long as they demonstrate need and assurance of non-duplication of aid. Legislation proposed in the 111th Congress aimed to increase aid for those with incomes below $100,000. In the face of record deficits, Members of Congress may consider enacting a means test before providing housing or other needs assistance. Some argue against means testing after a disaster due to unknown losses and increased administrative workloads. Others believe it would lower federal expenditures and encourage personal resource allocation. The 111th Congress took significant action on Stafford Act policy, granting authority to the U.S. Civilian Board of Contract Appeals to finalize decisions on public assistance applications. Legislation allowed retired judges to preside over arbitration for disputes exceeding $500,000 to expedite aid for Gulf Coast recovery efforts post-Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. FEMA regulations outline the appeal process for cases subject to review. The Civilian Board of Contract Appeals issued 14 rulings on disputed applications from December 2009 to March 3, 2010. One decision favored FEMA due to appeal timeliness, while seven decisions favored the appellants. A significant ruling involved awarding almost $475 million for the replacement of Charity Hospital in New Orleans. These decisions have influenced the debate between the Administration and Congress. The Administration and Congress are in a debate over appropriations for the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) due to recent appeals panel decisions. The President requested an additional $1.5 billion for the DRF in FY2010, on top of the $3.6 billion already included in the FY2011 budget submission. This total supplemental of $5.1 billion aims to cover unexpected demands, including arbitration panel decisions impacting the DRF. The Senate rejected a proposal to include the supplemental in legislation. Members of Congress passed a supplemental to the Disaster Relief Fund in P.L. 111-112, providing over $5.5 billion in additional disaster relief funding. The decision to authorize an arbitration process reflects dissatisfaction with the standard appeals process for FEMA's public assistance program. Congress is debating whether the appeal process needs modification through statutory change. The arbitration process for FEMA's public assistance program involves criteria for large projects exceeding $500,000, eligible applicants who withdrew their appeal, and those meeting specified deadlines. Final authority lies with the majority of arbitration panel members. Approximately 44 appeals were pending in Mississippi, Alabama, Texas, and Louisiana, with 2,188 projects awaiting rulings. FEMA expected 127 appeals to be processed. FEMA expected 127 appeals from 2,188 large projects eligible for arbitration, but only a few have been submitted. Congress may debate whether an external party should participate in the appeals process or if FEMA administrators should decide. The familiarity of FEMA officials with grant details and application requirements may support the latter argument. The familiarity of FEMA officials with grant details and application requirements may complicate efforts by appellants to determine whether to seek arbitration or appeal a FEMA decision. This may not meet the statutory mandate for fair and impartial consideration of appeals. FEMA frequently holds information that allows applicants to understand their eligibility, which could hinder the arbitration process. FEMA's slow responsiveness to FOIA requests hinders applicants' ability to understand and respond to cost disallowances in appeals. One option is to mandate FEMA to provide necessary information within the appeal timeframe. Another option is to establish an arbitration panel outside of FEMA for final determinations. The arbitration panel established under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 is authorized to consider appeals related to the Stafford Act public assistance program and assistance for housing and uninsured needs. There is no provision for public review of the arbitration panel process, and Congress may consider whether the proceedings should remain closed."
