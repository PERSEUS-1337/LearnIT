Providers of services must report sentinel events to the national accrediting body if the individual is in their care, as required by the Secretary. Providers must report sentinel events to the national accrediting body or the State agency designated by the Secretary for investigation and further reporting. This includes conducting an investigation, determining root causes, and establishing time-limited actions.

The report to the Secretary must include corrective actions taken by providers to prevent future sentinel events, proposed system changes from multiple providers, and any additional information deemed essential for compliance.

Additionally, the agency must report the name and address of providers with a pattern of poor performance to the Secretary.

The Secretary has the authority to waive reporting requirements for certain cases. The provider of services must report any sentinel event resulting in death to the Secretary or their designee, State Attorney General, State licensing agency, and State protection and advocacy system. The agency with oversight authority must determine if a death related to restraints or seclusion occurred in a sentinel event, and notify the Secretary. Sanctions will be established by the Secretary for failure to report. Sanctions, including intermediate sanctions, may be imposed for failure to submit required reports or information. The Secretary has the authority to remove an agency or entity with oversight authority if they refuse to comply. Individuals, providers of services, agencies, or entities can be held liable for reporting obligations. The root cause analysis developed under this subsection must be kept confidential and is not subject to disclosure in civil actions. Liability for false information in reports is not limited, especially in cases of sentinel events resulting in death. The Secretary shall establish a Sentinel Events Database within one year of enactment, containing provider information from reports submitted under subsection (c)(3). The Secretary will establish a Sentinel Events Database to contain provider information related to reports on deaths linked to the use of restraints or seclusion. Procedures will be in place to protect the privacy of individuals mentioned in the reports before entry into the database. The Sentinel Events Database will disclose information to providers, establish dispute resolution procedures, and ensure accuracy of information. Sanctions will not be delayed due to disputes. Access to the database will be provided. The Secretary will establish procedures for making information in the Sentinel Events Database available to Federal and State agencies, accrediting bodies, researchers, and the public. The database will also be accessible online, and fees may apply for disclosure. The Secretary may establish reasonable fees for disclosing information in the Sentinel Events Database, with no fees for Federal agencies. Fees collected will be used for maintaining the database. The amendments made by this section take effect upon enactment of the Act.

Providers must also submit reports on sentinel events as required. The Social Security Act is amended to define a 'congregate care provider' as an entity offering various healthcare services. The effective date of these amendments is upon enactment of the Act, with reporting requirements for sentinel events to be followed. The reporting requirements for sentinel events apply to events occurring on or after the date of enactment of this Act."
