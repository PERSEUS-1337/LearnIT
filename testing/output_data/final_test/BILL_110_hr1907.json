The Secretary may conduct a Coastal and Estuarine Land Conservation Program to protect important coastal and estuarine areas with significant conservation values. Grants will be provided to coastal states with approved plans for property acquisition. The Secretary may conduct a Coastal and Estuarine Land Conservation Program to protect coastal and estuarine areas by providing grants to coastal states or National Estuarine Research Reserves for property acquisition in alignment with specific management plans or programs. Funding allocation will be done through a competitive grant process following set guidelines. The Secretary consults with coastal state's management program, National Estuarine Research Reserve, and lead agency. Participating states identify conservation needs, values to protect, and threats to avoid. States ensure property acquisition complements working waterfront needs. Applicants must identify values to protect. The applicant must identify values to be protected, management activities planned, and how they may impact the identified values. Awards are based on demonstrated need for protection and ability to leverage funds. The governor or designated lead agency determines application consistency. The government determines if the application aligns with the coastal zone plan before submission. Priority is given to lands with significant ecological value that can be effectively managed and protected. Lands under threat of degradation and those mitigating coastal population growth impacts are prioritized. Guidelines are developed for project selection. The Secretary consults with stakeholders to develop guidelines for land acquisition and conservation. Coastal states and reserves can allocate grants to local governments. Performance measures are developed to evaluate the program's effectiveness. Grants can be used to purchase land or easements, with limitations and protections for private property. The program allows for the purchase of land or easements from willing sellers, with protections for private property owners. Acquisition with grants does not increase liability for property owners. Private property owners are not required to provide access unless their property has been purchased with program funds. The program allows for the purchase of land or easements with funds from this section. It does not affect the authority of governments to regulate land use. Grants require a 100 percent match from non-Federal sources, with a waiver possible for underserved communities. The program allows for the purchase of land or easements with funds from this section, with a 100 percent match required from non-Federal sources.

The land must meet specific criteria and be held by a non-governmental organization for conservation purposes in perpetuity. The program requires a 100 percent match from non-Federal sources for the purchase of land or easements. The appraised value of the land or conservation easement at the time of the grant closing will be considered as the non-Federal cost share. Costs related to land acquisition, planning, remediation, restoration, and enhancement can be used as non-Federal match if incurred within the grant award period. No less than 15 percent of funds under this section will benefit National Estuarine Research Reserves. Additionally, no more than 5 percent of funds can be used for administrative costs, with a report to Congress required. Grant recipients must provide assurances on property title if acquired with grant funds. The grant recipient must hold the property title in perpetuity, manage the property according to its intended purpose, and return funds to the Secretary if the property is sold. The property must be acquired from a willing seller. The grant recipient must demonstrate that any non-governmental land used as a match will meet program requirements. Definitions include conservation easements that grant all rights to the property except those reserved by the grantor. The term 'interest in property' includes a conservation easement. $60,000,000 is authorized for each fiscal year from 2009 to 2013 for the Secretary to carry out this section. The House of Representatives passed the document on September 22, 2008."
