    "content": "The paper constructs color invariant networks and evaluates their performance on a data set of crashed cars. The network focuses on colorfulness rather than specific colors, and the data set includes images of red and non-red cars. The networks were tested on classification tasks with altered color ratios in training data to analyze generalization capabilities. Results show that pixel-wise ordering of rgb-values improves performance. The discussion revolves around the challenges of color balance in training data for neural networks. It highlights the importance of considering color statistics for accurate object classification, especially in scenarios like autonomous driving tasks. The idea of balancing color statistics in the dataset is deemed impractical, leading to potential misclassifications based on color variations. In this paper, the focus is on constructing a network that is invariant under color changes. The paper discusses different variants of color invariant networks and evaluates them on cifar10. The main contribution is the introduction of the crashed cars data set and evaluating the best color invariant function on this data set. Appendices provide more details on the data sets, plots, figures, and explore the limits of color invariance. In this review, the focus is on color invariance in neural networks. The paper discusses various forms of invariance, including equivariance, and mentions the importance of evaluating invariance. It highlights the classical question of putting invariance in a network and provides advice on ensuring invariance through examples, pre-processing, and structure. Bishop (1997) offers guidance on enforcing invariance in training data to help the network learn. Color normalization and structural invariance are important in neural networks. Techniques such as cropping, flipping, and adding noise to training images help enforce invariance. Max pooling and spatial transformer networks are also used to ensure translation and structural invariance in image classification. Bishop (1997) provides further insights into enforcing invariance in training data. In neural networks, techniques like scaling, translating, and rotating input images help enforce stability under transformations. Invariance enforcing units, like translation and rotation invariance nets, extend spatial invariance to a larger scale. Nuisances, irrelevant properties of objects, are countered by extending the dataset with examples like computer models of chairs or real images. It is sometimes beneficial for the network to be aware of these transformations. Equivariant networks are aware of transformations, with a transformation T on the target space such that \u03c8(T (x)) = T \u03c8(x). Convolution and pooling can be extended to the group setting. Color invariance theory is derived from physical principles, with performance evaluation done. Color invariance goes beyond pixel permutation, looking at invariance under color changes of features like SIFT. The paper discusses evaluating invariance in deep neural nets through activation of neurons and with synthetic images. It defines pixel-wise color invariance and ways to achieve it in functions. The analysis focuses on symmetric polynomials. In this paper, symmetric polynomials are analyzed for invariance in deep neural nets. Various permutation invariant functions are applied to images, demonstrating their properties. The study analyzes symmetric polynomials for invariance in deep neural nets using permutation invariant functions on images. The baseline net in tensorflow's cifar10 architecture is compared to invariant nets, denoted as p 1 -net, p 2 -net, etc. The nets were trained for 249999 iterations, showing accuracy results in a table. Comparing the gray net (p 1 -net) to the baseline reveals insights. The study compares the accuracy of different symmetric functions in deep neural nets using permutation invariant functions on images. Colorfulness of input images provides enough information for classification, with sorting achieving similar results as the baseline. Order networks, which pixel-wise order color channels, perform similarly to baseline nets on cifar10. Further experiments compared order networks to baselines on a more realistic dataset. The study compared order networks to a baseline on a realistic dataset extracted from the NHTSA, consisting of images of cars categorized by body type. The task was to classify the body type and determine if the car was red. Additional annotations allowed for experiments on color invariance properties. The NCSA's Special Crash Investigations Program has provided detailed crash investigation data since 1972. The study utilized images from the NHTSA website showing crashed cars from 2004-2010, with body type annotations. Experiments were conducted using an alexnet type network, adjusting fully connected layer size, adding batch normalization, and l2-regularization to reduce overfitting. The choice of alexnet was due to its reasonable convergence time for multiple experiments. The paper analyzed different network architectures for classifying images of cars. The baseline network, a variant of alexnet, was used to output the class of a car image. Color invariant networks with an additional inv-block were also studied. Two variants were analyzed - one ordering rgb-values of pixels and another applying a convolution before ordering. The naming conventions included rgb-nets, order nets, and weighted order nets. Three training sets were created for the experiments. The study analyzed different network architectures for classifying car images, including rgb-nets, order nets, and weighted order nets. Three training sets were created: all-train, nored-train, and even-train. The nets were trained on these sets for 25000 iterations without optimizing for specific data. Four test sets were also created: all-test, nored-test, red-test, and class-test. The study analyzed different network architectures for classifying car images, including rgb-nets, order nets, and weighted order nets. Three training sets were created: all-train, nored-train, and even-train. The nets were trained on these sets for 25000 iterations without optimizing for specific data. Four test sets were also created: all-test, nored-test, red-test, and class-test. The distribution of red cars was not uniform over the classes, so sub-sampling was done to ensure each class had the same number of cars. The rgb-net performed best at 25000 iterations, beating its competitors. The class experiments showed that all three nets performed similarly, indicating accurate sub-sampling. The trained nets were tested on red cars, showing that the order nets performed slightly better than the baseline net. The accuracies of the rgb network, order network, and weighted order network were 0.5113 \u00b1 0.0306, 0.5420 \u00b1 0.0284, and 0.5411 \u00b1 0.0280 respectively. The heat plot of accuracies per class and test set confirmed that the numbers were in a similar range to previous conclusions. The experiments confirmed that the numbers were consistent with previous conclusions. The accuracy of the nets on all cars and non-red cars was similar, with the weighted order net performing the best. Training the nets on a dataset without red cars showed that the weighted order net outperformed the other nets. The weighted order net outperforms other nets on all cars and non-red cars by 0.01 to 0.02 units. On red cars, the order net beats other architectures significantly by 0.08 units. The accuracy of the trained nets was tested on 100 sets of red cars, with the rgb network at 0.3707 \u00b1 0.0272, order network at 0.4583 \u00b1 0.0281, and weighted order network at 0.3864 \u00b1 0.0280. Analysis shows order networks perform better than the baseline, with experiments on red/non-red car ratios showing improved accuracies. The achieved accuracies of different networks were analyzed, with the order nets outperforming the rgb net up to a ratio of 0.4. The nets were trained on eleven sets with fixed ratios of red/non-red cars per class. The deviation of ratios of red cars in the training set to the true ratio was computed for further analysis. In experiments analyzing color ratios in neural networks, the order nets excel up to a ratio of 0.4 compared to rgb nets. Training sets with deviations from the true ratio result in nets failing to detect red cars accurately. The study compared different color invariant neural networks and found that pixel-wise ordering of color channels showed similar results on cifar10 and a crashed car dataset. Testing the hypothesis that ordering is invariant under color changes, a classification task was conducted on the crashed car dataset, where red cars showed better performance with ordered nets. Excluding red cars from the training set, weighted order nets performed better than the baseline on all test sets. The order nets also performed well when the ratio of red/non-red cars was fixed in the training sets. The study compared different color invariant neural networks on cifar10 and a crashed car dataset. Testing the hypothesis that ordering is invariant under color changes, a classification task was conducted on the crashed car dataset. Red cars showed better performance with ordered nets. Weighted order nets performed better than the baseline on all test sets, even when the ratio of red/non-red cars was fixed in the training sets. However, all nets degraded noticeably when the ratio of red cars increased. The paper also discussed the issue of overfitting and the importance of stopping training earlier to prevent it. Sub-sampling the unevenly distributed test data gave similar results as deriving accuracies for all classes separately. The paper introduced color invariant nets that are aware of the colorfulness of objects rather than specific colors. These nets performed well when the color distribution was close to the true distribution. The crash car dataset remains a challenging classification task, calling for further experiments and insights. The paper introduced color invariant nets that are aware of the colorfulness of objects rather than specific colors. The crash car dataset poses a challenging classification task due to the difficulty in deciding the class of shown images. The selection of cars for the dataset focused on whole car views and specific annotations. The study focused on labeling whole car views with specific annotations, including determining if the car is red or not. They estimated a label error of 0.01, indicating that one out of 100 cars in the images is actually red. In the training set, there are 31918 cars and 135843 images. Three different groups of training sets were generated: all-train, nonred-train, and even-train. Each group had a specific distribution of red and non-red cars. Some images were not blacklisted despite errors in the jpg format. The all-train set included 25000 images sampled from the training data. The training data consists of 25000 images sampled from the training data. The data sets include nored-train with 2404 non-red images per class, and even-train with ten data sets denoted by even010 to even100. The data sets were generated by sampling from red and non-red images with varying ratios. The overall statistics show that each car has roughly four different views, with 14% of all cars being red. The test set includes all-test with 323 images per class, nonred-test with 273 images per class, and red-test with 100 sets of 25 images per class. Overall statistics show that each car has roughly four different views, with 14% of all cars being red. Most cars in class 09 are 4-door sedans, while sport cars in class 02 are more likely to be red. The appendix includes additional plots not included in the paper, such as nets trained on all-train and tested on nonred-test. Performance drops when there are no red cars in the training set, except for class 09. The performance of nets on red cars drops by 0.10 absolute units, while on non-red cars it drops by 0.05 absolute units. All nets perform poorly on red cars, especially class 09 which is classified almost perfectly. The nets were trained on different datasets and tested on various classes, showing varying levels of accuracy. The accuracies of the rgb-network, order network, and weighted order network were measured on thirty class data sets. Each row represents a bodytype class numbered 00 to 09, with columns showing accuracies for all cars, non-red cars, and red cars. The performance of the nets drops on red cars compared to non-red cars, with class 09 being classified almost perfectly."
