    "content": "Most of the funding for HUD comes from annual appropriations by Congress to address housing problems for low-income households. Rental assistance programs like Public Housing, Section 8 Vouchers, and Section 8 project-based rental assistance are key, along with block grant programs like HOME and CDBG for community development. Specialized grant programs also help homeless individuals, including those with AIDS. HUD's grant programs assist communities in meeting the needs of homeless individuals, including those with AIDS. The Federal Housing Administration insures mortgages for lower-income home buyers and developers of affordable rental buildings. Surplus funds from FHA have been used to support the HUD budget, which has also received emergency funding in recent years, including assistance for Hurricane Katrina and other disasters. Additionally, the economic stimulus legislation provided over $13 billion to HUD programs. Total enacted appropriations for HUD over the past five years are shown in Table 1. Table 1 shows total enacted appropriations for HUD over the past five years, including emergency funding. HUD's annual budget consists of regular annual appropriations, emergency appropriations, rescissions, and offsets. Most of HUD's programs are funded through regular annual appropriations, with additional emergency funding provided by Congress in response to disasters. Congressional appropriators are subject to limits on new discretionary appropriations, leading to offsets in regular annual appropriations for HUD. These offsets come from rescissions, receipts, and collections, impacting HUD's total budget authority. The Congressional Budget Office estimates HUD's budget authority, which may not accurately reflect funding for programs due to offsetting receipts. Congress adjusts appropriations based on offset changes to maintain level budget authority. The net non-emergency budget authority for HUD increased 41% between FY2002 and FY2009, reaching over $40 billion. Regular annual appropriations grew by 20%, while offsetting receipts and collections decreased by more than 75%. This resulted in an increase in total non-emergency budget authority for HUD, with part of the increase attributed to decreases in offsetting receipts. The increase in regular appropriations for HUD's programs and activities from FY2002 to FY2009 is largely due to the growth in appropriations for the Section 8 programs, which saw a 50% increase. This growth in non-emergency appropriations for Section 8 programs outpaced the growth in appropriations for all other programs and activities during the same period. Appropriations for the Section 8 program increased from 46% to 54% of HUD's regular appropriations from FY2002 to FY2009. Funding was increased to provide new vouchers and assistance to families in need, as well as to continue serving families in the project-based rental assistance program. The decline in offsetting receipts was mainly due to decreases in excess receipts in FHA's mortgage insurance programs. The FHA mortgage insurance program experienced a significant decline in offsetting receipts from FY2004 to FY2008, dropping by 92%. Although there was an increase in receipts in FY2009, they are expected to decrease below FY2008 levels in FY2010. President Obama's FY2010 budget request for HUD and the congressional response are presented in Table 2, with comparisons to the prior year's enacted budget authority. The current year appropriations and advance appropriations provided for the next fiscal year are included in the total available budget authority. President Obama's first HUD budget requested a 7.7% increase in regular annual appropriations, while the House-passed version of H.R. 3288 proposed a more than 11% increase in regular annual appropriations for HUD programs. The final FY2010 funding bill for HUD programs provided a 9% increase in regular annual appropriations, splitting the difference between the House and Senate versions. This resulted in an 11% increase in net new budget authority, slightly higher than President Obama's request. The FY2010 budget request of the Obama Administration outlined five key goals for HUD, including addressing the housing and economic crisis, promoting affordable rental housing, investing in communities, driving energy efficiency, and transforming HUD's operations. Several new initiatives were proposed to address challenges in information technology systems and research production. President Obama's Transformation Initiative requested the authority to transfer up to 1% of funding provided for most HUD accounts to fund activities related to Research, Evaluation, Performance Metrics, Program Demonstrations, Technical Assistance, Capacity Building, and Next-Generation Information Technology. This transfer authority would make $433.5 million available to the Transformation Initiative in FY2010. Additionally, $20 million in new appropriations was requested to address fraud, including fraud in the FHA mortgage insurance programs. The House-passed version of H.R. 3288 included the $20 million for combating mortgage fraud. The House bill approved the transfer of up to 1% of funding from most accounts, but did not permit transfers from certain accounts like Section 8 tenant-based rental assistance or public housing Operating Fund. Funds in these accounts are used immediately to assist families and cannot be transferred. The report directed the Department to spend the funds on purchasing a new information technology system for FHA and the Section 8 voucher program, studying sustainable building practices on Native American lands, and providing technical assistance on regional housing. The Senate-passed version of H.R. 3288 would have funded the President's Transformation Initiative with $20 million for combating mortgage fraud and allowing limited transfer authority. The bill prioritized funding for a new system for the FHA and Section 8 voucher programs, studies on Native American housing needs, the Moving to Work (MTW) demonstration program, and the conversion of public housing to project-based vouchers. The final FY2010 funding bill, P.L. 111-117, provides $20 million for combating mortgage fraud and authorizes transfer authority for various accounts, excluding a 1% transfer from specific accounts. It allows transfers of up to $100 million from the Section 8 tenant-based rental assistance account and up to $15 million from the Operating Fund. The bill allocates funds for new technology systems for the Section 8 voucher program and the FHA, directs an assessment of Native American housing needs, and evaluates the MTW demonstration program. The Energy Innovation Fund, proposed by the Obama Administration, aims to catalyze private sector investment in energy efficiency for housing. It includes a Local Initiatives Fund, pilot energy efficient mortgage program, and Multifamily Energy Pilot. The House-passed version of H.R. 3288 allocated $50 million for this program. The House-passed version of H.R. 3288 allocated $50 million for the President's Energy Innovation Fund, with funding split between the energy efficient mortgage program and the Multifamily Energy Pilot. The Senate-passed version provided lower funding levels, including $20 million each for the mortgage and pilot program, and $35 million for the Local Initiatives Fund. P.L. 111-117 ultimately allocated $50 million for the Energy Innovation Fund, without funding for the Local Initiatives Fund. The Choice Neighborhoods Initiative is a new proposal by the Obama Administration. The Obama Administration's Neighborhoods Initiative, modeled after the HOPE VI program, offers competitive grants to revitalize distressed neighborhoods, not limited to public housing. Eligible entities include PHAs, local governments, nonprofits, and for-profit developers. The program aims to transform, rehabilitate, and replace HUD public and assisted housing, as well as support affordable housing and community development activities in surrounding areas. The President's FY2010 budget proposed no new funding for HOPE VI, but requested $250 million for the new Choice Neighborhoods Initiative. The House-passed version of H.R. 3288 did not include funding for the President's Choice Neighborhoods Initiative. The House bill proposed funding the HOPE VI program at $250 million, while the Senate-passed version proposed funding the President's Choice Neighborhoods Initiative at the requested level. The Committee supported broadening community revitalization efforts but noted the need for public housing revitalization. P.L. 111-117 allocated $200 million to the HOPE VI program and up to $65 million for a Choice Neighborhoods demonstration. The Combating Abusive and Fraudulent Mortgage Practices Initiative aimed to prevent mortgage fraud and abuse. The Combating Abusive and Fraudulent Mortgage Practices Initiative focuses on combating fraud related to mortgage modifications, implementing RESPA and the SAFE Act, and preventing fraud in FHA's single-family programs. It includes increased funding and resources to identify and prevent mortgage fraud. The initiative aims to prevent mortgage fraud by providing funding for technology, training, and staff in various housing programs. Both the House-passed and Senate-passed versions of H.R. 3288 included funding for combating mortgage fraud and increasing resources for fair housing programs. The Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 established a Housing Trust Fund with funding from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, but their contributions were suspended in 2008. The Trust Fund currently lacks a funding source, despite authorization for alternative funding sources. The President's budget proposed $1 billion for affordable housing activities. The Housing Trust Fund lacks funding despite authorization for alternative sources. The President's budget proposed $1 billion for the Trust Fund, but no specific funding source was identified. Legislation in the 111th Congress did not mention the Trust Fund, but proposals for funding have been included in other bills. The Section 8 voucher program, funded through the tenant-based rental assistance account, provides rental subsidies for low-income families. The Section 8 voucher program offers portable rental subsidies for low-income families to reduce housing costs in the private market. HUD funds over two million vouchers administered by Public Housing Authorities. This account is the largest in HUD's budget and is subject to intense debate during funding deliberations. Budget authority for tenant-based rental assistance includes current year and advance appropriations. Since FY2001, funding for the Section 8 program has included an advance appropriation, with the amount remaining consistent each year. In FY2009, the advance appropriation for FY2010 was less than the previous year's advance, resulting in a decrease in budget authority for FY2009. In FY2009, the budget authority provided for the Section 8 program was less than the amount available, leading to a discrepancy in funding allocation. Congress was scored based on the available budget authority rather than the amount provided by the bill, impacting the program's relevant level. Public housing authorities manage the program on a calendar year basis, using the fiscal year appropriation for the program year. Additionally, a $750 million rescission from the advance appropriation was enacted in FY2009. In FY2009, a $750 million rescission from the advance appropriation reduced the amount available to the Section 8 program. In FY2010, the President requested the same amount in advance appropriations to match the previous year. Both the House-passed and Senate-passed bills, along with the final FY2010 funding law, followed the President's request on advance appropriations and rescissions for tenant-based rental assistance. These funding distinctions impact the amount available to Public Housing Authorities (PHAs) for voucher renewals. The FY2009 appropriations law provided $14.284 billion for voucher renewals in CY2009, with $11 billion in new appropriations, a $4 billion advance, and a $750 million rescission. PHAs received allocations based on leased vouchers and costs. The FY2009 appropriations law allocated $14.284 billion for voucher renewals in CY2009, with PHAs receiving prorated allocations based on leased vouchers and costs. The allocations were reduced by HUD's estimate of outstanding unspent funds, with PHAs expected to supplement their funding with unused Net Restricted Assets. A $750 million rescission was made, leaving $15 billion available for renewals. An additional $100 million was set aside as a reserve for adjustments in agency allocations. HUD based CY2009 allocations on PHAs' FY2008 data, but inaccuracies in estimates led to funding shortfalls for some PHAs. Approximately 15% of PHAs faced insufficient funding to cover voucher costs. HUD worked with agencies to address funding shortfalls for PHAs administering voucher programs. They used FY2009 funds to assist PHAs facing budget deficits and advised on cost-cutting measures to prevent voucher issuance stoppages, potentially leading to families losing assistance. Senator Murray proposed an amendment to allow HUD to use advance appropriations to supplement PHAs at risk of terminating assistance. The Senate approved an amendment allowing HUD to use $200 million from FY2009 funds to adjust PHAs' budgets at risk of terminating assistance. The President requested $16.189 billion for voucher renewals in FY2010 with no proposed rescissions, seeking new authority to offset agency budgets for NRA balances and reallocate to \"high performing\" PHAs based on need. The House-passed version of H.R. 3288 included $200 million more for renewals than the President's requested level and proposed funding agencies based on FY 2009 data. It did not include the reallocation authority requested by the President, stating that it was not appropriate for the Committee on Appropriations to implement. The Senate-passed version of H.R. 3288 included a $150 million adjustment pool for agencies facing unforeseen circumstances, portability, or increased leasing. It funded renewals at a level between the President's request and the House bill, with allocations based on FY2009 data and no reallocation authority. The final FY2010 funding bill, P.L. 111-117, followed the Senate proposal for renewals and included a $150 million adjustment pool. The final FY2010 funding bill, P.L. 111-117, does not align with the President's budget request, lacks reallocation authority, and allows for up to $100 million transfer to fund upgrades to the Voucher Management System. Congress has created incremental vouchers in some years to meet the demand for vouchers, allocated via formula or competitively, and targeted to specific populations. In FY2009, funding was provided for new vouchers for disabled veterans and families involved in the child welfare system. In FY2010, funding for housing programs included $75 million for VASH vouchers and $15 million for FUP vouchers. The public housing program, established in 1937, offers rental units for low-income families. Congress continues to support over 3,100 public housing developments. Congress provides funds to over 3,100 public housing authorities (PHAs) owning 1.2 million units. The Operating Fund helps cover maintenance costs, while the Capital Fund supports large projects. HOPE VI grants aid in redeveloping distressed housing. PHAs receive funding based on a formula to bridge the gap between maintenance costs and tenant rents. HUD estimates PHA budgets annually. HUD compares PHAs' budget eligibility to Congress funding. If Congress provides less, HUD applies across-the-board reductions, resulting in a proration level. Controversy often arises over the proration level in public housing funding debates. In FY2009, Congress allocated $4.455 billion, covering 90% of PHA budget eligibility. In FY2010, President Obama requested nearly $4.600 billion, estimated to result in a 100% proration level. PHA industry groups dispute HUD's estimates. Several PHA industry groups dispute HUD's estimates on public housing funding. The House and Senate bills increased funding but not to the level requested by advocates. P.L. 111-117 appropriated the funding proposed by both chambers. An amendment in H.R. 3288 aimed to suspend the community service requirement for non-exempted residents, but an opposing amendment in the Senate prevented this. The Senate floor considered H.R. 3288, clarifying that the bill did not limit the community service requirement for public housing residents. President Obama's FY2010 budget requested $2.244 billion for the Capital Fund, with $2.199 billion for formula grants. The estimated annual capital needs for public housing are around $2 billion, with a backlog of $20 billion in unmet needs. HUD's estimates of need are over 10 years old, and the public housing stock has changed significantly. HUD began a Capital Needs Assessment to estimate the current capital needs of public housing but suspended the study at the request of Congress. President Obama's FY2010 budget requested $142 million less than FY2009, excluding emergency supplemental capital grants provided in FY2009. PHAs will have less need to use capital funding for operating needs, allowing up to 10% of capital funding to be available for capital needs. In FY2010, PHAs can use funding for capital needs instead of operating needs. The Capital Fund was funded at $2.5 billion, above the President's request and FY2009 level, as per P.L. 111-117. A set-aside of up to $40 million was included for early childhood centers or other services for residents. President Bush did not request new funding for HOPE VI public housing from FY2003-FY2009. President Bush did not request new funding for the HOPE VI public housing revitalization program from FY2003-FY2009. Despite this, Congress continued to fund the program each year, with funding levels decreasing from just under $600 million to around $100 million in recent years. The Bush Administration criticized the program for slow grant fund expenditure, suggesting that PHAs could leverage resources similarly to HOPE VI grants. Critics of HOPE VI argued that it tore down more public housing than it replaced, leading to the permanent displacement of needy residents. However, proponents highlighted the program's transformative effects on distressed communities. President Obama's FY2010 budget did not request new funding for HOPE VI but instead proposed $250 million for a new Choice Neighborhoods Initiative. The final FY2010 funding law included $200 million for HOPE VI, with $65 million set aside for a demonstration of the Choice Neighborhoods Initiative. The House and Senate had differing positions on funding for HOPE VI versus the new initiative. $65 million was allocated for a demonstration of the Choice Neighborhoods Initiative, which provides funding for project-based rental assistance contracts between HUD and private landlords. HUD stopped making monthly payments to property owners in July 2007, leading to the suspension of contract renewals. HUD suspended renewals of expiring contracts due to insufficient funding. The issue arose because HUD's legal counsel determined they could no longer partially fund 12-month contract renewals with property owners. Funding for FY2007 was not enough to cover all renewals. By late summer, OMB and HUD found funding to resume payments for the rest of FY2007. Contracts were modified to indicate funding may not cover the full term, causing concern among property owners. In FY2008, concerns arose over insufficient funding for project-based contracts, leading to worries about property owner confidence in the program. An additional $2 billion was estimated to be needed to cover the shortfall. The FY2009 economic stimulus act provided the necessary funds, along with regular appropriations, to ensure full 12-month contract funding. President Obama's FY2010 budget requested $8.1 billion for project-based contract renewals. HUD requested $7.7 billion in new appropriations and $400 million from the prior year for renewals, with an additional $400 million requested for FY2011. The final FY2010 funding law provided just under $8.6 billion for renewals, including an advance appropriation for FY2011. The Section 202 and Section 811 programs offer capital grants and project rental assistance contracts for special populations. The Section 202 and Section 811 programs provide capital grants and ongoing project rental assistance contracts for new subsidized housing for special populations. The Section 811 program also offers vouchers for tenants with disabilities to use in the private housing market. The President proposed to fund Section 202 and Section 811 at the same levels as FY2009 for FY2010. The President proposed to maintain funding levels for Section 202 and Section 811 at $765 million and $250 million for FY2010. The budget proposal included dividing both programs into separate accounts for new capital grants, project rental assistance, and renewals of existing rental assistance payments. However, Congress did not adopt this account structure in the FY2010 Consolidated Appropriations Act. The FY2010 Consolidated Appropriations Act (P.L. 111-117) allocated funding for the Community Development Fund (CDF) account, supporting activities like the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program. CDF has also funded programs like Economic Development Initiatives (EDI) and Neighborhood Initiative (NI). CDBG is a major federal assistance source for neighborhood revitalization, housing rehab, and economic development, distributed to entitlement communities, states, and Puerto Rico. The FY2010 Consolidated Appropriations Act allocated funding for the Community Development Fund (CDF) account, including the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program. The Administration's budget requested increased funding for the CDBG program, proposing a $550 million increase in total CDF appropriations. This included funding for Sustainable Communities Initiatives and activities previously funded under other HUD accounts. The Administration plans to seek legislative changes to the Community Development Block Grant program's current dual formula allocation, aiming to address community development needs more effectively. A hold harmless provision will be included to assist entitlement communities in transitioning to reduced funding levels if appropriations drop below $4 billion. The House-passed version of H.R. 3288 recommended $149 million more in CDF appropriations and $18 million less in CDBG formula-based funding than that requested by the Administration. The Senate-passed version recommended an amount for CDBG formula-based funding that is $193 million less than requested by the Administration to fund congressionally designated special projects. The final version of the act, P.L. 111-117, closely followed these recommendations. The final version of the act, P.L. 111-117, appropriated $4.450 billion for CDF activities, including $3.990 billion for formula-based grants to states and local governments. Congress allocated $195 million less than requested for CDBG formula grants to fund EDI and NI activities. Additionally, $150 million was included for the Sustainable Communities Initiative, with $100 million for Regional Integrated Planning Grants. The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) proposed grants for sustainable community development, including Regional Integrated Planning Grants for regional organizations in metropolitan areas, Community Challenge Grants for reforming building codes, and Housing-Transportation Integration Research funding. The grants aim to support integrated planning efforts for sustainable growth and efficient land use patterns. $10 million would fund a joint HUD-Department of Transportation research initiative to evaluate benefits of various efforts. $2 million would be used to assess long-term benefits of Regional Integrated Planning Grants and Community Challenge Grants. The Secretary of HUD, in coordination with the Secretary of Transportation, must submit a plan detailing selection criteria and performance evaluation measures to congressional committees. These initiatives were proposed to be administered through a new Office of Sustainability within HUD. Initiatives proposed through a new Office of Sustainability within HUD include the introduction of S. 1619, the Livable Communities Act by Senator Christopher Dodd. This bill aims to establish the Office of Sustainable Housing and Communities within HUD, along with an Interagency Council on Sustainable Communities. It also includes the creation of comprehensive planning grants and sustainability challenge grants. The Section 108 loan guarantee program allows states and entitlement communities to leverage their annual CDBG allocation for financing. The CDBG entitlement communities and states can borrow up to five times their annual CDBG allocation for brownfield redevelopment activities, with a term of up to 20 years. The Obama Administration proposed eliminating the credit subsidy and charging a fee-based assessment for accessing the program to save costs. The House-passed measure wanted to maintain the program's structure, while the Senate-passed version supported the Administration's proposal. P.L. 111-117 included the House-approved provisions. The Brownfield Economic Development Initiative (BEDI) program, part of the larger CDBG program, provides grants for redevelopment of contaminated industrial sites. The Administration proposed merging BEDI into CDBG for FY2010, while the House approved $25 million for BEDI in P.L. 111-117. The Senate version of H.R. 3288 did not allocate funds for BEDI. The House-passed bill proposed $25 million for BEDI activities, but P.L. 111-117 allocated $17.5 million. This funding supports the SHOP program, which provides grants for self-help homeownership opportunities. It also funds the Capacity Building for Community Development and Affordable Housing Program and the Housing Assistance Council. The Administration's budget request aimed to increase funding for housing and community development organizations, particularly focusing on the rural poor. The proposed increase of 20% to $77 million would target the capacity building program. The budget also aimed to expand the number of national intermediaries eligible for assistance. However, no funding was recommended for the Housing Assistance Council. The House-passed bill proposed $53 million for capacity building activities, $3 million more than the Administration's request. Grants would be limited to LISC, the Enterprise Fund, and Habitat for Humanity. The Senate version supported the Administration's $50 million request and also limited appropriations to the same organizations. The House recommended $5 million for the Housing Assistance Council, while the Senate suggested $8 million. P.L. 111-117 allocated $82 million for Self-Help and Assisted Homeownership Programs, $5 million more than requested by the Administration. The appropriation for Opportunities Programs in P.L. 111-117 is $5 million more than recommended by the Administration, with $27 million for the SHOP program and $50 million for Section 4(a) capacity building grants. Capacity building funds are limited to LISC, the Enterprise Fund, and Habitat for Humanity. Additionally, $5 million is allocated for HAC activities. Lawmakers are increasingly interested in housing counseling due to rising mortgage delinquency and foreclosure rates. Housing counseling can include pre-purchase counseling, foreclosure mitigation counseling, and counseling for seniors seeking reverse mortgages. Since the late 1970s, Congress has provided funding to HUD for distribution to housing counseling agencies for various types of counseling. In recent years, funding for foreclosure mitigation counseling was given to NeighborWorks America instead of HUD. NeighborWorks distributes the funding through the National Foreclosure Mitigation Counseling Program. HUD received funding for housing counseling through the National Foreclosure Mitigation Counseling Program (NFMCP) in the FY2008 and FY2009 appropriations acts. The NFMCP received $180 million in FY2008 and an additional $180 million in the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008. In FY2009, it received $50 million. The President's budget proposed $100 million for HUD housing counseling in FY2010, with $33.8 million allocated to the NFMCP. The House Committee-passed bill allocated $70 million for HUD's housing counseling program, a $5 million increase from FY2009, and $63.8 million for the NFMCP, a $30 million increase from the President's budget. The report praised NeighborWorks's work with the NFMCP and urged HUD to focus on pre-purchase counseling. A floor amendment added $5 million to HUD's housing counseling assistance, transferred from the HOME Investment Partnerships Program account. The final House-passed version of H.R. 3288 included $75 million for HUD housing counseling and $63.8 million for NeighborWorks. The Senate-passed version of H.R. 3288 included a total of $165 million for housing counseling, with $100 million allocated for HUD housing counseling assistance and $65 million for the NFMCP. At least $15 million of the funding would be targeted to HUD-approved housing counseling agencies in areas with high foreclosure rates. The Senate report urged HUD and NeighborWorks to collaborate. The final FY2010 funding law, P.L. 111-117, allocated $87.5 million for HUD's housing counseling program and $65 million for NeighborWorks. At least $13.5 million was directed to housing counseling agencies in high foreclosure areas. An amendment in the Senate floor prohibited funding for ACORN or its affiliates. ACORN Housing Corporation, a HUD-approved housing counseling intermediary, has received HUD funding and NeighborWorks NFMCP funding in the past. Some local affiliates may also be HUD-approved and received housing counseling funds. The Senate's ACORN language was included in the enacted bill, prohibiting ACORN Housing Incorporated and its affiliates from receiving HUD funding. The Federal Housing Administration insures mortgage loans, and the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 provisions became effective for the FY1992 Budget. The Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 (FCRA) provisions for the FY1992 Budget calculate the cost of federal loan insurance based on expected cash flows from insured loans. The subsidy rate, expressed as a percentage of insured loan volume, determines the credit subsidy needed over the loan life. The Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 (FCRA) requires agencies to periodically revise initial subsidy estimates for federal credit programs based on actual loan experience. In the FHA program, re-estimates have often led to higher subsidy costs, indicating potential overestimation of program income or underestimation of program costs. FHA home loan insurance programs are managed through two program accounts. The Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 requires agencies to periodically revise initial subsidy estimates for federal credit programs. The FHA program manages insurance through two program accounts: the Mutual Mortgage Insurance/Cooperative Management Housing Insurance fund account and the General Insurance/Special Risk Insurance fund account. The MMI fund provides insurance for home mortgages, while the GI/SRI fund covers riskier mortgages, multifamily rental housing, and special-purpose loans. The MMI fund historically had a negative subsidy rate but has recently experienced adverse loan performance, leading to a positive credit subsidy rate in the FY2009 HUD budget submission. The FY2009 HUD budget submission noted the positive credit subsidy rate of the MMI fund, which would require appropriations for credit subsidy budget authority. The Budget did not request a credit subsidy appropriation and planned to increase insurance premiums to borrowers to avoid the need for appropriations. The collapse of the subprime mortgage market led to more FHA-insured loan applications. For FY2010, HUD estimated a negative subsidy rate of 0.57% for the MMI fund, resulting in $1.7 billion in negative credit subsidy. The HECM program was moved into the MMI fund by the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008, with separate accounting. When HUD re-estimated subsidy rates for FY2010, the HECM program had a positive subsidy rate of 2.66%, needing $798 million in appropriations. The MMI fund was projected to have a net credit subsidy of -$902 million, providing income to the government. The Congressional Budget Office disagreed, stating the MMI fund would require a positive credit subsidy due to the HECM program's large negative subsidy. The House and Senate versions of H.R. 3288 aimed to minimize the positive credit subsidy needed for the HECM program in the MMI fund. The House bill required adjustments to the program to operate at a net zero subsidy rate, while the Senate version directed a 5% reduction in factors used to calculate principal limits for HECMs. This would have reduced the need for the $798 million credit subsidy assumed in the President's budget. The Senate-passed bill would result in a $288 million positive subsidy requirement for HECMs, compared to $0 under the House bill and $798 million under the President's budget. The House language in P.L. 111-68 and P.L. 111-117 directed HUD to calculate principle limit factors for HECMs to operate at a net zero subsidy rate. Additionally, P.L. 111-68 authorized FHA to insure loans under the MMIF for up to $1.5 billion multiplied by the number of days covered by the resolution, while P.L. 111-117 authorized the MMIF to insure up to $400 billion in loans during FY2010. The continuing resolution in P.L. 111-88 insured up to $400 billion in loans during FY2010, with FHA loan limits set at $729,750 for one-family homes and $625,500 for HECMs. An amendment required HUD to report on the number of homes owned after foreclosures. The rate of foreclosure has increased among FHA-insured homes, leading to a rise in the number of homes owned by HUD. Ginnie Mae, an agency of HUD, guarantees timely payments on securities backing FHA-insured mortgages. The FY2010 budget requests a $500 billion limit on mortgage-backed securities by Ginnie Mae, a significant increase from the previous year. In FY2010, Ginnie Mae was authorized to guarantee $500 billion in commitments. The subsidy rate for FY2010 was estimated at -0.24%, resulting in a negative credit subsidy of $720 million. The Jobs for Main Street Act redirected over $150 billion in unspent TARP funds for infrastructure and job-creation investments. The Jobs for Main Street Act of 2009 redirected unspent TARP funds for infrastructure and job-creation investments, including over $1 billion for the National Affordable Housing Trust Fund and $1 billion for competitive grants through the Public Housing Capital Fund. The Senate has not yet taken action on this Act."
