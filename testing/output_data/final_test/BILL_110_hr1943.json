    "content": "The Act titled \"Stop AIDS in Prison Act of 2007\" aims to implement a comprehensive HIV/AIDS policy. The Bureau of Prisons will develop a policy for HIV testing, treatment, and prevention for inmates to stop the spread of HIV/AIDS, protect prison staff, provide medical care, raise awareness, and reduce transmission risk post-release. The Bureau of Prisons will consult with relevant agencies to develop regulations for HIV testing, treatment, and prevention in prison within one year of the enactment of this Act. SEC. 3. REQUIREMENTS FOR POLICY. The policy created under section 2 mandates routine HIV testing for all inmates upon intake, with exceptions for those with previous records. Testing must also be provided within 6 months for inmates admitted before the policy's effective date. Medical personnel provide HIV testing for inmates along with other health services. Testing must comply with regulations and include pre-test and post-test counseling. HIV/AIDS prevention education is also provided through frequent educational programs. HIV/AIDS educational programs for inmates are provided by community organizations, health departments, and peer educators. The programs cover transmission modes, prevention, treatment, and disease progression in various languages. Educational materials are available at orientation, healthcare clinics, educational programs, and before release. Both written and audio-visual materials are provided to inmates, culturally sensitive and for low literacy levels. Inmates have the right to request HIV testing once a year or if they suspect exposure, with medical personnel encouraging testing for sexually active individuals. Medical personnel should provide routine HIV testing to pregnant inmates and all inmates who request it due to sexual activity, rape, drug use, tattoos, or concerns about exposure. Inmates' requests for HIV tests should not be seen as an admission of risk or rule violation. Positive HIV test results require comprehensive treatment. Positive HIV test results require timely, comprehensive medical treatment, confidential counseling on managing the condition and preventing transmission, and voluntary partner notification services consistent with current guidelines. Medical personnel must discuss treatment options, adherence to therapy, and medication side effects with inmates receiving treatment. Medical and pharmacy personnel in correctional facilities must ensure the formulary includes FDA-approved medications for HIV/AIDS treatment, maintain adequate supplies, and implement automatic renewal systems to prevent interruptions in care. Distribution procedures should be developed for timely and confidential access to medications. Medical personnel in correctional facilities must ensure inmate confidentiality for tests, diagnoses, and treatment. Regular training on confidentiality procedures is required for both medical personnel and correctional staff. HIV services should be provided confidentially alongside routine health services. Testing, counseling, and referral for HIV should be offered before reentry. Medical personnel must provide routine HIV testing to inmates within 3 months of release. Testing is not required for inmates already known to be infected. Positive inmates receive confidential counseling on managing their condition before release. Inmates are provided with medical care, treatment, and prevention services in the community, including referrals to healthcare providers and a 30-day supply of necessary medications. Inmates have the right to opt-out of these services. Inmates have the right to refuse routine HIV testing and shall be informed orally and in writing. Refusal will not result in disciplinary action. The Bureau may conduct HIV testing in exposure incidents, which is not considered routine testing. Medical personnel do not need inmate consent for HIV testing in exposure incidents. The reason for testing must be documented in the inmate's medical records. Inmates must be promptly informed of their HIV test results. SEC. 4. CHANGES IN EXISTING LAW. Section 4014(a) of title 18, United States Code, is amended to remove certain phrases and require testing for virus infection before release unless declined. Section 4014(d) is amended to include the Stop AIDS in Prison Act of 2007. Section 4014(e) addresses screening as part of routine procedures. Section 4014(e) of title 18, United States Code is amended to include routine health screening at intake as part of the initial test under this section. SEC. 5. REPORTING REQUIREMENTS. The Bureau must report to Congress on policies for testing, treatment, and prevention education programs for Hepatitis and other diseases transmitted through sexual activity and drug use. Annual reports on disease incidence among inmates are also required. The Bureau must report to Congress on policies for testing, treatment, and prevention education programs for diseases transmitted through sexual activity and drug use, including HIV/AIDS and Hepatitis. Reports should include the number of inmates testing positive for HIV upon intake, prior to reentry, and those not tested before reentry due to insufficient notice. The Bureau must report to Congress on policies for testing, treatment, and prevention education programs for diseases transmitted through sexual activity and drug use, including HIV/AIDS and Hepatitis.
