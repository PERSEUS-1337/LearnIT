    "title": "SB 1095",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature intends for the genetic disease testing program to be funded by fees collected for services provided. The department will charge fees for tests and activities to cover the costs, with fees for prenatal screening and follow-up services to be deposited in specific funds. The department will implement fee collection for newborn screening and follow-up services, charging hospitals or families of newborns. A fee will also be charged for prenatal screening to support the Birth Defects Monitoring Program. The department will set guidelines for invoicing researchers to cover expenses related to research requests, data processing, and sample shipping. Prenatal screening fees will support the Birth Defects Monitoring Program's activities. The Birth Defects Monitoring Program Fund is created to support pregnancy blood sample storage, testing, and research activities. Fee revenues collected will be deposited into the fund. The Legislature emphasizes the need for efficient procedures to maintain quality genetic screening programs and statewide services. The Genetic Disease Testing Fund can spend money without following certain public contract code sections. The Department of Finance must be provided with proof of obtaining equipment and services at the lowest cost while meeting technical requirements for a high-quality program. The Genetic Disease Testing Fund can spend money for specific screenings without following certain public contract code sections. The Genetic Disease Testing Fund can use funds to expand the Genetic Disease Branch Screening Information System for additional diseases detectable in blood samples, without following certain public contract code sections. The paragraph applies to the design, development, and implementation of the Genetic Disease Branch Screening Information System, including change requests, once the expansion is implemented. The department may adopt emergency regulations to implement this chapter without Office of Administrative Law approval, becoming effective immediately upon filing by the Secretary of State. Regulations must undergo a public hearing within 120 days of filing with the Secretary of State and comply with specific Government Code sections or be repealed. The Office of Administrative Law will print and publish regulations in the California Code of Regulations, which will not be repealed by the Office of Administrative Law. The health and safety of California newborns relies on a well-staffed genetic disease program funded by program fees. Section 125001 of the Health and Safety Code is amended. The department will establish a genetic disease testing program, providing screening and follow-up services for individuals who undergo the screening. The department will expand newborn screening statewide to include various disorders using tandem mass spectrometry. Information on these disorders and testing resources will be provided to pregnant women and those admitted for delivery. If unable to provide screening by August 1, 2005, the department will temporarily obtain testing services through a competitive bid process. If contracting is more cost-effective, the department will contract with public or private laboratories meeting testing requirements. The department will contract with public or private laboratories for mass spectrometry equipment. The department will expand statewide newborn screening to include severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) and other T-cell lymphopenias without additional costs. Screening for adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) and other detectable diseases in blood samples will also be implemented within two years of adoption by the federal Recommended Uniform Screening Panel."
