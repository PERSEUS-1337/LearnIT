The Deli-Fisher GAN addresses this by enforcing structure on the latent space using a mixture of Gaussians. It uses the Fisher Integral Probability Metric for divergence measurement, outperforming DCGAN, WGAN, and Fisher GAN in terms of inception score. Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) are powerful unsupervised learning models used in image and vision sciences. GAN models consist of a generator that creates images from random noise and a discriminator that distinguishes between real and generated images. The training process involves optimizing the generator and discriminator alternately to improve performance. Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) involve a two-player game where the generator creates realistic images and the discriminator distinguishes between real and generated images. The training process optimizes both the generator and discriminator alternately to improve performance. GAN models are described mathematically as an optimization problem measuring the difference between real and generated data distributions. Different GAN models have been proposed to increase stability and speed. Different GAN models have been proposed over time to improve stability and convergence rates. The choice of the objective function is crucial, with some models using different divergence measures like Earth-Mover Distance and f-divergences. The Fisher GAN model, utilizing the Fisher Integrated Probability Metric, is a recent notable development in GANs. Recent research in GANs focuses on the structure of the latent space for the generator, with methods like Deli-GAN using input noise from Gaussian distributions to approximate prior data distributions efficiently. The choice of divergence measure in the loss function is crucial for stable and efficient training. In GANs, choosing a stable divergence measure for the loss function is crucial. The Jensen-Shannon divergence used in the first GAN model led to unstable training and slow convergence. The WGAN model, based on the Fisher IPM framework, offers stability, efficient computation, and high representation power. The Integral Probability Metric is defined on space P(X) of all probability measures on X, creating a distance between probability measures. The Fisher IPM, based on Fisher Discriminative Analysis, defines a distance between two probability measures P and Q in a constrained format for optimization. Previous GAN models often use simplistic distributions for input noise, which may not be optimal. The use of overly simplistic distributions for input noise in GAN models is not well justified, as it may fail to represent the diverse data used for training. A better choice of probability distribution for the latent noise can lead to improved features in generated images. The idea of using a mixed Gaussian distribution in the latent space was proposed, where parameters are learned during training to generate images with better structures. Incorporating the idea of using a mixed Gaussian distribution in the latent space, the Deli-GAN generates images with improved structures by learning parameters during training. The GAN model is built using a mixture of Gaussian distributions for the latent input noise, following the Fisher IPM approach. The optimization problem is formulated based on the distribution of real images and the multimodal distribution of the latent input noise components. The Deli-GAN model incorporates a mixed Gaussian distribution in the latent space to generate images with improved structures. Parameters are learned during training using a multimodal distribution of the latent input noise. The optimization problem involves updating parameters using the stochastic gradient descent algorithm ADAM to optimize loss functions. The Deli-GAN model optimizes loss functions by updating variables with penalty weights and learning rates. Inception Score is used to evaluate image quality, aiming for consistency and diversity in generated images. The proposed metric for evaluating image quality involves the Kullback-Leibler divergence between two distributions. Inception Score is calculated using a python script from OpenAI and replicated for various GAN architectures on the CIFAR-10 dataset. Results are shown in tables with means and variances of inception scores. Images used are cropped to size 32 \u00d7 32. For each training session, 50,000 fake images were generated to calculate the inception score using cropped images of size 32 \u00d7 32. The Deli-Fisher GAN was then applied to the dataset with hyper-parameters set to 0. Parameters such as \u03b8, \u00b5, \u03c3, and \u03b7 were learned using Stochastic Gradient Descent with ADAM optimizer. After learning the parameters, another 50,000 images were generated for comparison with Fisher-GAN. Different parameters were tuned in each model generation. In the experiments with different GAN models, parameters were adjusted for sample generation. The inception score was used to compare generated images with original data. Most GAN trainings took around 30 minutes, except for WGAN due to extra computation time. DCGAN showed unstable and unsatisfactory performance with inception scores ranging from 2 to 3. The Deli-Fisher GAN outperformed the current optimal Fisher GAN in image generation, as shown by higher inception scores on the CIFAR-10 dataset. The experiments produced high-quality images, demonstrating significant improvements over previous GANs both qualitatively and quantitatively. This suggests that better representation of random noise input captures more features of the latent space, enhancing the authenticity of generated images. The Deli-Fisher GAN model can generate superior images compared to other GAN models like DC-GAN, WGAN, and Fisher-GAN, with improvements in image quality measured by inception scores. Future enhancements may include adding regularization terms to the objective function and developing more sophisticated structures for the latent space tailored to different tasks. By enforcing properties on the latent space, such as symmetries or geometric characteristics, control over the features in generated images can be achieved."
