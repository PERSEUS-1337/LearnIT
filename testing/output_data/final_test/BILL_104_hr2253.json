    "content": "The \"Endangered Species Community Advisory Board Act of 1995\" adds a new section to the Endangered Species Act of 1973, allowing for the establishment of community advisory boards. The Secretary shall establish an Endangered Species Community Advisory Board for designated critical habitats or National Wildlife Refuges. The board consists of 12 members appointed by the Secretary from recommendations by the State Governor, with a chairperson elected from local government officials. Members serve a 4-year term. The Secretary appoints members to the Endangered Species Community Advisory Board for designated habitats or refuges for varying initial terms. Federal employees cannot be the majority of board members. Regulations will be prescribed for board establishment, composition, and funding. Payment for routine activities may be provided by the Secretary. The Secretary may provide funds for administrative expenses of a community advisory board for studying areas as critical habitat or National Wildlife Refuges. Private individuals on the board can receive funding if they reside near the designated area. The community advisory board is established for financial management. Local members can use funds for technical assistance and community education on endangered species. The Secretary must consult the board before designating critical habitat or National Wildlife Refuge areas. The community advisory board advises on identifying local needs, monitoring scientific studies, and addressing land use strategies for critical habitat or National Wildlife Refuge areas. Recommendations from the board must be published within 180 days. The National Wildlife Refuge was established to monitor and report on species conservation and recovery progress. It also requires periodic reviews of the scientific findings that led to the designation. The term 'State' in this section includes several states and territories."
