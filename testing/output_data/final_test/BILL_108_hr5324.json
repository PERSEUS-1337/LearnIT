    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Nurse Education, Expansion, and Development Act of 2004\". The Nurse Reinvestment Act (Public Law 107-205) increased nursing school applications by 60%, but schools lack nurse educators. In 2003-2004, 61.5% of schools had 1-15 vacant faculty positions, and 30.9% needed more faculty but lacked resources. 18,105 eligible candidates were denied admission to nursing schools in 2003. Admission to nursing schools in 2003 was hindered by a shortage of faculty members. A growing number of nurses with doctoral degrees are opting for non-educational careers, leading to a potential wave of retirements among nurse faculty in the next 10 years. Master's and doctoral programs in nursing are not producing enough nurse educators to meet the future demand. Graduations from master's programs in nursing were down 2.5% in the 2003-2004 school year. According to the February 2004 Monthly Labor Review of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, over 1,000,000 new and replacement nurses will be needed by 2012. Graduations from nursing doctoral programs decreased by 9.9% in the 2003-2004 school year. Capitation grants are provided to increase the number of nursing faculty and students under the Public Health Service Act. The Secretary awards grants to eligible nursing schools to increase faculty and students, with funds used for hiring faculty, purchasing equipment, and recruiting students. Grant amounts are determined based on the number of students. The grant amount awarded to eligible nursing schools is based on the number of students enrolled in graduate nursing programs leading to advanced degrees or faculty preparation. The grant amount awarded to nursing schools is based on the number of students enrolled in nursing programs leading to bachelor's or associate degrees. The grant is limited to $966 per student for associate degree programs. The Secretary may not make payments for more than 2 fiscal years for students in graduate nursing programs. The eligibility criteria for receiving grants for nursing schools include being accredited by a recognized nursing accrediting agency and having specific passage rates. The grant amount is based on the number of students enrolled in nursing programs leading to different degrees, with limitations on the duration of funding for graduate programs. To be eligible for a grant, a nursing school must have a passage rate of at least 80% on the NCLEX exam and a graduation rate of at least 80% for the past 3 school years. The school must also provide assurances to the Secretary regarding these rates for each school year. The school must ensure a passage rate of at least 80% on the NCLEX exam, maintain a graduation rate of 80%, and increase first-year enrollment of full-time nursing students by 5% or 5 students compared to the previous year. The Secretary may waive the enrollment increase requirement under certain circumstances. The school must meet certain criteria such as passage rate on the NCLEX exam, graduation rate, and enrollment increase. The Secretary can waive enrollment increase under specific conditions. Within a year of receiving the grant, the school must develop a plan to establish an accelerated nursing program or promote collaborative education among nursing schools. The curr_chunk discusses the shared use of technological resources, interdisciplinary training between schools, integration of core competencies, increasing admissions of financially disadvantaged individuals, and enrollment of minority and diverse student populations in healthcare education. The curr_chunk discusses strategies to address nursing shortages and improve nursing education, including increasing enrollment of graduate nursing students, developing residency programs, integrating geriatric content, partnering with disadvantaged communities, and expanding nurse-managed health centers for clinical education. The curr_chunk discusses the school's updated information on student enrollment, retention, graduation rates, and employment of graduates in nursing roles. The school will allow on-site inspections by the Secretary to ensure compliance with requirements. The Secretary will evaluate grant results and report to Congress within 18 months. The school nursing must submit an application to the Secretary to seek a grant under this section. $75,000,000 is authorized for fiscal year 2005, $85,000,000 for fiscal year 2006, and $95,000,000 for fiscal year 2007 for carrying out this section. Administrative costs, including evaluating results, are also covered. The Comptroller General of the United States will conduct a study on increasing nurse faculty participation, including successful master's and doctoral programs and compensation disparities. An examination of compensation disparities in the nursing profession and between higher education instructional faculty in general and nursing faculty specifically."
