    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Alaska Adjacent Zone Revenue Sharing Act\" and includes findings. Congress finds that the United States is an Arctic nation with a 700-mile border with the Arctic Ocean, over 100,000,000 acres of land above the Arctic Circle, and a broader Arctic area including the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands. The Arctic region is home to an indigenous population that has relied on marine mammals, fish, and wildlife unique to the region for millennia, with a history of over 16,000,000,000 barrels produced. The United States Arctic region has produced over 16 billion barrels of oil and may hold an additional 30 billion barrels of oil and 220 trillion cubic feet of natural gas. Temperatures in the region have warmed significantly, the Arctic ice pack is rapidly diminishing, and the Arctic Ocean may be ice-free in 30 years. These changes are impacting the indigenous people of the Arctic. The United States Arctic region has significant oil and gas reserves, with warming temperatures leading to the rapid decline of the Arctic ice pack. This is affecting the indigenous people, communities, ecosystems, and wildlife in the region, opening up new areas for potential development in offshore oil and gas, commercial fishing, marine shipping, and tourism.
