The Navy had planned to reduce the carrier force from 12 to 11 ships, but the 109th Congress passed a provision to maintain at least 12 carriers. The 109th Congress passed a provision to reduce the required size of the carrier force from 12 to 11 operational ships and permit the retirement of the Kennedy under certain conditions. This decision raised concerns about the Navy's future plans for the home port facility at Mayport. The proposal to retire the Kennedy and reduce the carrier force first emerged in January 2005. The proposal to retire the Kennedy aircraft carrier in FY2006 was estimated to save about $1.2 billion in DOD funding from FY2006-FY2011. The Navy projected that overhauling the Kennedy and keeping it in service from FY2007-FY2011 would cost over $2 billion. The Kennedy aircraft carrier was originally scheduled for a $350 million overhaul from May 2005 to August 2006. However, the Navy canceled the overhaul in April 2005 to use the funds for other needs. Despite plans to retire the Kennedy, it would be placed in preservation status for potential reactivation. The Navy considered reactivating the ship if a conventionally powered carrier was needed to replace the Kitty Hawk in Japan. The Navy announced in 2005 that a nuclear-powered carrier would replace the Kitty Hawk in Japan in 2008. The George Washington was selected for this role, while the Kennedy faced operational restrictions due to corrosion issues. The Navy's carrier force fluctuated between 12 and 15 ships from FY1951 to FY2006, reaching a peak of 15 ships in FY1987-1991. The Kennedy operated as an \"operational/reserve training carrier\" with a partially reserve crew from FY1995 to FY2000, before reverting to a fully active carrier in FY2001. The Navy's carrier force included 2 conventionally powered carriers and 10 nuclear-powered carriers just before the decommissioning of the Kennedy. The Kitty Hawk, the Navy's oldest carrier, is scheduled to be retired in 2008 at age 47. The carrier force is to be maintained at 11 ships with the commissioning of the George H. W. Bush in 2008. The Enterprise, the Navy's next-oldest carrier, entered service in November 1961. The Enterprise, the Navy's second-oldest carrier, entered service in November 1961. In 1994, it completed a nuclear refueling complex overhaul (RCOH) to extend its service life. The ship is set to be replaced in 2015 by a new carrier, CVN-78. Unlike newer Nimitz-class carriers, the Enterprise is powered by eight nuclear reactors, making its reactor plant more complex and expensive to maintain. The Kennedy, the Navy's third-oldest carrier, entered service in 1968 and underwent a less extensive complex overhaul in 1995. The Kennedy, scheduled to retire in 2018 at age 50, did not receive a SLEP overhaul at age 30, raising concerns about its continued service. The Nimitz-class carriers underwent RCOHs to extend their service life by 20 years. The Carl Vinson is currently undergoing an RCOH scheduled to finish in 2008 with an estimated cost of $3,134.3 million. The Navy is proposing to maintain a 313-ship fleet with 11 aircraft carriers, including Nimitz-class carriers undergoing RCOHs to extend their service life. The estimated cost for the Carl Vinson's RCOH is $3,134.3 million, with funding provided from FY2001 through FY2005. Admiral Michael Mullen supports retiring the Kennedy and reducing the carrier force to 11 ships, while also considering Mayport, FL, as a home port for a nuclear-powered carrier. The Navy's carriers are considered its primary capital ships, crucial both operationally and symbolically. Carriers have been a key focus in Navy planning, with carrier-based aircraft being versatile in various missions. Carriers have been actively involved in enforcing no-fly zones and conducting land-attack operations since the end of the Cold War. They are particularly valuable in situations where access to overseas air bases is limited. Carriers are versatile naval platforms used for various purposes, including transporting troops, conducting special operations, and disaster relief. The Navy's carriers are homeported at different locations, with the Vinson undergoing a refueling complex overhaul in Newport News, VA. The Navy's carrier, the Vinson, is undergoing a refueling complex overhaul at Newport News. The Navy aims to have at least six carriers in the Pacific for engagement and deterrence. After its overhaul, the Vinson will be homeported at Bremerton, San Diego, Pearl Harbor, or Guam, with a preference for Bremerton due to existing infrastructure. The final decision on the homeport is expected in April or May 2007. Mayport, currently home to 18 Navy ships, is not qualified to host a nuclear-powered carrier. Studies have been conducted to assess the requirements for Mayport to become a nuclear-carrier home port. The Navy has forward-homeported a carrier in Japan since the 1970s, reducing the total number of carriers needed in the force. The Navy has homeported carriers in Japan since the 1970s, reducing the total number of carriers needed in the force. The Kitty Hawk is the third Navy carrier to be homeported there, with plans for a nuclear-powered carrier to succeed it generating concern and opposition in Japan. Some observers believe Japanese views on nuclear carriers are changing, while others fear public opposition due to historical anti-nuclear sentiments. The 109th Congress debated the appropriate size of the carrier force, with DOD proposing to retire the Kennedy and reduce the force to 11 ships in FY2006 and FY2007. Supporters of maintaining a force of 12 or more carriers argued for the enduring need based on historical trends. The 109th Congress debated reducing the carrier force to 11 ships in FY2006 and FY2007, but DOD returned to a force of 12 fully active carriers, indicating dissatisfaction with less than 12. The Navy projects a decrease to 10 ships in 2013, but aims to maintain a 12-ship force through at least 2013 to avoid dropping to 10 ships. The carrier force is expected to increase to 12 ships in 2019 and be maintained at that level through at least 2036. The Navy aims to maintain a carrier force of 12 ships through at least 2036, indicating a preference for this number over 11. Carriers have proven their value in various operations since the end of the Cold War, serving as sovereign U.S. bases that can operate in international waters. The increasing capability of carrier air wings to attack targets daily makes carriers cost-effective military platforms, supporting their retention in the U.S. force structure. The Navy's carrier force size is not solely determined by historical figures, as advancements in carrier air wing capabilities allow for conducting future operations with fewer carriers. The Fleet Response Plan has enhanced the Navy's ability to surge carriers for overseas contingencies, reducing the number of carriers needed for warfighting. The planned LHA(R)-class amphibious assault ships will further augment the Navy's ability to base tactical aircraft at sea. The Navy's carrier force size can be reduced to 11 ships without compromising operational capabilities, as advancements in carrier air wing capabilities and the Fleet Response Plan allow for more efficient use of carriers. The procurement of LHA(R)-class amphibious assault ships will also enhance the Navy's ability to deploy tactical aircraft at sea. The Navy's carrier force can be reduced to 11 ships without compromising operational capabilities. The Fleet Response Plan allows for more efficient use of carriers, with the ability to surge six carriers within 30 days and another two within 60 days. Potential issues for Congress include deciding which carrier to retire if the force is reduced to 11 ships, with options including the Kennedy, Kitty Hawk, Enterprise, and Vinson. The decision to retire the Kennedy over the Kitty Hawk, Enterprise, or Vinson is based on the Kennedy's lack of a full service life extension program overhaul, making it increasingly difficult and expensive to keep in service. The Navy has restricted the Kennedy from conducting flight operations due to corrosion issues, with waivers for catapults and boilers set to expire. Retiring the Kitty Hawk is also being considered. The Navy is facing decisions on retiring carriers like the Kitty Hawk and shifting the Kennedy to Japan. This move could concentrate all Atlantic Fleet carriers in one area, raising concerns about potential terrorist attacks. Shifting a nuclear-powered carrier to Japan would require time and money to qualify Yokosuka as a nuclear-carrier home port. Retiring the Enterprise before 2014 would not realize a full return on the Navy's $2 billion investment in its overhaul. Retiring the Vinson and skipping its scheduled overhaul would reduce the workload significantly. The decision to retire carriers like the Kitty Hawk and potentially shift the Kennedy to Japan raises concerns about concentrating all Atlantic Fleet carriers in one area. Retiring the Vinson and skipping its scheduled overhaul would significantly reduce workload at Northrop Grumman's Newport News shipyard, increasing costs for other work being done at the yard. Retiring the Kitty Hawk, Enterprise, or Vinson instead of the Kennedy could be argued based on their capabilities and age. The Kennedy, scheduled to remain in service until 2018, could be retired in FY2006, involving a significant change from current plans. Its maintenance issues can be addressed in an overhaul, and it could potentially replace the Kitty Hawk in Yokosuka. Mayport, FL could be qualified as a nuclear-carrier home port to divide the Navy's Atlantic Fleet carriers. The Navy may consider retiring the Kitty Hawk and Enterprise in the near term to streamline nuclear-carrier logistics and reduce support costs. Retiring the Vinson would avoid a $2.27 billion cost for its RCOH in FY2006 and FY2007. The proposal to retire the Vinson would eliminate funding for its RCOH in FY2006 and FY2007, along with annual personnel and maintenance costs. Equipment purchased for the Vinson could be used for the next Nimitz-class ship. DOD and Navy officials argue that the Kennedy's warfighting capability is marginal and raised concerns about carrier homeporting arrangements. The potential advantages and disadvantages of homeporting all Atlantic Fleet carriers in the Norfolk-Newport News, VA area were discussed in hearings on the proposed FY2006 defense budget. Navy officials noted the efficiencies of co-locating carriers but also acknowledged the security risks of having carriers concentrated in a small number of home ports. Options for the 109th Congress arising from the proposal were considered. Options for the 109th Congress arising from the proposal to retire the Kennedy in FY2006 and reduce the carrier force to 11 ships included adding a provision to Title 10 of the U.S. Code stating that the Navy shall include not less than 12 large-deck aircraft carriers or prohibiting the Navy from reducing the carrier force to less than 12 ships. Congress passed a provision in the FY2006 defense authorization act related to this issue. The FY2006 defense authorization act amended 10 U.S.C. 5062 to require the Navy to maintain at least 12 operational aircraft carriers. However, in the FY2007 defense authorization act, the required size of the carrier force was reduced to 11 ships. Congress may add a provision to the annual defense authorization or appropriations bill to maintain a force of 12 carriers for a fiscal year or prohibit the retirement of an aircraft carrier. The option to maintain a force of 12 carriers could be expressed through report language rather than bill language, which may have less impact as it relies on DOD's discretion. Additional steps like funding for Mayport as a nuclear-carrier home port could be taken to support this option. The option to maintain a force of 12 carriers could involve directing the Navy to transfer a nuclear-powered carrier to Mayport once it is qualified as a nuclear-carrier home port. This would defer the retirement of the Kennedy until Mayport meets the qualifications. Steps may be taken to expedite the process of qualifying Mayport, and bill or report language could be used to facilitate the transfer. Compared to transferring the Kennedy to Yokosuka, this option would not require additional steps. The option of transferring the Kennedy to Yokosuka or Mayport as a nuclear-carrier home port is being considered. One potential issue for the 110th Congress is the Navy's future plans for the home port facility at Mayport, which could involve qualifying Mayport for homeporting a nuclear-powered carrier or transferring conventionally powered non-carrier ships in the near term. The Navy is considering transferring a nuclear-powered carrier to Mayport in the near term. Congress should consider the time and cost required to qualify Mayport as a nuclear-carrier home port, the possibility of accelerating the schedule, and the annual cost difference between homeporting all Atlantic Fleet carriers at Norfolk versus homeporting one nuclear carrier at Mayport. The Navy is considering transferring a nuclear-powered carrier to Mayport in the near term. Questions arise about the operational advantages and disadvantages of homeporting all Atlantic Fleet carriers at Norfolk versus homeporting one nuclear carrier at Mayport and the rest at Norfolk. Additionally, the vulnerabilities of Norfolk and Mayport to a potential terrorist attack are being assessed, along with the feasibility of transferring other Navy ships to Mayport. Economic impacts and military construction requirements at Mayport are also being considered. The House Armed Services Committee is concerned about the plan to retire the USS John F. Kennedy, which would decrease the aircraft carrier force to 10 in 2013 and 2014. The committee believes the Chief of Naval Operations aims to maintain a force of 12 aircraft carriers, as shown in the Navy's long-range shipbuilding plan. The House Armed Services Committee is concerned about reducing the aircraft carrier force to 10 in the near future, stating that maintaining at least 12 operational aircraft carriers is necessary to meet global commitments and avoid unacceptable risk. They believe the decision to reduce carriers was financially driven, not based on mission requirements analysis. The House Armed Services Committee amended the National Defense Authorization Act to maintain a minimum carrier force structure of 12 operational aircraft carriers. They are exploring options to keep the USS John F. Kennedy operational, including transferring control to NATO. The Secretary of Defense is directed to submit a report on these options by March 1, 2007. The Secretary of Defense is directed to coordinate an assessment with NATO Secretary General regarding the option of transferring the USS John F. Kennedy to NATO. The report will include cost, manning requirements, statutory restrictions, and a classified annex on maintaining global operational requirements with less than 12 aircraft carriers. Additionally, there are additional views on the issue from Representative Jeff Miller. The Senate version of the bill would repeal the requirement for the Navy to have at least 12 carriers as stated in the 2006 Quadrennial Defense Review Report. The Chief of Naval Operations emphasized that 11 aircraft carriers meet combat capability requirements and ensure coverage in any foreseeable contingency. Advances in ship systems and deployment practices have increased strike capability and force availability. The Navy has revised its deployment strategy with the \"Fleet Response Plan\" to increase surge capability for national security demands. With 12 aircraft carriers, the plan aims to have six carrier strike groups ready within 30 days and two more within 90 days. This can be adjusted to \"6 plus 1\" or \"5 plus 2\" with 11 carriers, supporting the National Military Strategy with acceptable risk. Timely decision-making is crucial for the success of this plan, especially with reduced forward presence increasing potential risks. The Navy's long-term plan for aircraft carrier force structure declines to 10 carriers in 2013, with the USS Enterprise set to retire. The Navy believes they can manage this gap through added measures, but any delays in delivering the replacement carrier CVN-21 could increase the gap. The committee expresses concern about the declining size of the naval force and reduction in the number of aircraft carriers, but agrees with the Navy's decision not to maintain 12 operational aircraft carriers by restoring the USS John F. Kennedy. The committee supports maintaining a fleet of at least 11 aircraft carriers for national security, authorizing increased procurement for shipbuilding and funding for CVN-21 class carriers. They also emphasize the need for timely surge operations and agree with the Navy's decision not to restore the USS John F. Kennedy to maintain 12 operational aircraft carriers. The report before the Committee on Armed Services in February 2005 recommended that the Atlantic Fleet remain dispersed in two homeports. The conference report on H.R. 5122, signed into law as P.L. 109-364 on October 17, 2006, reduced the required size of the carrier force from 12 to 11 operational ships. Section 1011 of the act prevents the Navy from retiring the Kennedy until formal notices are received from DHS and NATO. It also requires the Navy to maintain the ship in a condition for potential reactivation in a national emergency. The provision in Section 1011 of the act requires the transferee to return the ship to the Navy upon request in a national emergency, but does not mandate maintenance of the ship for reactivation. The act also reduces the required number of operational aircraft carriers from 12 to 11 and prohibits the retirement of the U.S.S. John F. Kennedy without certification from the Secretary of Defense. The U.S.S. John F. Kennedy (CV-67) cannot be retired from operational status without certification from the Secretary of Defense, Homeland Security, and NATO. If retired, the Navy must maintain the vessel in a state of preservation. The U.S.S. John F. Kennedy (CV-67) cannot be retired without certification from the Secretary of Defense, Homeland Security, and NATO. If transferred, conditions require the vessel to be maintained for reactivation in a national emergency. The 2006 Quadrennial Defense Review Report stated that a naval force with 11 aircraft carriers meets combat capability requirements. The conferees agree with the Navy's proposal to inactivate the USS John F. Kennedy (CV-67) in fiscal year 2007 but believe it is important to retain the ability to reactivate it in case 12 aircraft carriers are needed for a national emergency. The Secretary of Defense, in coordination with NATO and Homeland Security, will evaluate the feasibility of maintaining the aircraft carrier. The Secretary of Homeland Security will assess the possibility of keeping the USS John F. Kennedy (CV-67) operational by transferring control to NATO or Homeland Security. The Navy will preserve CV-67 after decommissioning for potential reactivation or other disposition options like museum donation. The Secretary of Homeland Security will assess options for the USS John F. Kennedy (CV-67), including maintenance in reduced mobilization status, museum donation, or striking from the naval registry. The Navy will retain custody of CV-67 until the commissioning of CVN-77 in 2008. If transferred, the vessel must be returned to the US upon request, with title reverting immediately if not notified otherwise. The conferees support the CNO's statement regarding Naval Station. The conferees support the CNO's commitment to maintaining Naval Station Mayport and the resources of the Jacksonville area for Navy readiness. They acknowledge the proud service of the USS John F. Kennedy (CV-67) and call for a fitting decommissioning ceremony to honor her history. (Pages 804-805) Section 126 of the conference report on the FY2006 defense. Section 126 of the conference report amended 10 U.S.C. 5062 to require at least 12 operational aircraft carriers in the Navy. It also authorized $288 million for maintenance of the USS John F. Kennedy to extend its life. The Department of the Navy will allocate necessary funding for repair and maintenance of the U.S.S. John F. Kennedy to extend its life. No funds can be used to reduce the number of active aircraft carriers below 12 until after the quadrennial defense review in 2005. An active aircraft carrier includes one temporarily unavailable for deployment due to maintenance. The Department of the Navy is prohibited from changing command and control relationships to give Fleet Forces Command control of U.S. Navy forces in the Pacific fleet, unless specifically authorized in a subsequent act."
