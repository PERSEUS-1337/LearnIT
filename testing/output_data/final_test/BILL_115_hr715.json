    "content": "The \"Compassionate Access Act\" allows for the availability of marijuana for medical use. The \"Compassionate Access Act\" recommends transferring marijuana from schedule I to a different schedule under the Controlled Substances Act within a year of enactment. The Controlled Substances Act is amended to exclude cannabidiol from the definition of marijuana and not treat it as a controlled substance under the Act. The term 'cannabidiol' is defined as a substance derived from marijuana or synthetically formulated, containing no more than 0.3% delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol. States can determine cannabidiol levels for marijuana grown in accordance with state law, unless the Attorney General deems the state law inadequate. In states where medical marijuana is allowed, federal laws will not restrict the prescription, possession, or use of marijuana for medical purposes as authorized by state law. The federal laws do not restrict authorized patients, parents of minors, entities producing or distributing marijuana for medical use, pharmacies, healthcare providers, or laboratories from operating as authorized by state law. The federal laws do not restrict authorized entities from conducting safety, quality, or efficacy testing of medical marijuana, including cannabidiol, as defined in the Controlled Substances Act. Research into potential medicinal uses of marihuana is authorized under federal laws, allowing for safety, quality, and efficacy testing of medical marijuana, including cannabidiol. The Attorney General will delegate control over access to marijuana for medicinal research to an agency not focused on addictive properties. Research conducted in states where marijuana is legal for medical purposes may be considered for rescheduling marijuana under federal law. The Act does not impact any laws regulating smoking in public. In this Act, an \"authorized patient\" is defined as an individual using marihuana as prescribed by a physician for medical purposes. The term \"marihuana\" is defined according to the Controlled Substances Act. A \"physician\" is described as a medical practitioner licensed by the state board, and a \"prescription\" is an instruction written by a physician in compliance with state law. The term \"State\" in this Act includes the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and other U.S. territories. It refers to applicable State laws authorizing medicine or treatment provision to patients."
