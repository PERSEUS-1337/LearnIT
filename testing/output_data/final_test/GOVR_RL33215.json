    "content": "Agency whistleblowers face a dilemma as they are encouraged to expose corruption but risk negative consequences such as being fired or harassed. Despite efforts to protect whistleblowers, the fear of reprisal still hinders their ability to report wrongdoing effectively. The Office of Special Counsel, Merit Systems Protection Board, and Federal Circuit have not provided expected protections for whistleblowers. National security whistleblowers were excluded from certain acts, but recent statutes offer some safeguards. Efforts by individual Members and committees aim to ensure long-term protections for whistleblowers. The report explores statutory and political protections for national security whistleblowers, highlighting the exclusion of these whistleblowers from certain acts. The struggle between the executive and legislative branches regarding whistleblower activity is noted, with efforts made to ensure long-term protections for whistleblowers. The conflict between the executive and legislative branches regarding agency employees seeking to communicate with Congress led to the issuance of executive orders by Presidents Theodore Roosevelt and William Howard Taft in 1902 and 1909. This conflict resulted in the Lloyd-LaFollette Act of 1912, which allowed employees to contact lawmakers, committees, and legislative staff despite threats of firing. The constitutionality of this act is still being challenged by the Justice Department today. In 1902, President Theodore Roosevelt issued an order prohibiting executive department employees from individually or through associations influencing legislation without going through department heads, with dismissal as a consequence for non-compliance. President William Howard Taft prepared a similar order in 1909. In 1909, President William Howard Taft issued an order forbidding government officials from directly contacting Congress without department head approval. In 1912, Congress rejected presidential orders that restricted government officials from communicating with Congress without department head approval. Lawmakers were concerned that this would limit their access to information from agency employees and their complaints about supervisors. Congressional debate emphasized the importance of hearing from rank-and-file members of departments to ensure transparency and accountability. Legislative language was drafted to ensure agency employees' constitutional rights to free speech, assembly, and petitioning the government. Some legislators objected to presidential orders as an attempt to prevent Congress from accessing information directly from agency employees, potentially leading to a lack of transparency and accountability. The legislative language, known as the Lloyd-LaFollette Act, was added to the Postal Service Appropriations Act of 1912 to protect agency officials from arbitrary dismissals when communicating with Congress. This was in response to concerns about the executive branch denying Congress access to information, ensuring procedural safeguards for agency employees' rights to free speech and petitioning the government. The Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 supplemented the Lloyd-LaFollette Act, ensuring agency employees' right to communicate with Congress without interference. The Act allows employees to provide information to Congress without fear of reprisal, emphasizing the importance of agency employees disclosing information directly to the legislative branch. The Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 expanded on the Lloyd-LaFollette Act, protecting employees' rights to communicate with Congress and disclose information without fear of reprisal. It also established new institutions like the Office of Personnel Management, the Merit Systems Protection Board, and the Office of Special Counsel. The Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 established new institutions like the Office of Personnel Management, the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB), and the Office of Special Counsel (OSC). The Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989 was passed due to conflicting values in the legislation, providing statutory safeguards that did not meet the expectations of some lawmakers, agency employees, and private organizations. The Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989 aims to protect employees who report violations of laws, mismanagement, waste of funds, abuse of authority, or threats to public health and safety. The Act addresses the harassment and abuse often faced by whistleblowers, ensuring they are not retaliated against for disclosing information to the press or public. The Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989 prohibits reprisals against employees who disclose information to the press or public about violations of law, agency mismanagement, or public health and safety risks. It emphasizes the importance of whistleblowers reporting wrongdoing to ensure effective oversight of the executive branch. Senator Jim Sasser highlighted the lack of protection for patriotic employees who expose official misconduct, citing numerous cases of reprisals. President Jimmy Carter recommended the Civil Service Reform Act to protect federal employees who expose management errors and abuses. He proposed the creation of an Office of Special Counsel to investigate merit violations and safeguard whistleblowers. The Special Counsel would have broad authority to investigate and protect legitimate whistleblowers who point out ethics violations or errors that harm the country. The Special Counsel appointed under the Civil Service Reform Act has broad authority to investigate whistleblower cases and protect whistleblowers who disclose information about prohibited personnel practices. The Act does not protect whistleblowers who disclose classified information or information prohibited by statute. The Civil Service Reform Act covers prohibited personnel practices in all executive agencies except for certain intelligence agencies like the FBI, CIA, DIA, NSA, and others involved in foreign intelligence activities. FBI whistleblower protections are addressed separately in the statute, with Representative Pat Schroeder highlighting the need for such protections due to the agency's history of internal wrongdoing. The Civil Service Reform Act provides protection for FBI employees who report wrongdoing, ensuring they are not subjected to reprisals. The Act does not cover intelligence agencies like the CIA and DIA. Supervisors are prohibited from retaliating against employees who disclose violations of laws or mismanagement. The Civil Service Reform Act protects FBI employees from reprisals for reporting wrongdoing, but does not cover intelligence agencies like the CIA and DIA. Representative Schroeder argued that whistleblowers in all federal agencies should be protected, including those in the CIA and GAO. The Special Counsel was directed to transmit prohibited intelligence information to congressional committees and make a public list of noncriminal matters referred to agency heads, ensuring no disclosure of classified information. The Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs added a provision to prevent withholding information from Congress or sanctioning personnel actions. The bill prohibits withholding information from Congress or taking action against employees who disclose information to Congress. It clarifies that employees have the right to communicate with and testify before Congress without reprisal. The bill clarifies that employees can communicate with and testify before Congress without facing reprisal. It prohibits withholding information from Congress or taking action against employees who disclose information to Congress. In the same year as the Civil Service Reform Act, Congress established offices of inspectors general in twelve executive agencies to prevent fraud and abuse. Inspectors general were authorized to investigate complaints of violations of law, mismanagement, waste of funds, and threats to public health and safety. Supervisors were prohibited from retaliating against employees for making complaints or disclosing information. The Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs emphasized the reliability of employee complaints and the importance of having an effective internal channel for addressing issues. The Civil Service Reform Act aimed to encourage employees to report concerns within the agency. The Civil Service Reform Act encouraged federal agency whistleblowers to report wrongdoing to Congress, the public, and the press. In contrast, the inspectors general statute of 1978 focused on in-house procedures, with IGs required to keep Congress informed about problems and deficiencies. In 1982, an inspector general was created in the Defense Department with authority over audits and investigations involving sensitive information. The 1978 inspectors general statute focused on in-house procedures, with IGs required to keep Congress informed about problems and deficiencies. In 1982, an inspector general was created in the Defense Department with authority over audits and investigations involving sensitive operational plans, intelligence and counterintelligence matters, ongoing criminal investigations related to national security, and other matters posing a serious threat to national security. The IG would advise the Secretary of Defense on fraud, waste, and abuse prevention and detection. The 1978 inspectors general statute focused on in-house procedures, with IGs required to keep Congress informed about problems and deficiencies. In 1982, an inspector general was created in the Defense Department with authority over audits and investigations involving sensitive operational plans, intelligence and counterintelligence matters, ongoing criminal investigations related to national security, and other matters posing a serious threat to national security. The Central Intelligence Agency had an Office of Inspector General, but it was not statutory. The limitations of that office were underscored by the Iran-Contra affair, which highlighted failures to comply with statutory restrictions and testify fully to congressional committees about covert operations. The House and Senate Iran-Contra Committees recommended the creation of an independent statutory IG confirmed by the Senate. During hearings in 1988, the Senate Intelligence Committee highlighted misleading testimony from the CIA regarding the Iran-Contra affair. As a result, Congress established a statutory Inspector General for the CIA to promote accountability, efficiency, and fraud detection within the agency. The CIA Inspector General reports to the director and informs the House and Senate Intelligence Committees of significant problems and corrective actions. The director can prohibit the IG from certain activities to protect national security interests. Whistleblower provisions allow the IG to investigate complaints from agency employees. The CIA Inspector General investigates complaints from agency employees regarding violations of laws, mismanagement, waste of funds, abuse of authority, or public health and safety risks. Employees are protected from reprisal unless the complaint was knowingly false. Additional procedures for whistleblowing were enacted in 1998. Employees can seek judicial review of MSPB decisions in federal appellate courts. In 1982, Congress established the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit with exclusive jurisdiction over MSPB decisions. Despite promises, whistleblower protections under the Civil Service Reform Act have not been fully realized. President Carter emphasized the importance of preventing retaliation against federal employees for whistleblowing. Representative Morris Udall highlighted the need for effective implementation of reforms. The gap between promise and practice in whistleblower protections under the Civil Service Reform Act was influenced by conflicting values, including the desire to hold federal employees accountable for their performance. President Carter aimed to address criticisms of government worker performance by giving managers more discretion in managing underperforming employees. President Carter addressed the issue of underperforming employees in federal agencies, highlighting the difficulty in demoting or removing them. The bill aimed to allow civil servants to be hired and fired more easily for the right reasons, with new protections for whistleblowers disclosing illegal conduct. Senator Ribicoff listed the dual purposes of the legislation without indicating any tension between them. The bill aimed to streamline processes for dismissing and disciplining Federal employees by lowering the standard of evidence needed for dismissal based on poor performance. It also gave supervisors greater deference in assessing employee work, potentially making it easier to sanction or remove whistleblowers. President Reagan encouraged whistleblowers to come forward to report illegal or wasteful activities. Citizens are encouraged to report illegal or wasteful activities and will be guaranteed confidentiality and protection against reprisals. Employees must feel assured that they will be protected when they blow the whistle. Representative Pat Schroeder found that whistleblowers currently have no protection and urged them to come forward. Whistleblowers are encouraged to come forward but have no protection. The focus of the hearings was on the performance of the Special Counsel, who emphasized the enforcement of merit systems and laws. The commitment to protect whistleblowers is through the merit systems and laws enforced by the OSC, not by the office itself. O'Connor emphasized the need for protection of whistleblowers through the merit system and laws enforced by the OSC. He highlighted the secure channel for disclosures and outreach programs to inform whistleblowers of their rights and protections. O'Connor pledged to continue using the statutory powers of the office to safeguard whistleblowers from retaliation for their disclosures. O'Connor emphasized protecting whistleblowers from retaliation for their disclosures by enforcing laws and prosecuting those who take reprisal against them. He stated that agency sanctions against employees involved in protected whistleblower activities may stand if justified, but officials with improper motivations may face prosecution and discipline. This approach aims to safeguard whistleblowers and uphold the public interest. The public interest is to execute the public business, not to support incompetent or disruptive individuals, even if they engage in protected conduct like whistleblowing. Representative Schroeder mentioned 11,000 federal employees seeking relief from the Office of Special Counsel. O'Connor acknowledged their complaints but emphasized the importance of upholding the public interest and preventing internal dissidence. O'Connor acknowledged the 11,000 complaints from federal employees but stated that few fell within his office's responsibilities. He believed most federal managers follow the law, while labeling whistleblowers as malcontents. In a 1984 article, he advised potential whistleblowers not to speak out unless financially secure. The House Post Office and Civil Service Committee held hearings on whistleblower protections, highlighting a gap between lawmakers and executive officials. Representative Schroeder emphasized the need for changes in the Civil Service Reform Act to provide relief for victims of prohibited personnel practices. Special Counsel O'Connor opposed a bill to strengthen whistleblower protections, stating that current statutory protections are effective. The House Post Office and Civil Service Committee reported a whistleblower protection act in 1986 to strengthen protections for Federal employees. Stuart E. Schiffer, Deputy Assistant Attorney General, testified against the bill, stating that the existing statutory system provides adequate protection for whistleblowers. The House Subcommittee on Civil Service found dissatisfaction with investigations by the Office of Special Counsel since 1981. Dr. Donald R. Soeken's study revealed that whistleblowers faced retaliation without protection, calling existing measures a \"cruel hoax.\" Congress did not act on the 1986 whistleblower protection legislation. The House Subcommittee on Civil Service found dissatisfaction with investigations by the Office of Special Counsel since 1981. Dr. Donald R. Soeken's study revealed that whistleblowers faced retaliation without protection, calling existing measures a \"cruel hoax.\" Mary Lawton, Special Counsel in 1987, emphasized the need for corrective action authority. The Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs reported whistleblower protection legislation in 1988, citing a high percentage of federal employees aware of wrongdoing but afraid to report it due to fear of reprisal. The House Subcommittee on Civil Service found dissatisfaction with investigations by the Office of Special Counsel since 1981. Dr. Donald R. Soeken's study revealed that whistleblowers faced retaliation without protection, calling existing measures a \"cruel hoax.\" The committee agreed that statutory protections alone cannot guarantee the elimination of reprisal among civil servants. Whistleblowers were vulnerable to reprisal even if they proved a connection between whistleblowing and reprisal. Agency heads and supervisors must create an environment where employees are encouraged to report problems and are rewarded for doing so. Congress' statutory efforts to protect whistleblowers had no observable impact on encouraging federal employees to blow the whistle. The House Subcommittee on Civil Service proposed modifying the Mt. Healthy test for whistleblower reprisal cases. Once a prima facie case of reprisal is shown, the agency must prove by \"clear and convincing evidence\" that whistleblowing was not a \"material factor\" in the personnel action. The Whistleblowing Protection Act of 1988 passed both the Senate and the House, with the Senate bill emphasizing the role of the OSC in protecting employees, especially whistleblowers, from prohibited personnel practices. The House worked out a compromise version of the bill with the Senate due to the end of the 100th Congress. President Reagan pocket vetoed the Whistleblowing Protection Act of 1988 on October 26, expressing support for whistleblowers but also concern about potential misuse of the process by non-genuine whistleblowers. President Reagan objected to certain provisions in the Whistleblowing Protection Act of 1988, including the \"clear and convincing evidence\" test which he believed favored employees over managers. He also disagreed with restrictions on the President's power to remove the Special Counsel and provisions allowing the Special Counsel to obtain judicial review of MSPB decisions. President Reagan objected to provisions in the Whistleblowing Protection Act of 1988, including restrictions on the President's power to remove the Special Counsel and provisions allowing the Special Counsel to obtain judicial review of MSPB decisions. The vetoed whistleblower bill was modified in 1989 and passed the Senate unanimously, retaining the Special Counsel's role in protecting employees, especially whistleblowers, from prohibited personnel practices. The bill also maintained limitations on the President's power to remove the Special Counsel. The bill modified the Mt. Healthy test for whistleblowers, giving them the right to appeal to the MSPB if the Special Counsel fails to act. The House passed the bill under suspension of the rules in 1989. Congress passed the Whistleblower Protection Act in 1994 to protect federal employees who make disclosures to eliminate fraud, waste, and abuse in the government. The Act incorporates exemptions for national security information and President George H. W. Bush emphasized the importance of protecting whistleblowers. Congress passed legislation in 1994 to amend the Whistleblower Protection Act, reauthorizing the Office of Special Counsel to protect federal employee whistleblowers from retaliation. Concerns were raised about the effectiveness of the Act in practice, with the House Committee stating that it has created more reprisal victims than it has protected. The House committee found that agency leadership plays a significant role in creating a workplace environment that respects the merit system. The statistical record shows that the MSPB and the Federal Circuit have not been favorable to federal whistleblowers, with a significant drop in whistleblowers winning decisions on the merits. The Federal Circuit has been particularly hostile towards whistleblowers, with employees prevailing only twice on the merits since its creation in 1982. The House committee found that the MSPB and the Federal Circuit have lost credibility with the practicing bar for civil service cases. A report in November 1993 showed that 81% of federal employees seeking whistleblower protection rated the OSC as ineffective. Recent studies indicate poor outcomes for whistleblowers in the MSPB and Federal Circuit, with very few prevailing on the merits. Some argue that weak cases may be a factor. The 1994 legislation allowed for reasonable attorney fees in certain cases for federal employees or job applicants who prevail in whistleblower cases. The Special Counsel must provide a written status report before terminating an investigation, giving the employee a chance to respond. Congress aimed to support legitimate whistleblowers, recognizing their importance in providing essential information for lawmakers. The Military Whistleblower Protection Act (10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1034) ensures free flow of information from Federal employees to Congress. Section 1034 originated in 1956 during a confrontation with the Eisenhower Administration over access to agency information. President Eisenhower restricted testimony on certain conversations, leading to the adoption of Section 1034. Attorney General Herbert Brownell, Jr. released a legal memorandum stating that the President and heads of departments have discretion to withhold information in the public interest. The Justice Department prepared a brief stating that Congress cannot compel departments to disclose information the President wants to keep secret. Representative John Moss criticized this as relying on information from the President. Legislation in 1988 added protections for military whistleblowers, including safeguards against retaliatory actions. The IG can investigate allegations of prohibited personnel actions against armed service members for making protected communications with Congress or an inspector general. Service members have the right to communicate directly with Congress and IGs when necessary. The Military Whistleblower Protection Act ensures protection for service members who disclose information to Congress or an Inspector General. It includes provisions for investigations and corrective actions in cases of reprisals. A recent case involves Bunnatine Greenhouse, who was demoted for raising concerns about no-bid contracts in Iraq. In 1983, President Ronald Reagan implemented nondisclosure agreements for federal employees with access to classified information. Congress passed legislation in 1987 to prohibit the use of funds for this policy, leading to a court dispute in 1988 where Judge Gasch ruled that Congress lacked authority to interfere with the executive branch's agreements to protect classified information. The Supreme Court's decision in Egan in 1988 stated that the President has the authority to protect national security information. The case involved the Navy denying security clearance to Thomas Egan, who worked on the Trident submarine. The Court ruled that granting security clearance is a discretionary judgment call for the Executive Branch. The conflict in Egan was within the executive branch, not between Congress and the executive branch. The Supreme Court directed parties to address whether the Merit Systems Protection Board can review the substance of security clearance decisions. The Justice Department found no basis for MSPB to review security clearance determinations based on statutory analysis. Oral argument explored congressional intent without suggesting classified information issues. The Supreme Court ruled in favor of the Navy, stating that the MSPB does not have the authority to review security clearance decisions. The decision was based on statutory construction, with the Court acknowledging the President's constitutional powers but emphasizing that Congress can override executive authority in military and national security matters. The Supreme Court ruled in favor of the Navy, stating that the MSPB does not have the authority to review security clearance decisions unless Congress specifically provides otherwise. The Justice Department emphasized the executive branch's authority in military and national security affairs, with the Court finding no evidence in the legislative history of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 to support MSPB's review of agency security-clearance determinations. The President's national security powers were debated during oral arguments, with the Court focusing on statutory interpretation. The Supreme Court ruled in favor of the Navy, stating that the MSPB does not have the authority to review security clearance decisions unless Congress specifically provides otherwise. The Court emphasized the President's role as Commander in Chief and his authority to protect classified information based on constitutional grounds. The Court did not address a constitutional issue regarding interference with executive power in the case of Egan. Judge Gasch, relying on Egan and the Curtiss-Wright decision, concluded that congressional intrusion on the President's oversight of national security information should be severely limited. Curtiss-Wright focused on the scope of congressional power in delegating authority to the President in foreign affairs, contrasting with a previous case involving domestic policy delegation. The Curtiss-Wright case addressed the scope of presidential power in foreign affairs, with Justice Sutherland's views being noted in subsequent cases. However, caution has been advised against relying too heavily on certain dicta in Sutherland's opinion. On October 31, 1988, the Supreme Court noted probable jurisdiction in the case American Foreign Service Assn. v. Garfinkel, where both the House and Senate protested Judge Gasch's analysis of the President's powers over foreign affairs. The Court vacated Judge Gasch's order on April 18, 1989, and remanded the case for further consideration. The Supreme Court vacated Judge Gasch's order in the case American Foreign Service Assn. v. Garfinkel and remanded it for further consideration, cautioning against unnecessary constitutional rulings on the relationship between Congress and the Executive Branch. On remand, Judge Gasch dismissed the plaintiffs' complaint for failing to state a cause of action, avoiding the need to address constitutional issues. Congress passed legislation in 2004 to prohibit the use of funds for implementing nondisclosure forms that do not align with employee obligations under the Lloyd-LaFollette Act. The Lloyd-LaFollette Act and other statutes protect employee rights and obligations. Nondisclosure forms for intelligence activities must require not disclosing classified information without authorization. These forms do not restrict disclosures to Congress. Nondisclosure forms do not restrict disclosures to Congress or authorized officials essential for reporting violations of law. Appropriations acts deny funds for salaries of officials who prevent agency employees from communicating with Congress. Funds are denied for the payment of federal officers or employees who restrict communication with Congress regarding employment matters or agency affairs. The Office of Legal Counsel issued an opinion on disclosure of classified information to Congress, Whistleblower Protection Act, and Executive Order 12674. Executive Order 12674 established ethical conduct principles for federal employees. Executive Order 12674, signed by President Bush on April 12, 1989, established ethical conduct principles for government officers and employees. It required employees to disclose waste, fraud, abuse, and corruption to appropriate authorities. The order defined terms like \"employee\" and \"agency,\" but did not specify who the \"appropriate authorities\" were. The Office of Legal Counsel was asked whether this order allowed employees to disclose such information to a Member of Congress. The order authorized an agency employee to disclose \"waste, fraud, abuse, and corruption\" to a Member of Congress, particularly members of oversight committees with direct interest in such issues. The Office of Legal Counsel concluded that the question of who is an \"appropriate authority\" to receive classified information is governed by Executive Order 12356, which specifically addresses the disclosure of classified information. Executive Order 12356, signed by President Reagan in 1982, governs the handling of classified information in the executive branch. The Office of Legal Counsel addressed the relationship between Executive Order 12356 and congressional enactments regarding federal employees providing information to Congress. OLC cited the Justice Department's stance in the Garfinkel case, stating that congressional enactments could be unconstitutional if they limit the President's control over national security information. This position supports restraints similar to those in executive orders issued by past Presidents. OLC concluded that the Lloyd-LaFollette Act does not grant the right to share national security information with Congress. Nondisclosure agreements may be enforced even with Members of Congress, and disclosures must adhere to Executive Order 12356. Members of Congress are presumed trustworthy but still need to meet the \"need-to-know\" requirement. OLC stated that individual employees cannot unilaterally disclose classified information to Members of Congress, as the \"need-to-know\" requirement must be met through established decision-making channels at each agency. Additionally, OLC clarified that denial or revocation of a Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) security clearance is not considered a \"personnel action\" under the WPA. OLC concluded that revocation of a security clearance is not a personnel action under the WPA, citing relevant court cases and statutes. This prompted Congress to hold hearings and analyze the issue further. The OLC's memorandum led Congress to analyze the President's control over classified information disclosure to Congress. The Senate Intelligence Committee evaluated OLC's conclusions and held hearings, leading to the drafting of legislation to ensure congressional access to classified information. The Justice Department argued that such bills were unconstitutional, prompting the Committee to unanimously report legislation directing the President to inform intelligence community employees about access to classified information. The Senate bill aimed to inform intelligence community employees that they can disclose certain information, including classified information, to Congress without prior authorization if it pertains to violations of law, false statements, mismanagement, waste of funds, abuse of authority, or danger to public health or safety. The House Intelligence Committee held hearings on a bill for national security whistleblowers. Chairman Porter J. Goss highlighted the lack of protection and confidentiality for whistleblowers in the intelligence community. There is no legal mechanism to prevent retaliation or ensure direct communication with intelligence committees. The House Intelligence Committee held hearings on a bill for national security whistleblowers. Chairman Porter J. Goss emphasized the lack of protection and confidentiality for whistleblowers in the intelligence community. Employees face risks in reporting concerns, with questions raised about whether they should only report to the inspector general and if agency heads should have the power to block complaints in exceptional cases. The House bill for national security whistleblowers aims to provide additional procedures for reporting wrongdoing, ensuring agency employees can approach Congress directly without interference from agency heads. The \"holdback\" provision was eliminated to prevent blocking disclosures, as it was deemed unnecessary and could undermine congressional prerogatives. The House Intelligence Committee rejected the Administration's assertion of the President's ultimate authority over national security information, emphasizing shared responsibility between branches. The committee also dismissed the theory of the President's constitutional right to control contact between executive branch employees and Congress. The handling of classified information was addressed in the bill that became law. The Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act was established as an additional process for disclosing classified information to Congress, ensuring protection for employees reporting wrongdoing within the Intelligence Community. The statute covered communications from the agency to Capitol Hill through the intelligence committees. The Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act allows employees to report wrongdoing within the Intelligence Community to Congress without prior authorization, emphasizing the need for joint efforts and mutual respect between Congress and the President. The Act aims to protect whistleblowers from reprisal, ensuring the flow of information to address serious issues within the Intelligence Community. The Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act allows employees to report serious problems to Congress, emphasizing the need for a procedure to safeguard classified information while encouraging reporting. Employees can report complaints to the Inspector General, with \"urgent concern\" defined as serious issues or violations. The Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act allows employees to report serious problems to Congress through the Inspector General. Complaints can include issues such as abuse, violations of law, false statements to Congress, or reprisal actions. The Inspector General has 14 days to determine credibility, and if deemed credible, the complaint is forwarded to the CIA Director within seven days. The Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act allows employees to report serious problems to Congress through the Inspector General. If the IG does not transmit the complaint accurately, the employee can contact the intelligence committees directly. Changes in 2001 modified communication procedures between the IG and the director regarding the credibility of complaints. In 2002, a case involving Richard Barlow highlighted disputes within the executive branch and Congress regarding Pakistan's nuclear issues. In 2002, disputes arose within the executive branch and Congress over Pakistan's nuclear capabilities. Questions were raised about potential misleading information given to lawmakers and improper certification to Congress by the Reagan Administration. Investigations were conducted, leading to a bill introduced to provide relief to whistleblower Richard Barlow, including compensation for losses incurred due to personnel actions taken against him. On October 5, 1998, the Senate referred the matter to the Court of Federal Claims regarding Richard Barlow's clearance and separation from the Department of Defense. Barlow and his attorneys sought documents to show Congress had been misled about Pakistan's capabilities, alleging adverse personnel actions against him for whistleblowing. CIA Director George Tenet signed a declaration of state secrets on February 10, 2000. On February 10, 2000, CIA Director George Tenet invoked state secrets privilege to deny Barlow access to classified intelligence information. Lt. Gen. Michael V. Hayden also used the privilege to assert NSA's control over intelligence reports. Tenet acknowledged that the judiciary, not the executive branch, decides what evidence to admit. The Court of Federal Claims acknowledged that the state secrets privilege was qualified, not absolute, and had options to determine the relevance of requested material in litigation. The court ruled that state secrets are absolute and privileged from disclosure in courts, denying Barlow access to requested documents and testimony. The court recognized a temporary suspension of Barlow's security clearance, citing the Egan case where security clearance was revoked. The court emphasized that the Executive Branch has the authority to protect classified information and that security clearance decisions are based on predicting future behavior. The court upheld the suspension of Barlow's security clearance, citing the Egan case supporting the Executive Branch's authority in predicting future behavior for security clearance decisions. The Supreme Court decision in Egan emphasized the discretionary judgment of the executive branch in determining and revoking security clearances. Congress later passed a bill in 2000 to establish penalties for leaking classified information. The 2000 bill established criminal penalties for leaking classified information, including fines and imprisonment for up to three years for government employees who disclose classified information to unauthorized individuals. Some Members of Congress referred to it as an \"official secrets\" law, with concerns that it could intimidate whistleblowers. The debate surrounding whistleblowers and the protection of classified information raised concerns about leaking to the press and the potential risks for reporters. Some Members argued that whistleblowers are protected under current laws, while others expressed worries about reporters being forced to reveal their sources. President Clinton vetoed a bill on November 4, 2000, after appeals from news organizations and the Radio-Television News Directors Association. He cited lack of public hearings and thorough deliberations as reasons for the veto. Legislation to amend the Whistleblower Protection Act was introduced in the House and Senate in 2005. The Employee Protection of Disclosures Act was introduced in 2005 to clarify information protection and prevent prohibited personnel practices. It aims to ensure that nondisclosure policies align with disclosure protections and provide authority for the Special Counsel. The bill addresses the need for federal employees to be free from agency retaliation, especially in light of security lapses post-9/11. The bill aims to clarify whistleblower protections, including disclosures to Congress and protection from retaliation. It also authorizes the OSC to file amicus briefs in whistleblower cases and allows cases to be heard by all federal appellate courts for five years. The committee report highlights cases of government waste, fraud, and abuse post-9/11 where whistleblowers faced retaliatory actions. The Senate bill aims to protect whistleblowers from retaliation, especially regarding security clearances. It prohibits managers from taking adverse actions against employees' security clearances in retaliation for whistleblowing. The bill also allows for expedited review of whistleblower cases involving revoked or suspended security clearances, which the Justice Department views as an intrusion into the President's control over national security information. The committee believes that Congress has a role in overseeing executive branch authority over classified information, citing Egan for support. Title 5 includes a provision that allows whistleblowers to disclose information to Congress without fear of retaliation. The Senate bill specifies that disclosures must be made to authorized members of Congress or legislative staffers with appropriate security clearances. H.R. 1317, introduced on March 15, 2005, contains provisions similar to S. 494, clarifying disclosures protected from prohibited personnel practices. The bill directs a study on security clearance revocations in whistleblower cases after 1996. Congress relies on executive branch information for its legislative functions, as noted by the Supreme Court in 1927. Congress relies on executive branch information for its legislative functions, balancing the need for information with protecting sensitive national security information. While agency heads provide information, some Members of Congress seek direct input from rank-and-file employees. Whistleblowers play a crucial role in uncovering agency wrongdoing, illegalities, waste, and corruption, aiding Congress in its oversight duties. Whistleblowers are crucial in uncovering agency wrongdoing, illegalities, waste, and corruption. Congress maintains an open channel with agency employees through various statutes and acts, such as Lloyd-LaFollette and the Military Whistleblower Protection Act. Several organizations provide assistance with whistleblowing issues, including those focused on national security whistleblowing. The first annual National Security Whistleblowers Conference was held in Chincoteague, Va., from October 9 to October 12, 2005. Sponsored by various organizations, the conference aimed to bring together national security whistleblowers to share experiences, provide support, and develop strategies. Founded in 1977, the Government Accountability Project (GAP) is a non-profit organization that advocates for government and corporate accountability, defends whistleblowers, and promotes ethical conduct. The coalition is a nonpartisan organization dedicated to aiding national security whistleblowers by advocating for governmental and legal reform, educating the public on whistleblowing activity, providing support to whistleblowers facing retaliation, and collaborating with other public interest organizations. Its members are current or former federal employees or civilians who expose fraud, waste, and abuse in government operations. The National Whistleblower Center and POGO are non-profit organizations dedicated to aiding whistleblowers who expose fraud, waste, and abuse in government operations related to national security. They provide support, advocacy, and legal assistance to whistleblowers, aiming to ensure accountability and protection for those who risk their careers to expose wrongdoing. POGO, founded in 1981, investigates corruption in the federal government, focusing on defense, homeland security, energy, and contract oversight. They aim to expose waste, fraud, and corruption to promote accountability and transparency in government operations."
