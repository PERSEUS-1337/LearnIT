Congress finds that Justice Kennedy called for a reexamination of mandatory minimum sentencing, stating it is unwise and unjust. He criticized the Federal criminal justice system for misspending resources and imposing overly severe and long sentences. In response, the ABA created the Justice Kennedy Commission in October 2003. The Justice Kennedy Commission was created to address issues raised by Justice Kennedy's speech in 2003. The Commission's report in 2004 recommended alternatives to heavy incarceration in the criminal justice system, such as shorter sentences and prisoner reentry programs. The ABA House of Delegates adopted these recommendations, including repealing mandatory minimum sentencing statutes. The Federal Bureau of Prisons budget saw a significant increase since the enactment of mandatory minimum sentencing for drug users. In 2004, $4,437,000,000 was spent. Mandatory minimums shifted discretion from judges to prosecutors, leading to disparities in drug convictions for African Americans. Before mandatory minimums for crack cocaine, African Americans faced higher sentences than whites. The implementation of mandatory drug sentencing laws has led to significant disparities in drug offense sentences for African Americans compared to whites. This has resulted in a higher percentage of African Americans in prison, with almost 70% of the incarcerated population being persons of color. Mandatory minimum sentencing statutes have contributed to this increase in the prison population. In 2001, average Federal drug trafficking conviction was 72.7 months, manslaughter sentence was 34.3 months, assault sentence 37.7 months, and sexual abuse sentence 65.2 months. African Americans made up 13% of drug users but 35% of drug arrests, 53% of convictions, and 58% of those imprisoned for drug offenses due to aggressive policing and racial profiling. In urban areas, African Americans are arrested for drug offenses at six times the rate of whites due to federal mandatory minimum sentences. In 2000, 84.7% of crack cocaine cases were against African Americans, despite them only comprising 26.6% of users. The Federal prison population grew from 20,000 to 115,000 prisoners from 1981 to 2001. The Federal prison population grew from 20,000 in 1981 to about 115,000 prisoners by 2001. The percentage of drug offenders in Federal prison increased from 25% to almost 60%, with mandatory minimum sentences for drug crimes being the main cause of the population growth. SEC. 3.
