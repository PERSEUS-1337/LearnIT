    "content": "The Federal Housing Administration (FHA), part of the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), insures private mortgage lenders against borrower defaults. FHA pays the lender if a foreclosure occurs, encouraging affordable mortgages with a 3.5% down payment for eligible borrowers. Lenders must be approved by FHA to offer insured mortgages for single-family homes. FHA-insured mortgages require approval from FHA and borrowers must meet specific criteria. Borrowers pay premiums for insurance, and the program aims to be self-supporting. However, increasing foreclosures and house price declines have strained the Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund. FHA had to take a $1.7 billion appropriation from Treasury in FY2013 to cover expected losses. The FHA's Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund is required to maintain a capital ratio of 2%, ensuring it has enough funds to cover future losses on insured loans. The capital ratio fell below 2% in FY2009 and has remained below since, turning negative in FY2012 and FY2013. In FY2014, the fund did not require any funds from Treasury to cover expected losses. The FHA's Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund capital ratio fell below 2% in FY2009 and remained negative in FY2012 and FY2013. In FY2014, the ratio improved but was still below the 2% requirement. Recent policy changes have been made to improve the fund's financial condition, with Congress considering additional reforms. This report focuses on these policy changes and legislative proposals for FHA's single-family program. For more detailed information on FHA-insured loans and the fund's financial status, refer to other CRS reports. The FHA has made policy changes since FY2010 to improve the financial status of the MMI Fund while maintaining access to mortgage credit. These changes aim to increase cash reserves and reduce risk in the mortgages insured by FHA. Some changes can be made administratively, while others require congressional action. FHA has implemented policy changes to reduce risk in future insured loans, including increasing premiums and strengthening underwriting criteria. It has also taken steps to address past loans, such as holding lenders accountable for non-compliant loans and implementing new procedures for delinquent mortgages and foreclosed properties. In recent years, FHA has made changes in three main areas: eligibility and underwriting criteria, oversight of lenders, and handling of delinquent mortgages and foreclosed properties. These changes include increasing borrower premiums, strengthening underwriting guidelines, and ensuring that FHA charges enough for insurance to cover potential costs and unexpected losses. The goal is to reduce the likelihood of default on FHA-insured mortgages. The FHA has made underwriting changes to reduce defaults on insured mortgages, resulting in fewer insurance claims. Some prospective homebuyers may no longer be eligible for FHA insurance due to these changes. Borrowers pay upfront and annual mortgage insurance premiums, which contribute significantly to FHA's insurance fund. FHA can adjust the premiums it charges within statutory limits. FHA can adjust mortgage insurance premiums within statutory limits. Current upfront premium is 1.75% of the loan amount, compared to a maximum of 3%. Annual premiums range from 0.85% to 0.80% of the loan balance, lower than the maximum allowed by statute. The FHA has the authority to adjust mortgage insurance premiums within statutory limits. The current annual premiums have been reduced to 1.35% and 1.30%, the lowest since October 2010. Changes to the premiums have been made administratively by FHA, with Congress mandating a 10 basis point increase in 2011. Legislation in 2010 raised the maximum statutory annual premium that FHA can charge. Prior to the reduction in the annual premiums in January 2015, there was debate about the appropriate level for FHA's premiums. Housing and mortgage industry groups called for lower premiums, arguing that high fees made FHA-insured mortgages too expensive for creditworthy borrowers. Critics of lowering premiums are concerned about the impact on the FHA insurance fund, especially with the capital ratio below the required 2%. Critics argue that lowering FHA premiums to below the required 2% capital ratio could hinder efforts to rebuild reserves, potentially leading to a need for additional Treasury assistance. They also warn that setting premiums too low may attract higher-risk borrowers, impacting the insurance fund negatively. The FHA has made changes to its mortgage insurance premiums, including lowering fees and requiring most borrowers to pay the annual premium for the life of the loan. Critics are concerned that these changes could impact the insurance fund negatively and expand the government's role in the mortgage market. The FHA has changed its policy for mortgage insurance premiums, now requiring borrowers with FHA-insured mortgages to pay the premium for the life of the loan. This change was made because FHA insures the entire loan balance regardless of the loan-to-value ratio, unlike private mortgage insurers. The previous policy allowed premiums to be canceled at 78% of the initial home value, leading to some borrowers having little equity when premiums were canceled. This resulted in FHA paying claims on defaulted mortgages where borrowers stopped paying premiums and the home value couldn't cover the claim amount. FHA has also increased the required down payment for borrowers. FHA has increased the required down payment for borrowers with lower credit scores, now at least 10% for credit scores between 500 and 579. Loans to borrowers with credit scores below 500 are no longer insured by FHA. Loans with lower credit scores have performed less well than those with higher credit scores. FHA increased down payment requirements for borrowers with lower credit scores to address risk layering concerns. The new rule requires at least a 10% down payment for credit scores between 500 and 579. FHA no longer insures loans for borrowers with credit scores below 500. FHA made these changes through rulemaking procedures and published a Federal Register notice for public comment. HUD issued a Final Rule on September 3, 2010, addressing changes in borrowers' credit scores for FHA-insured loans. The distribution of credit scores shifted over the years, with a decrease in loans to borrowers with lower credit scores and an increase in loans to those with higher credit scores, especially from FY2009 onwards. The share of loans to borrowers with credit scores below 600 dropped to below 10% in FY2009 and to 1% or less each year since FY2011. The shift towards FHA serving fewer borrowers with credit scores below 600 in recent years may affect a small share of potential borrowers. However, if borrowers with higher credit scores turn to conventional mortgages and private mortgage insurance, more borrowers may be unable to qualify for FHA-insured mortgages due to credit scores and higher down payment requirements. The share of FHA loans to borrowers with lower credit scores has decreased, while loans to those with higher credit scores have increased. In FY2011, nearly 60% of insured loans were to borrowers with credit scores of 680 or above. In FY2014, the share of FHA loans to borrowers with credit scores of 680 or above was about 45%, a decrease of close to nine percentage points compared to FY2013. The share of loans to borrowers with credit scores between 640 and 679 increased by nearly five percentage points to 42% from 38%. The changes in borrower credit scores may reflect tightening mortgage credit post-housing downturn. Some borrowers with lower credit scores may have struggled to secure a mortgage. FHA increased loan limits, making it an option for more borrowers with better credit in high-cost areas. FHA also proposed reducing seller concessions to 3% of the home's purchase price or $6,000. FHA is considering reducing seller concessions to 3% of the home's purchase price or $6,000, citing industry standards and past loan performance. Legislation introduced in the 113th Congress aimed to enforce this cap on seller concessions. FHA implemented a 3% cap on seller concessions by statute, affecting certain manually underwritten mortgages for borrowers with no credit history. Changes aim to reduce FHA's risk while maintaining access to FHA-insured mortgages for creditworthy borrowers. The new manual underwriting requirements for FHA-insured mortgages, effective from April 21, 2014, set limits on housing debt at 31% of income and total debt at 43% of income. Borrowers exceeding these ratios can still qualify by demonstrating compensating factors like savings or a history of managing higher debts. Specific criteria are outlined for approving loans that exceed DTI ratios, with cash reserves required for manually underwritten loans. The FHA now requires borrowers with manually underwritten loans to have cash reserves equal to one monthly mortgage payment. The minimum credit score for borrowers to exceed DTI ratios with compensating factors has been lowered from 620 to 580. FHA-approved lenders must meet certain criteria and ensure loans meet FHA standards to be insured. FHA can take actions against lenders submitting non-compliant loans for insurance. The FHA can take actions against lenders who do not meet its standards, including suspending them from FHA programs, imposing penalties, or referring cases to the Justice Department for prosecution. Recent changes have increased oversight of FHA-approved lenders and net worth requirements. In April 2010, changes were made to FHA-approved lenders' requirements, including increasing net worth requirements and consolidating guidelines into a single handbook. Some lenders are hesitant to offer FHA-insured mortgages due to uncertainty about FHA's requirements and potential penalties for loan defects. FHA aims to provide clarity to lenders by streamlining requirements and addressing mortgage defects that could lead to penalties. The April 2010 final rule increased the net worth requirements for FHA-approved lenders to $1 million, with at least 20% in cash or its equivalent, effective May 20, 2010 for new applicants and May 20, 2011 for existing lenders. As of May 20, 2013, FHA-insured lenders must have a net worth of $1 million plus an additional 1% of the dollar volume of FHA-insured loans originated, underwritten, purchased, or serviced in the previous fiscal year. The April 2010 final rule increased net worth requirements for FHA-approved lenders to $1 million, with 20% in liquid assets. Concerns have been raised about the burden on small lenders and potential cost increases for borrowers. Changes were also made to FHA's approval and monitoring of entities partnering with lenders for FHA-insured loans. In April 2010, FHA announced that it would no longer approve loan correspondents. These entities can now become third-party originators (TPOs) and partner with FHA-approved lenders to originate FHA-insured loans. The FHA-approved lender is responsible for overseeing TPOs to ensure compliance with FHA requirements. FHA announced in April 2010 that loan correspondents would no longer be approved. Instead, they can now become third-party originators (TPOs) and work with FHA-approved lenders to originate FHA-insured loans. The rationale behind this change is to focus FHA's oversight efforts and resources on lenders rather than TPOs, as the lender is responsible for ensuring compliance with FHA standards. Some industry concerns have been raised about the impact on small banks and increased costs for FHA-approved lenders. The Helping Families Save Their Homes Act (P.L. 111-22) signed into law in May 2009 included provisions to ensure lenders meet FHA standards. FHA stopped approving new loan correspondents in 2010, shifting focus to third-party originators (TPOs) working with FHA-approved lenders. Concerns include increased costs for lenders and potential risks to the insurance fund. The law expanded criteria for entities ineligible to participate in FHA-insured mortgages, including adverse actions against employees. FHA-approved lenders must notify FHA of certain actions and can face civil money penalties for violations. Regulations were updated in April 2010 to reflect these requirements and strengthen FHA's authority to require lenders to compensate for insurance claims on non-compliant mortgages. FHA-approved lenders may be required to compensate FHA for fraud or misrepresentation on mortgages that do not meet requirements. FHA issued a rule in 2012 to clarify these requirements and is seeking statutory changes to increase indemnification authority. FHA also wants to expand its authority to terminate lender approval under certain circumstances. FHA is developing a new Single Family Handbook to provide clearer guidance to lenders and servicers on FHA-insured mortgages, aiming to increase lender willingness to offer these mortgages by reducing concerns about meeting FHA standards. FHA is seeking feedback on draft sections for its new framework to assess problems with FHA-insured loans, aiming to provide clarity to lenders and reduce uncertainty about violations of FHA requirements. Loss mitigation actions are required when an FHA-insured loan goes into default to avoid foreclosure. Under FHA's loss mitigation program, servicers must evaluate borrowers for options to avoid foreclosure, such as loan modifications or short sales. If these options fail, the property is foreclosed on and conveyed to FHA for sale. FHA seeks feedback on a new framework to assess issues with FHA-insured loans and provide clarity to lenders. FHA has implemented changes to its loss mitigation program and property disposition methods to reduce losses from foreclosures. These changes include making it easier for borrowers to qualify for options that lower monthly mortgage payments and streamlining the short sale policy to increase the number of properties sold in short sales. FHA aims to reduce losses by promoting short sales over foreclosures. Short sales result in less loss to the insurance fund and higher selling prices. FHA has clarified requirements for mortgage servicers and implemented the Distressed Asset Stabilization Program to sell defaulted mortgages to investors. The Distressed Asset Stabilization Program (DASP) sells non-performing mortgages to investors, who are not allowed to foreclose for six months to negotiate with borrowers. FHA sells these loans through national or regional pools and neighborhood stabilization outcome (NSO) pools, with investors in NSO pools required to protect the surrounding neighborhood from foreclosures. DASP aims to reduce losses to the FHA insurance fund by removing non-performing mortgages and avoiding the costs of maintaining foreclosed properties. FHA aims to reduce costs by selling non-performing mortgages through the Distressed Asset Stabilization Program (DASP) to investors. DASP allows investors to negotiate with borrowers before foreclosing, with a focus on stabilizing neighborhoods. Concerns have been raised about borrower protections and the involvement of mission-based nonprofits in DASP. FHA has also implemented a pilot program where foreclosed homes are sold directly by lenders to reduce costs and losses to the MMI Fund. FHA has been reducing costs by utilizing alternative forms of property disposition, such as short sales and DASP, which have lower loss severity rates compared to traditional methods. The share of property dispositions using these alternatives has increased significantly in recent years, reaching 75% in the fourth quarter of 2014. FHA's financial stability efforts have included these actions. Some policy makers propose additional changes to FHA's single-family program through legislation, including underwriting and eligibility requirements adjustments. They also suggest increasing FHA's capital requirements to hold more reserves for unexpected losses and altering mortgage insurance standards to reduce its role in the market. Some policy makers propose changes to FHA's single-family program through legislation, including adjustments to underwriting and eligibility requirements. Concerns have been raised that these changes could make it harder for creditworthy borrowers to obtain FHA-insured mortgages. Bills with FHA reforms have been passed by the House but not considered by the Senate in previous Congresses, aiming to give FHA more authority in monitoring lenders. During the 113th Congress, bills were introduced to address FHA's solvency issues, including the FHA Emergency Fiscal Solvency Act of 2013 (H.R. 1145) and the FHA Solvency Act of 2013 (S. 1376). The Protecting American Taxpayers and Homeowners (PATH) Act (H.R. 2767) aimed to reform the housing finance system, including FHA provisions. These bills targeted FHA insurance and eligibility requirements to certain populations. The FHA reform bills introduced in the 113th Congress aimed to target FHA insurance and bring more private capital into the mortgage market. The bills included provisions such as requiring a minimum annual mortgage insurance premium of 0.55% and raising the maximum annual premium to 2.05%. These bills were part of efforts to address FHA's solvency issues. H.R. 1145 aimed to address FHA's capital ratio issues by requiring more frequent actuarial reviews of the MMI Fund when the ratio falls below 2%. It also mandated FHA to submit an emergency capital plan to restore the ratio and required a report from the Government Accountability Office. The bill aimed to address FHA's safety and soundness by expanding indemnification options, establishing an appeals process for lenders, and increasing termination authority. It also included provisions for streamlining FHA programs and was part of the broader PATH Act for housing finance reform. The proposed changes to FHA in the PATH Act aimed to improve the agency's financial stability by implementing stricter oversight, adjusting premiums, and capital requirements. These changes included making FHA an independent agency, targeting insurance more specifically, and increasing the role of private capital. Concerns were raised about the potential impact on credit availability and affordability for some households. The proposed changes to FHA in the PATH Act aimed to improve financial stability by implementing stricter oversight and adjusting premiums. Changes included increasing the minimum down payment to 5% for non-first-time homebuyers and reducing the maximum insured mortgage amount in some areas. FHA would have been prohibited from insuring mortgages with seller concessions exceeding 3% and in areas that used eminent domain for mortgages in the past 10 years. A minimum annual mortgage insurance premium of 0.55% of the balance would have been required. The proposed changes in the PATH Act aimed to improve FHA's financial stability by increasing the minimum annual mortgage insurance premium to 0.55% of the balance and raising the capital ratio requirement to 4%. It would also require FHA to use private sector accounting methods and provide increased authority to require compensation from lenders for non-compliant mortgages. The FHA Solvency Act proposed changes to FHA's standards, including establishing an appeals process for lenders, publishing a consolidated handbook, reducing the share of mortgage insurance to 50%, and implementing risk-sharing programs. It also included changes related to lender oversight, mortgage insurance premiums, and capital requirements. The bill was not as extensive as the PATH Act in limiting FHA insurance eligibility or bringing in private capital. The FHA Solvency Act proposed changes to FHA's standards, including evaluating underwriting standards, finalizing seller concessions rule, setting minimum annual mortgage insurance premium, and increasing maximum annual premium. It also raised required capital ratio to 3% and mandated annual premium reviews for cost maintenance. The FHA Solvency Act proposed changes to FHA's standards, including raising the required capital ratio to 3% and implementing measures such as premium surcharges on new borrowers and stress testing of the MMI Fund. It also aimed to enhance FHA's authority to seek compensation from lenders and establish an appeals process for indemnification decisions. Additionally, the bill would have allowed FHA to terminate lenders' approval nationwide and transfer mortgage servicing to specialty servicers. The bill proposed allowing FHA to transfer mortgage servicing to specialty servicers and required issuing a consolidated handbook with guidelines for lenders and servicers of FHA-insured mortgages."
