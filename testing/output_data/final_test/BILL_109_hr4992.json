The \"Veterans Medicare Assistance Act of 2006\" establishes a procedure for reimbursing the Secretary of Veterans Affairs for medicare health care services provided to medicare-eligible veterans. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs must have sufficient resources, expertise, and billing systems to provide health care benefits to eligible individuals and ensure accurate claims submission. The Secretary also needs access to all data of the Department of Veterans Affairs. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs must have access to all necessary data to verify billing accuracy and claims information. New VA medical facilities cannot be built or expanded with funds received under this subsection. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs can reduce reimbursement for Medicare health care services by deductibles, coinsurance, and cost-sharing. The Secretary can waive requirements for conditions of participation for VA medical facilities if it reflects their unique status as a federal agency. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs will establish procedures to verify if an individual is a Medicare-eligible veteran, with no reimbursement made if not eligible. Payments to Federal providers of services under certain sections will not be prohibited. Reimbursement for Medicare health care services for Medicare-eligible veterans is restricted to those who have been determined as eligible veterans. The Secretaries must certify to Congress that cost accounting systems provide necessary cost information before reimbursements can be made. The Secretary shall reimburse the Secretary of Veterans Affairs for health care benefits provided to medicare-eligible veterans at a rate equal to 100 percent of the amounts payable under this title for such services if the Department of Veterans Affairs medical facility were a provider participating in the medicare program. The Secretary shall reimburse the Secretary of Veterans Affairs for health care benefits provided to medicare-eligible veterans at a rate equal to 100 percent of the amounts payable under this title for such services if the Department of Veterans Affairs medical facility were a provider participating in the medicare program, and imposed charges for such service. In computing the payment amount, certain excluded amounts include disproportionate share hospital adjustment, direct graduate medical education payments, indirect medical education adjustment, and percentage of capital payments. Payments for capital-related costs under Medicare payment policies are to be made periodically from Medicare trust funds. These payments will be credited to the Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Care Collections Fund. The Collections Fund established under section 1729A of title 38, United States Code, allows for the investigation of fund expenditures by the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services. It does not add criteria for eligibility for health care benefits for veterans. Evaluation and reports are required for administering the fund. The administering Secretaries will evaluate the procedure and submit reports to Congress on savings or costs to the Medicare program and the effects on access to care for Medicare-eligible veterans. Definitions include the term 'administering Secretaries' as the Secretary and the Secretary of Veterans Affairs acting jointly, and 'Medicare health care services' as items or services covered under part A or B of this title. The term 'medicare-eligible veteran' refers to a veteran who is eligible for care under title 38, aged 65 or older, enrolled in Medicare parts A and B. 'Trust funds' denote the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal Supplementary Medical Trust Fund. The term 'Department of Veterans Affairs medical facility' is defined as a medical facility under the jurisdiction of the Secretary of Veterans Affairs."
