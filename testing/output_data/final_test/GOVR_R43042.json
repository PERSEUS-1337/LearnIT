    "content": "The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) amended national standards for traffic signs in 2007, including a measurable standard for nighttime visibility and changes to street sign lettering. Some agencies found compliance costly during strained financial times. Confusion arose over compliance deadlines, leading FHWA to remove some for the nighttime visibility standard. In 2007, FHWA updated the Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices standard for nighttime visibility of traffic signs, setting a minimum retroreflectivity level. The 2009 edition also updated sign lettering style requirements. The 2009 edition of the Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices updated sign lettering style requirements for names on signs of places, streets, and highways. The new standard eliminated the option of using only uppercase letters, requiring mixed-case lettering for better readability. State and local transportation agencies are only required to implement the new lettering style as they install new signs or replace existing ones, with no immediate deadline for compliance. Contrary to some press reports, communities are not mandated to replace all street signs immediately to comply with the new standard. In 1992, Congress directed DOT to develop a minimum standard for retroreflectivity in traffic signs. The reflective properties of sign materials degrade over time, making signs harder to see at night. This degradation is due to exposure to sunlight and other factors, leading to limited visibility for drivers after sunset. Driving at night is more dangerous than during the day due to limited visibility. Nighttime crash rates are three times higher, with a higher fatality rate. Traffic signs are crucial for guidance in low visibility conditions. Aging drivers face challenges with reduced vision clarity. The number of older drivers is increasing, emphasizing the importance of easily visible traffic signs. The increasing number of older drivers highlights the importance of visible traffic signs at night for safety. The development of a new standard for traffic signs involved FHWA-sponsored research and a task force appointed by AASHTO. AASHTO requested a study on the impact of the new standard before its issuance in 2000. The new standard for traffic signs, implemented in 2008, established measurable retroreflectivity standards and required agencies to adopt methods to maintain sign visibility at night. Various methods, including visual nighttime inspections, were listed to meet this requirement. The new standard for traffic signs, implemented in 2008, established measurable retroreflectivity standards and required agencies to adopt methods to maintain sign visibility at night. Agencies can comply with the standard through various methods, including visual nighttime inspections, measurement of sign retroreflectivity, and replacement of signs based on their expected life above the minimum standard. Compliance with the standard is required by certain deadlines. The new standard for traffic signs, implemented in 2008, required communities to comply with deadlines for maintaining sign retroreflectivity. The deadlines were January 22, 2012, January 22, 2015, and January 22, 2018 for different types of signs. Highway safety groups supported the standard, while state and local transportation agencies had concerns about potential tort liability. The FHWA's final retroreflectivity standard aimed to balance setting a minimum standard for sign visibility while allowing agencies to have a management process in place. This would help agencies defend against tort liability claims related to inadequate sign retroreflectivity. The final retroreflectivity standard allows agencies with an assessment or management method to comply even if some signs don't meet the minimum standard. Concerns about compliance costs and confusion over sign replacement requirements contributed to the standard's sudden attention in 2010. Federal and state laws mandate adopting traffic control manuals that meet or exceed MUTCD standards for public safety. The MUTCD standards, including retroreflectivity maintenance, promote public safety. Compliance deadlines are rare, but retroreflectivity had one due to its significant safety impact. Enforcement mechanisms include withholding federal funding and potential tort liability for non-compliance. Violations of MUTCD principles are common in practice. A lawsuit involving a nighttime car crash where visibility of a street sign is a factor. A study estimated the additional cost of complying with a new standard to be $37.5 million over 10 years, with local governments bearing $27.5 million and state governments $11.8 million. Up to 100% of the cost of replacing traffic signs is eligible for federal funding. Larger communities with existing sign maintenance programs may see a modest impact from the retroreflectivity maintenance standard. The impact of the retroreflectivity maintenance standard is estimated to be modest, especially in smaller communities without sign maintenance programs. Some state and local highway agencies reported higher costs to comply with the standard than the DOT study. There was confusion over the requirement to replace traffic signs that do not meet the retroreflectivity standard, which could pose a safety hazard at night. The rule on retroreflectivity maintenance standard may create safety hazards at night, with concerns about additional costs for state and local governments. The standard aims to ensure adequate nighttime visibility for traffic signs, with federal-aid highway funding available for sign installation and replacement. The appropriations act for highway infrastructure investment increased from $33.9 billion in FY2004 to $41.5 billion in FY2012. The compliance deadlines for the retroreflectivity maintenance standard were amended by DOT in May 2012, extending the deadline for highway agencies to implement an assessment method to ensure sign compliance to May 2014. Compliance deadlines for replacement of signs not meeting retroreflectivity standards were eliminated, but communities are still required to replace non-compliant signs. Communities must replace signs that do not meet standards, with revised deadlines set by DOT to reduce costs and impacts on highway agencies. Original deadlines were based on standard sign useful-life cycles, but varying environmental conditions affect sign longevity across different regions."
