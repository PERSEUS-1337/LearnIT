Congress finds that 2,500,000 people die in the US annually, with 80% passing away in institutions due to chronic illnesses like cancer and heart disease. A study in 2004 highlighted unmet needs of those dying in institutions, emphasizing the benefits of hospice care at home. The Supreme Court affirmed the right of competent adults to make end-of-life decisions in 1997. The Supreme Court reaffirmed the right of competent adults to refuse medical treatment and emphasized the use of advance directives to safeguard this right. Despite the Patient Self-Determination Act, only 15-20% of the general population have advance directives. Competent adults should complete advance care plans to stipulate their healthcare decisions in case they become unable to speak for themselves. Individuals can protect their right to express their wishes and have them respected by using advance directives such as living wills and durable powers of attorney for health care. The purposes of this Act are to improve access to information about health care options near the end of life, promote advance care planning, engage healthcare providers in disseminating information, and assist in the preparation of advance directives. The Act aims to enhance access to end-of-life planning consultations under Medicare coverage, promoting advance care planning and the use of advance directives like living wills and durable powers of attorney for healthcare.

Additionally, providers must honor advance directives executed outside the state to the same extent as those meeting state requirements. The text discusses the importance of honoring advance directives in healthcare decisions, even if executed outside the state. It also mentions that these directives should preempt any inconsistent state laws but not override laws that offer more patient autonomy. In paragraph (1), amendments are made to include advance directives in an individual's current medical record. These changes aim to ensure the prominence of advance directives in healthcare decision-making.

The effective date specified by the Secretary of Health and Human Services cannot be later than 1 year after the enactment of this Act. If a State plan under title XIX requires legislation to meet the new requirements, it will not be considered non-compliant. The plan is not considered non-compliant if it fails to meet additional requirements before the first day of the first calendar quarter after the state legislature's session following the enactment of the Act. Each year of a 2-year legislative session is considered a separate regular session. Increasing awareness of end-of-life planning through programs to educate on advance directive planning issues.
