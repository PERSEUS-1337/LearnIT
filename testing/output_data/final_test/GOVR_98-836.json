    "content": "Under Senate rules, only the majority leader or their designee typically offer agenda-setting motions to proceed to consider a bill or resolution. Items brought up are usually from the Senate's legislative or executive calendars, reported by committee or placed directly on the legislative calendar. Holds are notices from Senators to their party leaders indicating their objection to a unanimous consent request for consideration. Holds in the Senate serve to identify controversial bills or items within a bill. Senators can file \"requests to be consulted\" to discuss compromise versions of bills, amendments, and the Senate's floor schedule. Once consulted Senators no longer have concerns, a bill is considered cleared for unanimous consent and voice vote approval with little debate. Through negotiations, floor leaders can persuade Senators to support a bill despite reservations. The majority leader in the Senate can often secure agreement to consider a bill despite reservations. The motion to proceed is usually debatable and can only be ended by unanimous consent or cloture. Debate limits may be imposed, but some motions to proceed are not debatable, such as privileged items of business. The motion to proceed is a non-debatable procedure in the Senate that occurs during the \"morning hour\" at the beginning of a legislative day. It is governed by Senate Rule VIII and allows for the consideration of pending business. The majority leader rarely uses this procedure due to parliamentary difficulties. The Senate typically begins a new legislative day through unanimous consent agreements, rather than relying on automatic procedures. Privileged items of business, such as budget resolutions and nominations, can be taken up by unanimous consent. Motions to go into executive session for certain matters are also privileged and non-debatable. Measures or matters can be made a special order of business at a future date by motion of any Senator. In the Senate, resolutions can be made a special order of business at a future date by motion of any Senator. If there is objection, the resolution is placed on a special section of the Calendar of Business. Resolutions pending at the end of morning business can be called up later by a debatable motion or unanimous consent. Resolutions in the Senate can be made a special order of business for a future date by any Senator's motion. If objected to, they are placed on a special section of the Calendar of Business. Resolutions pending at the end of morning business can be brought up later by a debatable motion or unanimous consent. Executive resolutions on the Executive Calendar can be reached by unanimous consent or non-debatable motion. Motions to discharge committees from further consideration of a measure must wait one day and may require three-fifths of Senators to vote for cloture for a final vote. A motion to discharge would place a measure or matter on the relevant chamber calendar."
