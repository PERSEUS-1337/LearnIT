    "content": "Text messaging began in 1992-1993 but became widely used in 2000. Initially, messages were limited to users on the same carrier, but in 2001, networks were connected for cross-carrier messaging. The US now sends over 48 billion texts monthly, not just between phones but also from web-based apps and instant messaging clients. SMS is a method of communication between cell phones or computers. SMS is a method of communication that sends text between cell phones or from a computer to a cell phone. The messages are limited to 160 characters and flow through the SMS Center (SMSC) to the recipient's phone via cell towers. SMS messages are processed through the SMS Center (SMSC) and sent to the recipient's phone via cell towers. Enhanced Messaging Service (EMS) allows for formatted text, sound effects, pictures, and icons to be sent, while Multimedia Messaging Service (MMS) allows for animations, audio, and video files to be included. Messages between a computer and a mobile phone are sent using the mobile device's email address and are subject to different regulations. Common Short Codes (CSCs) are short numeric codes introduced in the U.S. market in 2003. Common Short Codes (CSCs) are short numeric codes introduced in the U.S. market in October 2003 for sending text messages from mobile phones. They are used by various entities like TV stations, radio stations, and sports teams for communication with subscribers. Users can subscribe to alerts or messages through CSCs, with some messages being free while others may have a fee. \"Vanity\" CSCs, which use letters to spell out words, are also available for a higher price. Common Short Codes (CSCs) are short numeric codes used for sending text messages from mobile phones. Some CSCs are established as business partnerships between carriers and entities, like American Idol with AT&T Wireless. Policymakers face issues like consumer fraud and inappropriate content in the wireless world. Technical definitions can be challenging, such as determining if a text message is sent phone-to-phone or via email. Spam between phones or from one phone to many does not always fall under legal regulations. According to the U.S. Department of Transportation, distracted driving from mobile devices caused approximately 16% of fatalities in distraction-related crashes. In 2009, 5,474 people were killed in U.S. roadways due to distracted driving, with the under-20 age group having the highest proportion of distracted drivers. Drivers using hand-held devices are four times more likely to be in serious crashes. Cell phone use while driving, whether hand-held or hands-free, leads to delays. The use of cell phones while driving, whether hand-held or hands-free, can delay a driver's reactions as much as having a blood alcohol concentration at the legal limit. Text messaging while driving is a growing concern among safety and regulatory groups, leading to various actions at the federal and state levels, including bills introduced in Congress on distracted driving. The Motorcoach Enhanced Safety Act aims to regulate the use of electronic devices by motorcoach drivers. The Motorcoach Enhanced Safety Act aims to regulate the use of electronic devices by motorcoach operators, prohibiting their use if they interfere with safe driving. S. 453 and Mariah's Act were introduced in Congress to address distracted driving, with a focus on prohibiting texting and cell phone use while driving. The bill introduced by Senator Amy Klobuchar focuses on teen traffic safety, prohibiting cell phone use while driving for those under 18, and establishing fines and penalties. It also creates a distracted driving grant program at NHTSA. The bill authorizes states to use grant funds for statewide programs to improve teen driver safety, including peer education and prevention strategies. It also allows the Secretary to establish a technical assistance center and a National Teen Driver Advisory Council. The National Teen Driver Advisory Council was established to study distracted driving and develop prevention strategies. Representative Carolyn McCarthy introduced a bill on June 23, 2011, directing the Secretary of Transportation to study cognitive distraction and withhold funds from states not enforcing laws against using hand-held mobile devices while driving. The bill introduced by Representative Eliot Engel on May 5, 2011, aims to provide distracted driving prevention incentive grants to states that enact laws prohibiting texting and handheld cellphone use while driving. States receiving grants must allocate funds for public education, enforcement of distracted driving laws, and other traffic safety projects. The bill introduced by Representative Eliot Engel on May 5, 2011, aims to provide distracted driving prevention incentive grants to states that enact laws prohibiting texting and handheld cellphone use while driving. It directs various agencies to administer education programs, establish research programs, issue regulations on electronic devices use, and report on wireless communications technology to reduce distracted driving problems. The CAN-SPAM Act aims to reduce spam in email accounts, but does not cover SMS messaging. P.L. 112-55 directs NHTSA and CDC to report on the link between electronic devices and distracted driving accidents. In December 2007, a class-action lawsuit was filed against T-Mobile regarding unwanted text messages and the inability to block or disable text messaging on phones. Customers expressed frustration to their congressional representatives about paying for messages they did not use. In August 2008, T-Mobile began allowing text blocking after a class-action lawsuit was filed against them. The lawsuit accused major carriers of colluding to set the price of text messages, alleging that they agreed to raise the price from $0.10 to $0.20. The defendants in the text messaging price-fixing lawsuit are accused of making identical price changes simultaneously, without attempting to lower prices to gain a market advantage. They had ample opportunity to conspire through a trade association, which was under investigation by the Antitrust Subcommittee. Defendants deny collusion, arguing that most consumers buy bundled plans for text messaging services. The wireless carriers in the text messaging price-fixing lawsuit are accused of simultaneous price changes without evidence of collusion. Defendants argue that most consumers use bundled plans for text messaging services, and deny discussing pricing at trade association meetings. Verizon declined to participate in NARAL Pro-Choice America's CSC program in 2007. Verizon initially declined to participate in NARAL Pro-Choice America's CSC program, citing concerns about controversial content. However, after facing criticism, Verizon reversed its decision, stating that it was based on an incorrect interpretation of internal policy. The policy was developed to protect against unwanted messages, but there are challenges in applying regulations to new services. Mobile providers have the right to control content in CSC programs, but Congress may need to consider protecting political and other speech. Third-party content providers use CSC programs to offer services like downloads and SMS-based chat, with some providers being deceptive. Some mobile content providers use deceptive tactics to charge customers for services like chat. The Mobile Marketing Association has guidelines to limit subscription periods and provide alerts for charges. Industry efforts aim to bring members into compliance over time. The risk of children accessing inappropriate content on mobile devices is increasing as more content services become available. While carriers follow voluntary guidelines for wireless safety, there is no guarantee children won't access inappropriate material. Content such as images, games, music, and videos can be downloaded on wireless devices, including material unsuitable for children. The wireless industry is working to prevent children from accessing inappropriate content on their devices, but the success of these efforts is uncertain. Policymakers may need to address the issue. Sexting, involving youth sending explicit messages or photos, can have serious legal consequences due to child pornography laws. Sexting among youth can lead to legal consequences under child pornography laws, potentially resulting in charges or registration as sex offenders. Congress may need to consider prosecuting children under laws meant for predators. Studies show a significant percentage of teens engage in sexting, highlighting the need for policy intervention. A study published in January 2012 found that only 2.5% of tweens and teens had engaged in sexting, with older teens more likely to be involved. About 7% had received nude images, but only 1% forwarded or posted them. Girls made up 56% of recipients, with most being 16 or 17 years old. In a study, 56% of recipients of sexually explicit images were girls, with 55% aged 16 or 17. Only 6% reported receiving such images, and some felt upset or embarrassed. Legislation like H.R. 975 addresses sexting as a form of cyberbullying. Cyberbullying, including the transmission of harassing communications through technology, is a growing issue highlighted by cases like the suicide of Megan Meier in 2007. This form of bullying can involve fake online personas, such as in the case of Megan's former friend's mother setting up a fake MySpace page. Cyberbullying is a growing issue highlighted by cases like the suicide of Megan Meier in 2007. Representative Danny Davis introduced H.R. 975, the Anti-Bullying and Harassment Act of 2011, which includes language defining cyberbullying as bullying through technology. The bill introduced by Representative Danny Davis in 2011 defines cyberbullying as bullying through technology, including electronic communications. Various other bills address bullying in general, while text messages are increasingly sought after for government business transparency. Some argue for the privacy of text messages despite the push for disclosure in government operations. States are redefining public communication based on whether it involves conducting the public's business, making text messages and records of such communication part of the public record. Courts and legislatures are considering access to text messages under various laws, including Sunshine Laws and Freedom of Information Acts. In Detroit, newspapers filed a lawsuit seeking access to text messages under the Michigan Freedom of Information Act. In Detroit, newspapers filed a Michigan Freedom of Information Act lawsuit to obtain text messages related to a $8.4 million settlement of whistle-blower lawsuits. The city argued that disclosing the messages would violate the Stored Communications Act. Despite obtaining some messages from an anonymous source, the newspapers continued to push for more information under public records law. The court ruled that some of the information was public, leading to the publication of text messages related to a cover-up, resulting in charges against the mayor and chief of staff. In Flagg v. City of Detroit, the mayor and chief of staff were charged and convicted for a cover-up related to text messages. The district court ruled that the city's text messages were considered \"public records\" under Michigan's FOIA. It was determined that the city had control over these records even if they were held by a third-party service provider. Additionally, courts have examined the privacy rights of employees regarding the disclosure of text messages sent on employer-issued devices. The United States Supreme Court in City of Ontario v. Quon addressed the privacy rights of employees regarding the disclosure of text messages sent on employer-issued devices. The court overturned a decision that officials engaged in an unconstitutional search and seizure when they acquired and read messages from a city police officer's pager. The court held that officials acted reasonably in reviewing the messages, applying principles for determining when a search is reasonable. The Supreme Court found that officials acted reasonably when reviewing text messages sent on Sergeant Quon's city-issued pager. Courts are also exploring the application of open government laws to text messages, as seen in a Texas case ordering the disclosure of emails and texts sent by city officials. Additionally, the FCC and FEMA announced the implementation of a Personal Localized Alerting Network (PLAN) in May 2011. The FCC developed the Commercial Mobile Alert System (CMAS) under rules since April 2008. The PLAN system will deliver emergency text messages to the public during disasters. Mandated by the Warning, Alert and Response Network Act in 2006, it will be operational nationwide by April 2012. The government will send out three types of messages to mobile-phone users: Presidential Alerts for national emergencies, Imminent Threat Alerts for imminent risks to lives, and Public Safety Alerts for other emergencies. The FCC has established the Commercial Mobile Alert System (CMAS) to deliver emergency messages to the public during disasters. Imminent Threat Alerts are for emergencies that may pose a risk to people's lives, while Child Abduction Emergency/AMBER alerts are for missing or abducted children. The FCC has recommended FEMA to serve as the alert aggregator for timely dissemination of warning messages to participating mobile services. In the Third Report and Order, the FCC adopted notification requirements for wireless providers regarding emergency alerts, procedures for transmitting and withdrawing alerts, and rules for alert opt-out capabilities for subscribers. Participating providers can recover costs for alert transmission equipment and must adhere to a compliance timeline for CMAS deployment. The FCC is refining rules for PLAN/CMAS, with the latest requirements outlined in the Third Report and Order. The Third Report and Order, released on August 7, 2008, outlines requirements for wireless carriers to participate in the PLAN/CMAS program by April 7, 2012. FEMA and the FCC announced that FEMA will be the gateway for alerts dissemination. The four major wireless carriers will be involved in the program. The major wireless carriers will participate in the program, with issues prompting varying responses from Congress and the industry. As wireless technologies evolve, approaches to ensure consumer safety will also evolve. AT&T customers can log in at mymessages.wireless.att.com for text-blocking and alias options, while Verizon Wireless customers can log in at vtext.com for text blocking options. Wireless customers can block text messages from e-mail or the web by logging in at vtext.com. Sprint customers can block specific phone numbers and addresses by logging in at sprint.com. T-Mobile customers can block all messages sent by e-mail or permit only messages sent to the phone's e-mail address by logging in at t-mobile.com. Customers can block text messages by logging in to their wireless provider's website. They can choose to block specific phone numbers or addresses, filter messages sent by e-mail, or only allow messages sent to their phone's e-mail address."
