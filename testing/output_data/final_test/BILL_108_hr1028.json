    "content": "The \"Coastal Zone Management Act Reauthorization of 2003\" amends the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972, specifically addressing administrative grants under Section 306. The Coastal Zone Management Act Reauthorization of 2003 amends Section 306 to allow the Secretary to provide grants to coastal States for program administration. States must match grants in specified ratios, with varying ratios for programs approved after October 1, 2001. Grants are allocated based on regulations. The Secretary establishes management programs for coastal States based on regulations, considering factors like shoreline extent, population, and equity. Grants are provided to promote effective coastal management, with a focus on minimizing funding changes among eligible States. Increased funding is ensured for each State when the total appropriation exceeds the previous fiscal year. The provision exempts the first full fiscal year for eligible States from certain requirements under the coastal management assistance program. SEC. 4. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. Section 318 (16 U.S.C. 1464) is amended to allocate specific funding amounts for grants under sections 306, 306A, and 309 for fiscal years 2004 to 2008. Additionally, $6,500,000 is designated for expenses related to the administration of this title for each fiscal year from 2004 to 2008. The amendment restricts the use of funds for program, administrative, or overhead costs of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration or the Department of Commerce, except for grants to States. The Secretary must allocate a minimum of $10,000,000 or 14% of funds to support State coastal nonpoint pollution control programs approved under the Coastal Zone Act Reauthorization Amendments of 1990."
