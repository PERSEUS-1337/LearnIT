    "content": "The Act titled \"Stop Nuclear Waste by Our Lakes Act of 2015\" includes findings related to nuclear waste disposal. Congress finds that Ontario Power Generation plans to build a Deep Geologic Repository near Lake Huron to store nuclear waste, sparking concerns from US and Canadian citizens due to the proximity to the Great Lakes Basin, protected under the Boundary Waters Treaty of 1909. The Boundary Waters Treaty of 1909 established the International Joint Commission to oversee cases involving boundary waters. It allows either the United States or Canada to request the Commission to examine and report on any differences related to their rights, obligations, or interests. The International Joint Commission can address disputes between the United States and Canada regarding boundary waters or their inhabitants with the consent of both parties. The International Joint Commission can address disputes between the United States and Canada regarding boundary waters or their inhabitants with the consent of both parties. SEC. 3. INTERNATIONAL JOINT COMMISSION. The Secretary of State will request the International Joint Commission to review the long-term impacts of the Deep Geological Repository for nuclear waste and issue a report to the US and Canada. In case Canada decides to dispose of high-level nuclear waste near the Deep Geological Repository or in the Great Lakes Basin, the Secretary of State will ask the International Joint Commission to study the risks and bring the matter before them. The Secretary of State will negotiate with Canada to delay decisions on storing high-level nuclear waste near the Deep Geological Repository or in the Great Lakes Basin until after the International Joint Commission reports. Additionally, they will seek consent to bring the matter before the International Joint Commission as per the Boundary Waters Treaty of 1909. The Deep Geologic Repository proposed by Ontario Power Generation aims to dispose of 7,000,000 cubic feet of low- and intermediate-level nuclear waste at the Bruce Nuclear Power Plant in Kincardine, Ontario. The Great Lakes Basin includes Lake Ontario, Lake Erie, Lake Huron, Lake Michigan, and Lake Superior, along with connecting channels and all bodies of water within their drainage basin."
