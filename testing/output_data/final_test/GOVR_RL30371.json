    "content": "Slobodan Milosevic maintained power in Serbia for over a decade through tight control of key institutions and support from certain sectors of the population. His reign ended in 2000 when he was deposed after refusing to concede defeat in an election. The Democratic Opposition of Serbia (DOS) coalition, led by Vojislav Kostunica, won the election against Slobodan Milosevic in 2000. Kostunica's reputation for honesty and opposition to Milosevic, along with his nationalist views, contributed to his popularity among Serbs. After the DOS coalition's victory in the Serbian parliament elections on December 23, 2000, tensions arose between supporters of FRYPresident Kostunica and Serbian Prime Minister Djindjic, slowing reforms and disillusioning many Serbs. One key dispute was cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY), leading to the transfer of Slobodan Milosevic to face war crimes charges on June 28, 2001. Djindjic defended the transfer for vitally-needed international aid, while Kostunica condemned it. The DOS government faced challenges after the transfer of Milosevic for war crimes charges, leading to tensions between Kostunica and Djindjic. The DOS coalition broke up in August 2001, and Djindjic was assassinated in 2003. Organized crime and extremists within the Serbian military pose a threat to Serbia's democratic development. The Serbian government called early parliamentary elections in December 2003 due to instability in the ruling coalition. The Serbian Radical Party emerged as the largest party with 82 seats, reflecting public disillusionment with the previous government. Kostunica formed a minority government with democratic parties, focusing on combating organized crime and corruption. The Serbian government, approved in March 2004, faces criticism for its reliance on support from the SPS party. Despite claims of reform, concessions to the Socialists have been made. The presidential election in June 2004 was seen as a test of Serbia's democratic progress and alignment with Euro-Atlantic institutions. The presidential election in June 2004 in Serbia was a crucial test for the country's alignment with Euro-Atlantic institutions. Tomislav Nikolic of the Radical Party faced off against Boris Tadic of the Democratic Party, with Nikolic winning 30.6% in the first round and Tadic coming in second with 27.37%. In the runoff, Tadic emerged victorious with 53.53% of the vote, signaling continued support for Serbia's integration with Western institutions. The growing strength of Tadic's pro-Western Democratic Party and continued support for the Radicals in Serbia. New parliamentary elections must be held by the end of 2007, with the current weak government facing potential destabilization from events like a Kosovo settlement, Mladic's transfer, or scandals. Experts are divided on the outcome of possible early elections. The Radicals are the most popular party in Serbia, but may not be able to form a majority government. Nationalist backlash could help them and the Socialists gain power, but the international community would disapprove. Alternatively, the DS, DSS, and other democratic parties could form a government, but internal conflicts may hinder this. In Montenegro, Djukanovic leads an anti-Milosevic faction and has consolidated power, leading to tensions with the Milosevic regime. A cold war developed between Montenegrin leaders and the Milosevic regime, with Djukanovic seizing control of power. Despite efforts for independence, international opposition, particularly from the EU, stalled progress. EU officials were concerned about the impact on Serbia and Montenegro, as well as Kosovo. An agreement on restructuring the relationship between Serbia and Montenegro was brokered by EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana on March 14, 2002. The agreement brokered by EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana in March 2002 restructured the relationship between Serbia and Montenegro, leading to the formation of \"Serbia and Montenegro\" as a new joint state in February 2003. The union of states had a popularly elected parliament, a president chosen by the parliament, and a government to handle various responsibilities including foreign affairs, defense, and economic relations between the republics. The agreement allowed either state to declare independence after three years, with Serbia inheriting sovereignty over Kosovo as outlined in U.N. Security Council 1244. Montenegro held parliamentary elections on October 20, 2002. Montenegro held parliamentary elections on October 20, 2002, with a DPS-led coalition winning an absolute majority. Djukanovic resigned as President in November 2002, becoming Prime Minister. Presidential elections in December 2002 and February 2003 were invalidated due to low turnout. Filip Vujanovic was elected President in May 2003. Montenegro, dependent on tourism and trade, has few industries and resources. Montenegro heavily relies on tourism, trade, and is allegedly involved in organized crime activities. Djukanovic and other leaders have faced accusations of complicity with smuggling operations and trafficking. In 2006, Montenegro held a successful referendum for independence from Serbia and Montenegro, with a 55.5% majority vote and 87% turnout. The referendum for Montenegro's independence from Serbia and Montenegro in 2006 was successful with an 87% voter turnout. International observers confirmed the vote's compliance with democratic standards. Serbia recognized Montenegro's independence on June 15, leading to discussions on dividing joint debts and property. Kosovo's autonomy within Serbia was abolished in 1990, sparking ethnic tensions and eventually armed conflict. NATO intervened to restore Kosovo's autonomy and halt the violence. In 1999, NATO launched air strikes against Serbia to restore Kosovo's autonomy. Milosevic agreed to withdraw forces, allowing a NATO peacekeeping mission. Kosovo is governed by UNMIK under UNSC Resolution 1244. Talks between Kosovo and Serbia on the province's status began in 2006, with the US pushing for a conclusion by the end of the year. Kosovo seeks independence, which Serbia strongly opposes. Serbia is seeking independence for Kosovo, which is strongly rejected by the Serbian government. Serbian leaders have proposed a decentralization plan for Kosovo, creating autonomous Serb regions in northern Kosovo and other Serbian-majority enclaves. This plan aims to consolidate control over northern Kosovo and important economic assets, but is strongly opposed by Ethnic Albanian leaders. Serbia's plan for decentralization in Kosovo aims to strengthen its control over northern Kosovo, criticized for supporting \"parallel structures\" by international officials and ethnic Albanians. There are concerns that Serbia's hard-line stance may be a negotiating tactic for a possible partition of Kosovo. The United States and other members of the Contact Group have ruled out a partition of Kosovo. Serbian leaders may seek compensation like easier terms for NATO and EU membership or increased aid. Serbian experts warn of difficulties in making concessions due to the weak Serbian government and the strength of the Radicals. There are concerns that Serbia could assist Serbs if Kosovo's independence is recognized. Serbia could assist Serbs in northern Kosovo in breaking away from the new state, potentially leading to violence. With international help, Serbia successfully defused an insurgency in southern Serbia in 2001. NATO allowed Yugoslav forces back into a demilitarized zone near Kosovo, leading to the disbandment of ethnic Albanian guerrillas. Western countries urged Serbia to address underlying issues like ethnic balance in local police and economic conditions. Serbia proposed a peace plan for the region in February 2001. In February 2001, Serbia proposed a peace plan for the region to boost ethnic Albanian participation in local government and police with help from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. Local elections in July 2002 resulted in ethnic Albanian parties controlling the local governments of Presevo and Bujanovac, while Serb groups control Medvedja. However, issues such as discrimination and occasional violence persist in the area. Ethnic Albanians boycotted the Serbian parliamentary elections in December 2003 due to a lack of representation for ethnic minorities. Final status talks in Kosovo could impact the stability of southern Serbia. The democratic leadership in Belgrade faced economic challenges after taking over from the Milosevic regime in 2000. The FRY's economy suffered from mismanagement, isolation, and the effects of NATO air strikes in 1999. Key enterprises and banks were controlled by regime cronies who mismanaged and stole from them. Serbia's GDP in 1999 was only 45% of its 1990 level, with unemployment at about 35% in 2000. The FRY had over 800,000 refugees and displaced persons to care for, about 10% of the country's population. Milosevic increased the money supply in his final year to fund reconstruction efforts. In his final year of rule, Milosevic increased the money supply to fund reconstruction projects after the Kosovo war, leading to inflation and currency depreciation. Serbia faced high levels of internal and external indebtedness, with budget deficits and bad bank debts. Since 2001, the Serbian government implemented economic reforms, reducing inflation through prudent fiscal and monetary policies. They achieved a budget surplus in 2005 and liberalized the foreign trade regime. Serbia and Montenegro experienced rapid economic growth in recent years, with a GDP surplus of 1.6% in 2005. Foreign investment in Serbian banks is increasing, and privatization efforts are ongoing. Despite corruption scandals, foreign direct investment rose by 50% in 2005. Economic indicators show growth, with GDP increasing by 6.2% in 2005 and expected to grow by 5.0% in 2006. Real wages also increased by 11.5% in February 2006, but inflation remains high at 16.6%. Unemployment levels are still significant. Unemployment in Serbia and Montenegro was at 32.6% in 2005, with poverty affecting 10% of the population. The IMF supported economic policies, providing loans for restructuring and privatization efforts. Serbia and Montenegro made progress in reducing foreign debt through debt forgiveness deals. Montenegro pursued a separate economic policy from Serbia, adopting the Euro and implementing sound fiscal and monetary policies. Inflation in Montenegro was lower than in Serbia, with real GDP growth of 4.1% in 2005. Montenegro's economy heavily relies on tourism and trade with Serbia and other countries. Privatization has attracted foreign investment, but some large firms still need to be sold off. Corruption in the privatization process has been a concern. Serbia and Montenegro aim for EU membership, with negotiations for a Stabilization and Association Agreement initiated in 2005. The EU has set conditions for enhanced cooperation with Serbia and Montenegro, including harmonizing laws with EU standards and cooperating with the ICTY. Failure to meet these conditions led to the suspension of SAA talks in 2006. Serbia and Montenegro have preferential trading status with the EU since 2001. The EU provided financial aid to Serbia and Montenegro in 2005 and 2006. EU officials initially encouraged the two republics to stay together and align their economic policies to secure a Stabilization and Association Agreement (SAA) and potential EU membership. However, when Montenegro insisted on holding a referendum for independence, the EU pushed for a higher threshold of 55% for the referendum's success, which was approved on May 21. Montenegro agreed to a 55% threshold for independence referendum approved on May 21, 2006. EU pledged to respect the result and open separate SAA talks with Montenegro. Serbia and Montenegro requested to join NATO's PFP program in June 2003, with the arrest of Ratko Mladic as the remaining obstacle. Reforms in armed forces include civilian control and retirement of high-ranking officers from the Milosevic era. Efforts to reform Serbia and Montenegro's armed forces include retiring high-ranking officers from the Milosevic era and restructuring the defense and national security strategies. The country is divided between the two republics after Montenegro's independence in May 2006, with each seeking to join NATO's PFP independently. The US supports the country's democratic transition but insists on meeting international obligations, including to the ICTY. The United States supports Serbia and Montenegro's democratic transition and their efforts to join NATO's Partnership for Peace. President Bush signed a determination allowing them to receive U.S. defense assistance. The U.S. backed EU efforts that led to the formation of the Serbia and Montenegro union in 2003. Undersecretary of State Nicholas Burns stated that the U.S. did not oppose Montenegro's independence referendum but emphasized the need for a peaceful and legitimate process. The main U.S. goal in the region is reform and progress towards Europe. The United States supported Serbia and Montenegro's democratic transition and their efforts to join NATO's Partnership for Peace. President Bush allowed them to receive U.S. defense assistance. The U.S. backed EU efforts leading to the formation of the Serbia and Montenegro union in 2003. The U.S. recognized Montenegro as an independent country in 2006. The fate of Milosevic and others indicted by ICTY has been a controversial issue in Serbia's relations with the United States. U.S. aid to Serbia has been conditioned on cooperation with the ICTY. Since 2000, Serbian cooperation with the ICTY has been influenced by U.S. aid conditions. Serbia tends to deliver indictees to the Tribunal just before or shortly after the certification deadline. Despite calls for more cooperation, Serbian leaders cite political and legal obstacles. Of the six remaining fugitives sought by the ICTY, Mladic and three others are believed to be in Serbia. Del Ponte also emphasized Serbia's responsibility to transfer Karadzic. The Serbian government has the main responsibility to transfer Karadzic, whose current whereabouts are unknown, and another indictee who has fled to Russia, due to Serbia's links with both persons. The United States provided aid to Serbia and Montenegro from FY1999 through FY2001, with additional funding allocated to the FRY as a whole. In subsequent years, the Administration provided varying amounts of aid to Serbia and Montenegro. The FY2005 foreign aid measure provided $73.6 million for Serbia and $20 million for Montenegro, while the FY2006 foreign aid bill contains $70 million for Serbia and $15 million for Montenegro. The FY2007 foreign aid bill recommended $60 million for Serbia and $10 million for Montenegro, with SEED aid used to help establish a free market economy and strengthen democratic institutions in the two republics. Other U.S. aid focuses on restructuring the banking sector, privatization, tax reform, WTO accession, fighting financial crime, and providing credit facilities for small businesses and developing a mortgage market. The FY2001 foreign aid bill provided $600 million for central and eastern Europe through the Support for East European Democracy Act (SEED) funds, with an additional $75.825 million earmarked for Serbia, Montenegro, and Croatia. The bill allowed the Administration to allocate funds for strengthening exports and border controls in Serbia and Montenegro.

It also outlined restrictions on aid to countries harboring war criminals. The FY2001 foreign aid bill allocated funds for Serbia and Montenegro with conditions related to cooperation with international organizations and settlement of state issues. The transfer of Milosevic to the ICTY was praised by members of Congress, who called for continued cooperation and aid to support reforms in the FRY. The FY2002 foreign appropriations legislation contained similar conditions on aid to Serbia, which were certified by the Secretary of State in May 2002. Secretary of State Colin Powell certified Serbia's cooperation with war crimes laws and the surrender of indictees in May 2002. This led to the Administration's support for restoring Normal Trade Relations status. The FY2003 foreign aid bill included certification provisions for aid to Serbia, with a deadline of June 15, 2003. Powell made the certification but emphasized the need for full cooperation with the ICTY. The House passed resolutions in 2003 to restore Normal Trade Relations status to Serbia and Montenegro, with conditions including cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia. The House passed resolutions in 2003 to restore Normal Trade Relations status to Serbia and Montenegro, with conditions including cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia. The United States should continue supporting reforms in Serbia and Montenegro, including fighting organized crime and corruption. The Administration restored Serbia and Montenegro's Normal Trade Relations with the United States on November 4, 2003, after the FRY's NTR status was suspended in 1992 due to its role in the war in Bosnia. The Administration granted duty-free treatment to some products from Serbia and Montenegro in June 2005 under the Generalized System of Preferences. The FY2004 foreign aid appropriations bill was added to an omnibus appropriations bill, tightening provisions related to cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia. The Administration declined to certify Serbia's cooperation, resulting in the suspension of $16 million in U.S. aid. The FY2005 foreign aid appropriations were included in an omnibus spending bill, containing similar certification requirements. The FY2006 foreign operations appropriations bill (H.R. 3057) was approved by the House and Senate in November 2006 (P.L. 109-102). Section 563 contains Serbian aid conditions, conditioning U.S. aid to Serbia on cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for Yugoslavia, including the surrender of indictees like Ratko Mladic and Radovan Karadzic.

The Administration is urged to vote for loans and aid for Serbia and Montenegro from international financial institutions after May 31, 2006, if certain conditions are met. The Administration can issue a certification even if Mladic and Karadzic are not transferred, as long as they are not living in Serbia. $7 million in U.S. aid to Serbia was suspended in 2006 for failing to cooperate with the ICTY. The FY2007 foreign operations appropriations bill contains similar certification provisions. Karadzic is no longer specifically named in the bill. The FY2007 bill no longer specifically names Karadzic but retains mention of Mladic."
