    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Preexisting Condition Patient Protection Act of 2009\". The Congress finds that millions of Americans were uninsured or underinsured in 2007, with a significant number having chronic conditions. Many states allow insurance companies to deny coverage for preexisting conditions. Additionally, over 26 million people were enrolled in private health plans in 2007 under HIPAA. The Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) does not protect individuals against pre-existing condition exclusions or waiting periods. When there is a 63-day gap in insurance coverage, pre-existing condition exclusions can be imposed on them when they get a new health insurance policy. Eliminating pre-existing condition exclusions for all is crucial for ensuring access to healthcare. A majority of Americans support the Federal Government requiring health insurance companies to cover anyone who applies, even with a prior illness. SEC. 3.
