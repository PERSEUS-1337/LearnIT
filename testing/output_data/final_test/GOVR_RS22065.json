    "content": "Following the collapse of the former Soviet Union, Congress authorized the closure of military installations under four BRAC rounds in 1988, 1991, 1993, and 1995. Cleanup efforts continue at some contaminated properties, delaying their reuse for civilian purposes. Public concern about the pace and costs of cleaning up these properties remains high. The completion of cleanup is crucial for economic redevelopment, as properties must be cleaned up to be suitable for their intended use. The 109th Congress approved a new BRAC round in 2005, requiring the Department of Defense to close selected installations by 2011, but there is no statutory deadline for the cleanup of contaminated property. The federal statutory requirements for cleanup of contaminated properties on closed military installations depend on negotiated response actions, cleanup technologies, and funding from Congress. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) mandates cleaning up contaminated federal property before transfer out of federal ownership. The federal government is responsible for cleaning up contaminated properties, including those on closed military installations. The Department of Defense usually handles the cleanup for closed military sites. After transfer of ownership, the US remains liable for any original contamination not adequately remediated. Ownership transfer documents guarantee cleanup to a specific level, with potential restrictions on certain uses. Further cleanup may be required if additional work is needed beyond the agreed-upon level. After transfer of ownership, the new owner is responsible for further cleanup if the property is to be used for a different purpose. Surplus federal properties are typically transferred to a Local Redevelopment Authority for civilian reuse planning. Early transfer under CERCLA can expedite redevelopment if cleanup is assured to be completed. Early transfer of contaminated properties may be beneficial for speeding up the redevelopment process, especially if the recipient agrees to handle and fund the cleanup. This can involve selling the property at a discounted price to offset cleanup costs. However, the purchaser takes on financial risk if cleanup costs exceed expectations. Environmental insurance can help mitigate this risk. If a contaminated property is still useful to the federal government, it may be transferred to another federal agency instead of being made available to non-federal entities. CERCLA does not specify which agency has responsibility for cleanup of contaminated federal properties. The agency that caused the contamination usually administers and pays for the cleanup, but disagreements over responsibility can arise. Congress has addressed such disagreements in legislation. The EPA and state regulatory agencies oversee cleanup decisions for closed military installations to ensure requirements are met. EPA is required to lead cleanup efforts for federal facilities on the National Priorities List. The EPA leads cleanup of federal facilities on the National Priorities List (NPL) to achieve levels of contamination exposure protective of human health and the environment. Land use determines exposure risks and cleanup actions, with residential cleanup being the most stringent and costly due to higher exposure risks, especially for sensitive populations. Industrial cleanup is usually less costly and less stringent. The Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act requires DOD to defer to a Local Redevelopment Authority's plan. The Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act requires DOD to give \"substantial deference\" to an LRA's redevelopment plan for surplus property on closed military installations. Cleanup goals may need to be revised due to technical challenges, resulting in different land uses. DOD administers a Defense Environmental Restoration Program funded by multiple defense appropriations accounts for cleanup actions under CERCLA. The \"2005\" account funds the cleanup of installations closed under the 2005 round. Most of the account currently funds actions to close and realign missions of installations. As actions are completed, more of the account will be devoted to cleanup for surplus property reuse. Cleanup of realigned installations in active use will be funded from Defense Environmental Restoration Accounts. DOD divides each installation into sites for cleanup based on contamination. DOD identified 5,356 contaminated sites on installations closed under BRAC rounds, with hazardous substances being the main contaminants. Some sites also had abandoned munitions. Specific authorities for munitions cleanup were enacted in the National Defense Authorization Act for FY2002. DOD reported completion of planned response actions at 70% of identified sites by FY2007. No response needed at 14% due to acceptable contamination levels. Response actions pending at 10% of sites, with evaluations pending at 6%. Sites not requiring further action made available for use. As of FY2007, cleanup at closed military installations from the 2005 round is mostly complete, making much of the property suitable for reuse. However, sites cleaned up for military use may not be suitable for other purposes. DOD spent $7.3 billion on cleanup of contaminated sites on closed military installations up to FY2007. An additional $3.9 billion was estimated to be needed for future cleanup actions. Estimates for cleanup costs are continuously revised based on new information, making them \"moving targets.\" The cleanup costs for contaminated sites on closed military installations are challenging to estimate accurately due to uncertainties about the required degree of cleanup. Higher cleanup costs could impact the savings expected from a Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) round. Despite the closure of military installations resulting in operational savings, cleanup costs to prepare decommissioned properties for reuse can reduce these savings. The time and resources needed for cleanup depend on the level of contamination. The cleanup of closed military installations depends on contamination levels and selected actions for civilian reuse. It can take years, with challenges in funding and cleanup technologies affecting feasibility. Uncertainties exist in estimating DOD's cleanup costs for preparing closed installations for reuse, especially for those closed in the 2005 round where civilian uses are yet to be decided. DOD's cost estimates for cleaning up closed military installations in the 2005 round are based on recent military use, but if properties are repurposed for higher-risk activities, more extensive cleanup may be necessary, potentially requiring more time and resources than initially estimated."
