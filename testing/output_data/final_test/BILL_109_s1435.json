    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Collaborative Agreements to Recruit Educators (CARE) Act of 2005\". Congress finds that there is a need for 2,000,000 new teachers in the US over the next decade. The No Child Left Behind Act requires all teachers to be highly qualified by 2005-2006, but schools in rural and low-income areas struggle to attract and retain such teachers. Low-income schools are twice as likely to lack certified teachers in their subjects, requiring special assistance to meet the Act's goals. The No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 emphasizes the importance of highly qualified teachers in improving student achievement. Effective teachers with high verbal abilities and content knowledge significantly impact academic performance, with the difference between effective and ineffective teachers being more than 1 grade level of achievement. The New Teacher Project study shows that strategic recruitment in urban schools may attract qualified applicants, but many withdraw due to late hiring timelines. Approximately 3,000 adolescents drop out of secondary school daily, with a national graduation rate of 68 percent and 540,000 students failing to graduate yearly. Only 53 percent of low-income students graduate annually, leading to over $2.6 billion spent on replacing teachers who leave the profession. The purpose of this Act is to provide grants to encourage graduation and higher education pursuits in low-income schools. The curr_chunk is a section titled \"SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\" The curr_chunk provides definitions for key terms related to education, including \"core academic subjects\" such as mathematics, science, reading, social studies, foreign languages, and fine arts. It also defines \"highly qualified\" and \"institution of higher education.\" The curr_chunk defines terms related to education, including \"institution of higher education\" and \"local educational agency.\" It specifies requirements for teacher preparation programs receiving Federal assistance. The curr_chunk defines a low-income school as one served by a local educational agency qualifying for funding under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, with over 30% of students eligible for services under Title I. The school must also be listed in the Annual Directory of Designated Low-Income Schools for Teacher Cancellation Benefits. The curr_chunk defines mentoring as structured guidance and support for new teachers, and secondary school as a public or nonprofit private school providing secondary education. The curr_chunk defines key terms such as Secretary, State, and Teacher in relation to education. The curr_chunk introduces a grant program. The Secretary can award grants to institutions of higher education to establish partnerships with low-income schools for programs promoting graduation from secondary school and completion of postsecondary degrees in education. Nonprofit organizations can also be included in these partnerships. Institutions seeking grants must submit applications developed with low-income schools to the Secretary. Each application for grants to establish partnerships with low-income schools must include a description of teacher shortages and how funds will be used to improve teaching quality and establish programs promoting graduation. The Secretary approves applications that meet requirements and show promise of achieving the Act's purpose. Priority is given to higher education institutions partnering with teacher unions to establish teacher hiring tracks in low-income urban or rural areas. The Secretary approves applications for grants to establish mentoring or tutoring programs in low-income schools to improve graduation rates and encourage students to pursue postsecondary degrees in education. Grants are distributed equitably across the United States and can be renewed for up to 5 years. The institution of higher education aims to increase graduation rates and recruit low-income students to pursue postsecondary degrees in education through scholarships, counseling, information about college admissions, workshops for academic achievement, and other activities. Matching funds are provided for these initiatives. Each institution of higher education receiving a grant must contribute non-Federal matching funds equal to 20% of the grant amount. The Secretary will report to Congress on the effectiveness of the grant programs funded under this section. Authorization of appropriations for this Act is set at $20,000,000 for each fiscal year from 2006 through 2011."
