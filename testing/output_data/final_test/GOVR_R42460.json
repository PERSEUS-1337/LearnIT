    "content": "The changing role of the United States in world petroleum markets has led to a reassessment of the need for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR). Lower oil prices, OPEC's market share strategy, and evolving consumption patterns suggest a less vulnerable oil market. However, conflicts in the Middle East, uncertainty over Iran's nuclear program, and Saudi Arabia's OPEC strategy reversal caution against major decisions on the SPR. Some view the SPR as a potential revenue source for non-energy programs. New resource development in Texas, North Dakota, and Ohio has significantly increased U.S. light, tight, crude oil production. This has led to a decline in U.S. net imports of crude oil and an increase in exports of refined products. The lifting of prohibitions on U.S. crude oil exports has further boosted exports. The question of whether to sell heavy or light oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve may arise in the future. The United States has faced significant spikes in crude oil prices since the mid-1970s due to various factors like supply disruptions, demand growth, and international conflicts. President Obama ordered the sale of 30 million barrels of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in 2011 to offset a production curtailment in Libya. This sale had a short-term impact on global oil prices but limited long-term effects. Elevated petroleum prices affect the U.S. economy by increasing the value of oil imports and impacting the balance of trade. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) was established in response to the 1973 Arab-Israeli War and the subsequent oil embargo imposed by the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries (OAPEC). The embargo led to a significant increase in the price of imported crude oil, causing local spot shortages of gasoline in the U.S. In 1975, Congress created the SPR to hold up to 1 billion barrels of crude oil to replace net imports for 90 days. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) was established in 1975 to hold enough crude oil to replace net imports for 90 days. Congress authorized expansion to 1 billion barrels to prevent economic disruptions like the 1973 Arab oil embargo. Strategic stocks can help mitigate market reactions during a crisis. OAPEC aimed to prevent the use of oil as a political weapon. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) was created in 1975 to prevent economic disruptions like the 1973 Arab oil embargo by holding enough crude oil to replace net imports for 90 days. Congress's motivation focused on mitigating the economic effects of a shortage caused by international events. The SPR would introduce oil into the U.S. market during a supply interruption to calm markets, reduce price spikes, and lessen economic disruptions. Holding crude oil instead of petroleum products was chosen due to sufficient domestic refining capacity. This would help offset lost supply and mitigate disruptions caused by potential oil market disruptions. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) was established in 1975 to prevent economic disruptions like the 1973 Arab oil embargo by holding enough crude oil for 90 days of net imports. The SPR could buy time for diplomacy to resolve crises and was instrumental in the creation of the International Energy Agency (IEA) to develop emergency response plans. IEA member countries, including the United States, commit to maintaining oil stocks equivalent to 90 days of prior year's net imports and participate in coordinated drawdowns during supply interruptions. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) was established in 1975 to prevent economic disruptions by holding enough crude oil for 90 days of net imports. The SPR can deliver 4.4 MMb/d of crude oil for 90 days, dropping to 3.8 MMb/d for an additional 30 days, and further decreasing for up to 180 days as stocks deplete. IEA member nations require stock holding by the private sector, with governments and supervisory bodies holding 60% of required stocks. The private oil sector holds 60% of IEA required stocks, while governments hold 40%. The U.S. federal government holds 100% of the SPR stock. U.S. net imports of crude oil and petroleum products declined from 9.667 MMb/d in 2009 to 4.871 MMb/d in 2016 due to a decrease in gross imports and an increase in exports. Questions arise about using SPR supplies during emergencies and whether only net import supplies should be preserved. Presidential authority to authorize a drawdown of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) depends on determining a severe supply interruption nationally or internationally. The U.S. is obligated to join in an International Energy Agency (IEA) coordinated response. The President may release unlimited crude oil in an international interruption, while statutory limitations apply in a national interruption. The Energy Policy and Conservation Act authorizes the SPR drawdown upon a finding of a \"severe energy supply interruption.\" The President can authorize a drawdown of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) in the event of a severe energy supply interruption. This determination is based on criteria such as an emergency situation with a significant reduction in supply, a severe increase in petroleum product prices, and potential major adverse impacts on the national economy. Additional drawdown authority was granted after the Exxon Valdez oil spill to allow for SPR use in domestic energy supply shortages without the need to declare a \"severe energy supply interruption.\" The President can authorize a drawdown of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) in the event of an energy supply shortage of significant scope or duration. This authority allows for SPR sales of up to 30 million barrels over a 60-day period when the inventory is above 500 million barrels. The Secretary of Energy must periodically evaluate SPR drawdown procedures and conduct a test sale of up to 5 million barrels. The last test sale was in 2014. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) comprises four sites in Texas and Louisiana with a storage capacity of 727 million barrels. Stored crude oil is displaced by injecting water, but repeated injections can compromise the caverns' structural integrity. The SPR's inventory reached nearly 700 million barrels before Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005, leading to crude oil loans to refiners and competitive bidding sales. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) reached its maximum fill of 727 million barrels by 2010 and remained at that level until the 2011 drawdown reduced the inventory to 695 million barrels. Currently, the SPR holds the equivalent of 139 days of import protection. The Bryan Mound storage site in Texas has a total storage capacity of 254 million barrels with a cavern inventory of 242.1 million barrels. The Big Hill storage site in Jefferson County, TX has 14 storage caverns with a capacity of 171 million barrels. The site began full operation in 1991. The West Hackberry storage site in Cameron Parish, LA has 22 storage caverns with a capacity of 228 million barrels. The site began full operation in 1988. The Bayou Choctaw storage site in Iberville Parish, LA has six storage caverns with an authorized capacity of 74 million barrels. The Bayou Choctaw storage site southwest of Baton Rouge has six storage caverns with an authorized capacity of 74 million barrels. In 2007, the authorized cavern capacity temporarily decreased to 73.5 million barrels due to the risk of breaching the salt dome. Cavern 20 passed integrity tests and remains safe, but its oil storage was reduced from 7.5 million barrels to 3.2 million barrels. Oil from Cavern 20 was temporarily stored in the Big Hill and West Hackberry caverns. In November 2011, DOE acquired a 10-million-barrel replacement cavern, Cavern 102, in the Bayou Choctaw salt dome to increase storage capacity. The completion of Cavern 102 will replace a 7.5 million barrel cavern with a 10 million barrel cavern, in line with the Energy Policy Act of 2005's requirement to expand the SPR to a maximum capacity of 1 billion barrels. The Obama Administration cancelled SPR expansion plans in FY2011, citing a projection that U.S. petroleum consumption will decline. The SPR has a drawdown rate of 4.4 million barrels per day for up to 90 days, with a capacity of 713.5 million barrels. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) has a current capacity of 713.5 million barrels, with inventory at about 691 million barrels. Refilling the SPR after a drawdown is at the President's discretion, typically when crude oil prices decline or market conditions are favorable. The initial oil in the SPR was purchased using appropriated funds, but the Department of Energy (DOE) proposed accepting royalty-in-kind (RIK) oil from Gulf of Mexico leases as an alternative. This program was finalized in late 1999 and 2001. In late 1999 and 2001, the RIK program transferred oil to the SPR to replace oil sold in the mid-1990s for deficit reduction. President Bush ordered the SPR filled to 700 million barrels in 2001. RIK deliveries totaled 162 million barrels between 1999 and 2009, resulting in forgone receipts of $6.49 billion to the U.S. Treasury. In 2009, Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar ended the RIK program due to limited storage capacity. DOE sells SPR oil through competitive bidding with specific details provided in a \"notice of sale.\" The Department of Energy (DOE) reviews bids and offers awards for oil sales from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR). Oil can enter the market about two weeks after a sale notice. The SPR has released over 160 million barrels for various purposes. Presidents have ordered releases totaling 63 million barrels in response to energy supply interruptions. DOE has also lent nearly 68 million barrels to mitigate temporary supply interruptions. Sales have generated revenue for budget deficit reduction. The Clinton Administration proposed selling 7 million barrels from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) in FY1996 to help finance the program. Despite opposition in Congress, three sales of SPR oil occurred that year, raising $544.7 million. The Obama Administration also proposed selling SPR oil in FY2011 to reduce deficit spending. EPCA authorities allow for oil exchanges to acquire additional oil for the SPR. EPCA authorities permit oil exchanges for acquiring additional oil for the SPR. Companies borrow SPR crude and later replace it with a premium. Exchanges occurred between 1996 and 2005. In 2006, ConocoPhillips and CITGO borrowed 750,000 barrels of crude from the SPR. In 2008, a test exchange was conducted after Hurricanes Gustav and Ike. 1 million barrels were exchanged with Marathon Oil after Hurricane Isaac. During the aftermath of the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990, there was a debate on whether to use the SPR to lower gasoline prices. The George H. W. Bush Administration decided not to draw down the SPR unless there was a physical shortage. Some argued that using the SPR to calm markets during perceived shortages was beneficial. It was believed that the Administration missed the opportunity to use the SPR effectively during the crisis. During the fall of 1990, it was observed that in a decontrolled market, physical shortages are less likely to occur, with higher prices being the expression of supply shortages. Following the air strike against Iraq in January 1991, President Bush authorized a drawdown of the SPR, leading to a significant drop in crude prices. This was attributed to optimistic reports about the allied forces' success and reduced risk to world oil supply. Despite criticism, the IEA plan and SPR drawdown were deemed unnecessary to stabilize markets. The DOE offered over 30 million barrels of SPR oil for bid during the Persian Gulf War drawdown, accepting bids on 17.3 million barrels. Successful bidders received oil delivery in early 1991. Legislation enacted during the 101st and 102nd Congress expanded the SPR drawdown authority to prevent shortages from escalating and to address severe supply reductions causing price increases. Hurricanes Katrina and Rita caused severe disruptions in U.S. petroleum production, leading to a significant increase in oil prices. The Department of Energy approved emergency loans of 9.8 million barrels of crude oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to help refineries affected by the hurricanes. Additionally, the EIA coordinated with member countries to make 60 million barrels of crude oil and refined products available to mitigate the disruptions. The Department of Energy offered 30 million barrels for sale and executed contracts for 11 million barrels. Together with loans, the Strategic Petroleum Reserve released a total of 20.8 million barrels. Other EIA member countries released 27.33 million barrels into the market, benefiting the East Coast. Receipts from the sale totaled $615.3 million, with 9.8 million barrels loaned to the industry repaid along with 500,000 premium barrels. The Obama Administration had proposed a $500 million sale of petroleum from the SPR in its FY2012 Budget Request. The House approved a $500 million sale of petroleum from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) to be completed by March 1, 2012. This was proposed to be deposited in the General Fund of the Treasury. The sale was aimed at replacing the quantity sold during FY2012 to offset the loss of Libyan exports and stabilize oil prices amidst political unrest in Tunisia, Egypt, and Libya in early 2011. Some in Congress believed that releasing oil from the SPR would help dampen speculative bidding and reduce prices in the short run. In early 2011, oil prices surged due to political unrest in oil-producing countries, leading to concerns about supply disruptions. The House approved a $500 million sale of petroleum from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to stabilize prices. Saudi Arabia promised to increase exports to offset lost Libyan crude, while the IEA announced a release of 60 million barrels into the global market. The President directed a drawdown of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) to meet U.S. response obligations by selling 30.64 million barrels of crude oil at an average price of $107.21 per barrel. Additionally, a test sale of 5 million barrels was authorized to test drawdown and sales procedures at the TEXOMA facilities. The test sale of 5 million barrels of crude oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) was conducted to test procedures in light of changes in oil production and distribution. Five oil companies contracted to purchase the oil, but infrastructure issues needed to be addressed. The oil was sold at an average price of $93.75 per barrel, higher than the average price paid for oil in the reserve. Replacement of the sold oil was completed by July 31, 2015. Oil companies may have limited interest in purchasing SPR oil unless they have spare refining capacity or want to build crude oil stocks. The U.S. government sells crude oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve based on the previous five-day average price. There may be limited interest from the oil industry in bidding on SPR supply if prices do not soften. The impact of a crude drawdown on prices is uncertain, as seen in a previous release where prices briefly declined but returned to previous levels within a week. A unilateral drawdown on U.S. strategic stocks would likely have less impact on the world oil market. A drawdown on U.S. strategic stocks may have less impact on the world oil market compared to a coordinated international drawdown. Some argue against the U.S. drawing down its stocks while other nations maintain theirs. Market conditions and geopolitical events influence oil prices, with speculation driving prices in the futures market. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve is seen as a defensive tool against high oil prices. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) is viewed as a defensive policy tool against high oil prices. The number of U.S. refineries has decreased, but refining capacity has increased. In 2016, there were 141 refineries operating with over 18 million barrels per day capacity, with the Gulf Coast region accounting for nearly 45% of U.S. refining capacity. The API gravity of imported crude oils has been decreasing while sulfur content has been increasing. U.S. refineries have added coking capacity to convert heavier, sour crude oils to high-value products. The Government Accountability Office noted in 2006 that 40% of crude oil refined in the U.S. was heavier than that stored in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. The DOE found that the current mix of crudes in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) was mostly compatible with refineries, but suggested adding heavy crude for future expansion. Refineries processing heavy oil may face capacity issues if they run lighter oils, resulting in production penalties. Some refiners may need to shut down units if lighter crude is used. The types of oil currently stored in the SPR may not be fully compatible with all refineries. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) currently stores oil that may not be fully compatible with some vulnerable refineries, potentially reducing its effectiveness during supply disruptions. Plans to store heavy crude in the SPR were considered but later cancelled, as it was determined that it would not provide a net benefit in the event of a disruption. The United States has seen an increase in light sweet crude production from unconventional resources like the Bakken, Utica, and Eagle Ford shales, as well as the Texas Permian Basin. This lower-priced light sweet crude oil is now being favored by U.S. refineries over heavier crude oils. Retail gasoline prices have been linked to calls for the release of reserves from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) during price increases. Gasoline prices rose by over 15%, increasing from $3.21 to $3.92 per gallon. Calls for and against releasing crude oil from the SPR to control prices were made. A release from the SPR would provide temporary relief, as seen in a previous release in 2011 when prices dropped by 2% after a 30 million barrel release. The price of gasoline initially declined by 2% after the SPR release announcement, but by July 8, 2011, it had returned to $3.61 per gallon. Gasoline prices continued to rise through August before declining in the fourth quarter of 2011. The reductions in gasoline prices were likely due to decreases in crude oil prices between August and October 2011. Crude oil prices also responded immediately to the release of oil from the SPR, with the price at $94.96 per barrel on June 22, 2011. The price of oil was $94.96 per barrel on June 22, 2011, dropping to $90.70 after President Obama announced the SPR release on June 23. By June 30, the price rose to $95.73 per barrel, exceeding the pre-announcement price. The initial market response to the SPR release lasted about a week, with oil prices declining in August and September to $75.40 per barrel on October 4, 2011. Prices then began to rise, surpassing $100 per barrel later in the year. Gasoline price increases in 2012 were linked to crude oil price hikes, driven by market tightening due to increased demand or reduced supply. The price of oil in 2011 and 2012 was influenced by factors such as demand in emerging markets, supply disruptions in Libya and other regions, and tensions with Iran. Speculation about future availability played a role in price fluctuations, with concerns about Iranian military action potentially blocking the Strait of Hormuz. The release from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) was seen as potentially ineffective in mitigating these price pressures. If the Strait of Hormuz is blocked, it could prevent over 17 million barrels per day of crude oil from reaching the market, triggering an international response for a coordinated release of oil reserves from the US and other IEA member countries. The effectiveness of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) in supplementing US oil supply depends on its size, drawdown capabilities, import volume, and consumption rate. Factors like demand, production, and temporary issues like recession and high prices can affect US petroleum consumption. Since 2005, U.S. consumption of petroleum products has decreased by 9.5% due to factors like recession and high prices. This decline has led to a reduced demand for crude oil, while U.S. production of crude oil has increased by 9.5%. As a result, the share of imports in total consumption has decreased from 49% in 2005 to about 25% in 2016. Canada has become a significant source of crude oil imports for the United States, potentially reducing reliance on imports. Recent laws have required the sale of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR), which may better meet U.S. requirements in times of supply shortage. The 114th Congress passed laws authorizing the sale of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) for various purposes, including funding programs, modernizing SPR facilities, health-related uses, and supplementing highway and transit programs. The legislation specified the sale of millions of barrels of SPR oil over different fiscal years, with revenues deposited in the U.S. Treasury. The price of oil can fluctuate, leading to potential revenue variability for program funding. The legislation passed by the 114th Congress authorizes the sale of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) for various purposes, including funding programs. This legislation will reduce the SPR inventory by 149 million barrels by 2025, about 21%. There are restrictions in place to prevent the SPR balance from falling below the 90-day net import coverage level. Factors such as reduced U.S. petroleum imports or increased exports could lead to a decrease in SPR inventories. Rapid changes and volatility in oil markets have been observed in the past."
