    "content": "Cybersecurity issues are gaining national prominence and affecting constituents nationwide, leading to increased congressional interest. This report provides an overview of cybersecurity concepts, federal agency roles, and key issues for Congress to consider, such as protecting critical infrastructure, data breaches, encryption, and incident response. Multiple authors contributed to this coordinated report, with their contact information provided for reference. Cybersecurity is the security of cyberspace, which includes services delivered through the internet infrastructure to users. Users access services like online banking, shopping, email, social media, and news through devices. These services rely on a common infrastructure of servers, switches, routers, and wireless spectrum. This infrastructure is also used by utilities, shipping companies, and businesses for various purposes. Cyberspace encompasses services, infrastructure, devices, and users. The internet is a part of cyberspace, along with private networks for enhanced confidentiality. The U.S. government lacks a single definition of cybersecurity, but the U.S. Commission on Enhancing National Cybersecurity defines it as protecting information and systems from unauthorized access, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability. The U.S. Code defines \"confidentiality,\" \"integrity,\" and \"availability\" as part of the information security triad. These terms apply to data stored, processed, and transmitted by IT systems, as well as the systems themselves. \"Authentication\" is also crucial in cybersecurity discussions, ensuring parties accessing data are legitimate. Cybersecurity involves policies in education, workforce management, investment, entrepreneurship, and research. Software development, law enforcement, intelligence, incident response, and national defense are key in addressing cyber threats due to the complexity and vulnerabilities of IT systems. The interconnected nature of devices and networks increases the risk of attacks on data and systems. The interconnected nature of IT systems, including smartphones connected to various networks, increases the risk of vulnerabilities. One common attack is Denial of Service (DOS), which overloads a network or website with information, making it unavailable to legitimate users. A DOS attack overloads a network or website with information, making it unavailable to legitimate users. Ransomware encrypts a user's hard drive and demands payment in cryptocurrency for decryption. Ransomware demands payment for decryption, but it doesn't guarantee the encryption key. Data breaches compromise system confidentiality, integrity, and availability, violating the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. Attacks on data and system integrity aim to disrupt availability. Integrity attacks aim to disrupt trust in data or the system itself by unauthorized access and alteration of files. Unauthorized commands can compromise the integrity of an entire system, such as malware executing operations without the user's knowledge. These attacks are illegal under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. Any entity's data and IT systems can be targeted by cyber attacks. Cyber incidents can target any entity, including countries, corporations, governments, and individuals. Attackers may reuse tools and techniques across multiple targets. Partner entities may face cyberattack risks due to their relationship with a targeted entity. Terrorist use of cyberspace is increasing for organizational support and operational goals. No publicly accessible report has been published on this matter. The possibility of a cyberterrorist attack against the United States exists, as tighter security measures may push terrorists to use novel weapons. Persistent internet vulnerabilities could lead terrorists to enhance their computer skills and attempt cyberattacks on critical infrastructure. Cyberterrorists, both state-sponsored and nonstate actors, use the internet for planning attacks, radicalization, propaganda distribution, and communication. The vulnerability of critical control systems to cyberattacks was demonstrated in the Aurora Project conducted by the Department of Homeland Security in 2009. Cyberterrorists may be seeking to exploit these vulnerabilities in critical infrastructure for destructive purposes, but progress towards this goal is uncertain. Cyberterrorism is not clearly defined, but the USA PATRIOT Act includes violations of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act as part of its definition. It is illegal to access a computer without authorization and obtain sensitive information for reasons of national defense or foreign relations. The USA PATRIOT Act includes violations of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act as part of its definition of cyberterrorism, which involves unauthorized access to computers to obtain sensitive information that could harm the United States or benefit a foreign nation. Naval Post Graduate School defense analyst Dorothy Denning's definition of cyberterrorism focuses on the distinction between destructive and disruptive action, generating fear comparable to physical attacks. While DDOS attacks may not cause immediate fear or destruction, the potential for catastrophic effects on critical infrastructure during a crisis is a significant concern. Cyberterrorism may be an appropriate metaphor if an attack on emergency services coincides with a planned real-world event. The term \"cyberterrorism\" has not been statutorily defined due to various reasons, including the difficulty in identifying applicable activities and the need for strategic maneuverability. The Department of Defense (DOD) and Department of Homeland Security (DHS) are responsible for defending the nation in cyberspace and coordinating efforts for cyber defense. DOD and DHS are responsible for defending the U.S. homeland and national interests against cyberattacks. Military cyberspace operations use capabilities to support operations across physical domains. Offensive Cyberspace Operations project power through force in cyberspace. The DOD Cyber Strategy focuses on three primary missions: Defend DOD networks, systems, and information; defend the U.S. homeland and national interests against cyberattacks; and provide cyber support to military plans. This led to the creation of the Cyber Mission Force in 2012. The DOD established the Cyber Mission Force in 2012 to carry out cyber missions, consisting of 133 teams organized for three main mission sets: Cyber National Mission Force defends the nation, Cyber Combat Mission Force supports combatant commands, and Cyber Protection Force defends DOD networks. Cyber Support Teams provide analytic and planning support. The force reached initial operating capability in October 2016 and is expected to grow to 6,200 individuals by the end of 2018. The Cyber Mission Force, part of the United States Cyber Command, is expected to grow to 6,200 individuals by the end of 2018. USCYBERCOM was established in response to the increasing cyber threat, with a mission to defend Department of Defense networks and conduct military cyberspace operations. USCYBERCOM, commanded by a four-star general who also leads the NSA and CSS, manages global cyberspace operations and defends DODIN. Military services support USCYBERCOM, while DHS plays various roles in cybersecurity, securing federal networks, coordinating protection efforts, responding to threats, investigating cybercrimes, funding research, and promoting education and awareness. DHS collects and shares information on cybersecurity threats. DHS plays a key role in securing federal government networks by deploying tools to identify and stop threats, assisting in risk mitigation, and ensuring adherence to cybersecurity regulations. Additionally, DHS serves as the federal lead for asset response activities in accordance with PPD-41 and NCIRP. DHS serves as the federal lead for asset response activities, providing technical assistance to victim entities for mitigating vulnerabilities and coordinating federal agencies' response. Additionally, DHS's agencies fund cybersecurity research, investigate crimes targeting network infrastructure, and assist with the cybersecurity of critical infrastructure sectors. The Department of Justice (DOJ) is responsible for investigating and prosecuting cyber threats, as well as protecting its own critical information systems. Under the Obama Administration's PPD-41, DOJ, through the FBI and NCIJTF, leads the response to significant cyber incidents by conducting investigative activities on-site. The FBI is involved in enforcement and national security investigative activities related to cybercrime, including collecting evidence, providing attribution, and identifying threat pursuit opportunities. Their Cyber Division focuses on high-level intrusions by state-sponsored hackers and global cyber syndicates. The DOJ, through the U.S. Attorneys and Criminal Division, prosecutes cyber threat actors. The U.S. Attorneys and the Criminal Division at DOJ are centrally involved in prosecuting cyber threat actors. Selected policy issues related to cybersecurity may be of interest to Congress, including critical infrastructure (CI) defined as vital systems and assets with a debilitating impact on national security. DHS coordinates CI security, with sectors classified under Presidential Policy Directive 21. In 2013, Executive Order 13636 established a cybersecurity framework for critical infrastructure sectors, facilitated by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). Congress authorized this framework process in the Cybersecurity Enhancement Act of 2014 (P.L. 113-274). The Cybersecurity Enhancement Act of 2014 established a framework with core activities and outcomes for all sectors, including identifying, protecting, detecting, responding, and recovering from cyber threats. The framework also includes a profile of an entity's cybersecurity postures and implementation tiers. The DHS C3 program promotes voluntary adoption, and NIST released a draft update in January 2017. Debate over federal regulation's role in cybersecurity legislation has been ongoing, with the evolving threat environment highlighting the need for federal protection of critical infrastructure. The 115th Congress may need to address security concerns such as cyber attacks on election infrastructure and data breaches in both private sector companies and government agencies. Calls for broad security regulations have been renewed following attacks like the Mirai botnet in 2016 and attempts attributed to Russia to interfere with the 2016 federal election. The unpredictable nature of emerging threats in cyberspace makes resolving these controversies more urgent. Breaches at companies like Equifax and the SEC highlight the risks of modern business practices reliant on IT. Cybersecurity initiatives aim to manage these risks, with Congress holding hearings and introducing legislation to address data breach standards and notification requirements. The increasing importance of IT and data in business operations necessitates a focus on cybersecurity to protect sensitive information. Increasing awareness of cyberattacks and the connectedness of cyber systems have raised concerns about the preparedness of U.S. homes, businesses, and government in securing sensitive data. Federal policymakers are addressing the sufficiency of cybersecurity education and workforce development, as well as the needs of the federal government for cybersecurity professionals. Federal programs aim to increase awareness of secure computing practices. The federal government is focusing on cybersecurity education and workforce development to address concerns about cyberattacks and secure sensitive data. Various activities, such as cybersecurity awareness programs, summer camps, student competitions, scholarships, and professional development opportunities, are supported by federal funding to attract and retain cybersecurity professionals. The National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education (NICE) worked to develop a common language for cybersecurity jobs and skills to address barriers in the cybersecurity labor market and federal hiring. The NICE Cybersecurity Workforce Framework aims to standardize terms and vocabulary for education and employment in cybersecurity fields. It may be implemented as a workforce management tool in federal agencies, with potential adoption by cybersecurity education programs in the future. Other policy issues for the 115th Congress include aligning academic pathways with cybersecurity occupations. Policy issues for the 115th Congress include expanding educational benefits for federal cybersecurity personnel, funding for cybersecurity education, training, and workforce development programs. Long-term challenges in cybersecurity education involve keeping educational content up-to-date with evolving cyber defense landscape, training federal workers in secure computing practices, and exploring new educational credentials like microcredentialing and digital badging. Encryption is the process of securing information through cryptography. Encryption is the process of converting plaintext into ciphertext to keep information confidential. It is used to secure data that are stored or transmitted. Encryption ensures that communication is only accessible to intended recipients and helps verify the identity of communicating parties. Individuals and businesses use encryption to protect their digital information and maintain privacy. Encryption is crucial for individuals, businesses, and governments to keep information confidential and secure. It is used to ensure privacy on devices and in communication, protect research and transactions, and maintain the authenticity of data exchanges. However, encryption can also be used by malicious actors to hide their activities from legal authorities. This poses challenges for law enforcement in accessing information for investigations. Law enforcement faces challenges in accessing certain information due to strong encryption technology. The tension between law enforcement capabilities and technological change has been a long-standing issue, highlighted by past conflicts such as the \"crypto wars\" in the 1990s. Congress has addressed this issue with legislation like the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA) in 1994. The Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA; P.L. 103-414) was enacted in 1994 to assist law enforcement in conducting electronic surveillance amidst technological advancements. The ongoing debate on \"going dark\" has shifted from intercepting real-time communications to accessing stored content. The Obama Administration urged the tech community to help law enforcement access encrypted data, while policymakers consider legislative responses to address these challenges. The Encryption Working Group in the 114th Congress highlighted key points for the going dark discussion in the 115th Congress, emphasizing that weakening encryption goes against national interests. Cooperation between law enforcement and technology communities is essential in addressing the encryption and going dark challenge in cyberspace. Timely and accurate information is crucial for effective cybersecurity in the rapidly evolving digital landscape. Information sharing in cybersecurity is crucial for protecting information systems. However, barriers to sharing, especially in critical infrastructure sectors, have been a significant hindrance. Private-sector entities are reluctant to share due to concerns about legal liability, antitrust violations, and misuse of intellectual property. Legislation addressing these obstacles was debated in Congress before enactment in the 114th Congress. The Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act (CISA) was signed into law in December 2015 as part of the Cybersecurity Act of 2015. It facilitates public and private sector sharing of cybersecurity information, includes procedures for sharing classified information, and designates the DHS National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center (NCCIC) as the lead agency for federal information sharing. Congress may consider various aspects of CISA implementation. In overseeing the implementation of CISA, Congress should consider factors such as the complexity of shared information, varying timescales for usefulness, potential information overload, protection of confidentiality and privacy, and the complexity of the current information sharing structure. The implementation of CISA involves considering factors like the complexity of shared information, varying timescales for usefulness, potential information overload, and protecting confidentiality and privacy. Private-sector information sharing entities, like ISACs and ISAOs, play a role in cybersecurity, but CISA's impact on improving cybersecurity effectiveness may be limited as it primarily focuses on immediate concerns like cyberattacks. Other important cybersecurity aspects include education, training, workforce, acquisition, and cybercrime law. The interest in insurance against cyberattacks has been growing due to the uncertainty and potential damages. The market for cyber risk insurance is still in its infancy, with coverage mainly offered outside the regular admitted market. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) has estimated the growth of this market. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) estimates cyber insurance premiums at around $1.5 billion, but note that a significant amount is missing due to non-U.S. companies not reporting. Actuarial data on loss probabilities is limited, leading to non-standardized policy language with low limits and exclusions. The immaturity of the cyber insurance market raises concerns about who may suffer losses from cyberattacks and the public policy purpose of insurance premiums in internalizing risks. In the 114th Congress, legislation was introduced for a business tax credit for purchasing \"data breach insurance\" to increase cybersecurity. This would also require compliance with NIST standards. Congress has enacted laws affecting various insurance markets like health, flood, and terrorism insurance. The 115th Congress may consider encouraging cyber insurance through tax, regulatory, or program approaches. Cybersecurity challenges arise in international trade due to increased online trade, impacting commerce's vulnerability to cyberattacks. Digital trade, including movies, video games, email, and online banking, boosts economy productivity and competitiveness. The internet's global economic impact was $4.2 trillion in 2016, ranking as the fifth-largest national economy. The United States exported $751 billion in services in 2015, with over 60% being information and communication technology (ICT) services. The increase in digital trade poses new challenges in U.S. trade policy, including cybersecurity risks such as hacks into company databases and systems. Trade barriers like data localization measures can fragment a U.S. firm's data, increasing the risk of cyberattacks. The internet facilitates intellectual property-related trade but also increases the risk of cyberattacks. Cyber theft of trade secrets can harm a firm's competitive advantage. In 2014, the DOJ indicted five Chinese individuals for cyber espionage against U.S. companies. China's new cybersecurity law imposes restrictions on internet firms. The new cybersecurity law in China requires critical infrastructure sectors to store data in China and assist Chinese authorities, raising concerns about disclosing source code and promoting local ICT providers over foreign firms. U.S. companies and officials have expressed concerns about the law's potential impact on cybersecurity efforts. High-level cyber dialogues are held with various partners, including China, India, and the European Union. Recent bilateral and plurilateral agreements between countries like India, the European Union, and the United States are focusing on cybersecurity efforts and addressing digital trade rules. The Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) promotes cooperation on cybersecurity issues with enforceable commitments to combat cyber theft and localization barriers. Various international forums like the G-20, OECD, and APEC discuss digital trade and cybersecurity norms. Congress is interested in aligning global internet economy rules with U.S. laws and advancing U.S. interests in digital trade and cybersecurity. The Internet of Things (IoT) involves networks of objects communicating through the internet, potentially including various interconnected \"smart\" objects like vehicles, appliances, and infrastructure. Congress may take actions to address cybersecurity threats to U.S. trade and businesses, such as imposing sanctions and upholding G-7 commitments. The Internet of Things (IoT) involves interconnected \"smart\" objects that communicate with each other and computers, enabling automated control of processes. It has the potential to impact various sectors like homes, communities, factories, and cities, leading to integrated systems and improved infrastructure in smart cities. Economic analyses predict trillions of dollars in economic growth over the next decade, with sectors like agriculture, energy, healthcare, and transportation being particularly affected. The Internet of Things (IoT) involves interconnected \"smart\" objects in sectors like agriculture, energy, healthcare, manufacturing, and transportation. IoT devices are vulnerable to hackers, with potential risks increasing as the number of connected objects grows. Economic factors may hinder adequate cybersecurity measures in IoT devices, which are small, disposable, and may lack software update capacity. Interconnectivity of IoT devices can provide entry points for hackers to access networks and create botnets for cyberattacks. The Mirai botnet attack in 2016 disrupted internet services for several companies. Cyberattacks like Stuxnet have shown the potential for destruction in industrial control systems. The Federal Information Security Management Act places responsibility for information security on federal agency heads. The Federal Information Security Management Act places responsibility for information security on federal agency heads and contractors. Agencies must have senior officials overseeing IT management and security. Congress requires annual evaluations of agency information security performance by agency inspectors general. Legislation like FITARA expands the role of the chief information security officer in IT acquisitions and mandates reporting to Congress by the Office of Management and Budget. The Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) requires agencies to report to Congress on capital investments and IT security performance. FISMA 2014 assigns operational roles to DHS and DNI in IT security and directs agencies to report data breaches directly to Congress. The Cybersecurity Act of 2015 mandates inspectors general to report on security policies of systems with sensitive information. OMB reports on FISMA performance annually, while agency IG reports on information security evaluations. Presidential Policy Directive 41 (PPD-41), issued in 2016, outlines government's response to cyber incidents. The National Cyber Incident Response Plan (NCIRP) details responsibilities of federal agencies in coordinating responses. Response to cyber incidents is a shared responsibility among victims, private sector, and government, with a focus on risk-based resource allocation and unity of effort. The government's response to cyber incidents, outlined in Presidential Policy Directive 41 (PPD-41), emphasizes unity of effort across federal agencies and prioritizes restoration and recovery of operations for victims. The National Cyber Incident Response Plan (NCIRP) follows a model that supports conventional emergency management, borrowing core capabilities from the National Response Framework. The National Cyber Incident Response Plan (NCIRP) follows the National Response Framework and adopts key aspects of the National Incident Management System (NIMS). It outlines the activation of a Cyber Unified Coordination Group to address specific incidents, similar to how a multiagency group is activated in response to natural disasters. However, lacking specific responses or options, the NCIRP may not deter adversaries. PPD-41 emphasizes unity of effort in responding to cyber incidents, focusing on supporting victims and pursuing aggressors. The federal government's response to cyber incidents focuses on victim remediation and pursuing attackers. DHS leads these activities but collaborates with partner agencies like DOD and the intelligence community. Victims can choose to accept federal resources or handle incidents internally or with cybersecurity firms. If the federal government is invited to assist, it provides resources but victims are not obligated to accept them. The federal government's response to cyber incidents focuses on victim remediation and pursuing attackers. If the government is invited to assist, its work may only be made public with the victim's consent. Federal resources being delivered can signal the options the government will pursue for cybersecurity. Response activities aim to attribute the attack, punish the attacker, and deter future adversarial action through various means such as cyber-based responses, sanctions, or arrests. The federal government's response to cyber incidents focuses on victim remediation and pursuing attackers, which may involve sanctions, indictments, or other national power. The FBI leads the response domestically, with support from partner agencies like DOD for cyberattacks and the intelligence community for attribution. Multiple bills were considered during the 115th Congress to address federal IT management, assist state and local governments in investigating cybercrimes, improve information sharing, and develop voluntary guidelines to reduce cyber risks. During the 114th Congress, over 30 bills were introduced to address various cyber issues such as data breach notification, information sharing, law enforcement, protection of critical infrastructure, workforce development, and education. The Obama Administration proposed three bills on information sharing, data breach notification, and cybercrime laws. H.R. 2029, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016, was signed into law, containing cybersecurity provisions in Division N, including Cybersecurity Information Sharing, National Cybersecurity Advancement, Federal Cybersecurity Workforce Assessment, and Other Cyber Matters. The bill encourages private companies to share information about cyber threats with each other and the government, providing liability protection for participants. In the 113th Congress, five cybersecurity-focused bills were signed into law, including the Cybersecurity Workforce Assessment Act and the National Cybersecurity Protection Act. The Trump Administration issued executive order E.O. 13800 in May 2017 to enhance cybersecurity for federal networks and critical infrastructure, requiring agencies to manage risks holistically and assist the private sector. The Obama Administration issued executive orders E.O. 13694 and E.O. 13757 to impose sanctions on individuals and entities involved in malicious cyber activities, including interference with election processes. Five entities and four individuals were added to the U.S. Department of the Treasury's SDN List. The executive order established the first sanctions program for overseas individuals engaging in destructive cyber activities. It declares \"significant malicious cyber-enabled activities\" a \"national emergency\" and allows sanctions on foreign entities involved in illicit cyber activity. The Obama Administration also issued Executive Order 13691 to enhance cybersecurity information sharing among private sector entities. The Obama Administration established initiatives like ISAOs and the Cyber Threat Intelligence Integration Center to enhance cybersecurity information sharing and analysis on foreign cybersecurity threats affecting national interests. The Obama Administration issued executive order E.O. 13636 in February 2013 to improve cybersecurity of U.S. critical infrastructure through voluntary efforts involving federal agencies and private sector owners. Some see it as a necessary step in securing vital assets against cyber threats, while others fear it could lead to increased government regulation. During the 114th Congress, the House and Senate held numerous hearings on cybersecurity issues, focusing on topics such as cybercrime, critical infrastructure vulnerabilities, and federal cybersecurity programs. Key committees involved included Homeland Security, Oversight and Government Reform, and Armed Services. During the 114th Congress, hearings were held on cybersecurity issues including cybercrime, critical infrastructure vulnerabilities, federal cybersecurity programs, and the Internet of Things."
