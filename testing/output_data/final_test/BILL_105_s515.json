    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Liability Reform for Volunteer Services Act\" and its purpose is outlined in the findings and purposes section. Congress finds that the litigious nature of the legal profession in the US creates barriers to individuals helping others, with lawsuits and damage awards hindering volunteerism and charitable service by increasing liability insurance costs for volunteers and organizations. Volunteer service organizations in the US are facing adverse effects due to the fear of lawsuits, leading to a decline in volunteerism. This is impacting essential services such as crisis counseling, rescue services, sports coaching, and support for the elderly. Clarifying and limiting personal liability risks for volunteers is crucial to address this issue. The need for Federal legislation to protect volunteers from lawsuits is crucial due to the national scope of the issue and the reliance on volunteers for various social programs. Encouraging volunteer service organizations is in the interest of the Federal Government as it lacks the capacity to provide all necessary services. The Act aims to provide liability reform for volunteer service organizations to protect volunteers from personal financial liability, promote the free flow of goods and services, and uphold constitutionally protected rights. It also serves to encourage volunteer service organizations to sustain social service programs and benefit taxpayers.
