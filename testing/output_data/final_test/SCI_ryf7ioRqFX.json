    "content": "Recurrent neural networks face the exploding and vanishing gradient problem, especially in tasks with long time scales. A new stochastic algorithm (\\textit{h}-detach) is introduced for LSTM optimization to address this issue by preventing suppression of gradient components crucial for capturing long term dependencies. The \\textit{h}-detach algorithm prevents gradient suppression in LSTM optimization, improving convergence speed, robustness, and generalization on benchmark datasets. LSTM addresses the exploding and vanishing gradient problem in recurrent neural networks, crucial for capturing long term dependencies in sequential data. RNN architectures like LSTM and GRU address optimization difficulties in tasks with long-term dependencies by introducing linear temporal paths for gradient flow. LSTMs are widely used for capturing long-term dependencies in sequential data. LSTMs are widely used for tasks involving long-term dependencies, such as the copying problem and sequential MNIST. The computational graph of a typical LSTM shows a linear temporal path for gradient flow and the stochastic process of blocking gradients during back-propagation. The goal of the paper is to introduce a simple approach called h-detach. The paper introduces a simple trick specific to LSTM optimization to improve training on tasks with long term dependencies. By analyzing the back-propagation gradient equation for LSTM parameters, it is shown that large weights suppress gradients through the linear temporal path, which carries information about long term dependencies. To address this issue, a stochastic algorithm is introduced to scale individual gradient components and prevent suppression. The paper introduces a stochastic algorithm called h-detach to prevent gradient suppression through the h-state of LSTM, improving convergence and generalization on various tasks. It addresses the issue of gradient flow over many time steps in LSTM optimization. The LSTM equations involve gates f t , i t , o t , and g t, with c t and h t representing cell state and hidden state. A linear recursive relation exists between cell states c t, aiding gradient flow over long time scales. Other components in the LSTM computational graph contribute polynomial terms in weight matrices, causing gradient magnitude imbalances. The LSTM equations involve gates f t, i t, o t, and g t, with c t and h t representing cell state and hidden state. A linear recursive relation exists between cell states c t, aiding gradient flow over long time scales. The back-propagation equations for LSTM network reveal a problem in composition due to imbalance in gradient magnitudes caused by polynomial terms in weight matrices. The LSTM gradient faces a problem when weights are large, causing imbalance in gradient magnitudes between cell state path (A t) and other paths (B t). The cell state path is crucial for smooth gradient flow over time and carries long term dependency information. A simple fix is proposed to address this issue. The LSTM gradient imbalance issue with large weights is addressed by manipulating gradient components through the cell state path (A t) to prevent suppression. Algorithm 1 introduces a trick to block gradients independently with a tunable hyper-parameter. The loss function at each time step t is a function of h t without detachment. The gradient components arising from B t get dampened by stochastically blocking gradients through the h t states of an LSTM with probability 1 \u2212 p. This reduces the amount of computation needed when training LSTMs with h-detach. Training LSTMs with h-detach reduces computation by blocking gradients through hidden states, aiding in back-propagation. The task involves memorizing and outputting inputs after a delay, requiring long-term dependency capture. Using a copying task setup similar to BID0, 100,000 training pairs and 5,000 validation pairs are sampled. An LSTM with hidden state size 128 is trained for 500-600 epochs using cross-entropy loss and ADAM optimizer with batch-size.

Using a copying task setup similar to BID0, 100,000 training pairs and 5,000 validation pairs are sampled. An LSTM with hidden state size 128 is trained for 500-600 epochs using cross-entropy loss and ADAM optimizer with batch-size. Validation accuracy curves during training on copying task show that h-detach leads to faster convergence and achieves \u223c 100% validation accuracy while being more robust to the choice of seed. Plots comparing LSTM training with and without h-detach for time delays of 100 and 300 show that h-detach leads to faster convergence and better performance. Without h-detach, LSTM achieves 82% validation accuracy at best for T=300, while h-detach reaches 100% accuracy. Using h-detach with detach probabilities 0.25 and 0.5 leads to the best performance of 100% and quick convergence, showing robustness to seed choice. The benefit of h-detach in training dynamics is demonstrated. The study extends to the transfer copying task BID9, evaluating LSTM generalization on larger time delays during inference. Results show that LSTM trained with h-detach generalizes better on longer time delays compared to LSTM trained without h-detach. In a sequential MNIST classification task, an LSTM is trained with h-detach. Two versions of the task are considered: one with pixels read in order and one with pixels permuted. The experiment uses 50000 training images, ADAM optimizer with different learning rates, and an LSTM with 100 hidden units. A hyperparameter search is done on the detach probability for h-detach. In a hyperparameter search, a detach probability of 0.25 performed best for both pixel by pixel MNIST and pMNIST tasks. For sequential MNIST, both vanilla LSTM and h-detach training achieved 98.5% accuracy. The method showed faster convergence and robustness to different learning rates. Training LSTM with h-detach in pMNIST resulted in a test accuracy of 92.3%, an improvement over regular LSTM training. The study evaluated h-detach on an image captioning task using an RNN with two models - Show&Tell and 'Show, Attend and Tell'. The models were tested on the Microsoft COCO dataset with 82,783 training images and 40,504 validation images. Feature extraction was done using a pretrained Resnet with 152 layers. The study used a pretrained Resnet with 152 layers for image classification and an LSTM with 512 hidden units for caption generation. Training was done using the ADAM optimizer with a learning rate of 10^-4. A hyperparameter search was conducted to optimize the h-detach parameter, with values tested in the set {0.1, 0.25, 0.4, 0.5}. Training the LSTM with h-detach outperformed the baseline LSTM, producing the best BLEU-1 to BLEU-3 scores among all compared methods. In this section, the effect of removing gradient clipping in LSTM training is studied. Training vanilla LSTM without gradient clipping becomes unstable, while h-detach method remains stable. Validation accuracy curves for both methods on pixel by pixel MNIST using ADAM are shown in FIG2. The study explores the impact of removing gradient clipping in LSTM training. While h-detach method remains stable, blocking gradients through the cell state path leads to poor performance on tasks requiring long term dependencies. Additional experiments on different seeds and learning rates are detailed in figure 8 in the appendix. The experiment investigates the effects of detaching the cell state in LSTM training, showing that gradients through the cell state path are crucial for learning long term dependencies. This is demonstrated in tasks like copying and pixel by pixel MNIST, where detaching the cell state leads to slow learning and poor convergence. The experiment confirms that gradients through the cell state are essential for learning long term dependencies in LSTM models. Prior to LSTM, NARX recurrent networks were popular for such tasks, and more recent designs like GRU have been proposed to address this issue. Other architectures aimed at preventing vanishing gradients can also be found in recent literature. Recent work has focused on preventing vanishing and exploding gradient problems in recurrent networks. Methods such as gradient clipping have been proposed to address these issues. Additionally, there is a line of research on using unitary transition matrices to avoid information loss in hidden states evolution. Various extensions and improvements to unitary RNNs have also been suggested. Furthermore, attention mechanisms and unsupervised auxiliary losses have been proposed to capture long-term dependencies in neural networks. The proposal in this paper adds an unsupervised auxiliary loss to encourage capturing long term dependencies in LSTM optimization. It reduces computation compared to other approaches and shows stability without gradient clipping when using h-detach. Two ways of using h-detach in training stacked LSTMs are discussed. When training stacked LSTMs, h-detach can be used to stochastically block gradient flow through hidden states. This approach dampens gradient components and is easy to implement. Another method to dampen gradients is by directly multiplying with a dampening factor, which is not currently available in auto-differentiation libraries. This strategy does not reduce computation like h-detach. Regularizing the recurrent weight matrices to have small norm can potentially prevent gradient components from being suppressed, but may restrict the model's representational power. Unlike dropout, h-detach randomly blocks gradient components through LSTM hidden states only during the backward pass, without masking hidden units during the forward pass. This method does not change the network's output. Our method, h-detach, blocks gradient components through LSTM hidden states only during the backward pass, preventing suppression of gradients through the cell state path. It improves performance on image captioning tasks by preserving important gradient components. However, it does not show benefits on language modeling tasks. Our method, h-detach, aims to improve LSTM performance on tasks with long term dependencies by reducing computation during training. It is robust to initialization, speeds up LSTM convergence, and enhances generalization on benchmark datasets compared to vanilla LSTM and other methods. The algorithm involves setting specific entries to indicate a delay and delimiter for reproducing input tokens as output.

It involves setting specific entries to indicate a delay and delimiter for reproducing input tokens as output. The target sequence consists of repeated entries of a certain value, followed by the first 10 entries of the input sequence in the same order. The algorithm h-detach improves LSTM performance by reducing computation during training. It involves setting specific entries for reproducing input tokens as output. The formula for z t is recursively proven using A t and B t. A t captures the contribution of the gradient from the cell state c t\u22121. The formula for z t is recursively proven using A t and B t, where \u03be t are i.i.d. Bernoulli random variables with probability p of being 1. Corollary 4 states that E[z t ] = (A t + pB t )(A t\u22121 + pB t\u22121 ) . . . (A 3 + pB 3 )z 2, by taking the expectation and using independence of \u03be t 's."
