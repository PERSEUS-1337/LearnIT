Response personnel who died while assisting in the events of September 11, 2001 are eligible for posthumous citizenship, with specific requirements and waivers outlined in the law. Posthumous citizenship can be granted without the need for demonstrating English language proficiency or knowledge of U.S. history and government. No oath of renunciation or allegiance is required for posthumous citizenship. The investigation and examination process for posthumous citizenship applications follow similar procedures as outlined in the Immigration and Nationality Act. Requests for posthumous citizenship can be filed by the next of kin or a representative within 2 years of the person's death. If approved, the Attorney General will issue a document stating the individual was a U.S. citizen. The United States considers the person a citizen after September 10, 2001, with no benefits under the Immigration and Nationality Act for relatives of the posthumously granted citizenship."
