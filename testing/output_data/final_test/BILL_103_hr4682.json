The Communications Opportunity Act of 1994 requires the Federal Communications Commission to distribute licenses to a variety of applicants, including small businesses, rural telephone companies, and businesses owned by minority groups and women. The Commission must ensure these entities have opportunities to participate in spectrum-based services through measures like tax certificates and bidding preferences. License set-asides and installment payments are also considered. Designated entities, including businesses owned by minority groups and women, face barriers to entering the telecommunications market due to historically low participation and limited access to capital. License set-asides and installment payments are additional policy tools used by the Federal Communications Commission to ensure licenses are disseminated to designated entities. The telecommunications industry faces barriers to entry, hindering diversity and competition. Large corporations' financial advantage limits access to licenses for designated entities, especially minority and women-owned businesses. Without the use of bidding preferences like set-asides, minority and women-owned businesses will struggle to participate in the telecommunications industry. Without the use of bidding preferences like set-asides, minority and women-owned businesses will struggle to participate in the telecommunications industry. SEC. 3. PARTICIPATION BY DESIGNATED ENTITIES. The Commission must ensure small businesses, rural telephone companies, and businesses owned by minority groups and women participate in spectrum-based services through licenses controlled by them. If competitive bidding is used for 3 or more licenses serving a market, at least one license up to 30 megahertz must be reserved for designated entities. If more than 6 licenses are to be granted, at least 2 licenses, one being at least 30 megahertz, must be reserved for designated entities. The Commission must ensure designated entities have bidding preferences for licenses, equalize license opportunities by size and area, and consider access to capital for competitiveness. The Commission should provide incentives for nondesignated entities to invest as minority equity holders in designated entity concerns. Simple regulatory approval processes should be provided for rural areas to encourage voluntary partitioning of licenses. Competitive bidding and bid financing considerations must be carefully evaluated to support designated entities. The Commission aims to reduce barriers for designated entities, offering lower fees, limited initial payments, and installment options. Flexibility in financial requirements for winning designated entities is also emphasized, with a focus on pursuing financing and construction in good faith. The Commission aims to reduce barriers for designated entities in auctions by considering additional methods such as tax certificates. Designated entities should generally follow the same rules as other parties but can request waivers for flexibility if it serves the public interest. They are also allowed to transfer licenses to other designated entities without financial penalties. Designated entities can transfer licenses to other designated entities without penalties. If a non-designated entity buys a controlling interest in a license, they must pay the government the remaining spectrum bid balance immediately. Additionally, they must pay the price difference between the initial bid amount and the market price for the license within 3 years, based on similar bids in the market. The Commission will establish a formula for this calculation, considering any bidding credits."
