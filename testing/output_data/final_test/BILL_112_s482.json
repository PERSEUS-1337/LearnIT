    "content": "The \"Energy Tax Prevention Act of 2011\" prohibits the regulation of emissions of greenhouse gases under Title III of the Clean Air Act. The \"Energy Tax Prevention Act of 2011\" defines greenhouse gases and limits the Administrator from regulating or taking action on their emissions to address climate change. The \"Energy Tax Prevention Act of 2011\" excludes greenhouse gases from the definition of air pollutants, except for purposes other than climate change. It also allows for specific exceptions, such as the implementation of certain vehicle emission standards. The proposed rule addresses greenhouse gas emissions standards for medium- and heavy-duty engines and vehicles, implementation and enforcement of various sections related to climate change, and specific exceptions under title VI for class I or class II substances. The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 state that greenhouse gases are not subject to certain air quality regulations. Specific rules and actions related to greenhouse gases are repealed, including the 'Mandatory Reporting of Greenhouse Gases' and 'Endangerment and Cause or Contribute Findings for Greenhouse Gases'. The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 exempt greenhouse gases from certain air quality regulations. Specific rules and actions related to greenhouse gases have been repealed, including the 'Mandatory Reporting of Greenhouse Gases' and 'Endangerment and Cause or Contribute Findings for Greenhouse Gases'. Additionally, there have been publications and memorandums regarding the interpretation of regulations determining pollutants covered by Clean Air Act permitting programs and the Prevention of Significant Deterioration and Title V Greenhouse Gas Tailoring Rule. The 'Title V Greenhouse Gas Tailoring Rule' was published in 2010 along with actions to ensure authority to issue permits under the Prevention of Significant Deterioration Program for sources of greenhouse gas emissions. Actions were taken in 2010 to ensure authority to issue permits under the Prevention of Significant Deterioration Program for sources of greenhouse gas emissions and to implement Title V permitting programs under the Greenhouse Gas Tailoring Rule. Additionally, determinations were made regarding error correction, partial approval, partial disapproval, and a Federal Implementation Plan for the Texas Prevention of Significant Deterioration Program. Actions were taken in 2010 to ensure authority to issue permits under the Prevention of Significant Deterioration Program for sources of greenhouse gas emissions and to implement Title V permitting programs under the Greenhouse Gas Tailoring Rule. Additionally, determinations were made regarding error correction, partial approval, partial disapproval, and a Federal Implementation Plan for the Texas Prevention of Significant Deterioration Program. Federal actions before the enactment of this section that apply stationary source permitting requirements are also addressed. The section does not limit a State's authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions, except for specific provisions that are not federally enforceable or considered part of Federal law. The term 'provision' in the plan or program refers to any part that limits greenhouse gas emissions to address climate change. The Administrator cannot approve any provision in a permit program under title V that limits greenhouse gas emissions to address climate change. The Clean Air Act is amended to prohibit waivers for greenhouse gas emissions standards for new motor vehicles and engines starting from model year 2017. The Administrator cannot waive this requirement."
