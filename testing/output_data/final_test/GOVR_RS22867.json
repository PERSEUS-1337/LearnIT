    "content": "The Senate's earmark disclosure rules aim to increase transparency in congressionally directed spending. Senate Rule XLIV requires a complete list of earmarks and the requesting Senator's name to be available on a public website 48 hours before a vote. Any additional earmarks proposed in floor amendments must be printed in the Congressional Record promptly. The Senate's earmark disclosure rules require items to be printed in the Congressional Record promptly. Rule XLIV defines congressionally directed spending item, limited tax benefit, and limited tariff benefit. A congressionally directed spending item is a provision primarily at a Senator's request for specific spending authority. Limited tax benefit is a revenue provision providing tax benefits to specific beneficiaries under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The Senate's earmark disclosure rules apply to congressional earmarks in bills, committee reports, conference reports, and joint explanatory statements. The rules cover items in authorizing legislation, appropriations legislation, and tax measures, including both reported and unreported measures. Earmark certification requirements must be met to avoid a point of order against consideration of the measure or conference report. Floor amendments are exempt from this point of order. The Senate's earmark disclosure rules apply to congressional earmarks in bills, committee reports, conference reports, and joint explanatory statements, including unreported measures, amendments, House bills, and conference reports. Senators requesting earmarks must provide specific details and certifications to the committee of jurisdiction. When submitting earmark requests, committees and subcommittees may have additional administrative requirements beyond Senate rules, such as prioritizing requests or submitting forms electronically. The Senate Appropriations Committee requires Members to post earmark request information on their personal website, including the purpose and value of the earmark. Committees may also establish policy requirements or restrictions, like matching funds or limitations on certain appropriations accounts. Deadlines are common for earmark requests in appropriations legislation. When submitting earmark requests, it is important to check with committees for any additional requirements or restrictions. The committee of jurisdiction is responsible for identifying earmarks in the legislative text and accompanying reports. Senators should specify if they want the earmark in the bill text or committee report, as there may be policy implications. Executive Order 13457 from January 2008 may also impact earmark placement. Under Executive Order 13457, executive agencies are directed not to use funds from earmarks included in non-statutory language like committee reports. Senators proposing earmark amendments must disclose earmarks in the Congressional Record. Senate committees have three main responsibilities regarding earmarks: determining earmarks, compiling requests, and certifying Rule XLIV compliance. Committees have discretion in defining earmarks. The Senate Appropriations Committee has rules for earmark disclosure, requiring lists of earmarks and sponsors to be publicly available for 48 hours before consideration. Earmarks must be searchable on a congressional website, and committees have discretion in defining earmarks. The Senate rules require committee reports with earmarks and sponsors to be available online before consideration. The committee chair or majority leader must certify compliance with disclosure requirements before a measure can be considered. Certification is typically done through a statement on the Senate floor or a written statement in the Congressional Record."
