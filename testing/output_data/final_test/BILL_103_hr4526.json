    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Children's Equal Protection Act of 1994\". The Congress finds that complaints of assault or abuse of children during custody proceedings are often not pursued criminally, leading to further harm for alleged child victims. Family courts may not have the jurisdiction or resources to investigate these complaints adequately. This failure to address complaints places children at risk of harm, highlighting the need for full criminal investigation and prosecution skills to protect child victims. The Supreme Court's interpretation of the Fourteenth Amendment to the US Constitution highlights the unequal enforcement of laws, especially criminal laws against assault, battery, and torture on children. Failure to address complaints of abuse during custody proceedings puts child victims at risk and violates their right to equal protection under the law. SEC. 3. RIGHT TO PROTECTION; DUTY TO INTERVENE. The Revised Statutes of the United States are amended to include section 1979A, emphasizing the right to protection and duty to intervene. The statutes of any State or territory must investigate and prosecute complaints of assault, abuse, or harassment without considering the victim's age. States must also investigate and prosecute complaints against child victims with the same urgency as adult victims. The identity of child victims must be protected in any investigation and prosecution. Failure to provide protection or intervention to a citizen can result in liability. Protection and intervention must be provided regardless of custody. Failure to comply with this section will result in the inability to receive Federal grants for law enforcement purposes as specified by Congress. An injured party under section 1979A can seek relief from the court, which may include injunctive relief, restraining orders, and monetary damages, but not punitive damages. The court's granting of relief does not prevent criminal prosecution. Judgments from such actions may be considered by the Department of Justice. The court may not abstain from hearing a case under section 1979B until State court proceedings are completed or State remedies are exhausted, unless the defendant proves with clear evidence that delaying Federal proceedings will not harm the injured party. The court has discretion to review all factual issues de novo and is not bound by res judicata or collateral estoppel doctrines, except for final criminal convictions. The injured party, a guardian ad litem, a class of affected individuals, the Attorney General of the United States, or the attorney general of a State, commonwealth, territory may bring an action under section 1979B. The court may allow the prevailing party in such actions a reasonable attorney's fee."
