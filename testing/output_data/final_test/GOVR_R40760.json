    "content": "Since 1789, Congress has grappled with how to judge its members. In 1964, the Senate formed the Select Committee on Ethics, while the House established the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct in 1967, later renamed the Committee on Ethics. These committees investigate allegations of wrongdoing by members of their respective chambers. The House Committee on Ethics investigates and recommends discipline for Members, facing challenges due to interdependence among Members and public scrutiny. Congress has periodically updated ethics codes and considered creating an independent ethics advisory body since 1951. Since 1951, there have been proposals to establish an independent ethics advisory body to assist or replace the House Committee on Ethics. In the 110th Congress, the Office of Congressional Ethics (OCE) was created to review complaints independently and refer valid findings to the Committee on Ethics. The OCE aims to ensure the integrity of the House by investigating alleged misconduct and supplementing the role of the Committee on Ethics. It allows groups and individuals to report misconduct by Members, officers, and employees of the House. The OCE officially began operating on January 23, 2009. The Office of Congressional Ethics (OCE) was established on January 23, 2009, with rules for investigations and a code of conduct. It has jurisdiction over current House Members, officers, and employees. The House ethics process has faced criticism for being perceived as reluctant to investigate and discipline colleagues. Calls for additional investigative mechanisms were made until 2008 due to this perception. Proposals have been made to establish investigative and enforcement mechanisms to supplement or replace ethics committees in Congress. Suggestions include creating an office of public integrity, an independent ethics commission, or a public review board composed of former Members of Congress, retired judges, or private citizens. This is seen as a way to strengthen Congress by having a panel of senior statesmen investigate allegations of wrongdoing by Members of Congress. Harvard professor Dennis Thompson advocates for an independent body like an ethics commission to counter the conflict of interest in Members judging Members, as it could provide more objective and independent judgments. An independent entity to investigate complaints in Congress has been proposed since 1951, aiming to enhance accountability and restore public confidence. Various legislative proposals were introduced between 1951 and 1996, including creating a bicameral independent ethics panel. Senate hearings in 1951 discussed a Commission on Ethics in Government, while in 1993, a proposal for a Joint panel was considered. In 1951, Senator J. William Fulbright introduced a resolution to create a congressional commission to establish higher moral standards in government. A special subcommittee chaired by Senator Paul Douglas held hearings on the establishment of a Commission on Ethics in Government in 1951. Senator Douglas emphasized the need for ethical standards in government during hearings in June and July of 1951. He proposed the creation of a Commission on Ethics in Government to investigate and report to the President. The subcommittee endorsed the passage of S.Con.Res. 21 and recommended establishing the Commission through a joint resolution of Congress. The Commission on Ethics in Government proposed by Senator Douglas aims to investigate and report on the moral standards of official conduct in the Federal Government and recommend measures to improve them. It will also assess the impact of moral standards on business and political activities related to the government. The subcommittee recommended creating a commission to address ethics issues in public affairs, along with amendments to the Administrative Procedure Act and mandatory disclosure of income and assets by Members of Congress. S.Con.Res. 21 was not further debated, but in 1993, hearings were held on the congressional ethics process. The joint committee's final report summarized differing opinions on the role of an independent ethics entity in enforcing congressional rules of conduct. Some witnesses advocated for non-members to investigate charges and recommend punishment, while others preferred ethics proceedings to be conducted only by members. Representative Robert Andrews supported an external ethics commission, emphasizing that ultimately, ordinary citizens are the true peers in ethical review. The joint committee's final report summarized differing opinions on the role of an independent ethics entity in enforcing congressional rules of conduct. Former Senator Warren Rudman believed that ethics proceedings should be conducted only by members. Representative Louis Stokes was against further procedural reforms, stating that the Ethics Committee has done its job properly. The House members recommended allowing the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct to use a panel of non-members in ethics cases. No further action was taken on the proposed ethics reforms. Prior to the passage of H.Res. 895 in the 110th Congress, various proposals were considered to create an independent ethics commission. Various proposals were considered between 1988 and 2007 to create an independent ethics entity in the House, but none progressed beyond introduction. In 2007, a Special Task Force on Ethics Enforcement was created by the Speaker of the House and the minority leader, leading to the introduction of H.Res. 895 (110th Congress) and the establishment of the Office of Congressional Ethics. In 2007, a Special Task Force on Ethics Enforcement was established in the House of Representatives to investigate Members, officers, and staff and provide information to the House Committee on Ethics. Chaired by Representative Michael Capuano, the task force considered creating an outside enforcement entity and met 29 times in executive session over eight months. This initiative was part of Speaker Nancy Pelosi's focus on ethics reform in the 110th Congress. The Special Task Force on Ethics Enforcement was established in the House of Representatives in 2007 as part of Speaker Nancy Pelosi's ethics reform initiative. Public support for reform was high, with a focus on creating an independent entity to monitor ethics violations. Ranking Member Lamar Smith discussed the need for an independent ethics entity in the House, considering both positive and negative aspects. Proposals for an independent ethics commission were examined, with concerns about maintaining checks and balances within the system. The task force heard from four witnesses, three in favor of an independent ethics entity and one who was opposed. Testifying in favor were Tom Fitton, Meredith McGehee, and Fred Wertheimer, who believe creating an independent investigative entity would end conflicts of interest in judging colleagues. Tom Fitton stated the House ethics process needs reform for upholding rules of conduct. Don Wolfensberger, director of the Congress Project at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, argued against an independent ethics entity, stating that only House members have the institutional sense, instincts, and legitimacy to properly exercise the power to punish members for actions that would bring the body into disrepute. Mr. Wolfensberger suggested strengthening the House ethics process by keeping the full committee informed of complaints, allowing the full committee to decide on creating investigative subcommittees, prohibiting agreements with respondents, sending reports to the House if no violation is found, and granting the committee authority to issue reprovals. Representative Capuano received a letter signed by 27 members after the hearing. Following a hearing, Representative Capuano received a letter signed by 27 House Democrats urging the ethics task force to address structural flaws in the current enforcement process. They propose revamping the ethics process to include greater independence, especially in the investigatory phase, to prevent past issues and ensure integrity without constitutional concerns. The final determination of ethical misconduct would still be the responsibility of members, as required by the constitution. This proposal aligns with practices in many state legislatures, where effective safeguards have been implemented to deter abuse of the ethics process. The Special Task Force on Ethics Enforcement issued its final report in December 2007, recommending the creation of an independent Office of Congressional Ethics within the House to investigate misconduct allegations. Only Democratic members signed the report, while Republicans chose not to comment. The proposed six-member entity would review possible violations of House rules, acting as an origination point for independent reviews but not preventing the Standards Committee from accepting complaints. The Special Task Force on Ethics Enforcement recommended the creation of an independent Office of Congressional Ethics within the House to investigate misconduct allegations. The task force suggested hiring a nonpartisan professional staff, prohibiting current House Members and lobbyists from serving on the panel, and allowing the OCE to conduct preliminary reviews before referring matters to the Committee on Standards. The Committee on Standards would then have a specified timeframe to consider the issues. Representative Capuano introduced H.Res. 895 in coordination with the task force's report recommending an independent ethics entity. The Committee on Rules reported H.Res. 1031, recommending adoption of H.Res. 895 with amendments. The amendments to H.Res. 895 were considered as adopted, making 13 changes to the original text. The House debated and agreed to H.Res. 1031, which provided for the adoption of H.Res. 895 with amendments. Representative Capuano highlighted the passage of H.Res. 895 as a significant step in strengthening ethics enforcement in the House. Leader Boehner emphasized the importance of the Office of Congressional Ethics (OCE) in improving the House's reputation and breaking the 'old boy network' image. The OCE's independence and transparency, with no current members of Congress serving on the panel and public statements required for reviewed matters, aim to restore public confidence. The OCE began implementing structural requirements in January 2009 and was reauthorized by the House in January 2019. The Office of Congressional Ethics (OCE) was established as part of the rules package adopted by the 116th Congress on January 3, 2019. It is structured to be nonpartisan and consists of six members and two alternates appointed by the Speaker and minority leader. Members may serve for two Congresses and vacancies are filled by the most senior. The Office of Congressional Ethics (OCE) board members are appointed by the Speaker and minority leader. Vacancies are filled by the most senior alternate nominated by the same congressional leader. If a replacement is not named within 90 days, the alternate continues to serve. The Speaker and minority leader can remove a board member for cause. The membership structure incentivizes consultation between the Speaker and minority leader. The nominations result in de facto appointments to the board. In the 116th Congress, board members of the Office of Congressional Ethics are not limited by term restrictions. Before starting their term, members must sign a document agreeing not to run for Congress and disclose information. The Clerk of the House retains these documents, makes them public, and publishes them in the Congressional Record. The document on the Clerk's website states that board members of the Office of Congressional Ethics must agree not to run for Congress for at least 3 years after leaving their position. They must also sign an oath to keep information confidential. The board is led by a chair and a co-chair designated by the Speaker. The board of the Office of Congressional Ethics is led by a chair designated by the Speaker and a co-chair designated by the minority leader. Board members must have exceptional qualifications in various fields and are selected without regard to political affiliation. Restrictions are in place to prevent individuals with certain lobbying or foreign agent ties from serving on the board. The Office of Congressional Ethics board members, including former Members, officers, and employees of the House, are subject to restrictions on political and outside activities to maintain independence. Board members receive remuneration for their service, equivalent to the daily pay rate of GS-15 employees, to conduct investigations efficiently within a short timeframe. The board members of the Office of Congressional Ethics receive pay for their service and have the authority to hire staff. Staff members are restricted from engaging in partisan political activities and must execute an oath before employment. Termination of staff requires an affirmative vote from at least four board members. The Office of Congressional Ethics requires staff to take an oath to maintain confidentiality and impartiality during investigations. Staff must disclose any conflicts of interest, and if deemed necessary, can be terminated from an investigation. The OCE has specific powers to conduct investigations, hold hearings, pay witnesses, and adopt rules. The Office of Congressional Ethics has the power to conduct independent investigations into allegations of misconduct against Members, officers, and staff of the House. Investigations are limited to activities after March 11, 2008, and any violations of laws or standards of conduct. In the 114th Congress, changes were made to OCE's investigations with the adoption of H.Res. 5. The OCE, authorized to investigate misconduct allegations, must inform individuals of their right to counsel without penalty. It is prohibited from denying any constitutional rights. Meetings, hearings, and evidence collection are allowed, but evidence obtained illegally cannot be reviewed. Submitters must affirm legality of evidence. The OCE rules require affirmation that evidence was legally obtained, allow for written comments from witnesses, prohibit consideration of privileged evidence without a waiver, authorize payment to witnesses, and prescribe rules for termination of reviews and communication protocols. The OCE rules include prohibition of ex parte communications, a code of conduct for board members and staff, procedures to prevent unauthorized disclosure of information, and confidentiality of testimony and information obtained. Breaches in confidentiality are to be investigated by the board. The OCE rules establish procedures for investigating misconduct allegations against House Members, officers, and employees. Individuals under investigation have the right to present a statement to the board. The investigatory process includes four steps: submission of information, preliminary review, second-phase review, and referral to the Committee on Ethics. The OCE operates independently and refers matters to the Committee on Ethics when necessary. The Office of Congressional Ethics (OCE) has procedures for the public to report wrongdoing, including providing information on its website. Submissions should include the person's information, the subject of the allegation, dates of alleged conduct, a statement of facts, laws violated, potential witnesses, and relevant documents. The Office of Congressional Ethics (OCE) has procedures for the public to report wrongdoing, including providing information on its website. Submissions should include the person's information, the subject of the allegation, dates of alleged conduct, a statement of facts, laws violated, potential witnesses, relevant documents, and a signed declaration acknowledging the False Statement Act. Information will be reviewed by the OCE, but submitting it does not trigger an investigation. The decision to investigate lies with the Board, requiring at least two members to concur after a preliminary review. The preliminary review process by the Board requires a reasonable basis to believe an allegation, concurrence of two board members, and notification to the Committee on Ethics and the individual under review. The review must be completed within 30 calendar or 5 legislative days, with a vote to continue based on probable cause by at least three board members. The board requires a vote of at least three members to proceed to a second-phase review. If no decision is made within the specified time frame, the investigation is terminated. The board can also vote to end an investigation with at least four members. Regardless of the outcome, the board must inform the Committee on Ethics and the individual under investigation. If the inquiry is terminated, a report can be sent to the Committee on Ethics. If a second-phase review is conducted, it must be completed within a set timeframe. The board can extend the time for a second-phase review by 14 days with a majority vote. Individuals under review have the right to be represented by counsel. The board must send a written report with findings and documentation to the Committee on Ethics after completing the second-phase review. The report should include recommendations for dismissal, further inquiry, or a tie vote, without making conclusions on guilt. The Office of Congressional Ethics (OCE) is responsible for investigating allegations and transmitting findings to the Committee on Ethics. The findings should include facts, recommendations for subpoenas, and relevant laws, but not names of witnesses or conclusions on guilt. The OCE can provide supporting documents to the subject of the investigation. The OCE provides the subject of the investigation with a copy of the written report. Once a Member leaves office, any inquiry or investigation against them will cease. The OCE submits findings and documentation to the Committee on Ethics for final disposition. The Committee on Ethics can open an investigation without an OCE referral. The Committee on Ethics can open an investigation without an OCE referral, but there are specific rules to follow. The committee must act within 45 days of receiving a referral from the OCE and may choose to withhold information for an additional 45 days. They are not required to release OCE findings if they dismiss a case, but they can choose to make the report public. The Committee on Ethics must release OCE findings and reports at the end of each Congress, unless an investigation is initiated. If the committee deadlocks on a matter referred by the OCE, the report and findings must be released. Investigations are conducted according to established rules, and action may be deferred at the request of law enforcement. Before releasing OCE findings, the committee must provide advanced notice. The committee must give advanced notice to the OCE and individuals involved in a referral. The Committee on Ethics and OCE are to collaborate closely. If the committee initiates an investigation, the OCE must refer the case to the committee. If the committee does not reach a conclusion, the OCE board must be notified. The OCE may refer allegations to the Office when appropriate. The OCE may refer allegations to various entities such as the Office of Congressional Workplace Rights, House Office of the Inspector General, House Commission on Congressional Mail Standards, and state and federal authorities as per OCE Rule 13. Referrals are based on the nature of the allegations, such as violations of Congressional Accountability Act laws, fraud, waste, abuse in House operations, or misuse of the franking privilege. Additionally, the OCE staff can refer information to state and federal authorities in cases of imminent harm or threats to public safety. The Office of Congressional Ethics (OCE) is authorized to use funds from House accounts as needed. Payments are approved by the board chair and House Administration Committee. The OCE issues quarterly reports summarizing its activities and board actions. It has considered cases since 2009, with a summary provided in Table 5. The Office of Congressional Ethics (OCE) has considered cases between 2009 and 2018, changing the relationship between the public and the House ethics process. Options exist to clarify OCE's relationship with the public, House Members, and the Committee on Ethics, each with advantages and disadvantages. Careful comparison of these options is necessary to ensure an effective process while enforcing House ethics procedures. OCE exists pursuant to H.Res. 895 (110th Congress) and faces renewal biannually as part of the House rules package. The Office of Congressional Ethics (OCE) was reauthorized in January 2019 as part of the House rules package. To ensure its continuation, the House could create a permanent statutory ethics entity, which would not require reauthorization each Congress. This would require the concurrence of the Senate and the President's signature. Prior to the OCE's creation, public complaints against Members of Congress were not allowed by the Committee on Ethics. The House could amend rules to allow the Committee on Ethics to receive public complaints directly, addressing constitutional concerns over involving an independent entity. This would involve establishing mechanisms for intake and evaluation of citizen complaints before potential action by the committee. The Committee on Ethics may see an increase in workload if it assumes responsibility for handling public complaints directly. The relationship between the Office of Congressional Ethics (OCE) and the Committee on Ethics is evolving, with the OCE forwarding reports to the committee for further investigation as needed. Providing the public with direct access to the Committee on Ethics could result in more information being shared and expectations for updates on investigations. The House could grant limited subpoena power to the OCE to enhance investigations before referral to the Committee on Ethics, potentially reducing workload and preventing duplicative efforts. Chairman Capuano considered empowering the OCE with subpoena power but decided against it due to concerns about timeliness and potential complications in the investigative process. The House could grant limited subpoena power to the OCE to enhance investigations before referral to the Committee on Ethics, potentially reducing workload and preventing duplicative efforts. Currently, the OCE has no recourse to follow a case once it is referred to the committee. Representative Ron Paul introduced H.Res. 216 on March 5, 2009, to address this issue. H.Res. 216, introduced by Ron Paul, aimed to amend House Rules to require a waiting period between introducing legislation and voting. It would allow citizens to petition the Office of Congressional Ethics to investigate violations. This would expand the OCE's jurisdiction and involve public complaints in House matters. The OCE's authority to take complaints from the public may need clarification. An amendment to reassign OCE's functions to the House Ethics Committee was proposed for the 115th Congress. This would create a new Office of Congressional Complaint Review within the Ethics Committee, altering the review process and prohibiting anonymous information use. The House may find the current OCE and Ethics Committee relationship effective. The House may find the current relationship between the OCE and the Committee on Ethics effective, suggesting that changes could be made as needed through House resolutions or subsequent Congress rules packages."
