    "content": "The Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) Program is the largest employer-sponsored health insurance program in the country, providing over $40 billion in benefits annually to federal employees and retirees. Participation is voluntary, with about 85% of employees and 90% of retirees choosing to participate. The program is governed by Title 5, Chapter 89 of the United States Code, which specifies cost-sharing between the government and participants. The Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) Program covers 72% of the weighted average premium of all plans, up to 75% of any individual plan's premium. The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) administers the program, contracting with health insurance carriers and managing contingency reserve funds. Eligible enrollees include federal employees, retirees, and their dependents. New federal employees have 60 days to enroll in an FEHB plan. Enrollees in the Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) Program can choose individual or family coverage, with a self plus one option available starting in 2016. Part-time workers may have to pay a larger share of premiums than full-time employees. Certain temporary and seasonal workers are also eligible for coverage. Active federal employees have a limited enrollment period from February 1 to February 29, 2016, to switch to self plus one coverage. Members of Congress and certain staff no longer receive health benefits through FEHB. Members of Congress and certain staff no longer receive health benefits through FEHB as a benefit of their employment but may be eligible to enroll in FEHB in retirement. They must enroll in a health plan offered through DC SHOP to remain eligible for an employer contribution toward their coverage. Eligible dependent family members include a spouse, children under 26, and qualified disabled children aged 26 or older. Under the Civil Service Retirement Spouse Equity Act of 1984, certain former spouses of federal employees, former employees, and retirees may qualify to enroll in FEHB. To be eligible for FEHB in retirement, an individual must be entitled to retire on an immediate annuity under a retirement system for civilian employees and have been continuously enrolled under FEHB for the five years before the annuity starts. The five-year requirement can also be met by coverage under TRICARE. Federal employee reservists called to active duty for more than 30 days can keep their FEHB coverage for up to 24 months. Eligible Indian tribes and organizations have been able to enroll in FEHB since May 1, 2012. Since May 1, 2012, eligible Indian tribes, tribal organizations, and urban Indian organizations can purchase FEHB for their tribal employees, paying the government's share of the premium. Coverage is only for employees and dependents, not retirees. Temporary Continuation of Coverage (TCC) allows individuals to continue FEHB after a qualifying event, similar to COBRA in the private sector. TCC enrollees can choose any FEHB plan and pay the full premium. FEHB enrollees can change plans during open season by paying the full premium plus a 2% administrative charge. TCC coverage is available for separating employees and their families for up to 18 months. Children aging out of their parent's plan and former spouses can continue TCC for up to 36 months. Enrollees choose from over 250 health plans offered by carriers, with limited choices depending on their location. Plans fall into fee-for-service (FFS) or health maintenance organizations (HMOs) categories. The Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) program offers over 250 health plans through various carriers, including fee-for-service (FFS) and health maintenance organizations (HMOs). The most popular insurance carrier in FEHB is Blue Cross and Blue Shield (BCBS), offering nationwide FFS plans and local HMOs. Enrollees can enroll or change plans during annual open season periods, with options to switch based on factors like existing coverage. Special enrollment periods are available for qualifying life events like marriage. Plan details can be found on OPM's website. Enrollees in the FEHB program can choose between FFS plans and HMOs based on factors like preferred providers and location. FFS plans offer more flexibility with out-of-network providers but come with higher out-of-pocket costs. FEHB offers around 15 nationally available FFS plans, including BCBS Standard and Basic Options. Many FFS plans in the FEHB program have a PPO option for discounted charges, while HMOs are limited to specific geographic areas. Enrollees must use providers within the HMO network for coverage. Eligibility for HMO enrollment depends on location. Enrollment in an HMO depends on location. FEHB insurance carriers offer CDHPs and HDHPs, which can be nationally or locally available. These plans are combined with tax-advantaged accounts like HRAs or HSAs to help save for future healthcare expenses. Enrollees in these plans have higher cost sharing to control costs. Enrollees in health plans with tax-advantaged accounts have higher cost sharing but lower premiums. They have flexibility in spending their healthcare dollars, such as using contributions to cover expenses like eyeglasses. CDHPs and HDHPs allow for out-of-network providers but may result in higher costs. These plans offer full coverage for preventive care at no cost to the enrollee. CDHPs offer full coverage for in-network preventive care and flexibility for enrollees in spending on their health care. Enrollees can use providers outside the network but at a higher cost. CDHPs have annual limits on out-of-pocket expenses and are often combined with HRAs, which have non-taxable employer contributions. Unused HRA balances can be carried over to the next year. OPM has defined the structure of an HDHP with specific deductibles for self-only and family coverage. Enrollees must meet these deductibles before coverage kicks in, except for preventive care within the network. Some HDHPs only cover services within the network. OPM also sets annual out-of-pocket limits at $6,550 for self-only and $13,100 for family coverage. Unused HRA balances can be carried over, but are forfeited when an enrollee leaves the plan. HDHPs have specific deductibles for self-only and family coverage, with out-of-pocket limits set at $6,550 and $13,100 respectively in 2016. Enrollees can pair HDHPs with an HSA, which allows tax-deductible contributions from both the enrollee and the health plan, up to annual limits adjusted by the IRS. Unused funds in the HSA can be carried over each year. Federal employees enrolled in the Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) program have the option to set up a Health Savings Account (HSA) paired with a High Deductible Health Plan (HDHP). Unused funds in the HSA can be carried over each year tax-free. FEHB enrollment is dominated by Blue Cross Blue Shield (BCBS), with about 67% of policyholders enrolled in this carrier. Carriers contract with the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) after submitting benefit and rate proposals in response to OPM's annual call letter in March. Additionally, federal employees can opt for a Flexible Spending Account (FSA) through the Federal Flexible Spending Account Program (FSAFEDS) to cover out-of-pocket healthcare expenses. The Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) program allows federal employees to enroll in a Health Savings Account (HSA) with a High Deductible Health Plan (HDHP). Employees can also participate in the Flexible Spending Account Program (FSAFEDS) to pay for health care expenses on a pretax basis, including options for supplemental dental and vision coverage through the Federal Employees Dental and Vision Program (FEDVIP). FSAs offered include the Health Care FSA (HCFSA), Limited Expense Health Care FSA (LEX HCFSA), and Dependent Care FSA (DCFSA) for child or adult dependent care expenses. Retirees are not eligible for FSAs. Since 2007, those eligible for FEHB can enroll in FEDVIP for supplemental dental and vision insurance. Health insurance carriers like BCBS offer multiple health plans with different features and premiums. Premiums are the cost of enrollment in the health plan, shared between the government and employees/retirees. Employees can pay their share of premiums on a pretax basis through payroll deduction. Premium costs are the same for retirees and employees, except USPS employees. No government contribution to FSAs, which are voluntary and funded by employee's pretax salary for child or adult dependent care expenses. The government shares costs of health insurance premiums with employees or retirees, with the government's share set at 72% of the weighted average premium. Premiums vary based on self or family coverage, and are negotiated differently for FFS and HMO plans by OPM. Profit paid to plans by OPM is calculated based on contractor performance, contract cost-risk factors, federal socioeconomic programs, capital investments, and cost control measures. OPM monitors plan performance and evaluates data throughout the year to determine profit. Profit paid to plans by OPM is determined by various factors such as contractor performance, cost control measures, and development of administrative systems. For community-rated plans, OPM negotiates capitation rates with HMOs based on comparable rates in the community. HMOs calculate their rates using factors like age and sex, and negotiate contracts with OPM in August for the upcoming plan year. OPM negotiates capitation rates with HMOs based on community rates in the spring for the upcoming plan year. Adjustments are made if there are changes between rate estimation and plan implementation in January. HMOs may receive higher profit rates than FFS plans under FEHB. Deductibles, co-payments, and coinsurance amounts vary among health plans, with lower costs for using in-network services. FEHB plans have varying benefits and cost-sharing, with OPM relying on statutory requirements and potentially setting additional ones during contract negotiations. OPM establishes requirements during contract negotiations with plans participating in the FEHB Program. All plans must cover basic services like hospital, surgical, physician, and emergency care, as well as prescription drugs and mental health parity. Optional benefits include applied behavior analysis for children with autism. Cost sharing includes co-payments, coinsurance, and deductibles for enrollees. Cost-sharing in health plans includes co-payments, coinsurance, and deductibles. Deductibles are an annual amount that must be paid before the plan covers services, but they may not apply to all services. Once out-of-pocket limits are reached, the plan pays 100% of covered expenses. Preventive services outlined in the ACA are exempt from cost sharing requirements. Plans must also include cost-containment provisions in their annual proposals. The Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) program includes cost-containment provisions in annual proposals submitted to OPM. Funding for FEHB comes from discretionary and mandatory spending. OPM maintains a contingency reserve fund for unexpected cost increases and incurs administrative expenses. The government contribution for FEHB enrollees is set by statute. The government share of an enrollee's FEHB premium is determined based on their employment status - employee, retiree, or USPS employee/retiree. The agency pays the government share for employees from its appropriations, classified as discretionary spending. OPM covers the government share for non-postal retirees through mandatory spending. The government contribution is capped at 75% for non-postal employees and retirees, while it is negotiated for postal employees through collective bargaining. OPM maintains contingency reserve funds for all FEHB plans, funded by premiums. FFS plans can use reserves to offset unexpected spending or premium increases. Reserves are maintained differently for FFS and HMO plans. OPM maintains contingency reserve funds for all FEHB plans, funded by premiums. FFS plans can use reserves to offset unexpected spending or premium increases. Reserves can be drawn down and used to offset a premium increase in the subsequent year. For HMO plans, OPM charges up to 3% of their premium to establish and maintain contingency reserves, which can only be used by OPM with approval during an annual reconciliation process. OPM employs about 117 full-time equivalent employees responsible for FEHB administration. OPM charges a fee to cover administrative costs for FEHB plans, limited to 1% of the premium. There is no separate accounting for agency personnel costs related to program administration. USPS has unique arrangements for health care benefits contributions. The USPS has unique arrangements for health care benefits contributions, with employees having collective bargaining rights for compensation and benefits. The Postal Reorganization Act of 1970 mandates that fringe benefits, including health insurance, be at least as favorable as in 1970. USPS generally pays a larger share of employees' health insurance premiums compared to other federal agencies. The USPS contribution rates for health care premiums will decrease in the coming years under current agreements with unions and management associations. The Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act requires the USPS to prefund retiree health care costs, with an annual payment of over $5 billion. The Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act (PAEA) requires the USPS to pay over $5 billion annually from FY2007 to FY2016 for retiree health care costs. The USPS has defaulted on these payments in recent years, leading to proposals in Congress to change how health benefits are provided to retirees and employees. Federal retirees and employees aged 65 or older have the option to enroll in Medicare in addition to their FEHB coverage. Most FEHB enrollees aged 65 or older are entitled to Medicare Part A due to paying Medicare payroll taxes. They are automatically enrolled when eligible, with no premiums for Part A coverage. Participation in Medicare Parts B and D is voluntary, with a monthly premium required. Enrollees who do not sign up initially may face penalties later on. Those covered by an FEHB plan can delay enrollment until retirement without penalties. Upon retirement, individuals must enroll in Medicare Part B to avoid late-enrollment penalties. FEHB plans offer comparable prescription drug coverage to Medicare Part D. FEHB enrollees eligible for Medicare can opt for a Medicare Advantage Plan, suspending FEHB coverage to enroll in Part C with the option to reenroll in FEHB during open season. When a retiree enrolled in Medicare also has coverage under FEHB, Medicare is the primary payer and FEHB is the secondary payer. FEHB may cover an enrollee's Medicare deductibles and coinsurance for care covered by both programs. For retirees over 65 without Medicare Part A or Part B, FEHB is the primary payer. If an individual has Part A but not Part B, FEHB is the primary payer for Part B services. FEHB is the primary payer for Part A services, paying based on Medicare rates. Benefit payments for hospital services are equivalent to Medicare rates, while payments for physician services are based on Medicare Part B rates or actual billed charges. Approximately 1.2 million FEHB enrollees are affected by these payment policies. Approximately 1.2 million FEHB retirees aged 65 and older had Medicare coverage in FY2013. The proportion of retirees with coverage in both Medicare Part A and Part B has declined over time, with rates varying depending on whether they receive benefits through a FFS plan or an HMO. In FY2013, about 56% of retirees in an HMO plan had coverage under both parts, while roughly 86% of those in a FFS plan had dual coverage. Coverage rates for Medicare Part A and Part B have declined over time for FEHB retirees, with rates varying between FFS and HMO plans. Efforts have been made to encourage enrollment in Part B to reduce FEHB spending, including cost-sharing reductions and legislative measures. The ACA passed in 2010 with provisions affecting health coverage for USPS retirees in Part B. Many ACA requirements were already met by FEHB plans, such as coverage for preexisting conditions. Uncertainty remains on how ACA provisions like the Cadillac tax and employer mandate will impact FEHB plans. The employer mandate under the ACA could lead to penalties for FEHB if full-time federal workers receive subsidies for health insurance on the exchange. The requirement will apply to large firms with 100 or more employees in 2015 and those with 50 or more employees in 2016. OPM has issued guidance on implementing ACA provisions, expanding the scope in some cases. For instance, FEHB plans were directed to eliminate annual limits on essential health benefits starting in 2013, a year earlier than required by the ACA. The Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) Program is administered by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) in accordance with the statute and its implementing regulations. OPM has broad authority to implement regulations, contract with plans, establish benefits, and administer the program. OPM, federal agencies, and health insurance carriers each have defined roles in FEHB. OPM administers the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program, overseeing plan negotiations, open enrollment periods, information dissemination, sanctions on providers, and financing. OPM also supervises health insurance activities for retirees, determining eligibility, enrollment status, premium deductions, and credits. OPM oversees the automatic deduction of premiums from monthly annuity checks, processes enrollment changes, and notifies carriers of changes. OPM enters into annual contracts with carriers each spring after sending a call letter outlining negotiation goals and procedures. The call letter includes changes in services and discourages certain services. OPM reviews proposals for rates for fee-for-service plans, considering factors like cost of services, managed care initiatives, and health care utilization patterns. Negotiations with plans result in specific terms for the next contract year, including covered and excluded services. Brochures are printed with benefits and costs according to OPM's format. An open season is announced in early November. During an open season in early November, OPM provides a guide to personnel offices and retirees detailing features and premiums of participating health plans. Enrollee satisfaction surveys and plan information are included. Personal advice is not given, but OPM's website offers guidance on plan selection. Employees obtain OPM's general guide and plan brochures from their personnel office, while retirees contact carriers for detailed information. Plan details can also be found on OPM's website. OPM's annual cycle of activities regarding plan contracts includes distributing call letters, receiving plan responses, negotiating contracts, distributing guides and brochures, holding open season, and reconciling HMO premiums. Federal agencies manage FEHB participation for employees following OPM procedures, administering open seasons, adjusting coverage and payroll withholding, and handling premium payments. OPM oversees premium payments, government share allocation, and documentation for FEHB plans. Carriers handle claims, enrollment, and financial data, while also assuming insurance risk. Contracts with FEHB plans last at least one year and may renew automatically. Contracts with FEHB plans last at least one year and may renew automatically. OPM may terminate a carrier's contract if they did not have 300 or more enrolled employees and retirees in the preceding two contract terms. Plans must offer temporary extension of coverage and an option to convert to a nongroup contract without proof of good health. Discontinued plans can reenter after three contract years. FEHB plans must be licensed to sell group health insurance under state law in every area they operate. HMOs must have a quality-assurance program and credentialing process. FEHB plans must have a quality-assurance program and credential participating providers. Plans must submit state licenses to participate in FEHB and inform OPM of any license issues. Plans with 500+ subscribers must conduct CAHPS surveys to evaluate member satisfaction. OPM sets CAHPS requirements for health plans, including submitting survey results and quality-assurance reports. HMOs with over 500 enrollees must complete HEDIS measures for clinical performance. OPM reviews plans for access to quality medical care. OPM ensures quality medical care by overseeing primary and specialty physicians in individual and group practice settings. They also handle administrative responsibilities like data warehousing and enforcing laws. OPM analysts use de-identified data for analytics, including health trends and risk-adjustment methodologies. Personal data may be used for congressional inquiries, legal proceedings, and law enforcement investigations. Plan brochures detail grievance procedures for coverage denials, with a 30-day window for plan response and the option to appeal to OPM. OPM allows enrollees to appeal coverage denials within 90 days. If OPM rules in favor of the enrollee, the plan must cover the care. Sanctions like debarment and civil penalties can be imposed on providers. Contract terms override state laws, but OPM mandates HMOs to offer state benefits to FEHB enrollees. OPM can override state-mandated benefits if it's in the best interest of federal enrollees."
