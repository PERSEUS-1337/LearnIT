The term 'serious' in relation to adverse experiences with dietary supplements includes events such as death, life-threatening conditions, hospitalization, disability, birth defects, and pregnancy complications. The Secretary may require postmarket surveillance for a dietary supplement if serious adverse health consequences are possible. If a supplement is believed to be adulterated, the manufacturer may be ordered to demonstrate its safety. The manufacturer of a dietary supplement may need to demonstrate its safety if it is believed to be adulterated. The supplement is not considered adulterated during the review process by the Secretary, unless there is an imminent hazard to public health.
