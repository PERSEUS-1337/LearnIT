    "content": "The 115th Congress prioritizes tax reform, focusing on reducing tax brackets and eliminating the AMT. A tax reform blueprint by Republicans proposes consolidating seven brackets into three. Previous legislation also aimed to reduce brackets and repeal the AMT. Tax reform debates often center on statutory rates, but they provide limited information on tax burden and economic incentives. The report highlights the importance of looking beyond statutory tax rates when evaluating tax reform proposals. It discusses average tax rates and effective marginal tax rates using data from the 2010 IRS Statistics of Income individual public use file. The file contains 159,791 records representing 142.9 million individual income tax returns filed. The report focuses on federal individual income tax returns filed using the TAXSIM model to calculate average tax rates and effective marginal tax rates. It excludes payroll taxes, corporate income taxes, excise taxes, estate taxes, and state tax liability. Around 44% of tax units are expected to have zero or negative income tax liability in 2016. In 2016, 18% of tax units are projected to have no income or payroll tax liability. The report analyzes three types of tax rates: statutory, average, and effective marginal tax rates, and how they vary across the income distribution. The data is based on IRS SOI public use file, focusing on individuals and households who filed income tax returns. The report analyzes tax rates across income distribution, focusing on average and effective marginal tax rates. It discusses the implications for tax reform and the differences between statutory, average, and effective marginal tax rates. The report analyzes tax rates across income distribution, focusing on average and effective marginal rates. It includes statistics and a case study to illustrate the differences between statutory, average, and effective marginal tax rates for taxpayers at different income levels. The federal income tax system is progressive, with higher tax rates applied at higher income levels. Tax brackets determine the tax rate applied to taxable income within each range. Most tax returns fall into lower tax brackets. In 2014, 43% of tax returns were in the non-taxed or 10% tax bracket, accounting for 9% of all adjusted gross income (AGI). Less than 1% of returns were in the top tax bracket, but they contributed 16% of all AGI. 29% of taxable income at the marginal rate was taxed at 39.6%, with the remaining income taxed at lower rates due to the progressive tax structure. In 2010, the top statutory tax rate was 35%, which increased to 39.6% after the American Taxpayer Relief Act. Few returns fell into the top rate bracket, but the highest income taxpayers may face higher average and effective marginal tax rates. Average tax rate is calculated as income tax liability divided by cash income. Payroll taxes are not included in the analysis. The tax system in 2010 had a progressive nature with various tax preference items, resulting in average tax rates lower than statutory rates for most taxpayers. Refundable tax credits like the EITC could lead to negative average tax rates, especially for lower-income taxpayers. In that year, taxpayers in the bottom four income deciles had negative average tax rates. Average tax rates vary across income levels, with taxpayers in the top decile facing a mean rate of 13.6% and those in the top 1% facing 19.8% in 2010. Despite a statutory rate of 35%, actual average tax rates for high-income earners were lower. Overall, average tax rates for the U.S. income tax system fluctuated between 10% and 16% from 1960 to 2016. The U.S. income tax system's average tax rate fluctuated between 10% and 16% from 1960 to 2016. The highest average tax rate was before the 1986 tax reform and the early 2000s tax cuts. In the 2000s, average tax rates were lower than historical averages, but began increasing in 2009. By 2016, average tax rates approached pre-1986 levels. Effective marginal tax rates impact work and savings decisions, influencing the attractiveness of non-taxable compensation. Effective marginal tax rates are influenced by a taxpayer's statutory tax bracket and interactions with other tax provisions. These rates are calculated using the NBER's TAXSIM program and do not include payroll taxes or benefit reductions from other programs. Phase-ins and phaseouts of tax provisions can affect a taxpayer's effective marginal tax rate, such as the earned income tax credit. The earned income tax credit (EITC) can impact a taxpayer's effective marginal tax rate based on their earnings level. In 2016, for an unmarried taxpayer with one child, the EITC reduced the effective marginal tax rate by 34% in the phase-in range, up to $9,920 of earnings. However, in the phaseout range starting at $18,190, the EITC increased the effective marginal tax rate by 15.98% for every dollar earned beyond that until $39,296. This illustrates how the EITC can lead to negative average and effective marginal tax rates for lower-income taxpayers. Effective marginal tax rates tend to rise with income, with taxpayers in the first two income deciles facing negative rates due to the EITC phase-in range. The top income decile faces a 28.5% rate, reflecting the progressive nature of the tax system. Marginal rates are higher than average rates, and phaseouts for higher-income taxpayers increase progressivity. There is variation in rates within income groups. When analyzing average marginal tax rates, it is important to differentiate between taxpayer-weighted and earnings-weighted averages. Taxpayer-weighted statistics average the marginal tax rates paid by each taxpayer, while earnings-weighted statistics weight each return by reported earnings. Earnings-weighted measures tend to be higher due to more income reported in higher tax brackets. Mean average tax rates in Figure 2 and Figure 4 are taxpayer-weighted, but earnings-weighted measures are typically higher. In 2010, 46% of taxpayers faced effective marginal tax rates different from their statutory rates. Average tax rates increase across income groups, while effective marginal tax rates are higher for many low- and middle-income earners. Family composition also impacts tax burden. Effective marginal tax rates can be higher for low- and middle-income taxpayers, especially those with children, compared to higher-income taxpayers. Family composition plays a significant role in determining average tax rates within income groups. Statutory tax rates may not accurately reflect taxes paid on additional earnings or overall tax burden. In 2010, 46% of taxpayers had effective marginal tax rates different from their statutory rates, with 54% having the same rate, 29% higher, and 16% lower. The reasons for these differences are further discussed. In 2010, taxpayers in different tax brackets faced varying effective marginal tax rates compared to their statutory rates. Those in the 28% and 33% brackets often had higher effective marginal rates, while those in the 35% bracket had rates lower than their statutory rate. Many taxpayers with low or no income experienced negative effective marginal tax rates. The differences between effective marginal and statutory rates were significant, especially in lower tax brackets. In 2010, taxpayers in different tax brackets faced varying effective marginal tax rates compared to their statutory rates. Approximately 41% of taxpayers in the 10% bracket had an effective marginal tax rate higher than their statutory rate. The differences in rates were more substantial in lower tax brackets, with some taxpayers facing rates at least 5 or 10 percentage points higher than their statutory rate. Taxpayers in higher brackets also faced effective marginal rates above their statutory rate, but the difference was smaller. In 2010, taxpayers in the 28% and 33% brackets often had effective marginal tax rates higher than their statutory rates. Nearly 10% in the 28% bracket faced rates at least 5 points higher, while less than 1% faced rates at least 10 points higher. For most taxpayers, average tax rates are 5-10 points lower than statutory rates. In 2010, taxpayers in the 25% bracket had an average tax rate of 15% or less, while those in the 35% bracket had an average tax rate of 25% or less. The U.S. individual income tax system is complex with provisions like the earned income tax credit (EITC) and child tax credit (CTC) affecting effective marginal tax rates. In 2010, the EITC reduced effective marginal tax rates by 40 percentage points for married couples with two children earning up to $12,590. The EITC phased out at a rate of 21.06%, causing tax rates to rise for incomes between $16,450 and $40,363. The child tax credit provided a refundable credit of up to $1,000 per qualifying child for families with earnings of at least $3,000, phased in at a rate of 15%. The Child Tax Credit (CTC) provides a credit of up to $1,000 per qualifying child, phased in at 15%. It phases out at 5% for joint filers with incomes above $110,000. The CTC decreases effective marginal tax rates for lower brackets but increases for higher brackets. Phaseouts for the EITC and CTC target lower to middle income distributions. In 2010, the Making Work Pay Credit increased effective marginal tax rates for taxpayers in the 25% and 28% brackets, providing up to $400 for single filers and $800 for married couples. The Child Tax Credit (CTC) provides up to $1,000 per qualifying child, phased out at 15% for joint filers above $110,000. The credit phases out at 2% of income for single filers above $95,000 and for married couples above $190,000. The phaseout range for the alternative minimum tax (AMT) starts at $150,000 for joint filers and $112,500 for single filers in 2010. In 2010, the phaseout for the alternative minimum tax (AMT) started at $150,000 for joint filers and $112,500 for single filers. The exemption amount is phased out at a rate of 25%, resulting in effective AMT rates of 32.5% and 35%. The AMT explains why many taxpayers in the top tax brackets face effective marginal tax rates higher than their statutory rates. Effective marginal tax rates can vary due to phased-in refundable tax credits and the alternative minimum tax (AMT), with a top effective rate of 28%. Approximately 45% of tax filers in the top tax bracket have a marginal effective tax rate lower than the statutory rate. In 2010, less than 1% of taxpayers in the top bracket faced an effective marginal tax rate of 30% or less. Policy changes can cause fluctuations in effective marginal tax rates. In 2010, policy changes affected effective marginal tax rates, with provisions like the making work pay tax credit, personal exemption phaseout (PEP), and limitation on itemized deductions (Pease) impacting higher-income taxpayers. PEP reduces personal exemptions based on income thresholds, while Pease limits deductions based on income levels. These provisions were repealed for 2010, thus not affecting the effective marginal tax rates in that year. The Pease limitation increases tax liability by $0.03 for each dollar of earnings, raising effective marginal tax rates by 3%. There is variation in average tax rates within income groups, with some higher-income taxpayers facing lower average tax rates than lower-income taxpayers. For example, taxpayers in the 90th percentile of the 4th income decile had an average tax rate of 5.6% in 2010, while those in the 10th percentile of the 9th income decile had a rate of 3.6%. Higher income taxpayers have average tax rates lower than some lower-income taxpayers. Median average tax rates increase across income groups, showing the progressive nature of the income tax system. Tax rates vary within income groups, with the widest dispersion among lower-income taxpayers due to family composition affecting refundable credits. Dispersion decreases as credits phase out, then rises towards the top of the income distribution. Effective marginal tax rates also vary within income deciles. Tax rates within income deciles vary, with negative effective marginal tax rates for lower-income taxpayers due to refundable tax credits. The median effective marginal tax rate remains at 15% for the middle income distribution. Some middle-income taxpayers face higher effective marginal tax rates than those with higher incomes. The effective marginal tax rates vary within income deciles, with negative rates for lower-income taxpayers due to refundable tax credits. Family composition plays a significant role in explaining the variation in tax rates across income levels. Figure 8 shows average tax rates for different family types, with 80% of tax filers falling into one of six categories in 2010. In 2010, tax filers in the top income decile faced varying average tax rates based on family type. Low- and moderate-income taxpayers saw reduced variation in tax rates when controlling for family type, but this was less true at the top income levels. For example, tax filers in the 10th percentile of the top income decile had an average tax rate of 3.8%, while those in the 90th percentile faced a rate of 23.3%. The distribution of average tax rates for single and married filers in the top income decile appeared similar, despite differences in income levels. In the top income decile, average tax rates vary based on family type. Head of household taxpayers see decreasing rates across lower income deciles before increasing, reflecting family-related tax benefits. Married filers with two children have higher median average tax rates in the 10th decile compared to other married filers. The 10th income decile varies based on family type, with higher starting values for married filers with two dependents. Effective marginal tax rates show more variation for taxpayers with children compared to those without, driven by eligibility for family-related tax benefits. Effective marginal tax rates for taxpayers with children tend to rise initially, then decline as incomes increase before increasing again at the top of the income distribution. Tax credit phaseouts result in higher effective marginal tax rates for lower income taxpayers with children compared to higher income counterparts. Differences in tax rates between households with and without children diminish at the top of the income distribution due to phaseouts of tax benefits for families with children. In analyzing tax policy, understanding the differences between statutory, average, and effective marginal tax rates is crucial for assessing equity and efficiency. Statutory rates offer limited information on tax burdens, while average rates provide a better picture. Effective marginal rates, which often differ from statutory rates, reveal the incentives created by the tax system. Therefore, discussions on tax policy typically focus on average rates, especially in progressive tax systems where rates increase with income. In a progressive tax system, average tax rates rise with income, reflecting vertical equity. Despite a 35% top statutory rate in 2010, the top 1% income group had an average tax rate of 19.8%. Variations in average tax rates within income groups exist due to tax code features like exemptions and credits. Horizontal equity efforts may lead to differing average tax rates for taxpayers with similar incomes. Horizontal equity in the tax system aims for fairness by ensuring similar tax burdens for taxpayers with equal income levels. Adjusting for family composition can reduce variations in tax burden across income levels, especially for lower and middle-income families. However, at higher income levels, tax rates tend to be more similar regardless of family type. Marginal tax rates vary based on income distribution, highlighting the importance of where a taxpayer falls on the income scale. Horizontal equity in the tax system aims for fairness by ensuring similar tax burdens for taxpayers with equal income levels. Marginal tax rates can impact taxpayers' work decisions, with higher rates potentially reducing labor supply. Empirical evidence suggests that increases in marginal tax rates lead to a small decrease in hours worked. Analysis of taxpayer behavior shows that effective marginal tax rates can influence decisions such as changes in labor supply or compensation form. Taxes are known to distort behavior, leading taxpayers to make different choices than they would without taxes. Effective marginal tax rates are seen as a measure of the efficiency cost of taxation. The efficiency cost of taxation is measured by effective marginal tax rates, which can influence taxpayer behavior. A tax system with low statutory rates but high effective marginal rates may cause more distortions. Complexity and lack of transparency in the current system make it difficult for taxpayers to understand the economic incentives created by the tax code. Policymakers may aim to simplify the tax system to make it fairer and more efficient. Complexity in the tax system arises from defining taxable income and various tax incentives. This complexity can impact taxpayer behavior due to high effective marginal tax rates. The individual income tax system is complex due to various social and economic issues, temporary tax provisions, and frequent policy changes. Simplifying the system by consolidating tax brackets alone may not be effective. Evaluations of equity should consider differences in tax burdens across and within income groups. There is substantial variation in tax burdens within income groups under the current system, prompting policymakers to consider if this variation is desirable. The current tax system has variations in tax burdens within income groups, prompting policymakers to consider if these variations are desirable for equity and efficiency objectives. Low effective marginal tax rates are more efficient in promoting economic activity compared to low statutory rates. However, phaseouts of tax benefits can result in marginal tax rates exceeding statutory rates, creating a tradeoff between equity and efficiency goals. Policymakers should consider the marginal tax rate effects of phaseouts for low- and moderate-income taxpayers. The primary goal of taxation is to raise revenue, but the individual income tax is also used for social and regulatory objectives. Refundable tax credits can enhance progressivity but may require higher rates elsewhere in the system, which could distort taxpayer behavior. The need to raise revenues can limit the tax code's ability to achieve other policy objectives. The 2010 IRS SOI public use file contains data on individual income tax returns filed in 2010, with a focus on the 2010 tax year. It includes 159,791 records representing 138.3 million returns after dropping records from previous tax years. This data is used to analyze the extent to which the tax code can be used to achieve other policy objectives. In 2010, IRS SOI public use file data shows that 45.1% of returns were filed by single taxpayers, 38.0% by married filers filing jointly, and the rest using other filing statuses. Most returns reported an AGI of less than $40,000 (57.6%) or less than $100,000 (87.1%). The top statutory tax rate in 2010 was 35%, with less than 1% of returns taxed at this rate, accounting for 14% of AGI. The top tax rate was 35% in 2010, affecting less than 1% of taxpayers. It increased to 39.6% in 2014. Changes in the top rate would impact a larger proportion of income. The 2010 tax code had provisions like the making work pay tax credit and first-time homebuyer tax credit, which phased out for higher-income taxpayers. The Pease itemized deduction limit and the personal exemption phaseout (PEP) raised effective marginal tax rates for higher-income taxpayers under current law, which were not in effect in 2010. Appendix B contains supplemental tables and data to support the analysis in the report, including information on income levels and distribution of effective marginal tax rates within statutory tax brackets. The final two figures in Appendix B, Figure B-1 and Figure B-2, show income decile break points for all taxpayers, not specific family types as in Figure 8 and Figure 9."
