    "content": "SECTION 1. CREDIT FOR CERTAIN EMPLOYER-PROVIDED RETIREE HEALTH CARE COVERAGE. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to include a new section on employer-provided retiree health care coverage. The new section on employer-provided retiree health care coverage allows eligible employers to claim a credit of 10% of qualified retiree health care expenses paid during the taxable year. Eligible employers are those eligible for a deduction under section 199 or have at least 50% of gross receipts from activities within the United States as domestic production gross receipts. Qualified retiree health care expenses are defined as amounts paid by an eligible employer for coverage for retired employees aged 55 to 65 who are not covered by Medicare. The term \"employee\" excludes those defined in section 401(c)(1). For qualified retiree health care coverage, the value must exceed that of a standard option with a preferred provider organization under title 5, United States Code. Rules similar to section 52 apply, and no double benefits are allowed for these expenses. The deduction for qualified retiree health care expenses under subsection (a) is reduced by the credit allowed under subsection (a) for the same taxable year. Taxpayers must elect to apply this section for each taxable year, and it does not apply to premiums paid after December 31, 2009. The credit is considered part of the general business credit. The Internal Revenue Code is amended to include a retiree health care coverage credit under section 45N. The credit can be used against the Alternative Minimum Tax and allows for a 10-year carryback and unlimited carryforward. The retiree health care coverage credit under section 45N allows for a 10-year carryback and unlimited carryforward. Amendments to the Internal Revenue Code include applying the credit separately from the business credit and making adjustments to the timeframes for utilizing the credit. The retiree health care coverage credit under section 45N allows for a 10-year carryback and unlimited carryforward. Amendments to the Internal Revenue Code include inserting a new section 45N(h) and updating the table of sections for subpart D of part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1. The amendments made by this section apply to amounts paid or incurred in taxable years beginning after the enactment of this Act."
