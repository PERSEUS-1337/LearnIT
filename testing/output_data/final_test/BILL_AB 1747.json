    "title": "AB 1747",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature aims to increase college graduation rates and reduce economic hardship for low-income Californians. A new section in the Education Code requires postsecondary institutions in participating counties to apply as food vendors for the Restaurant Meals Program and provide information to on-campus vendors. The section requires on-campus food vendors approved for the Restaurant Meals Program to be annually informed about the program. It does not mandate institutions to manage an EBT system for vendors. Vendors and counties must meet program requirements. Section 18904.3 of the Welfare and Institutions Code is amended to allow private nonprofit organizations, public postsecondary educational institutions, or other state or local agencies to receive federal reimbursement for CalFresh outreach activities. Any reduction in federal funding due to audits will be applied to the appropriate local government. Section 18995 is also amended. On January 1, 2012, the State Department of Social Services established the State Emergency Food Assistance Program (SEFAP) to provide food and funding for emergency food distribution to low-income households through food banks. The State Emergency Food Assistance Program Account was created to receive federal funds and donations for this purpose. All moneys received by the State Emergency Food Assistance Program Account shall be allocated to the State Department of Social Services for the purchase, storage, and transportation of food grown or produced in California, with storage and transportation expenditures not exceeding 10 percent of the SEFAP fund\u2019s annual budget. The State Emergency Food Assistance Program Account funds are allocated to the State Department of Social Services for SEFAP, including administrative costs. The Public Higher Education Pantry Assistance Program Account is established in the Emergency Food Assistance Program Fund. The Public Higher Education Pantry Assistance Program Account funds are allocated to the State Department of Social Services for food banks serving low-income households and supporting on-campus pantry efforts for low-income students. Section 18995 of the Welfare and Institutions Code is amended accordingly. On January 1, 2017, the State Emergency Food Assistance Program (SEFAP) will be renamed the \"CalFood Program\" under Section 18995 of the Welfare and Institutions Code. The program will provide food and funding for emergency food to food banks serving low-income households. The CalFood Account will receive federal funds and donations for this purpose. All funds received by the CalFood Account will be allocated to the State Department of Social Services for the CalFood Program, with a limit of 10% for storage and transportation expenses. The CalFood Account funds will be allocated to the State Department of Social Services for the CalFood Program, with a portion used for administrative costs. The Public Higher Education Pantry Assistance Program Account is established in the Emergency Food Assistance Program Fund for food banks meeting specific criteria. The food bank distributes food to low-income households and incurs costs for on-campus pantry and hunger relief efforts for low-income students. The bill includes amendments to the Welfare and Institutions Code, contingent on certain conditions. If the act mandates costs to the state, reimbursement will be provided to local agencies and school districts."
