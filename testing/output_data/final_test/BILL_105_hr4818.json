    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Asset-Building for Working Americans Act.\" The Congress acknowledges that existing resource limitations in public assistance programs may discourage working families from building long-term assets to escape poverty. Adjusting these limitations to disregard savings from earned income tax credits can help low-income families access temporary assistance while working towards financial stability. Adjusting limitations to disregard savings from earned income tax credits for 12 months can help working families build long-term security through assets while still receiving temporary public assistance. 33% of US households, and 60% of African-American households, have no financial assets. Additionally, 46.9% of children in the US live in households with no financial assets. SEC. 3 proposes a 12-month disregard of payments of Earned Income Tax Credit under the program of block grants to states for Temporary Assistance for Needy Families.
