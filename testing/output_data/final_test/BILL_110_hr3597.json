The Congress acknowledges the crisis in the American healthcare system, with an estimated 44,000 to 98,000 deaths annually due to medical errors. The shortage of Registered Nurses (RNs) is a significant factor compromising patient safety, as low nurse staffing levels contribute to a quarter of hospital patient deaths and injuries. The nursing shortage is projected to worsen, with a predicted shortfall of over one million nurses by 2020. The nursing shortage is projected to worsen, with a predicted shortfall of over one million nurses by 2020. More registered nurses must be educated to meet the demanding needs of the future, especially as 78 million baby boomers age and require additional health care services. The constraints in nursing education programs have intensified over the last nine years. Enrollment and Graduations in Baccalaureate and Graduate Programs in Nursing, U.S. nursing schools turned away 42,866 qualified applicants in 2006 due to various constraints. Graduations increased by 18 percent from 2005 to 2006 in entry-level baccalaureate nursing programs, but this does not meet the demand. Congress provided Capitation Grants to nursing schools from 1971 to 1978 based on student enrollment. The Nurse Training Acts of 1971 and 1975 increased enrollments in nursing schools and helped address nursing shortages. A 2006 report by the National League for Nursing highlighted a growing number of unfilled nurse faculty positions across the country. SEC. 3. NURSING EDUCATION.
