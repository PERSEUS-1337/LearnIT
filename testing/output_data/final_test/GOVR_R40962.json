    "content": "Congressional office spending is a topic of interest to various groups and scholars. It is often discussed in relation to financial accountability among elected officials and has been examined by watchdog organizations. Factors influencing spending include Member tenure, casework levels, geography, unexpected events, and the congressional calendar. Members have flexibility in how they use their office allowances to support their duties. Members of the House of Representatives must operate within restrictions and regulations when using their Members' Representational Allowance (MRA) for official duties. Various committees and sources provide guidelines on allowable expenses, including the Franking Commission and House Ethics Manual. The MRA, authorized in 1996, replaced multiple allowances for Members' spending. It aimed to increase flexibility and accountability in office operations. The report provides a history of the MRA and recent spending patterns, showing variations across offices and time. Further examination of additional Congresses is needed for a complete picture. The consolidation of allowances for Members' spending was authorized by the House Administration in 1996. The FY1996 Legislative Branch Appropriations Act combined separate appropriations into the \"Members' Representational Allowances\" to simplify accounting practices. Subsequent legislation in 1996 further defined the MRA and made it subject to regulations and adjustments by the Committee on House Administration. Additional provisions in the FY2000 Legislative Branch Appropriations Act amended language regarding official mail. Since its establishment, appropriations acts funding the legislative branch have included a provision requiring unused amounts in the Members' Representational Allowances (MRA) to be used for deficit reduction or to reduce the federal debt. This provision has been included in legislative branch appropriations bills since FY2002, sometimes added by amendment in previous years. Numerous bills and resolutions have been introduced to address the Members' Representational Allowances (MRA), falling into three major categories: changing procedures, governing unexpended balances for deficit reduction, and limiting overall MRA growth. Amendments related to MRA have also been offered to legislative branch appropriations bills. Several amendments related to the Members' Representational Allowance (MRA) were offered to various legislative branch appropriations bills, with some being agreed to by voice vote and others failing by recorded vote. Several amendments related to the Members' Representational Allowance (MRA) were offered to legislative branch appropriations bills. One amendment prohibited paid advertisements on non-official internet sites, but was not agreed to. Another amendment limited funds for leasing vehicles to $1,000 per month and was approved. Additional amendments proposing MRA restrictions failed. Funding for Members is provided annually under \"Members' Representational Allowances\" within the House account \"Salaries and Expenses.\" The House authorizes individual Members' Representational Allowances (MRAs) for each session of Congress, regulated by the Committee on House Administration. The total authorized level for all MRAs may exceed the total appropriation due to spend-out projections. The total authorized level for all MRAs may exceed the total appropriation due to spend-out projections. The frugality of Members is already factored into the bill, reducing the need for funds and contributing to lower federal spending and deficit. If fully funded, the Members' Representational Allowance would require an additional $27 million, making it underfunded by almost 7%. The Members' Representational Allowance (MRA) funding levels have been discussed in various House reports and hearings. Late-arriving bills can be paid for up to two years after the end of the MRA year, but expenses must be charged to the allowance available at the time they were incurred. The MRA is funded through the \"Salaries and Expenses\" account in the legislative branch appropriations bills, with a peak funding level of $660.0 million in FY2010, which was reduced to $613.1 million in FY2011. The Members' Representational Allowance (MRA) funding level peaked at $660.0 million in FY2010, decreased to $613.1 million in FY2011, and further decreased to $573.9 million in FY2012. The funding level for FY2012 was continued in FY2013 without sequestration or rescission. Subsequent years saw slight increases, with the FY2017 bill recommending an increase to $562.6 million, which was enacted in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017. The FY2019 MRA funding level of $573.6 million represents a 2.0% increase from FY2018. This funding is separate from an allowance for interns in Member offices. The MRA is the largest category of appropriations within the House of Representatives. The MRA is the largest category of appropriations in the House of Representatives, comprising about 50% of House appropriations. Each Member's MRA is determined by the Committee on House Administration based on personnel, office expenses, and official mail components. The office expenses include a base amount, mileage allowance, and office space allowance, while the mail component is based on nonbusiness addresses in a Member's district. This results in a single MRA authorization for each Representative to pay for official expenses. In the 112th Congress, the House agreed to reduce the amount authorized for salaries and expenses of Member, committee, and leadership offices in 2011 and 2012. This resulted in a total reduction of 11.08% from 2010 to 2012. Individual authorization levels for 2013 were also reduced by a total of 8.2% due to redistricting and sequestration. For legislative years 2014 to 2017, Member's MRA appropriations levels saw incremental increases, with FY2017 showing the highest increase of +1.5%. A shooting incident in June 2017 during a Congressional Baseball Game practice resulted in injuries to a Member of Congress, two USCP officers, and two members of the public in Alexandria, VA. The shooting incident in Alexandria, VA, impacted the consideration of MRA funding for FY2018. The House approved a $25,000 increase in MRA for Member security. Two amendments related to MRA were offered during consideration of the FY2018 legislative branch appropriations bill. On July 28, 2017, House Sergeant at Arms Paul D. Irving announced that his office would cover future District Office security upgrades previously supported by the MRA. The Committee on House Administration later updated the Members' Congressional Handbook to reflect these changes. The FY2018 budget maintained the MRA at $562.6 million, with a $25,000 increase for Member security expenses. Expenses related to official and representational duties are reimbursable under the MRA, with certain limitations outlined in the Members' Congressional Handbook. The MRA amount for each Member in 2017 was increased by $25,000. Unspent funds from one year cannot be carried over to the next, and there are restrictions on the use of official funds as per House Rule XXIV. \"Dear Colleague\" letters frequently mention the MRA and its regulations. The MRA regulations are often communicated through \"Dear Colleague\" letters from committees and officers, detailing changes in information dissemination, voucher processing, fund usage guidelines, and support for MRA legislation. These letters also address regulations on end-of-year expenses, office space, travel, allowable franking, expenses for events like the Congressional Art Competition, and reminders of prohibited expenses. They explain the impact of new regulations on MRA spending and summarize changes to the Statement of Disbursements. House spending is categorized by standard budget object classes used for the federal government, including personnel compensation, benefits, travel, rent, communications, utilities, printing, reproduction, other services, supplies, materials, transportation, and equipment. Certain costs like salaries of Members and benefits are not included in the MRA disbursement volumes. The MRA does not reflect spending by House officers and legislative branch agencies in support of Member offices. Staff pay ceilings and covered items by an office have changed over time. The Statements of Disbursements for House spending are available on the House of Representatives website, House.gov. Disbursement information for each authorization year may appear in Statements for 12 quarters, allowing for late-arriving bills to be paid up to two years following the end of the MRA year. Late-arriving receipts could be paid through the quarter ending December 31, 2013. Late-arriving bills can be paid up to two years after the MRA year, with most billing occurring during the session or the following quarter. Spending patterns can be better understood by analyzing volumes from subsequent quarters. Congressional districts and Member preferences influence spending priorities, but overall, there is consistency in MRA resource allocation by spending category. The distributional analysis of office-level data shows consistent allocation of MRA resources by spending category across Members and over time. Personnel compensation is the largest expense for Member offices, with similar patterns observed across the House in other spending categories. Office spending as a proportion of total individual authorization is detailed in Table 3, while Figure 3 illustrates aggregate House spending trends. The aggregate data shows that personnel compensation is the largest category of MRA-related expenses."
