Section 3 of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968 is amended to include new subsections regarding action plans for public housing agencies and Indian housing assistance. The Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968 is amended to require public housing agencies to prepare action plans for activities in accordance with specified subsections. This requirement does not apply to qualified public housing agencies or Indian tribes, except under certain conditions. An Indian tribe or tribally designated housing entity must prepare an action plan describing activities to be carried out in a fiscal year to receive grant amounts under the Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act of 1996. This requirement does not apply to recipients of grant amounts under the Act. An action plan must be prepared by an Indian tribe or tribally designated housing entity to receive grant amounts under the Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act of 1996, with a limit of 550 affordable housing units or households receiving rental assistance. This plan should be included in the annual plan for public housing agencies. The action plan must be included in the annual plan for public housing agencies or Indian tribes to receive retroactive funding for affordable housing units or rental assistance under the Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act of 1996. The action plan required for housing and community development assistance applications exceeding $200,000 must describe activities to be carried out in accordance with specific subsections. It should outline intended outreach efforts within the community for public housing agencies, Indian tribes, or recipients of housing assistance. The Secretary will oversee the implementation of annual action plans and may impose penalties for non-compliance by public housing agencies, Indian tribes, and recipients of housing assistance. Penalties could include sanctions for agencies or entities that fail to meet their action plans. The Secretary may impose penalties for non-compliance by public housing agencies, Indian tribes, and recipients of housing assistance, including enforcement actions, withholding future assistance payments, flagging in the Active Partners Performance System, and rejection of further assistance applications until compliance is achieved. Authorization of appropriation is also provided. Authorization of appropriation is provided for necessary funds to carry out the subsection. The amendment under section 2 will take effect after a 90-day period from the enactment of this Act."
