    "content": "The Act titled \"Developing Resources Immediately and Long-Term through Leases on Our Nation's Offshore Waters Act of 2008\" or the \"DRILL NOW Act of 2008\" terminates laws prohibiting the spending of funds for offshore leasing activities and revokes existing presidential withdrawals. The \"DRILL NOW Act of 2008\" revokes all presidential withdrawals of Federal submerged lands on the Outer Continental Shelf for oil and gas leasing, except in cases of national security. It also revokes presidential authority related to leasing, making certain areas available for exploration and production. Section 8 of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act is amended to allow Governors to petition the Secretary for leasing of certain areas for natural gas exploration. Qualified revenues from leases entered into after the enactment of this Act will be payable to the United States. The Secretary can issue leases for oil and gas exploration beyond the state's coastal zone upon receiving a detailed plan from the Governor. The Secretary must promptly approve or deny the petition, with specific requirements for exploration and extraction activities. The Secretary can approve a petition for oil and gas exploration in the coastal zone of a State if legislation supports it. The plan must align with the legislation and not conflict with military operations or national security. The Secretary of the Treasury will deposit qualified revenues as follows: 25% in a Clean and Alternative Energy Fund, 25% in the general fund, 37.5% in a special account for State disbursement, and 6.25% for financial assistance to States under the Land and Water Conservation Fund Act of 1965. The qualified revenues will be deposited as follows: 25% in a Clean and Alternative Energy Fund, 25% in the general fund, 37.5% in a special account for State disbursement, and 6.25% for financial assistance to States under the Land and Water Conservation Fund Act of 1965. Additionally, 6.25 percent will be allocated to a reserve fund for mitigating environmental damage from extraction activities on the outer Continental Shelf within 50 miles of certain coastal zones. The DRILL NOW Act of 2008 states that funds from oil and gas leases in Mississippi or Alabama will be paid to the State if they establish a plan for expenditure of those funds."
