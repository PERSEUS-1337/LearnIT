    "content": "The \"Health Care OverUse Reform Today Act (HealthCOURT Act) of 2011\" may limit recovery in health care lawsuits based on compliance with best practice guidelines. The HealthCOURT Act of 2011 may restrict lawsuit recovery based on adherence to best practice guidelines issued by the Secretary of Health and Human Services. The HealthCOURT Act of 2011 requires organizations to submit guidelines to the agency within 18 months of enactment. The Secretary must establish these guidelines within 2 years and post them on the Department of Health and Human Services website. Maintenance of the guidelines must be done within 4 years. The Secretary must review and update guidelines every 2 years after the enactment of the HealthCOURT Act of 2011. Limitations on damages include restrictions on noneconomic and punitive damages for healthcare lawsuits related to treatment consistent with issued guidelines. The HealthCOURT Act of 2011 requires guidelines for medical treatment to be safe, effective, and appropriate, either through quality review, approval in guidelines, or recognition by qualified experts. These guidelines cannot be introduced as evidence in healthcare lawsuits. The HealthCOURT Act of 2011 prohibits the introduction of guidelines for medical treatment as evidence in healthcare lawsuits, unless previously introduced by the defendant. There is no presumption of negligence if a healthcare provider deviates from these guidelines. States can replace current medical malpractice rules with guidelines compliance as a defense or add additional guidelines alongside existing ones. State grants are provided to create administrative health care tribunals under the Public Health Service Act. The Secretary may award grants to States for the development, implementation, and evaluation of administrative health care tribunals to resolve disputes related to injuries caused by health care providers. States receiving grants must allow parties to have legal representation during tribunal reviews. Prior to submitting any dispute to an administrative health care tribunal, allegations of injuries caused by health care providers must first be reviewed by an expert panel appointed by the State agency responsible for health. The expert panel must consist of at least 3 members, with half being medical experts. Legal representation is allowed during the review process. Each physician or health care professional appointed to an expert panel must be licensed in one or more states and have expertise in treating the condition under review. Panel members must not have any familial conflicts of interest. Panel members appointed to expert panels must not have any familial, financial, or professional relationships with parties involved in the dispute. They should also not have any conflicts of interest with the parties, except for cases where they have staff privileges at the institution where the treatment in question was provided, as long as this affiliation is disclosed and not objected to by either party. In disputes involving treatment, expert panels must consist of medical professionals in the same specialty as the physician providing the treatment, with no conflicts of interest allowed. Expert panels in disputes involving treatment must include medical professionals of the same specialty as the treating physician, with no conflicts of interest allowed. At least two medical experts on the panel should be practicing physicians of the same or similar specialty as the health care professional treating the condition. Expert panels in disputes involving treatment must include medical professionals of the same specialty as the treating physician. Practicing physicians must provide health care services at least 2 days a week. In cases involving children, at least one medical expert on the panel must have expertise in pediatrics. The expert panel will make a determination on liability after a review. An expert panel determines liability and compensation in disputes. If parties accept the panel's decision, compensation is paid, and further action is waived. If not accepted, the matter goes to an administrative health care tribunal. The parties have the right to request a hearing on liability or compensation from an administrative health care tribunal established by the State. The tribunal must be presided over by judges with health care expertise, have authority to make binding rulings on standards of care, causation, and compensation, and establish gross negligence as the legal standard. The administrative health care tribunal established by the State allows for the admission of expert panel recommendations, an appeals process, and review by State courts after exhaustion of administrative remedies. If dissatisfied, parties can file claims in State courts but forfeit any compensation awards received from the tribunal. The determinations of the expert panel and administrative health care tribunal in State court proceedings are admissible as evidence. The term 'health care provider' is defined as any person or entity required to be licensed to provide health care services. Appropriations are authorized for grants to States under this section.
