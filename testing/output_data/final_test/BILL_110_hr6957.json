Microfinance is praised for its success in reaching the poor, especially women, with high-impact and sustainable programs. Studies show significant returns on microbusiness investments, indicating the potential for the poor to escape poverty through work and savings. Currently, 113 million clients are served with microcredit, with a goal to reach 175 million of the world's poorest families by 2015. The lack of human capital is a major constraint to the growth of microfinance. The lack of human capacity is a significant constraint to the growth of microfinance networks and practitioners providing financial services to the poor. Industry estimates suggest a need for 1.6 million new loan officers in Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Near East. Currently, $2 billion in private investment capital is leveraged for microfinance, but more could be mobilized if there were qualified leaders and institutional capacity. Sub-Saharan Africa faces severe human capacity challenges due to the relative immaturity of the sector. Sub-Saharan Africa faces human capacity challenges in the microfinance industry due to a lack of trained professionals and the prevalence of HIV/AIDS. Congress believes that microfinance capacity-building activities should drive innovation and address the lack of human capital in developing countries, especially in sub-Saharan Africa. The focus should be on educating and training African nationals to enhance the microfinance industry in the region. The Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 is amended to establish a grant program for capacity building in microfinance service providers. Assistance will be provided to private, non-profit networks of microfinance institutions to offer financial services to the poor in developing countries, including education and training for industry professionals. Training and education programs are provided for individuals in the microfinance industry in developing countries, particularly in sub-Saharan African countries. This includes curriculum development, distance learning, job shadowing, mentoring, scholarships, and equipment support to improve governance structures and quality of management. The curr_chunk focuses on improving financial and nonfinancial services in microfinance institutions by enhancing technical knowledge of employees, sharing best practices, and identifying new staff. The curr_chunk outlines eligibility criteria for microfinance institutions to receive assistance, including delivering financial services to the poor, operating as a nonprofit organization, and agreeing to match cash contributions. The Administrator requires microfinance institutions to match grant funds on a 2:1 basis and ensure that at least 50% of participants are women and 100% are from developing countries. Preference is given to networks meeting these criteria.
