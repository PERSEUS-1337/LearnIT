    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature acknowledges the need to produce 11,900,000 degrees and credentials by 2025, with a projected gap of 2,400,000. California's community colleges are seen as key in addressing this gap, as only 32 percent of students complete credentials on time. Financial barriers are a significant factor affecting college enrollment and success. California invests in need-based financial aid for college students through the Cal Grant Program and the BOG Fee Waiver Program. The Cal Grant Program awards over $2 billion annually, making it the largest state grant program in the nation. The BOG Fee Waiver Program provides free tuition to almost half of all California Community College students. However, access grants for non-tuition college costs are insufficient, leaving many low-income students without support. California's community college students, often first-generation or from immigrant backgrounds, face higher costs compared to attending UC or CSU. The solution lies in increasing grant aid to cover non-tuition expenses, aligning with the state's commitment to affordable, quality education for all. The Legislature aims to enhance college affordability by expanding financial aid for students in California community college career technical education programs through the Cal Grant Program. Community colleges are encouraged to educate students about the increased aid availability and urge them to complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid by the September 2 deadline. Section 69437 of the Education Code is amended to establish the Competitive Cal Grant A and B award program for students who did not receive a Cal Grant A or B entitlement award. Awards under this program are not entitlements and the selection of students will be based on specific criteria determined by the commission. Starting from the 2016-17 academic year, up to 34,000 Cal Grant A and B awards will be granted annually on a competitive basis to applicants meeting eligibility criteria and priorities set by the commission. Fifteen thousand of these awards are available to all students, including California community college students, based on financial need and academic requirements. Application deadlines vary for different types of students. The commission reserves 19,000 awards for California community college students, with a second application deadline of September 2. Starting in the 2017-18 academic year, students in occupational or technical training courses at a California community college are eligible for Cal Grant B awards. The commission allocates awards to eligible students based on financial need and academic merit, with a limit of 34,000 awards per year. The commission establishes selection criteria for Cal Grant A and B awards, giving special consideration to disadvantaged students. Additional consideration is given to students reestablishing their grade point averages and those who did not receive awards in previous programs. All eligible students can compete for an award under this article. The Education Code defines terms like career pathway, economic security, industry cluster, long-term unemployed, and occupational or technical training. Cal Grant C awards are for occupational or technical training lasting at least four months. The number of awards each year matches those in 2015-16, with the maximum amount determined annually. The commission considers various criteria when selecting students, giving priority to those facing economic hardship or barriers to employment, including family income and household size. The Cal Grant C award recipients are selected based on criteria such as family income, household size, household status, and employment status. Recipients can renew their grants until they complete their occupational or technical training, with a maximum duration of two calendar years. Cal Grant C awards can be used for tuition, fees, training-related costs, and living expenses. The commission considers the student's financial means and other available state and federal programs when determining award amounts. The commission, in consultation with state and federal agencies, identifies areas of occupational and technical training for Cal Grant C awards. They consult with industry clusters and educators to prioritize programs. Training areas are reviewed and updated every five years. The commission updates priority areas for occupational and technical training by January 1, 2016. Priority for Cal Grant C awards is given to students in training programs meeting criteria related to job quality, such as employer demand, employment growth, salary projections, and career pathways. At least one criterion from high salary projections or well-articulated career pathways must be met for priority consideration. The commission determines areas of occupational or technical training in consultation with relevant departments and agencies using labor market projections. They publish a current list of these areas on their website. The commission publishes and updates a list of occupational or technical training areas on its website based on labor market projections. The commission examines graduation rates and job placement data of eligible programs to prioritize Cal Grant C award applicants. The commission collaborates with various agencies to develop an outreach plan for publicizing the grant award program to California's long-term unemployed. Local workforce investment boards are required to participate in outreach efforts as part of their existing responsibilities under the federal Workforce Investment Act of 1998. The commission collaborates with agencies to develop a plan for informing grant recipients about job search services. Local workforce boards must participate in outreach efforts as part of their responsibilities under the Workforce Investment Act of 1998. The Legislative Analyst\u2019s Office will submit a report to the Legislature on the outcomes of the Cal Grant C program, including recipient demographics, training program categories, selection priority, and job placement success. The Legislative Analyst\u2019s Office will submit a report comparing occupational training programs for Cal Grant C recipients before and after a specific implementation. The report must comply with Government Code Section 9795."
