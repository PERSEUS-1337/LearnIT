    "content": "The Act is titled the \"High School Athletics Accountability Act of 2009\" and its purpose is outlined in the findings and purposes section. The Congress finds that sports participation benefits youth, especially girls, by improving confidence, self-esteem, mental health, and academic performance. It also helps combat obesity, which is a significant issue among girls. Despite advances in athletic opportunities for women and girls, discrimination still limits their participation in interscholastic and intercollegiate athletics. Girls make up 49% of the high school population but only receive 41% of athletic opportunities nationwide, resulting in 1,300,000 fewer chances to play sports compared to boys. This disparity also leads to fewer athletic scholarships for girls, hindering their ability to attend college. (5) Girls' teams often receive inferior benefits and services in areas such as budgets, travel, equipment, facilities, training, and coaching. Without information on athletic opportunities, students may miss out on scholarships. (6) Awareness of available athletic opportunities for male and female students is crucial for enhancing sports participation. The Act aims to ensure equal athletic opportunities for all students, promote gender equality in school sports, and provide access to benefits from playing sports for both boys and girls. SEC. 3.

Average annual institutional salary for head coaches of men's teams across all sports should also be included. The average annual institutional salary for head coaches of women's teams and assistant coaches of men's and women's teams across all offered sports must be reported. If a coach has responsibilities for multiple teams and the salary is not allocated by team, it should be divided by the number of teams and allocated based on the coach's responsibilities. Each coeducational elementary or secondary school must disclose information to students and the public annually, including reports by October 15 each school year. The school must also inform students and the community of their right to request this information. Additionally, the school must provide the information to the Commissioner for Education Statistics within 15 days after making it available. The Commissioner for Education Statistics must ensure that required data is posted on the Department of Education's website promptly. They are also responsible for notifying all elementary and secondary schools about reporting requirements and providing guidance on collecting and reporting information within 180 days of the enactment of the High School Athletics Accountability Act of 2009."
