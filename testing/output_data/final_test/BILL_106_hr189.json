The Act permits additional contributions to retirement plans during maternity or paternity leave under specific sections of the Internal Revenue Code, with limitations for the relevant year. Employers are not required to match these contributions, but if they choose to do so, certain requirements must be met. Under the Act, retirement plans allow elective deferrals during eligible maternity and paternity leave, with limitations on the amount based on what would have been permitted if the deferral was made during that period. The plan must specify the amount and timing of these deferrals to meet requirements. Proper adjustment is made to the compensation amount for elective deferrals made during the 3-year period after eligible maternity or paternity leave. Matching contributions for such deferrals must be made by the due date. The deferral for elective contributions must be made by the employer's return due date for the taxable year. Eligible maternity or paternity leave includes absence due to pregnancy, childbirth, or adoption placement. The adoption of a child by an individual for caring purposes after birth or placement is limited to 12 months. Definitions include elective deferral, plan arrangements, and certain retroactive adjustments. The rules of subsection (u)(3) and (u)(4) apply to certain retroactive adjustments and loan repayment suspensions during eligible maternity and paternity leave. The effective date for these amendments is after December 31, 1999. Catchup contributions for families with children not covered by a pension plan are allowed under Section 3. Catchup contributions for families with children not covered by a pension plan are permitted under Section 414 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, allowing eligible participants to make additional elective deferrals in their plans. The plan allows eligible participants to make additional elective deferrals in any certified catchup year, with limitations on the amount of deferrals permitted. In certified catch-up years, eligible participants can make additional elective deferrals within specified limits. The excess amount is determined by subtracting any other elective deferrals made by the participant for the year without considering this provision.

In certified catch-up years, participants can make additional elective deferrals within limits without affecting plan compliance. Matching contributions for these deferrals must meet specific requirements and are subject to separate application of section 401(a)(4). The maximum matching contribution cannot exceed what could have been made for elective deferrals without this provision. Participants must certify to the plan administrator their status for making additional elective deferrals. An eligible participant can certify one or more catchup years, limited to a total number not exceeding the excess of years before the current year over previously certified years. An eligible participant in a plan is not considered to fail requirements due to relying on an incorrect certification unless the plan administrator knew or should have known it was incorrect. The term 'eligible participant' refers to a participant who was not an active participant for any plan year before the current year. The subsection defines terms like 'elective deferral' and 'plan', including certain rules and adjustments. The amendment made by this section applies to contributions in taxable years beginning after December 31, 1999, with certain retroactive adjustments not required."
