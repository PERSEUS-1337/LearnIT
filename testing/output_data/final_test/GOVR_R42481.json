    "content": "The Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher (HCV) program is the largest federal housing assistance program, serving 2 million low-income families at a cost of $19 billion. Eligible families receive subsidies to rent housing from private landlords based on income levels. The Section 8 HCV program provides subsidies for low-income families, covering the difference between their minimum rent contribution and market rent. Administered by Public Housing Authorities (PHAs) with federal funds from HUD, the program allows for local discretion in certain elements. PHAs have managed federal housing assistance since the 1930s. The public housing program, created to provide federally subsidized housing for low-income tenants, initially left program design to local PHAs. However, federal regulations increased over time, directing administration details such as income eligibility, priorities, rent charges, and safety standards. The federal housing policy evolved over time, with regulations initially left to local PHAs but later expanded to include rules for the Section 8 program. By the mid-1990s, there was a shift towards deregulation and local control, culminating in the Quality Housing and Work Responsibility Act of 1998. This gave PHAs more flexibility in setting tenant selection, income, rent, and administrative policies for Section 8 HCV. The devolution of social programs, including the Section 8 HCV program, aims to allow states and localities to design their own policies to reflect their interests and needs. This variation in program policies across Public Housing Authorities (PHAs) can lead to new and innovative models for providing assistance. However, challenges may arise in achieving federal policy goals, such as promoting consistent access to assistance and ensuring policies are advantageous to low-income populations. Policymakers debate the level of discretionary authority for PHAs in the administration of the HCV program, with concerns about potential policy tensions and lax oversight of federal funds. PHAs have discretion in setting policies, prioritizing families for assistance, and implementing federal policies. This study examines the discretionary authority of Public Housing Authorities (PHAs) in the Housing Choice Voucher (HCV) program, focusing on tenant selection, income and rent determination, and program administration policies. PHAs have the power to make decisions that impact federal costs, policy goals, and the experiences of families in the program. The study focuses on PHAs' discretionary policies in the HCV program, including tenant selection, income and rent determination, and program administration. Data was collected on specific PHA policies such as local preferences, screening, termination of assistance, and waiting list administration. The methodology and previous research on PHAs' discretionary authority are discussed, with detailed descriptions of the policies and data collected provided in the research findings section. The study focused on PHAs' discretionary policies in the HCV program, including tenant selection, income and rent determination, and program administration. Data was collected on specific PHA policies such as local preferences, screening, termination of assistance, and waiting list administration. The data collection process involved reviewing PHA administrative plans and conducting interviews with PHA officials to explain their discretionary policies. The Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher administrative plans are the main source of data for the research study on PHAs' discretionary policies. PHAs update their plans to reflect new requirements from HUD and local circumstances, often including both discretionary and mandatory policies despite HUD's discouragement. The administrative plans of PHAs serve as program guidebooks containing policies and procedures. A total of 131 PHAs were selected for the study out of a universe of 1,732 PHAs, excluding those with unique operating rules. The sample excluded PHAs with fewer than 100 units to manage the study size effectively. CRS selected 131 PHAs for the study, representing various sizes and regions of the country. They collected administrative plans in a way that minimized burden, either by downloading them from websites or requesting copies from PHAs. Some PHAs provided information through a questionnaire when unable to supply a current plan. Two PHAs did not provide plans or complete the questionnaire, resulting in missing data in the research findings. Challenges in collecting administrative plans are discussed in Appendix A of the report. The challenges faced in collecting administrative plans for the research project were discussed. Interviews with PHA officials served as a secondary source of data. The selection of PHAs for interviews was non-probabilistic and aimed to provide context for PHAs' discretionary policies. Key respondents were identified based on initial data collection contacts to ensure the interviews served their purpose. PHA officials who had not been contacted initially were invited for interviews to avoid excluding key respondents. 18 interviews were conducted by phone, where officials explained their discretionary policies. Limitations in the data collected from administrative plans were acknowledged, impacting the findings presented in the report. The data collected from administrative plans and interviews with PHA officials may not accurately reflect the actual practiced policies due to limitations in verifying the information. Some PHAs did not update their plans, and not all discretionary policies were included. Additionally, two PHAs did not provide their administrative plans for review. Readers should consider these limitations when interpreting the data presented in the report. The report on the Housing Choice Voucher program reflects CRS's analysis of data from administrative plans and interviews with PHAs. The findings should be seen as a broad overview of PHA practices, not a definitive statement. Different interpretations of ambiguous policies could lead to varied research findings. The last major study on PHAs' discretionary authority was conducted by HUD in 2000. The last major research study on PHAs' discretionary authority was conducted by HUD in 2000, focusing on various areas of discretion in the Tenant-Based Section 8 Program. The study sampled 167 PHAs and examined their policies on tenant selection, occupancy, extending housing opportunities, and rent policies. Additionally, it described factors influencing PHA officials' policy choices. The study by HUD in 2000 focused on PHAs' discretionary authority in the Tenant-Based Section 8 Program, examining policies on tenant selection, occupancy, housing opportunities, and rent. Comparisons with this study should consider differences in data sources and changes in regulations over time. This report compares how PHAs have used their discretionary authority since it was first granted, including methods like waiting list placement and local preferences. PHAs have the discretion to determine which low-income populations will receive assistance in the Housing Choice Voucher program. PHAs have the discretion to establish local waiting list preferences for the Housing Choice Voucher program, allowing them to prioritize low-income populations based on local housing needs and priorities. This discretion was granted through legislation in 1996 and 1998, giving PHAs the authority to determine how needs should be prioritized and assign varying weights to local preferences. PHAs gained the authority to establish local waiting list preferences for the Housing Choice Voucher program in 1996 and 1998. These preferences can include residency, working families, victims of domestic violence, elderly, displaced, homeless, and persons with disabilities. A HUD study in 2000 found that PHAs used this discretion in a limited manner. Approximately 41% of PHAs did not adopt local preferences in 2000. Today, only 9% of PHAs placed applicants on the waiting list based on the date and time of application. Approximately 26% of PHAs incorporated some old federal preferences into their local preferences. PHAs have adopted a wide range of local preferences, including residency. Approximately 63% of PHAs placed applicants on the waiting list based on three or more common local preferences, with 23% using seven preferences. 44% of PHAs had additional preferences beyond the common ones listed. Only 6% of PHAs placed applicants on the waiting list based on 10 or more common local preferences, with 41% adopting the residency preference. The weighting of preferences can limit access to vouchers for households not qualifying for heavily weighted preferences. The data shows that 18% of PHAs prioritize residency preferences, potentially limiting selection to local applicants. 62% of PHAs use varying weights for local preferences, raising questions about the effectiveness of multiple preferences. PHA officials mentioned pressure from boards and community groups to expand local preferences, making waiting lists harder to manage. Several PHAs found it challenging to manage a high number of local preferences on waiting lists, reflecting community needs and providing flexibility to meet immediate housing needs. Examples include preferences established for housing needs after a local mobile home community closure and for residents who lost their homes in fires. PHA officials believed it was unfair to prioritize one group over another on waiting lists. They limited local preferences to avoid mismanagement and liability issues. Special purpose vouchers were used to meet specific group needs, such as veterans. The PHA abandoned local preferences after realizing the potential risks involved. The PHA officials limited local preferences to avoid mismanagement and liability issues. Some preferences were seen as easy to manipulate, such as the preference for the homeless or those at-risk of homelessness. 44% of PHAs had \"other local preferences\" that were difficult to categorize. Some PHAs had narrow local preferences that were difficult to categorize, such as preferences for families living and working within the PHA's area, single-parent households with young children, families not in lead-safe housing, grandparents as parents, and foster youth aging out of the child welfare system. These preferences created administrative flexibilities between housing programs. Some PHAs have diverse local preferences, including preferences for Shelter-Plus-Care graduates, those displaced from housing programs, and settlements of litigation. These preferences highlight PHAs' flexibility to address specific community needs but make it challenging to summarize the program's target population. PHAs have varying local preference policies, reflecting different determinations of housing assistance priorities. The program serves at-risk populations based on local preferences and PHAs' use of preferences may raise issues of racial discrimination. HUD may take fair housing actions against PHAs with residency preferences. Some PHAs with residency preferences may face fair housing actions from HUD. 41% of PHAs sampled have residency preferences, with varying definitions. Residency preferences can impact access to the HCV program for racial minorities. PHAs can admit families directly to the HCV program through special admissions procedures, especially when awarded program funding for specified units previously subsidized through another housing program. Special admissions procedures can re-house tenants facing displacement due to HUD program actions. This includes families displaced from public housing projects, multifamily rental housing projects sold or demolished by HUD, or families in projects with expiring Section 8 contracts. PHAs can also establish special admission procedures in other cases to assist families in need. PHAs can establish special admission procedures to re-house tenants facing displacement due to HUD program actions. 77% of sampled PHAs had special admission procedures for administering HUD-awarded funding for specified units or special purposes, while 16% did not. Some PHAs used special admission procedures to serve specific groups, such as those displaced by disasters. Thirteen percent of PHAs allowed special admissions for particular groups, including those displaced by natural disasters or government actions. The Housing Choice Voucher program allows PHAs to establish special admission procedures to re-house tenants facing displacement. While some PHAs used this flexibility to serve specific groups like those displaced by disasters, there were concerns about some PHAs using the special admissions procedures in ways not contemplated by regulations. Further guidance from HUD on the use of special admission procedures may be necessary to ensure program funds are used for their intended purposes. Federal law allows Public Housing Authorities (PHAs) to deny assistance to certain families based on financial obligations, criminal history, and suitability for tenancy. This includes denying admission to sex offenders, drug offenders, and those evicted for drug-related crimes in the past three years. These policies, known as denial of admission or screening, aim to limit access to assistance for some families. Federal law allows Public Housing Authorities (PHAs) to establish policies denying admission to households with tenants engaged in illegal drug use or violent criminal activity. PHAs may also consider drug rehabilitation completion or cessation of offending behavior to allow admission. HUD regulations permit PHAs to consider all relevant circumstances when implementing denial of assistance. PHAs can consider various factors when implementing denial of admission policies, including seriousness of the case, family members' participation, mitigating circumstances related to disability, and impact on other family members. Post-QHWRA, PHAs can conduct additional screening for tenant suitability and behavior, although landlords remain responsible for screening HCV tenants. The Housing Choice Voucher Program Guidebook discusses the importance of screening program applicants and denying assistance to those with poor rental histories. PHAs have discretion in determining eligibility based on behaviors, mitigating circumstances, and period of ineligibility. Low-income housing advocates have criticized some PHAs for their screening and denial policies. Some PHAs have screening and denial policies, with proposals to limit discretionary screening. Concerns exist about inadequate policies to protect communities. Most PHAs state that screening tenants is the landlord's responsibility, with few actually screening for suitability. Criteria for denial often involve past financial obligations and criminal activity. Financial obligations, including debts owed to PHAs, are a common reason for denial of admission according to program regulations. PHAs may consider debts to any PHA, not just their own. Some PHAs are reevaluating policies on unpaid debts, with one official mentioning a list maintained by a private company to track tenants with outstanding obligations. Recently, a PHA decided to remove tenants with bad debts from the list with the help of their local legal aid office. The PHA recently decided, with the assistance of their local legal aid office, to remove tenant information after seven years to align with consumer credit report standards. Over one-third of PHAs in the study conduct credit checks on applicants, some to verify household information and others to identify court-ordered judgments. All PHAs in the study referenced HUD guidelines on crime-related denials of assistance, with policies varying on specific crimes considered. The study found that PHA policies on denying assistance varied based on specific crimes considered, with some stating they \"shall\" deny assistance for certain crimes while others stated they \"may\" deny assistance. The most common policy among PHAs was to deny assistance for violent or drug-related criminal activity that may threaten the safety of residents. Some PHAs have policies to deny assistance based on past behaviors, including violent or drug-related criminal activity. Specific crimes like murder and sexually based crimes are addressed in some PHA plans. HUD regulations allow consideration of evidence beyond arrests and convictions when determining violations. PHA policies vary in terms of how far back they look for disqualifying behavior when evaluating tenants. Some plans do not specify the time period, while others have specific time frames for different categories of crimes. Around half of PHAs use a single time period, with the most common being a five-year look-back. Some plans reference periods of one, three, seven, and 10 years. About 22% of plans mention using multiple time periods. About 22% of PHA plans use multiple look-back periods for evaluating tenants, varying from one year to over a lifetime. Specific policies for crimes like murder have look-back periods ranging from seven years to a lifetime. Criminal background checks are conducted by 85% of PHAs, with some also using fingerprinting. HUD's 2000 study found that less than 50% of PHAs used formal background checks, but now more are using them, especially with the availability of online checks. Some PHAs even conduct checks on household members under 18, including those as young as 14 or 15. Several PHAs are increasingly using criminal background checks, especially now that they are available online. Officials assess applicants with criminal backgrounds on a case-by-case basis, with guidelines in place. They like the flexibility to weed out problem tenants but also believe in giving second chances. Some PHAs have concerns about serving ex-offenders but have developed a Memorandum of Understanding with a local legal aid office. This policy allows them to serve needy families while protecting themselves by requiring ongoing participation in supportive services. The PHA has changed its policy in recent years to \"lower the bar.\" The PHA has adopted stricter rules to combat negative perceptions and has changed its policy to be more lenient in the appeals process. Tenants have opposed proposals to loosen criminal background requirements, and the Resident Advisory Board supports making restrictions stricter. The PHA has been supportive of recent initiatives to make restrictions stricter in the community, worried about burning out its supply of landlords willing to accept vouchers. They have a more liberal policy than local landlords, leading to voucher holders struggling to find units to lease. Officials have reconsidered policies in response to HUD guidance on serving ex-offenders, expressing concerns about program integrity and reputation. Some PHA officials expressed concerns about loosening standards due to gang activity in the community, with one official estimating a 20% denial rate for applicants with past criminal activity. Another official mentioned that most denials were related to bad debt or financial obligations rather than criminal history. The officials had varying opinions on the appropriate length of look-back periods for screening applicants. Some PHA officials have differing opinions on the length of look-back periods for screening applicants. One official mentioned a five-year look back policy to avoid punishing tenants for past incidents, while another official emphasized honesty on applications. Several officials follow HUD guidelines for crime and drug policies. PHA policies on evaluating criminal backgrounds vary widely, leading to potential inconsistencies in treatment based on location. Written policies are often vague, giving administrators discretion to assess families case by case. While this flexibility is valued, it can also create challenges such as conflicts with applicants. Inconsistent application of PHA policies may lead to conflicts with applicants and their advocates. Lack of specificity in written policies could impact tenants. Administrators' judgment in evaluating tenants for assistance may be beneficial, but perceived bias or inconsistency could be problematic. Unpaid debts to a PHA could limit future access to assistance for families. It is unclear how PHAs report unpaid debts and use this information in evaluating program applicants. Support for federal policy initiatives for ex-offenders varies among PHAs based on local administrators' perceptions and policy discretion. Federal law requires PHAs to terminate HCV assistance for families evicted from program-assisted housing for serious lease violations. Landlords make eviction decisions, but PHAs have discretion in determining lease violations. Most termination policies are related to criminal activity, with PHAs having discretion in most circumstances. Termination policies for federally assisted housing are tied to criminal activity. PHAs must terminate assistance for tenants convicted of producing methamphetamines on the premises. While not required by federal law, PHAs are encouraged to terminate assistance for individuals on a sex offender registry. Policies also allow for termination of assistance for households with tenants using illegal drugs or alcohol in a way that disrupts other residents' safety or enjoyment. Certain criminal activities, such as those threatening the safety of residents or involving fugitive felons, can also lead to termination of assistance. The termination of tenancy in federally assisted housing is linked to criminal activities, including drug-related or violent behavior that disrupts the safety and peace of other residents. While federal law mandates termination for producing methamphetamines on the property, PHAs have discretion in deciding when to pursue termination for other offenses. Factors such as the seriousness of the case and individual culpability are considered in implementing termination policies. The study found that the most common policy adopted by Public Housing Authorities (PHAs) for terminating assistance is based on violent or drug-related criminal activity that threatens the safety of residents. 53% of PHAs had this type of policy, while 31% had a policy where termination of assistance may occur. Several PHAs have policies for terminating assistance based on violent or drug-related criminal activity, with some excluding other criminal activities. Some plans had missing or incomplete information on this topic. PHAs have discretion to consider mitigating circumstances, allowing for case-by-case discretion despite policies stating assistance termination. PHA officials expressed a tension between flexibility and fair, clear, consistent policies, with some making their termination policies more detailed in response to challenges from legal aid attorneys. PHA officials expressed tension between flexibility and clear policies regarding termination of assistance. Some officials mentioned the need for more concrete guidance from HUD. Policies on termination grounds are not definitively stated, allowing for discretion based on family circumstances. Ambiguous policies can lead to legal challenges for PHAs. Having flexible policies can help PHAs avoid trouble but also pose risks. In the Housing Choice Voucher program, families must contribute to their housing costs, known as the total tenant payment, which is generally 30% of their monthly adjusted income. However, PHAs have discretion to set a minimum rent between $0 and $50 per month, potentially requiring low-income families to pay more than 30% of their income towards housing costs. The QHWRA allows tenants to request a hardship exemption if they can't meet the minimum rent, with a 90-day eviction protection. Policymakers are considering increasing the minimum rent to reduce program costs, but this may lead to more hardship exemptions and administrative costs. PHAs have struggled to determine the proper minimum rent amount. The 2000 study found that many Public Housing Authorities (PHAs) had difficulty determining the appropriate minimum rent amount, balancing revenue collection with administrative costs. In the current study, CRS discovered that most PHAs set their minimum rent at $50 per month, with concerns about administrative costs and tenant circumstances. 70% of PHAs set their minimum rent at $50, while 14% had a minimum rent of $0, 9% had $25, and 7% did not provide data. The data collected by CRS suggests that approximately one-third of PHAs have increased their minimum rents from $25 to $50 since 2000. Discussions with PHA officials reveal varied opinions about the application of a minimum rent, with some considering raising it if there were no HUD guidance. Some PHA officials are divided on increasing the minimum rent, with concerns about creating a rent burden for low-income tenants. They suggest conducting a rent burden study before deciding on a higher minimum rent. Some officials believe a higher minimum rent could be supported in local communities, while others argue that very few tenants would be affected, resulting in minimal savings if the minimum rent is increased beyond $50. Some PHA officials are hesitant to increase the minimum rent due to concerns about financial stress on vulnerable tenants, potential hardship hearings, and the availability of sufficient reserves. They worry about the impact on tenants with little to no income and how they would afford the increased rent. PHA officials generally support the idea of a minimum rent, with 79% setting it at $25 or $50. They believe it fosters tenant responsibility and fairness, with some seeing it as a requirement for program participation. While not primarily for revenue generation, officials view the minimum rent as important for tenant accountability. PHA officials see the minimum rent as a way to promote tenant responsibility and fairness in the Housing Choice Voucher program. Annual income examinations are required to determine housing assistance and rent contributions, with PHAs having discretion in establishing income recertification policies. Concerns about improper payments, particularly due to unreported income, highlight the importance of accurate subsidy calculations. PHAs have discretion in establishing policies for interim recertifications of income between annual examinations. This allows for adjustments in housing assistance subsidy levels and tenant rent based on changes in income. The Housing Choice Voucher Program Guidebook advises considering the costs of processing income increases versus potential savings if the HAP is reduced. HUD has issued regulations to increase income verification integrity by restricting PHAs' discretion in setting income reporting and interim recertification policies. The regulations mandate the use of HUD's EIV system to confirm household income and determine rent when there are discrepancies. The EIV system provides access to new hire, wage, unemployment, and Social Security information. HUD regulations require PHAs to use the EIV system to verify household income and resolve discrepancies. PHAs should examine and resolve discrepancies greater than $2,400 per year. Some PHAs are not processing interim recertifications according to EIV system requirements, despite requiring tenants to report income changes. Some PHAs are not processing interim recertifications for all income changes, with only 33% doing so. Comparing to a HUD study from 2000, it shows that over the past decade, some PHAs have opted out of recalculating subsidies for all income changes. Administrative factors affect the processing of interim recertifications. Some PHA officials struggle with setting income change thresholds for interim recertifications, balancing payment reductions and administrative burden. Unclear origins of threshold policies and impact of EIV requirements on policy changes noted. One PHA aligned policy with EIV reporting, emphasizing the importance of processing all income changes to avoid EIV discrepancies. Some PHA officials debated the process of interim recertifications for income changes, with differing views on tenant reporting and rent adjustments based on income fluctuations. Several PHA officials discussed the challenges of processing interim recertifications for income changes, with varying opinions on whether tenants should report income changes or be allowed to benefit from increased income. The data showed a range of policies among PHAs, but common themes emerged. PHAs may benefit from technical assistance in establishing consistent reporting and recertification policies. The report discusses the challenges PHAs face with interim recertifications and the need for clarification on their discretion. Local preferences allow PHAs to prioritize specific tenant characteristics on waiting lists for Housing Choice Vouchers. PHAs have discretion in maintaining waiting lists to ensure an adequate pool of applicants for funding. PHAs have discretion in maintaining waiting lists for Housing Choice Vouchers, deciding when to open and close them. Some waiting lists have been closed for years, creating a rush of applicants when they do open. For example, when the East Point Housing Authority reopened its waiting list in 2011 after eight years, 30,000 people applied. Seventy-seven percent of PHAs use the date and time method to add applicants to waiting lists, while only 18% use random selection. Some PHAs may consider switching to random selection when reopening long-closed waiting lists. PHA officials mentioned that the demand for vouchers exceeds the supply, with some PHAs having waiting lists open for years and receiving thousands of applications. One large metropolitan PHA has over 20,000 applicants on its waiting list. Another PHA plans to close its waiting list soon due to its length. The Housing Choice Voucher program's waiting list challenges may be due to a mismatch between voucher distribution and housing assistance needs. Families selected from the waiting list must find a landlord willing to accept the voucher, with some facing difficulty due to local rental market conditions. PHAs have discretion in setting search time limits to increase success rates. The Housing Choice Voucher program's waiting list challenges may be due to a mismatch between voucher distribution and housing assistance needs. HUD studies from 2000 estimated a national success rate of approximately 69%, but current success rates are uncertain due to policy changes and rental market conditions. PHAs control factors that influence success rates, such as setting search time limits. PHA policies on search time and extensions are crucial for success rates. Regulations mandate a minimum 60-day initial search time, but PHAs can allow longer times and issue extensions. Factors like local housing market conditions and search effort influence the length and number of extensions granted. The majority of Public Housing Authorities (PHAs) set an initial search time of 60 days, as required by regulations. Some PHAs extend the search time to 120 days, with a few extending it even further. About 5% of PHAs only give extensions to the elderly and those with disabilities. Other PHAs provide extensions without specifying a maximum length or automatically extend the search time to 90 days and then to 120 days with documentation. The comparison between PHAs' extension policies shows that some PHAs now require documentation for extending the search time to 120 days, indicating stricter regulations compared to previous studies. Only 43% of PHAs in the sample easily offer a 120-day extension, with others granting extensions under extenuating circumstances. In contrast, the HUD study revealed that 77% of PHAs required proof of a thorough search before granting an extension, while in this study, 63% of PHAs had this requirement. The study compared PHAs' extension policies, showing stricter regulations with some now requiring documentation for a 120-day search time extension. 63% of PHAs in the sample required proof of search before granting an extension, indicating adjustments to local markets as intended by deregulation. Limited information is available on how the Housing Choice Voucher program is administered in many communities, prompting the study to expand knowledge on PHAs' practices. The study aimed to explore how Public Housing Authorities (PHAs) utilize their discretionary authority under federal law, impacting program administration, family experience, community perception, and program costs. The findings highlight considerations for policymakers regarding program flexibility and accountability, crucial elements in social services programs like the Housing Choice Voucher program. The balance between flexibility and accountability in program structure can influence the achievement of federal policy goals. The study explores how PHAs use their discretionary authority under federal law, affecting program administration, family experience, community perception, and costs. The balance between flexibility and accountability in the program structure impacts the achievement of federal policy goals and has benefits and drawbacks for PHAs and tenants. The research indicates a lack of information on PHAs' use of discretionary authority, which affects equitable access to the program. HUD field offices ensure PHAs follow policies, but do not provide general trends in program administration. Local preferences chosen by PHAs determine access to the program. The study examines how PHAs use their discretionary authority under federal law to impact program administration, family experience, community perception, and costs. The question raised is what oversight is appropriate to ensure federal policy objectives are met. PHA industry groups support increasing administrative flexibilities to reduce costs. Federal policymakers are seeking ways to decrease the cost of the HCV program. Some PHA officials suggest that the deregulation of assisted housing programs and expansion of the Moving-to-Work Demonstration may not always lead to cost savings in the Housing Choice Voucher program. There are concerns about the administrative burden created by the discretion granted to PHAs, with calls for a uniform policy on denials based on criminal activity to reduce challenges. Testimony from PHAs to Congress indicates that the deregulation may actually result in re-regulation, requiring significant staff time. The QHWRA provisions require significant staff time for administrative tasks such as income targeting, rental integrity, and PIC reporting. The reporting requirements tied to discretion are seen as costly and negate the benefits. Increased administrative flexibility may not always reduce burden and costs, especially when tied to new reporting requirements and tenant protection procedures. Tenant advocates fear that local discretion could lead to decreased housing assistance and higher rents for tenants. The study highlights concerns about how local discretion in Public Housing Authorities (PHAs) could impact housing assistance payments and tenant rents. There is a worry that inconsistent program procedures may cause confusion and reduce access to the program. The study does not determine if PHA discretionary policies are more beneficial to applicants and participants than federal policies, but it does show variations in program administration. PHAs are consistent in some areas of discretion, like minimum rent applications, but diverge in others, such as local preferences. These variations in local policy may benefit applicants and tenants as PHAs use their flexibility to best serve them. The study explores how Public Housing Authorities (PHAs) use their administrative flexibility to serve communities. PHAs' Section 8 administrative plan describes their policies and discretion, which can be valuable for further research. CRS observed that PHAs' Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher administrative plans may be of interest to policymakers due to availability issues. While federal regulations require plans to be publicly accessible, they are not consistently posted online. Many PHAs do not have their plans readily available on their websites. Many PHAs do not have their administrative plans readily accessible on their websites. CRS staff contacted PHA offices to request copies of the plans, with most willing to email electronic copies. Some PHAs preferred to respond to a questionnaire via email instead of sending a plan. Some PHAs found it burdensome to provide their plans, while others had outdated plans. Most PHAs eventually sent their plans after initial requests, but a quarter required extensive follow-up. Obtaining these public documents raised concerns about their availability for oversight and public information purposes. PHAs are required to include discretionary policies in their HCV administrative plans, as advised by HUD. Plans should only address policies where the PHA has discretion, with regulations and operating procedures in a separate manual for easier updates. Despite HUD's guidance, all plans reviewed included policies beyond the PHA's discretion. Many PHA administrative plans reviewed by CRS included policies beyond HUD's guidance, some repeating regulations verbatim while others summarized them. PHA officials described the plan as a \"bible\" or \"guidebook\" used primarily by program staff, with varying opinions on the primary audience including PHA staff, HUD, legal aid offices, tenant advocates, landlords, and tenants. The administrative plans reviewed by CRS have multiple audiences, including landlords, tenants, and program staff. PHA officials question if the plans meet the needs of these audiences. A discretion-only plan would be easier for HUD oversight but less useful as a policy guide. The plans are used as policy guidance for program staff and include detail on program rules and regulations. Tenants, landlords, and advocates may also find the plans helpful. Advocates, like legal services attorneys, may prefer a comprehensive listing of PHA policies over a discretion-only plan. PHAs sometimes have contradictory or unclear information in their lengthy administrative plans, which may be outdated. Updating these plans is seen as cumbersome by officials, leading to inconsistencies. Policymakers and PHAs should consider revisiting and updating the current administrative plan. Policymakers and PHAs may need to review the current administrative plan model to ensure relevance and compliance. Some PHA officials purchase Section 8 administrative plans from private companies to customize their plans. 42% of PHAs in the study had plans from outside consultants, offering options for customization. The voucher program raises questions for policymakers regarding the use of funds for purchasing plans from private entities. It is important to streamline program guidance for PHAs to redirect funds for other purposes and ensure they understand their authority. There is a concern that private companies are influencing local policies. The research focuses on the Public Housing Authority (PHA) universe, including very large PHAs and a random sample of large, medium, and small PHAs. The sampling frame allows for comparisons between very large PHAs and all other PHAs in the universe. The data collected could be used for future comparisons. PHAs operating outside typical program rules include Moving-to-Work (MTW) PHAs, PHAs in territories, and PHAs administering state-level programs. These PHAs have greater discretionary authority and can act outside statutory and regulatory rules governing assisted housing programs. The study excludes PHAs with fewer than 100 units to focus on larger PHAs. The study focused on larger Public Housing Authorities (PHAs) due to resource constraints, excluding those with fewer than 100 units. Despite this exclusion, the study included 1,732 PHAs, representing 99% of housing vouchers. Very large PHAs, with over 6,000 units, were all included in the sample due to their significant impact on subsidies. The study included all very large Public Housing Authorities (PHAs) in the sample, capturing their discretionary choices with statistical certainty. A stratified random sample of 91 PHAs was drawn from the remaining 1,692 PHAs to ensure a confidence level of 95% and a margin of error of +/- 10%. The study aimed to include PHAs from various size categories and regions to prevent exclusion of any particular type of PHA. The study sampled 131 Public Housing Authorities (PHAs) to represent different size and region categories. The data collected allowed for a detailed description of the discretionary choices of very large PHAs with certainty and all other PHAs with 95% confidence and a margin of error of +/- 10%. The study sampled 131 Public Housing Authorities (PHAs) to represent different size and region categories. The data collected allowed for a detailed description of the discretionary choices of very large PHAs with certainty and all other PHAs with 95% confidence and a margin of error of +/- 10%. PHAs adopted a wide variety of local preferences and provided varying levels of specificity about their preferences. For the purposes of this study, CRS categorized PHAs' local preferences and identified those that were commonly used. Training is considered an eligible activity for residency preference. Elderly individuals aged 65 and older may qualify for this preference. Government action preference applies to families displaced due to actions by PHAs or other government entities, such as demolition or redevelopment of public housing.
