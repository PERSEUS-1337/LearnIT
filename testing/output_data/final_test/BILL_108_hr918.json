The Act \"Patient Navigator Outreach and Chronic Disease Prevention Act of 2004\" allows the Secretary to make grants for demonstration programs providing patient navigator services to improve health care outcomes. Grantees must use funds to recruit, train, and employ patient navigators who have direct knowledge of the communities they serve. The Patient Navigator Outreach and Chronic Disease Prevention Act of 2004 allows for grants to fund programs that provide patient navigator services to improve health care outcomes. These navigators assist individuals seeking prevention or early detection services for cancer or chronic diseases, facilitate community organization involvement, and improve access to high-quality health care services. The Patient Navigator Outreach and Chronic Disease Prevention Act of 2004 allows for grants to fund programs that provide patient navigator services to improve health care outcomes. These navigators assist individuals in clinical trials enrollment, overcoming health care system barriers, and providing information on health coverage options. The Patient Navigator Outreach and Chronic Disease Prevention Act of 2004 allows for grants to fund programs that provide patient navigator services to improve health care outcomes, including outreach to health disparity populations for preventative care. Grants can be awarded for up to 3 years, with possible 1-year extensions. The Secretary may authorize up to 4 extensions for grants under this section, with grant periods not ending after September 30, 2010. To apply for a grant, eligible entities must submit an application outlining baseline measures and benchmarks to evaluate program outcomes. The Secretary will establish uniform baseline measures for impact evaluation. The Secretary will give preference to entities using patient navigator services to overcome barriers and improve healthcare outcomes in communities. Coordination with existing programs will ensure access to quality healthcare services. A study will be conducted and a report submitted to Congress within 6 months of completing the demonstration grant program. The program will evaluate outcomes, provide recommendations on using patient navigator programs in other public health areas, and submit reports to Congress. The Secretary may also provide interim reports on the demonstration grant program. The Secretary may require grant recipients to submit interim reports on program outcomes. The section defines 'eligible entity' as various healthcare centers and facilities. The term 'health disparity population' refers to a group with significant differences in disease rates compared to the general population. A 'patient navigator' is an individual trained to provide specific services. $2,000,000 is authorized for fiscal year 2006, $5,000,000 for 2007, and $8,000,000 for 2008 to support these initiatives. The funding allocated for fiscal years 2007 to 2010 is $5,000,000, $8,000,000, $6,500,000, and $3,500,000 respectively. The appropriations will be available for obligation until the end of fiscal year 2010. The House of Representatives passed the bill on October 5, 2004."
