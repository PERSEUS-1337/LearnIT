    "content": "The Act is known as the \"Standards for Internet Non-Censorship Act of 2010\" or the \"SINC Act of 2010.\" It includes findings related to internet censorship. The Congress finds that Internet freedom has been compromised by repressive regimes using technology to control information flow and limit political debate. One violation is the censorship of search engines by these regimes, forcing providers to censor search results globally. Access to US websites by search engines worldwide provides significant market value. Repressive regimes benefit economically from accessing US websites through search engines, which they use to distort information. Censorship of the Internet is a significant global issue that requires action from free countries. The future of the Internet as a platform for free speech depends on worldwide adoption of non-censorship standards. The sense of Congress is that the President should establish interim minimum standards of non-censorship for Internet search providers and negotiate with free countries to adopt non-censorship standards for access to the Internet. Additionally, there should be Federal Communications Commission regulation against censorship. The Federal Communications Commission may adopt regulations to restrict repressive Internet search providers from accessing domestic online information. If regulations are adopted, a public Web site will list these providers and reasons for their classification as repressive. The Commission can enforce these regulations to prevent collusion in evading them. Additionally, there is a call for the development of international minimum standards of non-censorship for the Internet. The Secretary of State will seek agreements with free countries to prevent censorship of nonviolent political speech on the Internet. The Commission may regulate to restrict foreign entities from accessing domestic online information. The Act defines key terms such as Commission, free country, Internet, domestic online information, and repressive internet search provider. The Act defines key terms related to the Internet, including repressive internet search provider that censors search results for political speech suppression."
