    "content": "Title V of the Social Security Act authorizes funding for services to improve maternal and child health, including the MCH Services Block Grant administered by the Maternal and Child Health Bureau. This grant program is the largest under Title V and aims to support the health of mothers and children. The Title V of the Social Security Act established programs to improve maternal and child health services, especially in low-income and rural areas, and to extend services for children with special health care needs. The Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 replaced the term \"crippled\" with \"children with special health care needs.\" Additional programs were added over time to target children with special health care needs and low-income women and children. Title V of the Social Security Act established programs for children with disabilities, lead-based paint poisoning prevention, genetic diseases, sudden infant death syndrome, hemophilia treatment, and adolescent pregnancy grants. In 1981, Title V was converted to the MCH Services Block Grant by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act, consolidating these programs into a single block grant to give states more flexibility in addressing maternal and child health needs. Each state was required to receive the combined funding of the programs consolidated under OBRA 1981. The MCH Services Block Grant, established under OBRA 1981, underwent changes in 1989 to increase appropriations and accountability. It consists of block grants to states, set-asides for SPRANS and CISS programs, and was funded at $638.2 million in FY2016. Funding is distributed to various states and territories. The MCH Services Block Grant, established under OBRA 1981, provides funding to Micronesia, the Marshall Islands, and Palau. Funds are allocated for CISS and SPRANS grants, with goals including improving access to quality healthcare for mothers and children, reducing infant mortality, and increasing preventive and health care services. The MCH Services Block Grant funds diagnostic and treatment services, preventive and health care services for blind and disabled children, and family-centered care for children with special health needs. It also provides toll-free hotlines for pregnant women and children eligible for Medicaid. The funds aim to fill gaps in public health services for low-income mothers and children, including projects for workforce development, genetic services, and hemophilia treatment. The CISS grants fund projects that support integrated maternal and child health services at the community level. States are required to use block grant funds to provide access to quality maternal and child health services for low-income families. Services funded by the block grant may include prenatal care, well-child care, dental care, immunization, family planning, and vision and hearing screening services. States determine the actual services provided under the block grant. Title V programs, such as the Maternal and Child Health Services Block Grant, offer a range of services for women and children, including inpatient care for special health needs, lead poisoning screening, and counseling for parents of sudden infant death syndrome victims. Block grant funding also supports school-based health centers, with a focus on serving low-income families. The definition of low-income for allocation purposes is below 100% of federal poverty guidelines, but this does not restrict access to Title V-funded services based on income. Block grants to states provide funding for core public health services, including infrastructure building, population-based, enabling, and direct health care services. Infrastructure building services support the development and maintenance of health systems, while population-based services focus on universal screening and health promotion. In FY2015, block grants funded core public health services such as universal screening, health promotion, and disease prevention campaigns. Population-based services included newborn screening, lead screening, immunization, oral health, and injury prevention. Enabling services facilitated access to care for vulnerable populations, while direct health care services filled gaps in primary and preventive health care for low-income mothers and children. The distribution of funds for block grants in FY2015 varied by state, with direct health care services for low-income mothers and children being the largest recipient. The allocation of funds depended on each state's population needs and gaps in existing health and social service programs. The costs for direct health care services per person served were higher compared to other services. Funding distribution was based on state and national indicators, with data available on HRSA's website. Block grant funds for health services to women and children have restrictions on use, including prohibitions on cash payments, inpatient services except for specific cases, and transfers to other programs. States must submit applications with needs assessments every five years to receive funds. The Title V program requires states to conduct a needs assessment every five years to identify health goals and services for women, infants, children, and those with special health needs. The plan to address these needs must detail how block grant funds will be used within the state. Coordination with the state's Medicaid program is also mandated. The state's Medicaid program, including the EPSDT program, requires coordination with other related programs such as WIC, education, health, and family planning programs. Interagency agreements outline the expected areas of coordination, with varying levels of formality and scope among states. Services provided by each agency are specified in these agreements. The Title V agency contracts health providers for services, with Medicaid responsible for reimbursement. States may coordinate with programs like WIC. HRSA's 2008 analysis recommended specific components for interagency agreements. The SPRANS program is a HRSA-administered grant program for maternal and child health research and training. SPRANS grants are available for maternal and child health research conducted by eligible organizations. These projects must address national needs, have regional significance, and aim to improve state systems of care. Approximately 15% of MCH Services Block Grant funds are allocated to SPRANS programs, with specific set-aside funds for oral health, epilepsy, sickle cell, and fetal alcohol syndrome in the FY2016 budget. SPRANS can also be used for genetic disease testing, counseling, newborn screening, and follow-up programs. SPRANS grants prioritize projects for newborn screening of genetic disorders in high infant mortality areas. Congress sometimes provides specific directives for funding, comprising about 16% of SPRANS funding in FY2016. The Family-to-Family Health Information Centers program funds centers providing support to families of children with special health care needs. The CISS program, administered by HRSA, funds projects to increase service delivery capacity for mothers and children, especially in rural areas and those with special health care needs. Grants support integrated services at the community level, including maternal and infant health home visiting and integrated maternal and child health service delivery systems. Eligible organizations can receive grants to promote community-based health systems. The Maternal and Child Health Services Block Grant funds centers providing pregnancy and primary care services for women and infants, maternal and child health projects for rural populations, and programs for children with special health care needs. 85% of the funds are distributed to states and territories by formula, with 15% distributed competitively under SPRANS. Additionally, 12.75% of funds above $600 million are reserved for CISS, with state allocations based on the proportion of low-income children in each state. The Maternal and Child Health Services Block Grant distributes funds to states based on historical allocations and the number of low-income children. States must match federal funds, limit administrative costs, and maintain funding levels. Funds are awarded quarterly and must be used within two fiscal years. The Maternal and Child Health Services Block Grant distributes funds to states based on historical allocations and the number of low-income children. States must match federal funds, limit administrative costs, and maintain funding levels. Funds are awarded quarterly and must be used within two fiscal years. If a state does not apply for block grant funds or is not qualified, its allotment is redistributed among other states. 15% of the grant is awarded competitively to organizations for SPRANS. SPRANS also receives additional funding for specific programs like Family to Family Information Centers. The CISS program is initiated when the MCH Services Block Grant appropriation exceeds $600 million, with 12.75% set aside for CISS. Funds are distributed competitively to organizations focusing on high infant mortality rate areas. The MCH Services Block Grant program is authorized to receive $850 million annually, with $638.2 million appropriated for FY2016. The President's budget requested $638.2 million for FY2017, but full-year appropriations have yet to be enacted. Funding for the MCH Services Block Grant was $638.2 million in FY2016, with a peak of $731.3 million in FY2002. Federal funding has decreased by $93.1 million since then, but new Title V programs under the ACA may offset this decrease. States must provide $3 for every $4 of federal funding for MCH services. The MCH Services Block Grant funding is not solely determined by federal funding; states must provide $3 for every $4 of federal block grant funding. Other local, state, or federal funds can also support MCH activities. Certain MCH programs generate income through insurance payments and Medicaid reimbursements. Reporting mechanisms required by law include a needs assessment, an annual report, and an independent audit every two years. HRSA must report to Congress on activities under the SPRANS and CISS programs, as well as provide a summary of state reports on block grant funding. HRSA has developed national performance measures for MCH in coordination with states and grantees. The Title V Information System (TVIS) was introduced in 1998 to collect and publicly report state-level Title V data. States report annually on their progress towards achieving 18 National Performance Measures (NPMs) since 2011. Changing trends in MCH risk factors and advances in scientific knowledge led to the design of these measures. The Maternal and Child Health Bureau (MCHB) designed a new performance measurement system with three tiers: NPMs, NOMs, and ESMs. States select 8 out of 15 NPMs for programmatic focus during a five-year reporting cycle. The system aims to increase flexibility, reduce reporting burden, and enhance accountability for states. The Maternal and Child Health Bureau's performance measurement system allows states to choose eight NPMs for focus and develop actionable ESMs to increase accountability. States must submit annual reports on Title V activities in a standardized format, including program participation, maternal and child health measures, and progress towards national objectives. The Maternal and Child Health Bureau's performance measurement system allows states to choose NPMs for focus and develop actionable ESMs to increase accountability. States report on program participation, maternal and child health measures, and progress towards national objectives. States also identify priority needs in their strategic plans, such as family support services, oral health services, childhood obesity prevention, mental health systems, and services for children with disabilities. The Title V block grant requires states to report the number of individuals served and expenditures by service categories. Maternal and child health measures include data on maternal mortality rates, infant mortality rates, and vaccination rates. HRSA differentiates between health performance and outcome measures, such as breastfeeding, oral health care, suicide rate, and teenage birth rate. The Title V block grant mandates states to report on maternal and child health indicators, including infant mortality rates, vaccination rates, and teenage birth rates. States must also report workforce data on healthcare providers and access to prenatal care for pregnant women. States are required to report on maternal and child health indicators, including infant mortality rates, vaccination rates, and teenage birth rates for the Title V block grant. HRSA compiles this information annually and presents it to Congress, including data on funded projects and other health measures reported by states. In FY2014, 59 states and jurisdictions received MCH Services Block Grant Funding, serving 2.0 million pregnant women, 36.9 million children (aged 1 to 22), including 2.7 million children with special health care needs. Additionally, 3.7 million infants and 7.7 million others received services funded by the block grant. Figure 4 illustrates the proportion of individuals served nationally by the MCH Services Block Grant, with nearly 50.4 million persons served by Title V programs. The largest category served are children aged 1 to 22, followed by women of childbearing age. Title V programs, such as the MCH Services Block Grant, serve a variety of individuals including children aged 1 to 22, women of childbearing age, infants, children with special health care needs, and pregnant women. In FY2012, 33% of pregnant women receiving Title V-funded services had private health insurance, 56% were on Medicaid, and 4% had no insurance. For children aged 1 to 22 receiving services, 34% were on Medicaid, 4% on CHIP, 29% had private insurance, and 6% had no insurance. Insurance status was unknown for some recipients. Insurance coverage status was unknown for 27% of children receiving Title V-funded services. Federal block grant funds must be used for primary and preventive care for children with special health care needs. State matching funds and other sources of maternal and child health funding provide flexibility for states to allocate funds as needed. State funds are not required to follow the same allocation requirements as federal funds. Selected national and state indicators of maternal and child health are presented. The report presents state indicators of maternal and child health, along with data from the CDC for comparison. Selected measures are based on the goals of the MCH Services Block Grant. These indicators provide examples of how maternal and child health is measured and discussed in relation to funding. Title V funding is just one factor influencing health outcomes for low-income children and families. The National Survey of Children's Health measures access to quality healthcare through insurance coverage, preventive care visits, unmet healthcare needs, and having a medical home. In 2011-2012, almost 95% of children had insurance coverage. According to the 2011-2012 National Survey of Children's Health, almost 95% of children have health insurance coverage, with variations by race, ethnicity, and poverty status. For example, 81% of children in households at or below the federal poverty level have insurance, compared to 99% in households at 400% or more of the poverty level. Hispanic children have a 90% coverage rate, while non-Hispanic white and black children have rates of 96% and 95% respectively. Infant mortality rate is used as an indicator for children's health status. Recent data reported to HRSA by the states show variability in infant mortality rates (IMR) by state and region. IMR is higher in the South and Midwest, with Mississippi having the highest rate (9.97 per 1,000 live births) and New Hampshire the lowest (3.95 per 1,000 live births) in 2008. Factors such as teenage births, prematurity, and inadequate prenatal care contribute to higher IMR, especially among low-income families. Medicaid-eligible populations tend to have higher IMR rates according to HRSA data. According to HRSA data, infant mortality rates are higher among Medicaid-eligible populations. Disparities in infant mortality between Medicaid-enrolled women and those not in the program vary widely by state. Prenatal care is crucial for maternal and child health, with late or no prenatal care leading to complications like low birth weight. Rates of pregnant women entering prenatal care in the first trimester are generally higher among non-Medicaid populations compared to those enrolled in Medicaid, with variations by state. In 2012, prenatal care rates varied by state, with Maine showing 92% of pregnant women receiving care in the first trimester. In Georgia, only 45% received care in the first trimester. Barriers to early prenatal care include lack of insurance, access to providers, and transportation, especially among racial and ethnic minorities and Medicaid enrollees. Overall, 84% of children had one preventive health care visit in the year preceding the 2011-2012 National Survey of Children's Health. Racial and ethnic disparities were observed, with non-Hispanic white children having the highest rate (86%) of preventive health care visits, followed by non-Hispanic black children (84%), and Hispanic children with the lowest rate (81%). Uninsured children were less likely to receive preventive health care (54%) compared to those covered by public insurance (84%) and privately insured children (88%). Children with special health care needs may face challenges in accessing preventive and health care services, as well as additional services beyond preventive care. They are more likely to have injuries requiring medical attention, which can create financial burdens for families. Medicaid or CHIP may provide coverage for these children, who are more likely to have health insurance. In the 2009-2010 National Survey of Children with Special Health Care Needs, 76% did not report any unmet needs for services. In the 2009-2010 National Survey of Children with Special Health Care Needs, 76% did not report any unmet needs for services. However, children with no insurance had a higher proportion of unmet health care needs compared to children with insurance. Family-centered care for children with special health care needs involves shared decision-making and various components like time spent with providers, attentiveness, sensitivity to values, and being a partner in the child's health care. The 2009-2010 National Survey of Children with Special Health Care Needs showed that families with insurance were more likely to receive family-centered care. Medical homes, providing access to primary care providers and a care team, have improved health care for children with special needs. However, access to medical homes varies widely across states. Access to care for children with special health care needs varies across states. State toll-free hotlines provide Medicaid enrollment information to facilitate access to maternal and child health services. In 2012, these hotlines received 1.3 million calls. The Maternal and Child Health Services Block Grant consists of block grants and discretionary grant programs to improve access to health care and achieve national health objectives. This approach allows states flexibility in reaching maternal and child health goals while maintaining national guidance. The Maternal and Child Health Services Block Grant, overseen by HRSA, aims to optimize federal and state resources to provide services to millions of children, including those with Medicaid or CHIP coverage. Changes under the ACA may impact the grant's reach, but policymakers see it as crucial during this transition period. The MCH formula block grant and its discretionary grants play a vital role in ensuring continuity of care and reducing coverage gaps due to shifts in insurance eligibility. States may argue for redirecting block grant funds to meet maternal and child health goals, especially if Medicaid and CHIP coverage expands. Concerns about federal funds addressing state-specific issues rather than national concerns exist, but Congress has addressed this with the SPRANS set-aside. States are best suited to use block grant funds where there is wide variability in burden and cost, such as filling gaps left by Medicaid and CHIP. Title V funding, along with other federal and state programs like Medicaid and WIC, impact the health of low-income children and families. Progress towards national health objectives, such as reducing infant mortality, has stagnated in recent years due to varying circumstances and societal issues. It is challenging to track the direct impact of maternal and child health block grant funds globally. It is difficult to globally track the impact of maternal and child health block grant funds on national health indicators like infant mortality rate (IMR). Congress and the executive branch cannot mandate states to focus on IMR with block grant funding. Alternative programs like Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting Program, Strong Start, and CDC's Safe Motherhood and Infant Health program are promoted as direct approaches to improving this health objective. Healthy Start, a national program targeting infant mortality rate in specific communities, has shown success. Critics argue that the decentralized nature of block grants hinders program performance measurement and accountability. The ACA added provisions to Title V, including the Abstinence Education program which provides funding to states for abstinence education. Most provisions created under the ACA had mandatory appropriations for FY2010 through FY2014. The Postpartum Depression program was authorized but remains unfunded. The ACA provided funding for abstinence education programs to states, with appropriations of $50 million per year from FY2010 to FY2014. The Title V Abstinence Education block grant was extended through FY2015 and increased to $75 million per year for FY2016 and FY2017. Additionally, the Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting Programs received a total of $1.5 billion in funding. The ACA allocated $1.5 billion for the home visitation grant program from FY2010 to FY2017. Funding was extended through FY2015 and included grants for research, evaluation, and services to tribal entities. The program is administered by the Administration for Children and Families and the Maternal and Child Health Bureau at HRSA. The program provides grants for research on postpartum depression and related conditions, funded by the ACA. The Personal Responsibility Education program educates adolescents on abstinence, contraception, and adulthood preparation subjects. The Personal Responsibility Education program covers various subjects such as healthy relationships, adolescent development, financial literacy, parent-child communication, educational and career success, and healthy life skills. The program was initially funded at $75 million annually for five fiscal years, with extensions granted in subsequent legislation. The Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 extended PREP funding through FY2017 at $75 million per year. The Maternal and Child Health Bureau funds over 700 projects annually through discretionary grants. The Maternal and Child Health Bureau (MCHB) funds over 700 projects annually through discretionary grants, with performance measures captured electronically in the DGIS system. MCHB is planning to revise the performance measures requirements for its programs to better measure progress towards program goals, aligning with the Title V Block Grant. The notice of changes in DGIS was published in the Federal Register on March 15, 2016. The Maternal and Child Health Bureau (MCHB) is revising performance measures for its programs funded through discretionary grants to align with the Title V Block Grant. The changes aim to accurately capture the scope of services provided and reduce the number of performance measures required from grantees. The revised data collection structure will provide a more detailed picture of services offered by grant programs administered by MCHB."
