The Home Buyer Tax Credit Act of 2009 allows a one-time tax credit for the purchase of a principal residence. If a credit is claimed for one residence, no credit can be claimed for another residence in the same taxable year by the same individual or spouse.

Exceptions include the taxpayer's death or involuntary conversion of the residence.
