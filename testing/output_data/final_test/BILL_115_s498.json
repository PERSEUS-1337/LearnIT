    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Battlefield Excellence through Superior Training Practices Act\" or the \"BEST Practices Act.\" The Department of Defense has made significant progress in medical training and troop protection, resulting in decreased battlefield fatalities. However, they still use over 8,500 live animals annually for training purposes, despite the civilian sector transitioning to more advanced human-based training methods. Human-based medical training, like simulators, can replicate human anatomy for better practice and data collection. Medical simulation replicates human anatomy for practice and data collection, increasing patient safety and reducing errors by healthcare providers. The Department of Defense is developing high-fidelity simulators to replace live animal-based training for battlefield medical procedures. The Department of Defense aims to replace live animal-based training with high-fidelity simulators for battlefield medical procedures by specific deadlines. Various branches have already implemented policies to phase out animal use in training courses. The Department of Defense replaced animal use in medical training with simulators for battlefield procedures by specific deadlines. The Coast Guard also reduced animal use for combat trauma training courses. SEC. 3. REQUIREMENT TO USE HUMAN-BASED METHODS FOR CERTAIN MEDICAL TRAINING. The Secretary of Defense is required to develop human-based training methods for combat trauma injuries by October 1, 2020, with the goal of replacing animal-based methods by October 1, 2022. The Secretary may exempt specific commands or training methods from using human-based training if they are not equivalent to live animal-based methods. Any exemption is valid for up to one year and can be renewed. The Secretary must submit annual reports to Congress on the development of human-based training for combat trauma injuries. The curr_chunk discusses the definition of combat trauma injuries and human-based training methods for medical treatment. Combat trauma injuries include severe injuries likely to occur during combat, such as hemorrhage, tension pneumothorax, blast injury resulting in amputation, airway compromises, and other injuries. Human-based training methods refer to using systems and devices like simulators instead of animals for training individuals in medical treatment. The curr_chunk discusses various training methods for medical treatment, including simulators, partial task trainers, moulage, simulated combat environments, human cadavers, and rotations in trauma centers. Partial task trainers are defined as aids for learning specific medical procedures. The curr_chunk focuses on the use of human-based methods for certain medical training in 2017."
