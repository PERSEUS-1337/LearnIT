AUTOMATED DRIVING SYSTEM CYBERSECURITY ADVISORY COUNCIL.\" is a condensed summary of a specific section related to an automated driving system cybersecurity advisory council. The Secretary of Transportation will establish an Automated Driving System Cybersecurity Advisory Council within the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, consisting of diverse members appointed for three-year terms. The Automated Driving System Cybersecurity Advisory Council, established by the Secretary of Transportation, consists of members appointed for three-year terms. Vacancies are filled in the same manner as the original appointment, and the Council's duties include information gathering, developing technical advice, and presenting best practices to the Secretary on cybersecurity for automated driving systems. The Council also provides recommendations on supply chain risk management, interactions with Information Sharing and Analysis Centers, and implementing recalls of motor vehicles or equipment. The Automated Driving System Cybersecurity Advisory Council's recommendations are reported to Congress and must adhere to the Federal Advisory Committee Act. The Secretary can provide technical assistance and detail federal employees to assist the Council in its duties. The Automated Driving System Cybersecurity Advisory Council members serve without pay, except for travel and per diem expenses. The Council will terminate 6 years after the enactment of the Act. Definitions include \"automated driving system\" as hardware and software capable of performing the dynamic driving task, and \"dynamic driving task\" as the functions required to operate a vehicle in traffic. The term \"highly automated vehicle\" refers to a vehicle capable of performing key driving functions in traffic, such as motion control, environment monitoring, response execution, maneuver planning, and enhancing visibility. The term \"highly automated vehicle\" refers to a motor vehicle equipped with an automated driving system, excluding commercial vehicles. The term \"operational design domain\" specifies the conditions under which a driving automation system is designed to operate. If SAE International revises certain definitions in Recommended Practice Report J3016, updates will be made. The Secretary must notify SAE International of any revisions to the definitions in Recommended Practice Report J3016. If the Secretary determines that a new definition does not meet motor vehicle safety needs or is inconsistent with the law, they can reject it. The Secretary may update definitions in Recommended Practice Report J3016, and if a revised definition by SAE International is not rejected, the Secretary must make necessary amendments without following section 553 of title 5, United States Code. The Secretary may update definitions in Recommended Practice Report J3016 if materially changed circumstances regarding highly automated vehicles impact motor vehicle safety."
