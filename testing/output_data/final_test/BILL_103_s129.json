Chapter 50 of the United States Code defines criminal offenses committed outside the country by members of the armed forces or individuals serving with them. It includes definitions such as the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States and what constitutes a criminal offense. Sec. 992 of the United States Code addresses criminal offenses committed by members of the armed forces or individuals serving with them outside the country. It states that individuals engaging in conduct that would be a criminal offense within the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States will be subject to the same punishment as provided under title 18. Sec. 992 of the United States Code outlines that individuals employed by the armed forces outside the US may not be prosecuted for offenses if they are not US nationals and were appointed in the country where the offense occurred. Prosecution under this section is prohibited if a foreign government has already prosecuted the individual for the same offense, unless approved by the Attorney General. The Attorney General or designated officials may approve prosecution for offenses prohibited under Sec. 992. The Secretary of Defense can authorize armed forces members to apprehend and detain individuals outside the US for criminal offenses. The text discusses the process of apprehending and detaining individuals for criminal offenses outside the US. It outlines that individuals can be released to US authorities for judicial proceedings unless they are delivered to a foreign country or pending court-martial. Additionally, it mentions the authorization for armed forces members to deliver individuals to foreign authorities upon request. The text outlines the conditions under which a person can be delivered to a foreign country for trial, as requested by the appropriate authorities and authorized by international agreements. The Secretary of Defense can detain the individual until the trial is completed, and determines the foreign country's appropriate authorities. \"Criminal offenses committed outside the United States can lead to trial in a foreign country as per international agreements.\""
