    "content": "One of the key features of the 1996 welfare reform law was its focus on promoting work and job preparation for parents in needy families with children through the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) block grant. While TANF does not explicitly require adult recipients to work in exchange for cash assistance, it does establish work participation standards for states. TANF's work rules, established in the 1996 welfare reform law, focus on promoting work and job preparation for parents in needy families with children. States determine work requirements and activities to meet those standards, with a shift in context due to decreased cash assistance rolls since the late 1980s. In FY2011, cash assistance rolls decreased to 1.9 million families. State TANF welfare-to-work efforts targeted around 1.3 million adults monthly. This report analyzes work participation standards for TANF cash assistance recipients, reviews effective welfare-to-work programs, and discusses TANF work provisions and participation data in FY2011. In the early 20th century, many states had laws providing aid to mothers with dependent children, known as \"mothers' pensions,\" to prevent the breakup of families when the breadwinner passed away or became disabled. By 1921, 40 states and the territories of Alaska and Hawaii had these pension laws. By 1921, 40 states and territories had laws supporting widows and women with disabled or absent husbands. Eligibility varied by state, with limited budgets leading to partial operation of programs. The Great Depression worsened the situation, causing many counties to reduce or eliminate aid programs. By 1935, the number of eligible families far exceeded those receiving assistance. President Franklin D. Roosevelt established the Committee on Economic Security in 1934 to address the lack of support under state programs and increased demand for financial help during the Great Depression. The CES proposed the nation's first federal social insurance program, including aid for children without a father's support. They recommended federal grants-in-aid to allow mothers to focus on caring for their children. The Committee on Economic Security proposed a program to provide financial assistance to mothers to stay at home with their children. This led to the establishment of the Aid to Dependent Children program (ADC) under the Social Security Act of 1935, providing cash assistance to needy families with children deprived of parental support. The program aimed to enable mothers, typically widows, to rear their children at home. The Aid to Dependent Children program (ADC) was established under the Social Security Act of 1935 to provide financial assistance to mothers, typically widows, to stay at home and care for their children. The program's demographic shifted over time, with an increase in female-headed families headed by divorced, separated, or never-married mothers, as well as changes in Social Security policy benefiting widows, widowers, and child survivors. The Social Security Amendments of 1939 expanded the Aid to Dependent Children program, leading to a shift in demographics with more nonwhite families and women who were divorced, separated, or unmarried. Some states imposed rules barring \"employable\" mothers from aid. In the 1950s, there was a focus on self-sufficiency and rehabilitation of public aid recipients as female workforce participation increased. Norms for middle-class mothers changed regarding child-rearing and work, diminishing the assumption that women should stay at home with their children. In the 1950s, amendments to the ADC law focused on self-sufficiency and rehabilitation of public aid recipients. The 1956 amendments aimed to provide financial assistance while helping parents achieve maximum self-support and independence. Disability Insurance was also added to the Social Security program, potentially aiding families who would otherwise rely on ADC for benefits. In the 1960s, the focus on self-sufficiency progressed from symbolic statements to federal program requirements. President Kennedy called for amending the ADC program to include children of the unemployed during a recession. States had to ensure unemployed parents were registered for job placement services to receive assistance. In the 1960s, the ADC program began to include work requirements for families receiving assistance, emphasizing self-sufficiency. President Kennedy advocated for services over cash assistance, leading to the program's name change to Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) in 1962. The Social Security Amendments of 1967 introduced financial incentives for adult recipients to work and requirements for AFDC. The amendments in the 1960s introduced financial incentives and work requirements for AFDC recipients, including the creation of the Work Incentive Program (WIN) for fathers and optional participation for mothers. By 1971, all parents were required to enroll in WIN, except mothers with children under six. In the 1980s, states were given the option to implement \"workfare\" programs through Community Work Experience Programs (CWEP) under the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981. The Family Support Act of 1988 further evolved AFDC work requirements. The Family Support Act of 1988 (P.L. 100-485) replaced the Work Incentive Program (WIN) with the Job Opportunity and Basic Skills (JOBS) Training Program, which aimed to provide job training, education, and quick job acquisition for AFDC recipients. It lowered the age-of-youngest-child exemption to three years, increased funding for child care, and mandated minimum participation rates for states to receive federal funding. JOBS also emphasized education by requiring states to offer education to adults without a high school diploma. The welfare system underwent significant changes in the mid-1990s with the signing of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996, replacing AFDC with the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program. TANF introduced work-related requirements for both states and recipients, reflecting a shift towards work incentives and supports. The negative income tax experiments in the 1960s-1980s showed reduced work effort and increased marital dissolutions. The TANF program was influenced by research on welfare duration and welfare-to-work initiatives in the 1980s-1990s. Long-term welfare receipt raised concerns about dependency, with some families relying on benefits for extended periods. Studies showed that a significant portion of recipients received benefits for 10 years or more in their lifetime. This raised questions about whether welfare had become a long-term lifestyle rather than a temporary solution for events like job loss or divorce. Welfare-to-work programs in the 1980s were evaluated through social experiments to test their effectiveness. The evaluation of welfare-to-work programs in the 1980s through social experiments found that mandatory participation programs emphasizing job search had positive impacts. Unpaid work experience programs like \"workfare\" had limited positive employment effects but provided value in public service. The period between the Family Support Act of 1988 and PRWORA in 1996 saw a surge in experimentation on welfare-to-work approaches. The Family Support Act of 1988 authorized the National Evaluation of Welfare-to-Work Strategies (NEWWS) study to examine the impact of 11 mandatory welfare-to-work programs. These programs took different approaches to help recipients find work. States also conducted their own evaluations as a condition of receiving waivers under the Social Security Act. Key initiatives that influenced welfare reform included allowing recipients to work low-paying jobs while still receiving benefits, implementing time limits on benefit receipt, and enhancing sanctions for noncompliance. The Family Support Act of 1988 led to welfare-to-work experiments like California's GAIN program, which focused on skill-building and employment. Riverside's GAIN program was cost-effective and had the highest taxpayer return among six counties studied. The NEWWS evaluation studied impacts of welfare-to-work programs from mid-1991 through the end of 1994. Riverside's program increased earnings by $3,113 for the experimental group, a 49% gain over the control group. Mandatory work participation reduced welfare received but did not raise incomes. Different strategies were evaluated, including job search and education-focused programs in Atlanta, Grand Rapids, and Riverside. The NEWWS evaluation found that both labor force attachment and education-focused programs had positive impacts on employment and reduced welfare receipt. Over five years, labor force attachment programs had larger impacts, especially for those without a high school diploma. Adult basic education activities did not result in positive employment impacts. The NEWWS evaluation found positive impacts on employment and reduced welfare receipt from both labor force attachment and education-focused programs. While some programs did not modify for student needs, positive impacts were seen for those who pursued post-secondary education after receiving a GED, particularly in Portland's \"mixed\" program model. Despite success in raising employment rates and earnings, none of the programs, including Portland's, were able to increase incomes. Several programs in Portland succeeded in raising incomes by combining mandatory work participation with policies that allowed recipients to remain on welfare at higher earnings levels. The earnings supplement programs, such as Minnesota's Family Investment Program, were effective in increasing work and reducing poverty. Additionally, the MFIP program examined the impact on child development and found some positive outcomes. The New Hope program in Milwaukee, WI, from 1994 to 1998 aimed to increase income and improve child development for adults in targeted neighborhoods living below 150% of the poverty line. The program's philosophy focused on providing full-time work opportunities, ensuring full-time workers are not poor, and increasing pay for more hours worked. Positive impacts on child development were observed, but the additional welfare payments needed to supplement earnings were a budgetary concern. The New Hope program in Milwaukee aimed to increase income and improve child development for adults living below 150% of the poverty line. Participants were provided with job assistance, earnings supplements, health insurance, and child care subsidies. The program aimed to ensure that full-time work would make people financially better off than welfare. New Hope program in Milwaukee provided job assistance, community service jobs, and income supplements to increase earnings and employment for participants. The program also had positive impacts on child development. Participants experienced reduced poverty even after the program ended, although impacts faded over time. The New Hope program in Milwaukee offered job assistance, community service jobs, and income supplements to boost earnings and employment for participants. It had lasting positive effects on child development and reduced poverty even after the program ended. However, the current system of aid for low-income families lacks key elements of New Hope, such as an emphasis on full-time work and publicly-funded community service jobs when other employment opportunities are scarce. The system lacks publicly-funded community service jobs for TANF recipients, despite funds being available for them. Research post-1996 welfare reform focused on those leaving cash assistance, with studies examining employment outcomes and program innovations. Studies conducted post-1996 welfare reform focused on the employment outcomes of individuals leaving cash assistance. Research examined factors such as work status, earnings, government benefits received, and return to assistance rolls. Majority of leavers transitioned to employment, with consistent employment rates in the following quarters after exiting welfare. After leaving welfare, between 30% and 40% of individuals worked consistently in the second, third, and fourth quarters. However, some return to welfare due to lack of steady work. Approximately 20% of leavers returned to welfare in the fourth quarter. Follow-up studies on welfare-to-work initiatives have shown mixed results, with ongoing experimental studies to improve program impacts, such as the Employment Retention and Advancement (ERA) project. The Employment Retention and Advancement (ERA) project tested initiatives to improve employment stability and advancement for welfare recipients. It found that providing earnings supplements combined with employment services could lead to positive earning impacts, including employment retention. Community-based organizations or for-profit providers of employment services also showed positive employment impacts. Programs combining work with education for welfare recipients did not result in positive employment impacts. Some ERA sites focused on hard-to-serve populations, including disadvantaged groups beyond the TANF cash assistance population. Programs testing approaches like subsidized \"transitional jobs\" provided income boosts and employment to participants, but no long-term impacts on employment or earnings were found. A program in New York City focused on cash assistance recipients with disabilities, resulting in positive earnings impacts and reduced cash assistance, although employment rates were lower than the general cash assistance population. HHS is conducting four additional experimental studies focusing on TANF assistance recipients or related populations with pending impact findings. The ISISS project will test the \"career pathways\" model to move participants into better paying jobs. HPOG evaluates career pathways in the health care sector for TANF recipients and low-income individuals. STED examines subsidized employment models, while JSA measures the impact of job search services in TANF programs. The 1996 welfare reform law (the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996, P.L. 104-193) replaced Aid to Families with Dependent Children with Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), which included welfare-to-work requirements. States had already implemented work requirements and sanctions for noncompliance before TANF was enacted. The Clinton Administration granted welfare waivers to 43 states, allowing them to create their own welfare-to-work approaches. TANF represents a significant change in social policy, but its welfare-to-work aspects continue the evolution of such policies. The Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program is a block grant that provides funds to states to support cash welfare programs for needy families with children. States must meet a maintenance of effort requirement and have flexibility to achieve goals such as assisting families in caring for children at home and reducing dependence on government assistance. The Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program aims to promote job preparation, work, marriage, prevent out-of-wedlock pregnancies, and encourage two-parent families. States have flexibility in using TANF funds to achieve these goals, with varying benefit amounts across states. The Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program provides cash assistance with varying amounts across states, ranging from $170 in Mississippi to $923 in Alaska. Recipients must cooperate in establishing paternity and enforcing child support orders. TANF funds can support work through tax credits, transportation assistance, and child care funding. Cash welfare accounts for less than 30% of all TANF funds, with a decline in cash assistance since TANF's creation in 1994. Since the creation of TANF in 1994, cash assistance expenditures have significantly decreased from $22.7 billion to $9.6 billion by FY2011. TANF cash assistance was received by 1.9 million families per month in FY2011, with 1.3 million work-eligible adults. Work-eligible individuals under TANF are adult recipients of cash assistance or non-recipient parents of children receiving aid who are expected to work. In FY2011, 61% of families receiving TANF assistance included a work-eligible individual, while 39% did not. Most TANF families with a work-eligible individual are single-parent families, comprising 55% of all TANF families. TANF provides assistance to disadvantaged families with children, mainly single mothers with young children. Work-eligible individuals often have lower educational attainment and two-thirds are minorities. In FY2011, 84% of TANF work-eligible individuals were women, with 76% of them never married and over one-third under 25 years old. Men were more likely to be married and older, with a large share not completing high school. In 2011, 13% of men age 25 and older lacked a high school diploma or equivalent. TANF work requirements are conditions for receiving federal block grant funds, including program rules for recipients and numerical performance standards for states. The national data files do not include information on barriers to employment like physical or mental impairments, substance abuse, or criminal records. The federal TANF law has three work-related requirements for adult or teen parent recipients: employability assessment, engagement in work within 24 months, and sanctions for non-compliance. States must assess skills and work experience within 90 days of eligibility determination and may develop an Individual Responsibility Plan (IRP) with employment goals. IRPs are optional for states but can result in sanctions for non-compliance. States must engage each parent or caretaker adult in work within 24 months of eligibility for TANF benefits. Failure to comply may result in sanctions, determined by the state, which can include reducing or terminating benefits for non-compliance with work requirements. Under TANF, states can sanction families for not complying with work requirements, leading to the suspension or termination of the family grant. Single parents with a child under six cannot be sanctioned for lack of affordable child care if they can prove unavailability of suitable options. The incidence of sanctions in TANF programs is discussed in the \"Sanctions\" section. In TANF programs, sanctions can be imposed for non-compliance with work requirements, resulting in grant suspension or termination. The work status of TANF work-eligible individuals in FY2011 showed that 42% were either employed or engaged in job preparation activities, with 21% in unsubsidized jobs and 21% in other work or preparation. The majority (58%) had no participation in activities. The overall engagement rate was less than 50% in any given month. The TANF program requires states to ensure a specified percentage of their caseload is participating in work requirements, set at 50% (90% for two-parent households). Despite low engagement rates, states did not necessarily fail their official work participation standards. The overall rate of engagement is a monthly snapshot of work or job preparation activities, with some recipients potentially engaged in activities in earlier or later months. The TANF program requires states to ensure a specified percentage of their caseload is participating in work requirements, set at 50% (90% for two-parent households). Despite low engagement rates, states did not necessarily fail their official work participation standards. Activities measured over a period greater than one month may show higher engagement than monthly snapshots. Reasons for no reported participation include being a newcomer, completing an activity, state exemptions, good cause for not engaging, non-compliance with work requirements, or not yet engaged by the state. The most common activity for TANF work-eligible individuals is working while receiving assistance. States have varying rules for families with a working adult. States have different rules for families with a working adult on TANF. Some states disregard earnings for a period, others provide income supplements for low earners. There are time-limited earnings supplements for families who left cash assistance. New applicants have stricter rules than those already receiving assistance. Table 2 shows participation in work activities among TANF work-eligible individuals in FY2011. Participation in work activities among TANF work-eligible individuals in FY2011 varied little between men and women. Rates were lower for those without a high school diploma and for certain demographics such as teen parents and older women. African-American women had higher participation rates compared to other races. In FY2011, participation rates among TANF work-eligible men showed little variation by the age of the youngest child in the family. Asian and Pacific Islander men had higher participation rates compared to other races. Participation under TANF was considerably higher than pre-TANF programs, with an increase in regular unsubsidized employment and other activities. Total participation remained stable from FY2000 to FY2011. In FY2000-FY2011, total TANF participation remained stable. Employment rates were higher in earlier years, offset by increased engagement in other activities. States determine sanctions for non-compliance with work requirements, with flexibility in defining \"good cause\" for non-participation. Sanctions for non-compliance with work requirements in TANF programs can range from partial reductions to lifetime ineligibility. More states are now closing cases for families who do not meet work requirements, with the number of jurisdictions doing so increasing from 8 to 23 between FY2001 and FY2011. This trend is reflected in data on sanctioned families and those leaving the TANF rolls. In FY2001, about 4.6% of families on TANF rolls were sanctioned for non-compliance with work requirements, while 6.5% of families leaving the rolls had their cases closed for the same reason. The overall sanction rate was 4.8%, with an increase in the number and percentage of families leaving the rolls due to sanctions by FY2011. In FY2011, 24,000 families were sanctioned off TANF rolls per month, representing 15.4% of all case closures. The Claims Resolution Act of 2010 required states to report on work participation and examine work-eligible individuals with zero hours of participation. HHS found that 16.7% of these individuals were either sanctioned or in the process of being sanctioned. The focus is on TANF's work participation standards for assessing state welfare-to-work programs. The TANF work participation standards are set in federal law and include target participation rates, rules for disregarding certain families, and minimum hours requirements. States failing to meet these rates risk penalties through a reduction in their block grant. The standards measure state performance in engaging recipients in work activities and reinforce the policy goal of work in exchange for welfare assistance. This section describes the detailed rules of the TANF work participation standard and provides data on the number of families included in FY2011. The TANF work participation standards set minimum work requirements for states to meet, with specific percentages of families engaged in work activities for a minimum number of hours. States can receive credits for caseload reduction or exceeding spending requirements. The TANF work participation standards allow states to receive credits for caseload reduction and exceeding spending requirements. States can reduce their work participation standards based on the percentage of caseload reduction achieved, including excess MOE spending. For example, a 25% caseload reduction would reduce the work participation standard from 50% to 25%. The TANF work participation standards in FY2011 ranged from 0% to 50%. 23 states had a 0% standard, 2 states had a standard from 1% to 9.9%, 8 states had a standard from 10% to 19.9%, and so on. South Dakota and Guam faced the full 50% participation standard. Figure 10 will compare these standards with actual work participation rates achieved. The TANF work participation rate is calculated by comparing the state's rate to the effective standard. It is a percentage of families engaged in work divided by the total number of families in the calculation. Not all families receiving cash assistance are included, only those funded by federal TANF or state MOE funds. The report details the rules for computing the rate and provides FY2011 data on family participation. Certain families receiving TANF assistance are excluded from the work participation rate calculation, such as those without a work-eligible individual, single parents caring for a child under one year old (limited to 12 months), families in tribal programs, and those under sanction for noncompliance. Figure 4 illustrates the percentage of families included in the rate calculation. After excluding certain families from the work participation rate calculation, about 54% of TANF assistance families are included. Single-parent families with infants accounted for 5.9% of all TANF families and 80% of those disregarded from the rate. Families under sanction make up 1.5% of all TANF families, while participation in tribal work programs is a small but significant factor in some states like North Dakota. States have the authority to determine exemptions for individual recipients. States have the authority to determine exemptions for individual recipients from work requirements in TANF. Work-eligible individuals must engage in specific activities for a minimum number of hours per week to meet the work participation standard. Federal law lists 12 categories of activities that count towards meeting TANF work participation standards, with HHS regulations defining the specific types of activities under each category. The 12 categories of activities for TANF work participation standards are comprehensive, including education and rehabilitative activities. Pre-employment activities like job search and education have limitations on counting towards the participation standard. Unsubsidized employment was the most common work activity in FY2011. In FY2011, unsubsidized employment was the most common work activity for TANF work-eligible individuals, followed by job search, readiness, and vocational educational training. States receive credit towards their work participation standard for working families on assistance, encouraging them to provide earnings supplements for a limited period of time. This approach tends to increase work participation and raise family incomes. In FY2011, TANF earnings supplements increased work participation and family incomes. However, the smaller caseload limited the reach of TANF earnings supplements compared to pre-1996 programs. Other programs like EITC, ACTC, SNAP also supplement earnings for low-income working families. Subsidized employment rates for TANF work-eligible individuals were low in FY2011. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 established a fund for subsidized employment in TANF welfare-to-work programs, but most activity occurred in FY2010. It is unclear how the funds were used for those on assistance rolls versus those not receiving TANF. Subsidized employment for those not on the benefit rolls does not count towards TANF work standards. In FY2011, 10.7% of TANF work-eligible individuals were in job search and readiness, while 5.9% were in vocational educational training. These activities are countable for a limited time, with job search and readiness limited to 12 weeks per fiscal year and vocational educational training limited to 12 months in a recipient's lifetime. States have some flexibility in counting job search and readiness in hourly equivalents. The TANF work participation rate includes activities like work experience and community service, which are considered as \"workfare\" where individuals work in exchange for cash assistance. These activities help individuals develop work habits and job skills. Most states have not implemented large-scale workfare programs under TANF. States may count most education and training activities in only a limited way toward the TANF work participation standards. On-the-job training is an exception, where states can count hours spent in this activity under any circumstance. However, engagement in on-the-job training is relatively rare, with only 0.1% of all TANF work-eligible adults participating in FY2011. For adult recipients, educational activities like secondary school completion and job skill training count only under limited circumstances or in combination with other activities. The TANF work participation standards require a minimum number of hours per week in a month for families to be considered participants. The hours vary based on family composition, with single parents needing 20 hours per week for children under six, and more hours for two-parent families. The TANF work participation standards require a minimum number of hours per week for families to meet the standard. In two-parent families, the combined hours of both parents are considered. Certain hours must be in \"core\" activities, while the rest may be in \"supplemental\" activities. HHS regulations clarify that only actual hours count, but there is an excused absence policy. Paid activities are credited for all hours paid, while unpaid activities allow for up to 10 holidays and 80 hours of other excused absences per year. Unpaid activities require daily supervision. In FY2011, families included in the work participation rate were classified based on statutory hours requirements for different family types. Teen parents without a high school diploma could fulfill work engagement through education or related activities. Single parents with young children had specific hour requirements, while two-parent families were also considered. In FY2011, the largest category of families in the TANF participation rate were single parents with a pre-school aged child, followed by single parents with older children. Two-parent families made up a smaller percentage, with very few receiving federally funded child care. Teen parents without a high school diploma also represented a small portion of TANF families included in the participation rate. Teen parents without a high school diploma can be considered engaged in work if they are participating in education related to employment for at least 20 hours per week or making progress towards completing a secondary school program. However, their participation may not count if the state exceeds a cap on education participation. The cap is that no more than 30% of those engaged in work can be through vocational training or education for teen parents. Table 8 shows the engagement of teen parents in work or job preparation, with 15.4% participating in education related to employment. The percentage of teen parents without a high school diploma engaged in education declined with age, from 33.3% for those aged 17 to less than 10% for those aged 19. This indicates a low uptake of the option for states to engage and count teens aged 18 and 19 in education programs. The low rate of take-up on the option for states to engage and count teens aged 18 and 19 through GED programs is reflected. Single-parent families with children under age 6 are more likely to participate in hours compared to those with older children. There is a 7% gap in participation rates for families with zero hours between those with older children and those with preschool-aged children. The participation rates of single-parent families with children under age 6 differ based on hours required, with a higher share participating for 20 hours compared to those with older children. For two-parent families in TANF, only 37.7% had zero hours of participation in FY2011. In FY2011, two-parent families in TANF had varying levels of participation, with 37.7% reporting zero hours. Single-parent families had different requirements, with some falling short of their 20 or 30-hour per week standards. TANF work rules prioritize quick attachment to the labor force for adult recipients. The TANF work rules prioritize quick attachment to the labor force for adult recipients age 20 and older. States can receive credit for recipients combining work with education, with 12 core and supplemental activities listed. Core activities focus on moving families quickly into work, while supplemental activities are education-related. Vocational educational training is creditable for 12 months as a primary TANF activity. In FY2011, only 4.5% of TANF work-eligible individuals participated in both education and work-related activities. Education activities include vocational training, job skills training, work experience, and school attendance for those without a high school diploma. These activities aim to enhance career opportunities, but there are limits on how much can count towards a state's work participation rate. The FY2011 national average work participation rate was 29.5% for all families under TANF. Each jurisdiction's annual work participation rate is compared to its effective standard. Nine jurisdictions, including California and the District of Columbia, failed to meet their all-family work standards in FY2011. In FY2011, nine jurisdictions, including California and the District of Columbia, failed to meet their all-family work standards. There is no clear relationship between a state's effective standard and its participation rate. States have generally faced effective standards lower than 50%, with the work participation rate hovering around 30% since FY2002. The effective TANF all-family work participation standard for states has generally been lower than 50%, with the work participation rate around 30% since FY2002. Caseload reduction and state spending credits impact the effective standard, with some jurisdictions facing a 0% standard in certain years. Guam and South Dakota were the only ones facing the full 50% standard in FY2011. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 changed the credit measurement for caseload reduction from FY2005. The work participation standard was reduced due to caseload reduction, which declined nationally by 57% from FY1995 to FY2005. In FY2007, credits were based on caseload change from FY2005 to FY2006, leading to four jurisdictions facing a zero participation standard. States began relying on excess MOE credits in FY2008, resulting in substantially reduced effective standards. In FY2009, 16 states would not have met their TANF work participation standards without claiming excess MOE credits. The ARRA of 2009 allowed states to freeze caseload reduction credits at pre-recession levels through FY2011. Beginning in FY2012, the freeze on reductions in work participation standards expires, and states will receive credit for caseload changes from FY2005 to FY2011. HHS regulations standardizing the calculation of the excess MOE portion also take effect in FY2012, potentially raising effective participation standards for states with caseload increases or liberal methodologies. The national average TANF work participation rate was 29.5% in FY2011. The national average TANF work participation rate was 29.5% in FY2011, fluctuating around 30% since FY2002. Most families receiving cash assistance are single-parent families, with some two-parent families also receiving aid. Two-parent families have a higher work participation standard of 90%, requiring more hours of participation. Before FY2007, many states aided two-parent families in separate state programs, which were not included in the work participation rate. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 brought these families into the calculation of TANF participation rates, subjecting them to the standards effective in FY2007. Many states then moved these families to solely state-funded programs. Many states moved two-parent families to solely state-funded programs, outside of TANF rules. Some states failed to meet the work participation standard, risking a financial penalty. The penalty starts at 5% of the block grant and increases for subsequent failures. The Secretary of HHS may reduce the penalty based on the severity of the failure. The HHS regulations specify a formula for reducing penalties for states that fail to meet the TANF work participation standards. States can enter into a corrective compliance plan with HHS to avoid or reduce penalties, and the Secretary of HHS may determine if there was \"reasonable cause\" for the failure, potentially avoiding penalties. President George W. Bush's TANF reauthorization proposal aimed to raise the participation standard percentage, end the caseload reduction credit, limit pre-employment activities, and increase the full hours standard. The House passed bills aligning with most of the proposal, while the Senate Finance debated the changes during the 2002-2005 period. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 (P.L. 109-171) made changes to revise the caseload reduction credit, standardize work activities definitions, and require states to verify work participation. Congress may reconsider raising participation standards, as state rates have remained steady at 30% with overall engagement at less than half of all work-eligible individuals. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 made changes to welfare programs, including revising caseload reduction credits and standardizing work activity definitions. Congress may consider raising participation standards, as state rates have remained steady at 30% with overall engagement at less than half of all work-eligible individuals. MDRC noted in 1995 that proposed participation standards were higher than those achieved in any tested programs. President Obama's Administration has not proposed a comprehensive reauthorization of TANF, but provided general principles for Congress to consider. The Administration is willing to work with Congress to strengthen the TANF program by using performance indicators, providing flexibility to states, and addressing various issues related to welfare-to-work programs. This includes discussing changes in economic and policy environments, the experience of subsidized employment programs, innovations in education and workforce programs, and issues regarding TANF implementation. The curr_chunk discusses issues with TANF welfare-to-work programs, particularly regarding the monitoring and assessment of these programs. It highlights how changing employment patterns, such as increased labor force participation of women, have impacted welfare-to-work policies. The text also touches on the complexity of transitioning from childhood to adulthood in today's economy, where longer periods of education are often necessary to meet job demands. Additionally, it mentions policy initiatives treating young adults as youth for benefit purposes. The 1996 welfare reform law treats young adults as youth for benefits. After 2000, labor force participation and employment declined for women aged 20 to 24. Enrollment in educational programs increased for this age group. In 2000, 73.1% of women aged 20 to 24 were in the labor force, with 67.9% employed. By 2007, these rates had declined, with 70.1% in the labor force and 65.0% employed. These trends continued post-recession. The labor force participation and employment rates for women aged 20 to 24 declined after 2000. Educational enrollment for women in this age group increased during the same period. In 2011, the enrollment rate for women aged 20 to 21 rose by 9.1 percentage points, and for women aged 22 to 24, it rose by 6.7 percentage points. The employment and school enrollment rates for young women aged 20 to 24 rose from 25.3% in 2000 to 32.0% in 2011. Changes in employment and education patterns have led to delays in marriage and childbirth. TANF recipients may face educational disadvantages if limits on education counting towards work participation standards are enforced. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 established an emergency fund for TANF recipients. The TANF Emergency Contingency Fund (ECF) provided $5 billion to states, territories, and tribes for increased expenditures in basic assistance, short-term benefits, and subsidized employment. $1.3 billion was used for subsidized employment, supporting 281,000 job placements for low-income parents and youth. The program offered flexibility in job design and was the largest since the 1970s. The TANF ECF provided $5 billion for subsidized employment programs, supporting 281,000 job placements for low-income parents and youth. States and tribes had flexibility in program design, with variations in populations served, types of jobs subsidized, and subsidy structure. Participants in subsidized jobs often did not receive cash assistance or became ineligible for TANF. The program expired on September 30, 2010. After the TANF ECF expired in 2010, many states scaled back or ended subsidized employment programs. New policies in education and training, such as Career Pathway models and integrating adult education with technical skills, have not been tested in welfare-to-work programs. The NEWWS study showed positive impacts on employment for those who completed adult basic education and obtained a GED. The impacts of adult basic education, GED attainment, and post-secondary education are being explored through new program models like the I-Best program in Washington state. \"Drop-out recovery\" programs aim to re-engage high school dropouts in separate settings. Community college programs target low-income students, including parents, with financial incentives for completion. Learning communities and support sessions are also available for disadvantaged students. TANF work participation standards do not prevent cash recipients from participating in these programs. The TANF work participation standards do not prevent cash recipients from participating in support sessions or various education programs. States may hesitate to use these programs if they exceed durational limits or face other restrictions. The Obama Administration aims to work with Congress on performance indicators for program improvement, which can impact welfare-to-work programs indirectly through numerical work participation standards. The TANF work participation standards indirectly impact state welfare-to-work efforts by setting numerical goals to ensure federal goals are met. Performance measures can influence state behavior, with both intended and unintended effects. An alternative to assessing state welfare-to-work performance based on numerical participation standards is to examine program outcomes like job entry or leaving welfare rolls with a job. However, outcome measures can lead to unintended consequences such as \"cream skimming\" and may not directly measure program effectiveness. The effectiveness of a welfare-to-work program can be measured by its impact on participants' employment and earnings. Evaluation research, including random assignment experiments, has strengths and weaknesses in assessing program effectiveness. Multiple measures may be needed to evaluate the effectiveness of TANF's welfare-to-work efforts. TANF's welfare-to-work efforts are evaluated using multiple measures to assess effectiveness. Created in 1996, TANF reflects policy concerns of the 1980s and 1990s regarding welfare receipt and dependency. Emphasizing work and job preparation, TANF aims to transition families from welfare to work quickly, with time-limited job search and less focus on long-term education and training. TANF emphasizes work over long-term education and training, with about 306,500 families participating in work activities in FY2011. Many families are unable to participate due to various reasons like disability, caring for children by non-parent relatives, or immigration status. Work participation standards require states to engage less than 50% of families with a work-eligible member in countable activities. The Congressional Research Service analysis found that welfare reform in 1996 shifted the income safety net to support work for single parent families with children. This change reduced reliance on cash welfare, decreased poverty among children, but child poverty began to rise again in the 2000s. The decline in cash assistance rolls slowed, and child poverty began to increase. Welfare-to-work activity measures remained stagnant from FY2002-FY2011. Knowledge about effective welfare-to-work programs has not significantly changed since welfare reform. Mandatory work requirements and earnings supplements have shown to increase employment and reduce welfare receipt. Post-welfare reform research has not produced similar breakthroughs yet. Policy makers are questioning the effectiveness of current welfare policies. Policy makers are questioning whether the current TANF welfare-to-work efforts are satisfactory or need improvement to address changing needs. TANF has evolved into a broad-based block grant, but the focus remains on work participation rates as the main assessment of program success. There are concerns about whether the assessment of TANF should solely focus on welfare-to-work performance or also consider overall program effectiveness. The report analyzes work participation from the TANF National Data Files for FY2011, which includes demographic and economic data at the family and individual recipient levels. States are required to report monthly data to HHS, including information on average weekly hours of engagement in TANF work activities. The TANF National Data Files provide information on work participation activities, with states reporting engagement in countable activities. Sampling error and potential nonsampling errors may affect data quality. States may revise their data reports, leading to differences in the data used to compute official participation rates. In data analysis for the report, decisions were made to ensure accuracy, such as excluding activities with over 90 hours per week and removing recipients with implausible birth dates. No age was calculated for these individuals."
