They also stated that the Government of Sudan violated the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide. The resolution urged the Administration to consider multilateral intervention if the UN Security Council failed to act and called for targeted sanctions on those responsible for the atrocities in Darfur. The House of Representatives passed H.R. 3127, the Darfur Peace and Accountability Act of 2006, urging international support for the African Union Mission in Sudan, imposing sanctions on individuals responsible for atrocities in Darfur, and offering US support for the region. The United States supports the International Criminal Court's efforts to prosecute those responsible for genocide in Darfur. Former Secretary of State Colin Powell and President George W. Bush both acknowledged the genocide in Darfur committed by the Government of Sudan and Janjaweed militias. Several states have passed or are considering legislation to divest state funds from companies conducting business operations in Sudan, which benefit the Sudanese regime in Khartoum. Millions of Americans inadvertently support Sudan by investing in foreign companies operating in Sudan. Several states, including Connecticut, Ohio, and Vermont, have passed non-binding divestment legislation related to Sudan. Arizona, Louisiana, Missouri, and Pennsylvania have implemented screening processes for investments in companies operating in countries that sponsor terrorism, such as Sudan. Providence, Rhode Island, and New Haven, Connecticut, have laws requiring divestment of city funds from companies with business operations in Sudan. Additionally, various universities like Harvard, Stanford, and the University of California have also taken steps to divest from companies involved in Sudan. Several universities in Southern California, Vermont, Washington, Williams, and Yale have divested funds from companies operating in Sudan to prevent support of genocide. Divestment has been effective in past situations, such as in South Africa, where it played a critical role in ending apartheid. The effectiveness of economic pressure, such as sanctions and divestment, against Sudan has been demonstrated. Divestment campaigns have led to positive outcomes, like the Comprehensive Peace Agreement of 2005. Congress recognizes the importance of using divestment sparingly and under extraordinary circumstances, such as the genocide in Sudan. The deteriorating security situation in the Darfur region of Sudan highlights the urgency for reestablishing security, especially considering the abhorrent genocide occurring in the country. United States investors are concerned about the business operations of companies in countries perpetrating grave human rights abuses, including genocide, even if these operations are a small part of the company's business. State and city pension funds have tried to access Federal Government data on companies for investment decisions without success. Congress supports States, cities, colleges, and universities that have divested funds from companies operating in Sudan. The bill also aims to identify companies conducting business operations in Sudan. The Securities and Exchange Commission requires companies trading in securities registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to disclose their business operations in Sudan, including relationships with governments, business activities with government entities, and operations related to military equipment and natural resources. The Government Accountability Office will investigate Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board investments in companies involved in Sudan's military equipment, natural resource extraction, and business operations to prevent support for Sudan's government policies. The Securities and Exchange Commission will provide Congress with reports on these companies. The Government Accountability Office will investigate Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board investments in companies involved in Sudan's military equipment, natural resource extraction, and business operations. The Securities and Exchange Commission will maintain a list of these companies on their website. The Comptroller General of the Government Accountability Office will list companies involved in Sudan's military equipment, natural resource extraction, and business operations on the GAO website. SEC. 5. PROHIBITION ON UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS. The Government of the United States is prohibited from entering into contracts with companies identified under section 4(a), except for those involved in specific activities in Sudan related to southern Sudan, Darfur Peace Agreement implementation, provision of military equipment for certain organizations, or humanitarian assistance. The President may waive the prohibition on entering contracts with certain companies in Sudan if it is important for national security interests. This waiver applies to the Darfur region of Sudan or eastern Sudan, including the Red Sea, Kassala, and Gedaref States. SEC. 6. RULE OF CONSTRUCTION. This Act does not override State laws prohibiting State funds, including pensions, from investing in Sudan. SEC. 7. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, \"business operations\" refer to activities related to maintaining, selling, or leasing business assets. A \"company\" includes various entities established for profit-making purposes, including those owned or controlled by foreign governments. The term \"investment\" refers to purchasing, owning, or controlling stock, bonds, or debt instruments of a company. \"Military equipment\" includes weapons and defense supplies. \"Oil-related activities\" encompass oil export and extraction.
