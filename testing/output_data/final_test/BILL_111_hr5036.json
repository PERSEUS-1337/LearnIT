    "content": "The \"Autofill Act of 2010\" is also known as the Automated Partially Pre-Populated Tax Returns Act. It amends the Internal Revenue Code to include a new section for automated partially pre-populated tax returns. The Secretary will establish a program for taxpayers to download pre-populated individual income tax forms with information reported to the IRS. The return information must be available within 15 days in printable and computer-readable formats. The Secretary will establish standards for data download to tax preparation software and provide a demonstration server for downloading partially populated printable document files. Taxpayers can download pre-populated 1040, 1040A, and 1040EZ forms in printable and computer-readable formats annually. Taxpayers must acknowledge responsibility for the accuracy of their tax return and verify all information provided in downloadable forms. This includes information related to wages and self-employment income for the calendar year 2010. The Commissioner of Social Security must provide wage and self-employment income information for the calendar year 2010 to the Secretary by January 31, 2011. For subsequent years, this information must be provided by January 31 of the following calendar year. The filing deadline for information returns under part III of the Code is January 31 of the year following the calendar year to which the returns relate. This amendment also includes a conforming amendment to the Social Security Act regarding information on wages paid. The Commissioner requires information on wages and self-employment income to be provided by January 31 of the following year. A clerical amendment is made to the table of sections for chapter 77 of the Code. The amendments made by this section regarding automated partially pre-populated tax returns will apply to taxable years starting after December 31, 2009."
