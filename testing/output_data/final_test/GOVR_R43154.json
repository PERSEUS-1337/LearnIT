    "content": "End-stage renal disease (ESRD) is the final phase of chronic kidney disease, requiring dialysis or kidney transplant. Medicare covers kidney transplantation for eligible beneficiaries, including those who are at least 65 years old and meet citizenship and work requirements. Individuals diagnosed with ESRD can enroll in Medicare if they or their spouse, parent, or guardian have earned at least six Social Security credits over the past three years. Originally, Medicare eligibility for ESRD beneficiaries was limited to 12 months post successful kidney transplant, but this was extended to 36 months in 1978. Medicare coverage for beneficiaries with ESRD was extended to 36 months in 1978. Coverage begins on the first month of eligibility for kidney transplant or home dialysis. Medicare is a secondary payer for the first 30 months for those with employer-sponsored health plans. Medicare consists of Part A, Part B, Part C, and Part D. Medicare Parts A and B provide coverage for inpatient hospital services, post-hospital services, physicians, durable medical equipment, outpatient prescription drugs, and hospital outpatient services. Medicare Advantage (Part C) allows beneficiaries to receive covered services through private health plans. Medicare Part D is available for prescription drug coverage. Medicare Part D provides coverage for outpatient prescription drugs through private plans. Medicare Parts A and B cover inpatient services, doctors' services during a kidney transplant, outpatient dialysis treatments, and immunosuppressive drugs for transplant recipients. In 2010, Medicare spent $32.9 billion on beneficiaries with ESRD, with $345 million on Part B immunosuppressive drugs. Annual Medicare expenditures were $87,561 for hemodialysis and $32,914 for kidney transplant recipients. Around 489,000 individuals were diagnosed with ESRD and eligible for Medicare coverage. In 2010, roughly 41% of individuals under 65 who had a successful kidney transplant were not eligible for Medicare coverage. About 25% were covered by original Medicare, 15% by both Medicare and Medicaid, 15% had Medicare as a secondary payer, and 4% were in an MA plan. Patients with a functioning kidney transplant require lifelong immunosuppressive drugs to prevent rejection. The standard of care for immunosuppressant therapy in kidney transplant recipients typically involves a combination of tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF). Other prescribed immunosuppressants may include azathioprine, cyclosporine, mycophenolic sodium, prednisone, and sirolimus. Medicare provides coverage for these drugs under Part B for eligible transplant recipients. Medicare started covering immunosuppressive drugs under Part B for eligible transplant recipients in 1987, following a Medicare-covered organ transplant in a Medicare-approved facility. Initially limited to 12 months post-transplant, coverage was gradually extended under the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993. The Medicare coverage of immunosuppressive drugs for transplant recipients was extended from 12 months to 36 months in 1998. The 36-month time limitation was eliminated in 2000 for kidney transplant recipients. However, Medicare eligibility for drug coverage is still limited to 36 months for those who qualify due to ESRD and not age or disability. After 36 months, individuals must find alternative payment methods for the drugs. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that the percentage of kidney transplant recipients whose transplants failed doubled when the timeframe was extended from 36 months to seven years. Insurance coverage may impact access to immunosuppressive drugs, but it is not the only factor contributing to transplant failure. Noncompliance with medication can be due to various reasons, including avoiding side effects of the drugs. Beginning January 1, 2014, beneficiaries with a functioning kidney transplant who are no longer entitled to Medicare may have greater access to health insurance in the private market, potentially covering immunosuppressive drugs, due to provisions in the ACA. Non-random selective samples suggest that commonly used immunosuppressive drugs for individuals with ESRD are often covered by private health plans. The ACA requires health plans offered through the new insurance exchanges to cover essential health benefits, including immunosuppressive drugs. State benchmark plans vary in the number of drugs required to be covered, with roughly half of all states mandating at least 20 different immunosuppressive drug products. In states with a requirement for a large number of covered immunosuppressive drugs, health plans in insurance exchanges are likely to cover drugs commonly used by transplant recipients. Medicare Part B covers immunosuppressive drugs for organ transplant recipients, with beneficiaries responsible for a 20% coinsurance and an annual deductible. In 2010, Medicare Part B spent $345 million on immunosuppressive drugs, with an 8% annual growth rate since 2005. In 2010, Medicare Part B spent $345 million on immunosuppressive drugs for organ transplant recipients, with the largest expenditure being on tacrolimus at $200 million. Post-transplant beneficiaries commonly use a combination of tacrolimus and MMF or tacrolimus and MPS. Part B payments for tacrolimus grew at an average annual rate of 11.2% between 2005 and 2010. Part B payments for tacrolimus increased by 11.2% annually due to a rise in claims filed. Despite the growth in tacrolimus utilization, expenditures were moderated by competition from generics. MMF, the second most billed immunosuppressive drug, saw a decline in expenditure growth attributed to ASP decrease and MPS utilization increase. Medicare Part D covers outpatient prescription drugs and immunosuppressive drugs for beneficiaries, with varying cost-sharing amounts depending on the drug plan. Coverage is not provided for immunosuppressive drugs for beneficiaries who have received a Medicare-covered transplant. Medicare coverage is limited to 36 months after a successful covered kidney transplant. Experts have raised concerns about the 36-month time limitation on Medicare coverage for immunosuppressive medication after a successful kidney transplant. Non-adherence to medication could lead to kidney failure, necessitating costly dialysis or another transplant. This limitation may negatively impact beneficiaries' health and quality of life. Legislation has been proposed to extend coverage beyond the current limit. Legislation has been introduced in Congress to extend Medicare coverage for immunosuppressive drugs after a kidney transplant beyond the current 36-month limit. S. 323 and H.R. 1428 in the 113th Congress propose Medicare Part B as a secondary payer for these drugs for recipients not eligible for Medicare, enrolled in a group health plan. Medicare would be the primary payer for those not in a group health plan, with slightly lower monthly premiums. In 2014, individuals with a functioning kidney transplant may have greater access to immunosuppressive drug coverage from private health plans in the individual and small business marketplace. Factors such as ACA provisions, state EHB-benchmark plans, and a decline in drug prices could positively impact obtaining coverage."
