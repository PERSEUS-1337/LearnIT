    "content": "The Act titled \"Presidential Records Act Amendments of 2011\" establishes procedures for considering claims of constitutionally based privilege against disclosure. The \"Presidential Records Act Amendments of 2011\" establishes procedures for the Archivist to notify former and incumbent Presidents when making Presidential records available to the public. The notice must be in writing and include information as prescribed by regulations. Upon the expiration of the 60-day period, the Archivist must make Presidential records available to the public, unless a claim of privilege is made by a former or incumbent President. An extension of up to 30 days can be granted for further review of the records. The 60-day period for making Presidential records public may be extended if it would expire within 6 months of a new President taking office. The decision to assert privilege over records must be made by a former or incumbent President personally, and notification must be given to specific committees. If a former President asserts a constitutionally based privilege claim on a Presidential record, the Archivist must consult with the incumbent President to determine if the claim will be upheld. Within 30 days of receiving notification of the claim, the Archivist must notify the former President and the public of the incumbent President's decision. If the incumbent President upholds the privilege claim of the former President, the Archivist cannot release the Presidential record publicly unless the decision is withdrawn or directed by a final court order. If the incumbent President does not uphold the claim or fails to make a determination, the Archivist will release the record after a 90-day period. The Archivist must withhold a Presidential record if the incumbent President asserts a privilege claim, unless the claim is withdrawn or a final court order directs otherwise. Adjustments to time periods may be made to comply with subpoenas or judicial processes. The Archivist is restricted from providing original presidential records to individuals convicted of crimes related to handling archival records. Amendments are made to various sections of the United States Code to align with this restriction. Amendments are made to chapter 22 of title 44, United States Code, with a clerical amendment at the end of the table of sections. The amendment made to chapter 22 of title 44, United States Code, clarifies that claims of constitutionally based privilege against disclosure regarding Vice Presidential records are not affected."
