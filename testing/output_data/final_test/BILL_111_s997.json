    "content": "The \"Family Tax Relief Act of 2009\" includes amendments to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, specifically expanding the dependent care credit by adding a new section for expenses related to household and dependent care services necessary for gainful employment. The \"Family Tax Relief Act of 2009\" expands the dependent care credit for individuals with qualifying dependents, allowing a credit for employment-related expenses paid during the taxable year. The applicable percentage of the credit is based on the taxpayer's adjusted gross income, with a minimum of 20 percent. The \"Family Tax Relief Act of 2009\" expands the dependent care credit for individuals with qualifying dependents, allowing a credit for employment-related expenses paid during the taxable year. Qualifying individuals include dependents under age 13, those physically or mentally incapable of self-care, and spouses in need of care. The dependent care credit under the \"Family Tax Relief Act of 2009\" covers expenses for household services and care of qualifying individuals, including those incapable of self-care, to enable gainful employment. The dependent care credit covers expenses for household services and care of qualifying individuals, including those incapable of self-care, to enable gainful employment. Employment-related expenses incurred for services outside the taxpayer's household are eligible if they are for the care of a qualifying individual who stays overnight at a camp or regularly spends at least 8 hours each day in the taxpayer's household. The dependent care credit applies to expenses for care of qualifying individuals, including those unable to care for themselves, to support gainful employment. Expenses for services provided outside the taxpayer's household by a dependent care center must comply with state or local laws, serve more than six individuals, and receive payment. The dependent care credit allows for the reimbursement of employment-related expenses incurred for caring for qualifying individuals. The dollar limit on the amount creditable is $5,000 for one qualifying individual and $10,000 for two or more qualifying individuals. This amount is reduced by any income excluded under section 129. There is also an earned income limitation. The earned income limitation for the dependent care credit states that the employment-related expenses incurred cannot exceed the individual's earned income for the year, or the lesser of the individual's earned income or their spouse's earned income if married. There is a special rule for spouses who are students or incapable of caring for themselves. For the dependent care credit, if a spouse is a full-time student or qualifying individual, they are deemed gainfully employed with a certain earned income amount per month. Special rules apply for spouses' place of abode. Married couples must file a joint return for the dependent care credit to be allowed, and individuals legally separated from their spouse are not considered married for tax purposes. If a qualifying individual maintains a household for more than half the year and provides over half the cost of maintaining it, and their spouse is not a member of the household for the last 6 months of the year, they are not considered married for tax purposes. Special rules apply for dependent care credit in cases of divorced parents with children under 13 or incapable of self-care. For tax purposes, if a child is unable to care for themselves, they are considered a qualifying individual for the custodial parent and not the noncustodial parent. No credit is allowed for payments to related individuals who qualify for a deduction for personal exemptions. The term 'student' refers to an individual who is a full-time student at an educational organization for 5 calendar months during the taxable year. An 'educational organization' is defined as an organization described in section 170(b)(1)(A)(ii). No credit is allowed for payments to a service provider without the required identifying information. The tax credit requires the name, address, and taxpayer identification number of the person receiving payment to be included on the return. Due diligence must be shown if information is not provided. No credit is allowed for payments to a service provider without the required identifying information for qualifying individuals. The tax credit requires the inclusion of the TIN of the qualifying individual on the return claiming the credit. Dollar amounts are adjusted for inflation annually.
