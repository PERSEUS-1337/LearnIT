    "content": "President Obama emphasized the importance of making America a hub for new jobs and manufacturing in his 2013 State of the Union speech. The debate over government policies to revive the manufacturing sector, especially in advanced technology products, has reignited discussions among lawmakers and economists. This debate mirrors the industrial policy discussions of the late 1970s and early 1980s. The debate over government support for U.S.-based manufacturing companies revolves around whether it is more beneficial to invest in strategic industries or in worker skills, education, research, and economic infrastructure for long-term growth. Critics argue that industrial policies may not succeed as civil servants may not be as adept as businessmen in identifying new technologies. The debate over government support for U.S.-based manufacturing companies focuses on whether to invest in strategic industries or in worker skills, education, research, and economic infrastructure for long-term growth. Critics argue that civil servants may not be as adept as businessmen in identifying new technologies with potential for job creation. The role of federal policy in reviving manufacturing has become a policy issue in the 114th Congress, especially in the context of proposals to reform the federal income tax. Critics of the current tax system highlight the uneven tax benefits for manufacturing, which they argue resemble federal spending without the same level of scrutiny and oversight. This report examines the provisions in current federal tax law that benefit manufacturing firms. The report discusses provisions in federal tax law that benefit manufacturing firms, including targeted federal support. It provides overviews of the economic contributions of the sector and existing federal non-tax support for manufacturing. The manufacturing sector consists of establishments engaged in transforming materials into products. The report will be updated as needed due to changes in federal tax law. Manufacturing involves transforming materials into finished or semi-finished products. The sector is divided into sub-sectors reflecting the interconnectedness of companies in the production process. Companies often exchange goods and services with each other, such as materials and components. The manufacturing sector encompasses various activities, with economic boundaries sometimes unclear. For instance, bottling and processing of milk are considered manufacturing, while erecting an office building is classified as construction. Manufacturing's significance in the U.S. economy has evolved significantly since 1960, with changes in GDP contribution, employment, investment, R&D, and exports. Since the 1970s, the manufacturing sector's economic contributions in the U.S. have declined sharply. Figure 1 shows the sector's decreasing share of non-agricultural employment, GDP, business R&D investment, and exports between 1960 and 2010. By 2010, manufacturing's share of exports was 17% lower, R&D investment was 29% lower, and non-agricultural employment was 71% lower compared to 1960. Manufacturing's decline was due to other sectors growing faster and losing workers, except during recessions. All indicators in Figure 1 trended downward except for employee. Employee wages and salaries in manufacturing showed a steady increase from 1960 to 2010, remaining consistently higher than in other sectors like construction, mining, transportation, and utilities. Manufacturing also held the largest share of GDP until 1986 when the government sector surpassed it. By 2010, government, finance, insurance, real estate, rental and leasing, and professional and business services had larger shares than manufacturing. Since 1989, government employment surpassed manufacturing, with retail trade, professional services, education, health services, and leisure/hospitality also employing more than manufacturing. Despite a decline in manufacturing employment since 1979, its GDP contribution grew significantly, reflecting strong labor productivity growth. Manufacturing's value added reached $1.8 trillion in 2013, a factor of 11.9 increase from 1960. Productivity growth in manufacturing outpaced non-farm businesses from 1990 to 2000, with a rate of 4.3% compared to 2.2%. The gap narrowed from 2000 to 2007, with manufacturing at 3.7% and non-farm businesses at 2.6%. Between 2007 and 2013, both sectors saw similar growth rates of 1.6% in manufacturing and 1.5% in non-farm businesses. Manufacturing industries varied in outcomes from 1960 to 2010, with different growth rates depending on sub-divisions. The performance of 20 major manufacturing industries from 1998 to 2013 varied significantly. Full-time-equivalent (FTE) employment decreased in all industries, with the extent of the decrease ranging from -7.2% for food, beverages, and tobacco products to -75.9% for apparel, leather, and similar products. Real value added also showed a wide range of changes, with decreases in eight industries and increases in 12 industries during the same period. The performance of 20 major manufacturing industries from 1998 to 2013 varied significantly, with FTE employment decreasing in all industries. The decreases ranged from -7.0% for plastics and rubber products to -50.2% for apparel, leather, and similar products. Increases in real value added extended from 1.5% for printing and related support activities to 561.2% for computers and electronic products. Rising foreign competition, offshoring, and the growth of the information economy were key driving forces. Federal support for manufacturing includes tax and non-tax subsidies, focusing on workforce training, export promotion, business counseling, and technology development through programs like the Hollings Manufacturing Extension Partnership program. The Manufacturing Extension Partnership program (MEP) and the Advanced Manufacturing Partnership (AMP) are federal programs that support small and medium-sized manufacturers by providing technical assistance and leveraging partnerships for advanced manufacturing technologies. Other programs at various government agencies also support manufacturing through the development of new technologies. Total federal spending on non-defense manufacturing programs is not readily available. Federal spending on non-defense programs to support the manufacturing sector is challenging to estimate due to direct and indirect support channels. Direct support, like the MEP program, targets resources to manufacturing firms, making it easier to track. However, indirect support poses difficulties in determining the dollar value, benefiting manufacturers without specific targeting. The research tax credit under section 41 of the federal tax code is an example of direct support that is not limited to manufacturing. The research tax credit under section 41 of the federal tax code is a key form of direct federal non-tax support for manufacturing, with manufacturing firms being the biggest users of the credit. Data on claims for the credit by industry are available through the IRS website, but a similar breakdown does not exist for programs administered by the Small Business Administration. Federal funding for research and development (R&D) is a significant component of non-tax support for manufacturing. The federal government funded $24.4 billion of defense and non-defense R&D by U.S. manufacturing companies in 2011 and 2012. President Obama's FY2016 budget includes $2.4 billion for advanced manufacturing technology R&D. The proposal allocates $130 million to MEP and $15 million for advanced manufacturing technology consortia. Funding is also designated for the construction of a national network of 45 manufacturing innovation institutes over 10 years. Tax preferences in the federal tax code provide special relief to eligible individual or business taxpayers to promote certain policy goals, such as increasing research expenditures to boost U.S. innovation and economic growth. These preferences aim to support struggling businesses and enhance the competitiveness of U.S. companies in domestic and foreign markets. Tax preferences in the federal tax code provide special relief to eligible individual or business taxpayers to promote certain policy goals, such as increasing research expenditures to boost U.S. innovation and economic growth. The tax reduction from preferences is considered special as it deviates from normal income tax law. Tax preferences can take forms like exclusions, exemptions, deductions, preferential tax rates, credits, and tax deferrals, all of which reduce tax revenue flowing into the U.S. Treasury. Tax preferences in the federal tax code provide special relief to eligible individual or business taxpayers to promote certain policy goals. These preferences, also known as tax expenditures, are viewed as federal spending through the tax code. Permanent tax preferences are compared to entitlement programs, with benefits distributed without a time limit. The federal tax code includes provisions granting preferential treatment to companies in various industries, with limited congressional oversight on business tax benefits. Manufacturing companies derive tax preferences as shown in Table 2. Manufacturing companies benefit from tax preferences in the federal tax code, with the deduction for \"domestic production activities\" income under Section 199 being the most beneficial preference for the sector. This preference is designed to benefit manufacturing firms more than others, while other industries also benefit to varying degrees from different preferences listed in Table 2. Tax preferences in the federal tax code, such as deductions for research and equipment investment, aim to stimulate increased investment by reducing capital costs and boosting cash flow. While subsidies for research address market failures, the rationale for capital investment subsidies is less clear as there is no evidence of a similar market failure in this area. Manufacturing companies benefit the most from these preferences, particularly the deduction for \"domestic production activities\" income under Section 199. Tax preferences in the federal tax code, such as investment tax subsidies, aim to stimulate increased investment by reducing capital costs and boosting cash flow for manufacturing firms. The federal government implemented measures like extending bonus depreciation allowances and enhancing expensing allowances in response to economic downturns. These preferences encourage activities such as increased domestic investment, equity capital flow to small manufacturing firms, greater cash flow, and increased exports of manufactured products. The federal tax code includes provisions that benefit U.S.-based manufacturing firms, such as deferring the active income of controlled foreign corporations (CFCs) under Section 11(b). This provision allows U.S. corporations with CFCs to postpone U.S. taxation on their subsidiaries' earnings as long as the earnings are reinvested abroad. The federal tax code allows U.S. corporations with controlled foreign corporations (CFCs) to defer taxation on their subsidiaries' earnings by reinvesting abroad. This incentive encourages establishing profit centers in countries with lower tax rates, particularly benefiting manufacturing firms. The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 provided a temporary reduction in tax rates for repatriated earnings, allowing U.S. corporations to deduct 85% of the earnings. The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 allowed U.S. corporations to deduct 85% of any increase in their repatriated foreign-source income, lowering the effective tax rate to 5.25%. Companies had to establish a domestic investment plan for the repatriated funds and the deduction was limited to $500 million or the amount of earnings permanently invested outside the U.S. as of June 30, 2003. The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 allowed U.S. corporations to deduct 85% of any increase in their repatriated foreign-source income, lowering the effective tax rate to 5.25%. Manufacturing corporations filed 55% of the returns for the 2004 to 2006 tax years claiming the deduction, with nearly half of all qualifying dividends repatriated by firms in the pharmaceutical, electronic, and computer industries. The debate over expanding federal support for manufacturing echoes past discussions on industrial policy and the economic consequences of a decline in the domestic manufacturing base due to foreign competition. The debate over enhancing federal support for manufacturing in response to increasing foreign competition in global markets raises policy issues, including the economic rationale for such support. Proposals in the 114th Congress include new targeted tax incentives to boost the after-tax rate of return on investments by manufacturing companies. The debate over enhancing federal support for manufacturing in response to increasing foreign competition in global markets raises policy issues. Proposals in the 114th Congress include new targeted tax incentives to boost the after-tax rate of return on investments by manufacturing companies, which could divert capital from non-manufacturing businesses. This raises questions on how Congress can reconcile tax-based support for manufacturing with aims of tax reform proponents. The debate over federal support for manufacturing in response to foreign competition raises policy issues. Proponents argue for targeted government assistance based on the sector's contributions to the economy, including exports, wages, innovation, and global competition. The case for greater federal aid for manufacturing is supported by economists advocating for less reliance on consumption and imports financed by foreign borrowing. The U.S. should focus on domestic production and exports to reduce the trade deficit, particularly in manufacturing. Proponents suggest dismantling barriers to export, influencing exchange rates, and investing in workforce development to enhance competitiveness. Government support for manufacturing industries in the U.S. is advocated to boost domestic production and exports, reduce the trade deficit, and improve competitiveness. Manufacturing firms offer higher wages and benefits compared to other industries, although the pay gap has been narrowing over time. Estimates vary, with data showing manufacturing workers earning 21% more on average between 2005 and 2010, while a recent study found an 8.4% difference from 2008 to 2010. Manufacturing workers earned more than non-manufacturing workers from 2008 to 2010, especially in firms with high export ratios. Some non-manufacturing industries like mining, utilities, and finance pay more than manufacturing. Low-wage workers benefit the most from manufacturing jobs, potentially reducing wage gaps. Manufacturing jobs also offer more fringe benefits and a higher share of workers have no formal education beyond high school. Proponents argue that increased federal support for manufacturing could create more middle-income job opportunities and reduce income inequality. Manufacturing firms are crucial for technological innovation, conducting 69% of business R&D in the US and employing 60% of workers involved in R&D. This innovation is essential for long-term growth in productivity and the economy, leading proponents to advocate for policies that encourage manufacturers to increase their R&D efforts. According to NSF data, U.S.-based multinational manufacturing companies conducted an estimated 76% of their worldwide R&D in the United States in 2011. Some companies have moved R&D operations to Asia for growth opportunities, skilled researchers, lower salaries, and government subsidies. The manufacturing sector plays a significant role in developing environmentally beneficial goods and services. Proponents argue that a competitive manufacturing sector is crucial for the United States to meet the challenges of producing clean energy and reducing fossil fuel use. They emphasize the need for federal assistance in developing new green technologies. Backers of targeted government assistance for manufacturing industries emphasize the role they play in the growth of other sectors, citing the multiplier effect of manufacturing output on overall output. The sector's backward linkages in the economy contribute to its influence on overall output. According to an analysis by the Manufacturing Institute, $1.00 of final demand for manufactured products led to $1.33 in output from all other sectors. Manufacturing firms contribute to industrial innovation and growth in non-manufacturing industries through product innovations. Proponents argue that investing in information technologies in industries can lead to well-paying jobs in various sectors, but the loss of domestic manufacturing jobs through offshoring hinders innovation. They suggest targeted government support to sustain and grow the ability to create new technologies through \"industrial commons\". The argument for federal policies to assist manufacturing is supported by the success of countries like Germany, which has achieved superior outcomes in manufacturing compared to the United States. German policies have fostered R&D networks, continuous vocational training, and stable job growth in the manufacturing sector. The success of Germany in manufacturing is attributed to federal policies supporting continuous vocational training, stable finance access for small companies, and collaborative decision-making between unions and companies. This model is seen as a way to address challenges in the manufacturing sector and achieve key policy objectives like high wages, technological innovation, trade surpluses, environmental protection, and energy conservation. A 2013 report by the Government Accountability Office compared support for manufacturing in Germany, South Korea, Japan, and Canada. The report compared support for manufacturing in South Korea, Japan, and Canada, highlighting varied programs to support innovation among small- and medium-sized manufacturing firms. South Korea funded national research institutes, clean energy technology development, and regional innovation centers. Japan also provided targeted support for innovation in manufacturing. The Japanese government supported small- and medium-sized manufacturing firms through various initiatives from 2007 to 2012, including Innovation 25, Industrial Cluster Project, and Rebirth of Japan strategies. These efforts involved collaboration with larger businesses, universities, and research institutes to promote technological innovation, particularly in alternative energy R&D projects and clean-energy motor vehicles. Canada also implemented initiatives to foster innovation in manufacturing. Canada implemented several initiatives to support small- and medium-sized manufacturing firms in developing and commercializing new products and processes. These initiatives included the Canadian Innovation Commercialization Program, the Industrial Research Assistance Program, tax credits for R&D investment, and the Venture Capital Action Plan to encourage private investment in startup firms. Proponents are divided on which manufacturing firms should receive government assistance, considering differences in size, industry, and products. Some argue for policies that support industries based on financial condition and economic benefits, aiming to facilitate worker migration and address market inefficiencies. Proponents are divided on which manufacturing firms should receive government assistance, with some advocating for support to help small and medium firms raise productivity and target assistance towards developing high-technology products in America. They argue that focusing on small companies makes sense as they are key drivers of employment and technology growth but face difficulties in adopting new technologies. Critics oppose targeted government support for manufacturing, citing reasons such as the lack of market failures, decreased contributions to job creation and GDP, and the potential for growth in U.S. exports of services. Critics argue against government assistance for manufacturing, stating that it cannot be justified economically due to the absence of market failures. Market failures necessitate government intervention to achieve efficient outcomes, such as addressing competition issues through antitrust laws. Key market failures include public goods, externalities, lack of competition, and information asymmetry. Government support for manufacturing is debated due to the absence of market failures. Critics argue that market failures, such as inefficient resource allocations, are necessary for government intervention. Some believe manufacturing is prone to market failures due to R&D investment, firm clustering, and learning by doing. However, critics disagree, stating there is no clear evidence of unique market failures in manufacturing. One potential market failure associated with manufacturing is sub-optimal R&D investment. The manufacturing sector accounts for a significant portion of domestic R&D investment by companies, leading to underinvestment in R&D due to the inability to capture all returns. This market failure affects not only manufacturing but also other sectors like software development and Internet access. Critics debate the appropriate policy response to address the positive externalities or spillovers from R&D investments. Critics suggest offering subsidies to boost R&D investment across all industries, including manufacturing, to address market failures related to industry clustering. Manufacturing firms benefit from clustering, leading to increased productivity and innovation. Critics argue that government subsidies are necessary to encourage companies to invest in industry clusters, as the positive externalities from clustering are similar to those from R&D investments. However, studies have not found widespread evidence of these benefits. Critics also point out that clustering benefits should apply to various industries, not just manufacturing. They dismiss the idea of \"learning by doing\" as a market failure in manufacturing, citing a lack of evidence to support this claim. Critics argue against government assistance for firms investing in new production methods, citing a study on the semiconductor industry. They believe that companies making initial investments reap most rewards, and external benefits like national defense spending do not justify targeted assistance. Critics also argue that not all manufacturing firms benefit equally from a war effort. Critics argue against special assistance for manufacturing firms, stating that the existing U.S. production base for defense goods can adequately supply weapons during a war. They also believe that targeting assistance at manufacturing for job creation would be misguided, as the sector has been steadily shrinking since 1979 and many lost factory jobs are unlikely to return on a large scale. Many critics argue against providing special assistance to manufacturing firms, as they believe that the jobs lost in this sector are unlikely to return on a large scale. They point out that skills for these jobs are readily available in other countries, and the shift towards spending on services instead of goods has contributed to the decline in manufacturing employment. Additionally, slow recovery in aggregate demand has been a major factor in sluggish job growth since the Great Recession. Critics argue against increasing assistance to manufacturing firms, especially SMFs, as it would not significantly boost job creation in the short run. They suggest that the U.S. economy would benefit more from efforts to dismantle foreign barriers to U.S. exports of services. The U.S. has a comparative advantage in highly skilled services like engineering, law, finance, and architecture, rather than products made with low-skilled workers. There is untapped potential for expanding U.S. service exports, despite being the leading exporter of services in the world. The potential for expanding U.S. service exports is significant, with estimates suggesting that the U.S. could double its service exports by removing foreign barriers. This could create an additional $800 billion in tradable business services, supporting nearly three million U.S. jobs with higher wages. Critics argue that the government should focus on opening up foreign service markets rather than promoting exports by domestic manufacturers. The debate over federal assistance for manufacturing industries raises issues for Congress to consider in tax reform or economic growth. Evidence shows no clear economic rationale for federal support, despite arguments for technological innovation benefits. The positive externalities of R&D extend to all companies investing in it, not just manufacturing. Federal tax policy has recognized this for nearly 60 years, with provisions like a research tax credit. These subsidies can stimulate innovation across all sectors, not just manufacturing. Increased federal aid for manufacturing may not significantly boost job creation, as the sector's contribution to overall employment has been declining. Instead, policy measures like increased federal spending on infrastructure could stimulate faster job growth. The importance of technological innovation in the domestic climate is also a key consideration in the debate over targeted federal support for manufacturing. The importance of domestic manufacturing for technological innovation is emphasized, with proponents advocating for a greater federal role in encouraging firms to conduct R&D and production in the United States. The impact of separating innovation activities and production in different countries on company competitiveness is debated, with Congress urged to investigate the economic benefits of domestic production. The debate on the economic benefits of domestic production capabilities for innovation extends beyond manufacturing, with proponents suggesting federal policy initiatives to support R&D, worker training, investment capital, and collaboration for productivity improvements across industries. Congress should consider a broader approach to growing the U.S. economy, not limited to manufacturing. Congress should consider policy options for providing more R&D support, improving worker training, expanding access to credit for small- and medium-sized companies, and encouraging industry-specific networks for collaborative services. Additionally, examining the advantages and disadvantages of using tax incentives as a primary tool for achieving policy objectives in manufacturing industries is recommended. Tax incentives can lead to revenue losses and compliance burdens for companies, while spending programs offer more transparency and oversight. Congress is considering options for tax reform, including lowering business tax rates and expanding the tax base by reducing certain incentives."
