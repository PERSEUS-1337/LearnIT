The National Food Safety Database Act of 2003 establishes an electronic database for eligible institutions to access food safety information for procurement purposes. Eligible institutions include hospitals, nursing homes, schools, and child care facilities, with the possibility of additional institutions being deemed appropriate by the Secretary. The Secretary is required to establish an electronic database with current food safety information by August 1, 2005. This information includes details on food intended for human consumption that is adulterated, misbranded, or at risk of being so due to manufacturing, processing, or storage conditions. The Secretary must establish a database by August 1, 2005, containing food safety information such as enforcement actions, outbreak findings, recalls, and facility inspection results. This information is related to food safety concerns and does not require registration of food facilities. The database established by the Secretary contains food safety information, including enforcement actions, outbreak findings, recalls, and facility inspection results. State officials can access the database upon request and entering into an agreement with the Secretary. Items in the database are electronically identified as confidential. State officials or employees recommended by the State can access the database containing food safety information. Agreements with the Secretary outline State responsibilities for database management. State officials or employees responsible for managing a specific type of eligible institution's database must be from the State agency overseeing public health. Eligible institutions in the State can request access to the database as outlined in agreements with the Secretary.

The information is provided through electronic means and includes details on food procurement, with confidential information identified. An interagency task force will be established to coordinate among Federal agencies, and an advisory committee will make recommendations to the Secretary on food purchasing decisions to avoid adulterated or misbranded food.

Membership includes representatives of anticipated users, food industry, consumer groups, and relevant Federal agencies. Members may be reimbursed for their participation. The advisory committee members may be reimbursed for travel expenses but not compensated for their service. The Secretary must ensure the committee's first meeting within 90 days. The Secretary can provide grants to States to assist with food safety information for eligible institutions. The Secretary will establish program criteria and regulations for the participation of States and eligible institutions in obtaining food safety information. Regulations will include criteria for access to confidential information in the database.
