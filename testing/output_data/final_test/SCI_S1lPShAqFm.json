    "content": "This work challenges the belief that larger models train more slowly with gradient descent. It shows that larger models, especially wider ones, can potentially train faster despite increased computational requirements. The study focuses on the impact of network structure on training time, demonstrating that wider models require fewer training steps to converge. The study demonstrates that increasing model width can improve halting time during weight space traversal. This improvement is attributed to factors such as the shrinking distance between initialized and converged weights, the growth of average step size, and increased alignment of gradient vectors. Overparametrization can impact convergence in neural networks. Increasing depth can speed up optimization, but increasing width may not affect convergence. The conclusion that \"width does not matter\" assumes the hidden dimension is wider than the input dimension. For many real problems, the hidden dimension is smaller, such as in RNNs. Convergence rate is influenced by the distance from initialization to final weights, average step size, and alignment of gradient vectors. Various experiments are presented in the paper. The paper presents experiments on the effect of width on the error surface in neural networks. It explores how width impacts convergence speed, factors contributing to convergence, and the relationship between model size and dataset size in the convergence curve. The paper analyzes the error surface characteristics of overparametrized models, showing that as models get wider, the direct distance from initial weight to final weights shrinks, total path length traveled shrinks, path length shrinks faster than direct distance, and step size gets larger. This suggests that the number of local minimas in higher dimensional space grows asymmetrically with respect to the origin, and there exists a shorter path within the extra dimension to the newly-found local minimas. Researchers have studied the impact of saddle points on optimization in linear neural networks. The relationship between learning time and error surface properties has been explored, along with the effect of network structure on convergence. Studies have shown that increasing network width allows for larger batch training, but overfitting can occur when the model runs out of capacity. Time-to-convergence is defined as the number of iterations to reach a certain accuracy level. The text discusses the concept of time-to-convergence in neural networks, specifically focusing on the impact of increasing model size by adjusting the model's width. Three established RNN models are examined: character-level language model, word-level language model, and speech recognition. The convergence curve illustrates the number of iterations needed to reach the minimum validation loss for different model sizes. The use of baseline large learning rates to speed up training and small learning rates to slow it down is also mentioned. The text discusses the impact of model size on time-to-convergence in neural networks, focusing on character and word-level language models. It shows convergence curves with different dataset sizes and observes a power law relationship. Increasing training size increases convergence steps. Changing learning rate affects the power law trend, with higher rates reducing steps to minimum validation loss. The text explores the effects of changing learning rates and model depth on convergence patterns in neural networks. It shows that increasing the learning rate shifts down the curve without changing the slope, while adaptive learning rates affect both the slope and intercept. Additionally, deeper models lead to a decrease in the number of steps to reach minimum validation loss. Increasing the training set size also increases the number of steps required for convergence. Increasing dataset size leads to more steps for convergence. The relationship between steps and dataset size is nearly linear. The number of training steps can be approximated with D/M k, where D is the training set size, M is the model size in terms of parameters, and k is a constant. Scaling dataset size by S requires scaling model size by S K to maintain the same number of training steps. Empirical results suggest a \"power-law\" region where each new weight absorbs more information, reducing the total samples needed for convergence. The relationship between dataset size and convergence steps is nearly linear. The convergence curve may reach a \"minimum data region\" where no further information can be gained per sample. Further study is needed to understand convergence behavior for small models. The machinery introduced by BID18 is used to characterize convergence by considering the model's loss on each sample at each time step of gradient descent. The minimum number of gradient updates required to reach the best answer can be evaluated using specific equations. The text discusses the evaluation of convergence in a model by analyzing the average distance from initialization point to the best answer, average step length, and average misalignment of gradient vectors. It also explores the impact of overparametrization on convergence components like direct distance, step length, and angle between weight vector and the path to the best answer. The study focuses on a character language model with SGD optimizer. The study examines the effect of overparametrization on different model components, such as embedding layer, hidden layers, and softmax layer. Model accuracy decreases beyond 1.2 million parameters, indicating overfitting. The number of steps to convergence decreases with a power law relationship. Training a character language model with SGD optimizer is slow, with experiments not exceeding 13 billion. The study explores the impact of overparametrization on various model components, showing a decrease in model accuracy beyond 1.2 million parameters due to overfitting. Training a character language model with SGD optimizer is slow, with experiments not exceeding 13 billion parameters. Further research is needed to understand the pattern of slowdown and the minimum number of epochs required. The direct distance from initial weights to final weights decreases with model size, indicating the presence of multiple local minima in higher dimensional space. The study shows that as model size increases, the direct distance between initial and final weights decreases. For narrow models, weights in the softmax layer travel farther than in hidden layers, while wider models exhibit the reverse pattern. The softmax layer benefits the most from increased width, with a logarithmic relationship between direct distance and model width. These findings align with previous research on overfitting in models exceeding 1.2 million parameters. The results align with previous research on the relationship between model size and direct distance. The average step size increases with model size, following a square root relationship with the norm of the gradient vector. The growth in norm may be lower than expected in wider models due to correlation between weights. The step size for the softmax layer and hidden layer grows with model width, indicating absorption of new information. Weights in hidden layers take larger steps than in softmax and embedding layers. Embedding layer shows minimal improvement with model width growth. The gradient vectors' misalignment with the line connecting their positions in weight space to the starting point is measured by angles A s and A e. Increase in A s leads to a reduction in A e, with angles towards the origin averaging roughly \u03c0/2 and slowly opening up as models get larger. Width does not significantly affect angle alignment. The reduction effect in larger models during training may come from increased step size or reduced distance, challenging the belief that larger models train more slowly with gradient descent. This finding was evaluated on character-level LM, word-level LM, and speech recognition models, which are crucial for domains like speech recognition and machine translation. Language models predict probability distributions for the next character or word based on previous input sequences, with low-dimensional input and output spaces that can be trained with large labeled sets. Speech recognition technologies convert acoustic speech signals into text or commands, used in applications like voice-powered machine controls and conversational user interfaces. Researchers have shifted to end-to-end deep learning methods for speech recognition, showing promising results. LSTM-based word language models are implemented with vocabulary restricted to the top 10,000 most frequent words in the Billion Word Dataset. In speech recognition, LSTM-based models are used with sequence lengths and hidden nodes scaled to increase model size. Character-level LMs with Recurrent Highway Networks are trained for high accuracy. Deep Speech 2 model consists of convolution and LSTM layers optimized with Adam for CTC loss function. Inputs are log-spectrograms of audio clips and outputs are English alphabet symbols. Language models for output sequence beam search are not included in these speech models. The DS2 model is trained on a large dataset of speech data with varying model sizes. Increasing the width of the neural network results in a reduction in the average distance from initial weights to final weights. A simple example of a linear neural network is used to illustrate this concept. The loss function is formulated based on weights of the first layer and depicted geometrically. Increasing the hidden dimension reduces the average distance from initial weights to final weights. For K=1, the best answer is a point on w-axis at distance C from origin. For K=2, the best answer lies on a straight line with slope of -1 crossing w 1 axis at distance C. The average distance in n-dimensional space is always expected to be smaller than in (n-1)-dimensional space, leading to a reduction in average distance from start to final point. This relationship is based on simplifying assumptions and further analysis is needed for non-scalar input and arbitrary matrix sizes."
