    "content": "As the 110th Congress enters its second session, military retirement and Concurrent Receipt issues are expected to remain prominent. The Department of Defense and veteran's organizations will continue to advocate for military personnel benefits, including retirement. Concurrent Receipt eligibility will also be a key issue. Congress faces challenges balancing constituent concerns and budget constraints when addressing military retirement issues. Military retirees, along with their family members, are a well-educated group familiar with the legislative process. Their efforts to secure more benefits have been supported by nationwide nostalgia for World War II veterans and concerns over recruitment and retention issues in the military. The Clinton Administration's perceived lack of support for the military led to efforts to increase retirement benefits, while the Bush Administration is seen as more pro-military. Public and congressional support for the Armed Forces has increased since September 11, 2001. The debate over pension resources for younger workers and retirees is reflected in the recent policy choices for military retirees. tensions between DOD and active duty personnel may arise in the defense context. In the defense context, tensions exist between DOD, current military personnel, and retired military personnel over benefits and resources. Some argue that retiree-related benefits are crowding out defense resources, while others believe the GDP can finance both benefits and defense requirements. Congress has been addressing these issues since the late 1990s. Since the late 1990s, Congress has been more proactive than the executive branch in addressing retiree concerns about military benefits. Despite DOD's focus on budgetary savings in retirement benefits, Congress repealed the \"Redux\" cuts in 1999 and increased health care benefits for retirees. In FY2007, federal budget outlays for military retirement totaled $43.5 billion, with DOD budget outlays at $14.4 billion. The differing figures for total federal and DOD outlays result from using the accrual method in accounting for military retirement costs. Table 1 shows estimated numbers of retirees and costs for FY2005-FY2008. The Military Retirement Reform Act of 1986 enacted cuts in retired pay for future retirees. The repeal of compulsory Redux in 1999 indicated a shift in Congress regarding military retirement systems. The FY2000 National Defense Authorization Act repealed compulsory Redux, allowing post-August 1, 1986 entrants to retire under the pre-Redux system or opt for Redux with a $30,000 cash payment. Retired pay is granted after 20 years of service, regardless of age. The average age of retiring enlisted members in FY2005 was 41 with 22 years of service, while officers were 45 with 24 years of service. A member who retires from active duty receives a monthly annuity based on a percentage of their retired pay computation base. The computation base is determined by the final monthly basic pay for those who entered service before September 8, 1980, and the average of the highest three years of basic pay for those who entered service on or after that date. Basic pay makes up approximately 70% of the total for all retirement eligibles, with 75% for 30-year retirees and 66% for 20-year retirees. Special pays, bonuses, and other cash compensation are not included in these calculations. The retired pay for military personnel is calculated based on years of service, with a minimum of 50% after 20 years and a maximum of 75% after 30 years. The FY2007 National Defense Authorization Act extended the pay table to 40 years, allowing additional raises and retirement credit at a rate of 2.5% per year beyond 30 years. The retired pay for military personnel is calculated based on years of service, with a minimum of 50% after 20 years and a maximum of 75% after 30 years. Personnel who first enter service on or after August 1, 1986, are required to choose between two options for calculating their retired pay within 180 days of reaching 15 years of service. They can opt for the pre-Redux formula with a modified COLA adjustment or the Redux formula with a $30,000 cash bonus. The Redux Formula for military retirees under age 62 calculates retired pay based on years of service, with a higher percentage for longer-serving careerists. For example, a 20-year retiree will receive 40% of their pay base, while a 30-year retiree will receive 75%. This formula incentivizes longer service before retirement. The Redux Formula recalculates retired pay for retirees 62 and older based on years of service, increasing the annuity percentage. This change in monthly retired pay, not a lump sum, was authorized by the FY1993 National Defense Authorization Act. The Temporary Early Retirement Authority (TERA) allowed services to offer early retirements to personnel with 15-20 years of service. TERA retired pay had a 1% reduction for each year below 20, but could be restored by working in specified public service jobs. Military personnel do not contribute to retirement benefits but are entitled to full social security benefits based on their service. Military retirees receive full social security benefits in addition to their military retired pay, which is protected against inflation by statute. Congress has not modified the COLA formula since FY1996, and it is uncertain if COLAs will be off the table in future Congresses. The most recent military retirement COLA was 2.3%, first applied on January 1, 2008, with the next COLA to be applied on January 1, 2009. For military personnel who entered service before August 1, 1986, a COLA equal to the percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index is applied each December for annuities paid starting on January 1. The COLA for military retirement is calculated based on the Consumer Price Index, with a recent increase of 2.3%. For those who entered service before August 1, 1986, the COLA is applied each December for annuities paid starting on January 1. Beginning January 1, the monthly retired pay is increased by the percentage increase in CPI. Military personnel have the option to choose between two methods for calculating their COLAs. The COLA for military retirement is calculated based on the Consumer Price Index, with a recent increase of 2.3%. Retirees under age 62 will receive a 2.0% increase in their military retired pay, with future COLAs held to one percentage point below the actual inflation rate. Upon reaching age 62, there will be a one-time recomputation of annuity to make up for lost purchasing power, compounding the size of the annuity increase for most retirees. Future COLAs will be based on inflation rate minus one percentage point. Opting for the pre-Redux formula is more beneficial for retirees in the long run, according to a report by the Center for Naval Analyses. While a $30,000 lump sum bonus was initially unpopular, more retirees are now opting for it. Wise investment decisions could potentially offset the negative aspects of the bonus, but it would be challenging. Since 2001, the bonus option has been available for Marine Corps enlisted retirees, warrant officers, and commissioned officers. Only 13% of commissioned officers have taken the bonus, indicating its appeal to lower-paid members. DOD budgets now use accrual accounting to estimate and set aside funds for military retired pay, investing in special U.S. government securities to generate interest for current retirees. The Department of Defense (DOD) budgets for future retirement costs of military personnel by projecting based on past retention rates and economic factors. Approximately 35%-40% of military basic pay costs are allocated each fiscal year to cover future retirement expenses. These budget outlays are transferred to a Military Retirement Fund for future retirees. The Military Retirement Fund receives transfers from the General Fund of the Treasury to cover the unfunded liability of the military retirement system. Money disbursed from this fund goes to current retirees, who receive their pay from DOD finance centers. Payments to retirees are classified as outlays from the federal budget's Income Security function, not from DOD. Total federal outlays for each fiscal year are recorded under accrual accounting. Accrual accounting changes how the federal government accounts for military retired pay, but does not affect actual payments to individuals. The military retirement system's unfunded liability will be fully paid by FY2033, with an estimated liability of $628.3 billion at the end of FY2003. The unfunded liability for military retirement pay is projected to be fully paid by FY2033. The estimated liability increased from $628.3 billion in FY2003 to $684.2 billion in FY2006, mainly due to concurrent receipt-related retirement benefits. Concerns have been raised about the growing unfunded liability, but it is a cumulative amount to be paid over 50 years, not all at once. The unfunded liability of federal retirement programs, including military retirement, is spread out over many decades to be deemed affordable. Military retirement costs to the federal budget rise modestly each year due to the predictable increase in retirees and survivors. The cost to the Department of Defense declined after FY1989 as the force size decreased. The cost of military retired pay in federal budget outlays and Department of Defense accrual outlays has stabilized as the force size decreased. The cost of concurrent receipt of military retired pay and VA disability compensation is a concern for retiree benefits. The cost of military retired pay has stabilized as force size decreased. Suggestions include channeling funds into active duty or reserve benefits related to recruitment or career retention, not retiree compensation. Concerns include concurrent receipt, CRSC, TRICARE for life, and potential retiree benefit increases under debate in Congress. The arguments in favor of benefit increases for military retirees include lowering the age for retired pay and strengthening benefits as a career retention incentive, especially during ongoing combat operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. The controversial military retirement issue of concurrent receipt of military retired pay and VA disability compensation has been a subject of intense congressional interest. Legislation has been introduced to allow military retirees to receive both benefits simultaneously, known as \"concurrent receipt.\" The FY2003 National Defense Authorization Act created a benefit called \"combat-related.\" The Defense Authorization Act of 2002 established combat-related special compensation (CRSC) for disabled retirees, providing a cash benefit similar to concurrent receipt. The FY2004 NDAA introduced Concurrent Receipt Disability Payments (CRDP) and expanded CRSC. The FY2005 NDAA further relaxed concurrent receipt rules. VA disability compensation requires a VA determination of injury or disease. For more information, visit the Military Officers Association of America website. The VA determines if a veteran's injury or disease is service-connected, with disability ratings ranging from 10% to 100%. Veterans can request medical reexaminations, and all VA disability compensation is tax-free. Military retirees can apply to the VA for disability compensation, which is tax-free despite the offset. Retirees can apply for VA compensation after leaving the service and have their disability rating changed by the VA later on. Many retirees seek benefits from the VA years after retirement for conditions incurred during military service. The DOD and VA disability rating systems have similarities and differences, with DOD determining eligibility for disability retirement only once at separation. The DOD measures disability based on the ability to perform military duties, not post-service civilian work. Military retirees can apply for VA disability compensation after leaving active duty. Military disability retired pay is usually taxable, unless related to a combat disability. Combat Related Special Compensation (CRSC) was authorized by the FY2003 NDAA. Combat Related Special Compensation (CRSC) was authorized by P.L. 108-136 for military retirees with at least 20 years of service. Eligibility includes disabilities attributable to combat injuries or incurred during armed conflict, hazardous duty, duty simulating war, or through an instrumentality of war. This encompasses combat with hostile forces, hazardous duties like diving or parachuting, training exercises, and accidents in combat vehicles or military aircraft. Combat Related Special Compensation (CRSC) provides financial support to military retirees with disabilities related to combat injuries, hazardous duty, training exercises, or accidents aboard naval vessels or military aircraft. The amount of CRSC payments is based on VA disability compensation, but it does not eliminate the reduction of military retired pay by the amount of VA compensation received. While CRSC beneficiaries receive financial equivalence to concurrent receipt, it is not considered concurrent receipt in legal terms. For more information and online applications, visit https://www.dod.mil/prhome/mppcrsc.html. Retirees with a disability rating of 30% or higher may receive retired pay before completing 20 years of service. Chapter 61 retirees, covered by Title 10, are eligible for Combat Related Special Compensation (CRSC) since January 1, 2008. Eligibility is not based on years of service or disability rating, except for the 30% requirement. Former servicemembers medically retired for service-connected disabilities are excluded. Contact retirement services offices for more information. The FY2008 NDAA expanded eligibility for Combat Related Special Compensation (CRSC) to almost all reserve disability retirees, except those retired under a specific provision. DOD initially required reserve retirees to have at least 7,200 reserve retirement points to qualify for CRSC, which was a high threshold. The FY2004 NDAA authorized concurrent receipt for retirees with at least a 50% disability, phased in over a 10-year period. 100% disabled retirees were entitled to immediate concurrent receipt starting January 1, 2005. The initial amount of retired pay varied based on disability degree, with the decrease in retired pay eliminated by 2014. The new concurrent receipt benefit, available to reservists with 20 years of service creditable for reserve retirement and receiving retired pay, is complex in its implementation. It involves both dollar and percentage amounts, varying based on disability degree and calendar year. In 2005, military retirees entitled to VA disability compensation received additional amounts of retired pay. 100% disabled retirees began receiving all of their military retired pay in addition to VA disability compensation. In 2006, affected retirees received an additional 20% of their remaining offset from 2004. This pattern continued in 2007 and 2008, with retirees receiving 30% and 40% respectively. In 2008, affected retirees receive an additional 40% of their remaining offset from 2004. Retirees medically retired due to combat-related disabilities become eligible for Combat-Related Special Compensation (CRSC) on January 1, 2008. Those rated as 100% Unemployable by the VA become eligible for Concurrent Receipt retroactive to December 31, 2004. Initial amounts for retirees after 2004 are based on the dollar amount prescribed for each percentage of disability, plus an additional percentage for that year. A retiree with an 80% disability retiring in 2006 will receive an additional $420 monthly in retired pay. The new concurrent receipt benefit allows severely disabled retirees to receive most of their military retired pay within a few years. Retirees cannot receive both CRSC and CRDP benefits and can choose the most financially advantageous option. An issue arose after the enactment of the FY2005 NDAA regarding full concurrent receipt for 100% disabled retirees. The FY2005 NDAA allowed full concurrent receipt for 100% disabled retirees, excluding those with an \"Individual Unemployability\" rating of 100%. The FY2006 NDAA made a partial step towards including these individuals by authorizing full concurrent receipt earlier than originally planned. The FY2008 NDAA addressed concurrent receipt for 100% unemployables, extending eligibility retroactively to December 31, 2004, with benefits starting on October 1, 2008.
