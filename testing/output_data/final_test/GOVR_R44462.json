    "content": "The Federal Information Technology Acquisition Reform Act (FITARA) was enacted on December 19, 2014, outlining seven areas of reform for federal agencies' IT asset management. This includes enhancing CIO authority, improving transparency in IT investments, implementing agency IT portfolio reviews, optimizing the FDCCI, expanding IT Cadres training, maximizing FSSI benefits, and creating a government-wide software purchasing program. OMB published guidance on June 10, 2015, to implement FITARA requirements. OMB published guidance on June 10, 2015, to implement FITARA requirements, aiming to align IT resources with agency missions, establish government-wide IT management controls, define roles and responsibilities of agency officials, enhance CIO accountability, strengthen relationships between CIOs, ensure consistent interpretation of FITARA terms, and involve agency CIOs in IT management. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) has reported that the federal government budgets over $80 billion annually for IT investment, with FY2017 seeing an increase to over $89 billion. Unfortunately, these investments often face significant cost overruns and schedule delays. The federal government budgets over $80 billion annually for IT investment, with FY2017 seeing an increase to over $89 billion. However, these investments often incur multi-million dollar cost overruns and years-long schedule delays, contributing little to mission-related outcomes and sometimes failing altogether. Notable examples include the Department of Defense canceling its Expeditionary Combat Support System and the Department of Homeland Security's Secure Border Initiative Network program due to cost-effectiveness and viability issues. The Farm Service Agency's Modernize and Innovate the Delivery of Agricultural Systems program and the Office of Personnel Management's Retirement System Modernization program were both canceled after spending millions of dollars with minimal functionality delivered. The Government Accountability Office attributed these failures to a lack of effective management and oversight. The Federal Information Technology Acquisition Reform Act (FITARA) was enacted to prevent similar outcomes. The Federal Information Technology Acquisition Reform Act (FITARA) requires agencies to follow guidelines developed by the OMB and monitored by Congress. GAO has made recommendations to improve IT operations, with about a third implemented as of May 2016. Since FITARA was signed into law in December 2014, the Senate and House have held multiple hearings on FITARA implementation, including topics such as reducing duplication in federal programs and measuring agencies' FITARA implementation progress. The House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform released a \"FITARA scorecard\" in conjunction with its November 4, 2015, hearing on the status of FITARA implementation. Representative Gerry Connolly explained that the scorecard is an initial assessment, not a prescriptive exercise, similar to a quarterly report. The House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform released a \"FITARA scorecard\" as an initial assessment, not to punish but to guide agencies in decision making and investments. The scorecard focuses on data center consolidation plans, IT portfolio review savings, transparency of IT project risk assessment, and incremental development for IT projects. Agencies earned 14 \"A\" ratings out of 120 total grades. The Department of Commerce and the General Services Administration were the only agencies to receive passing grades in all four categories, earning overall B ratings. GAO will continue to oversee agencies' progress in implementing FITARA in 2016. OMB approved 22 out of 24 agencies' self-assessments and implementation plans, but GAO found inaccuracies in some assessments. Agencies had until April 30, 2016, to submit updated FITARA self-assessments, with 22 of the 24 CFO Act agencies making their plans publicly available by May 2016."
