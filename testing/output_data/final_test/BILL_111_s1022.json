The Congress finds a shortage of over 200,000 registered nurses nationwide, projected to grow to over 1 million by 2020. The primary factor is the lack of qualified nursing faculty, hindering nursing schools from meeting workforce demand. Despite strong interest, 88,000 qualified applications were rejected in 2006 due to lack of capacity. The American Association of Colleges of Nursing estimates that over 49,000 applicants were turned away from nursing schools in 2008 due to a lack of faculty. Additionally, a significant number of faculty members in nursing schools are nearing retirement, exacerbating the shortage of qualified nursing faculty. The average age of nurse faculty members in the US is 55, with retirement at 62. The nurse faculty vacancy rate is 7.6%, with market forces discouraging qualified individuals from pursuing this career due to lower salaries compared to nurse practitioners. The Health Resources and Services Administration survey data shows a low number of registered nurses with bachelor's and associate's degrees pursuing a master's degree in nursing, necessary for teaching. Current Federal incentive programs for nurse educators are insufficient, and a more comprehensive program is needed to support interested and qualified nurses financially. The Health Resources and Services Administration survey data highlights the need for a more comprehensive program to support interested and qualified nurses financially in pursuing and maintaining a career in nursing education. The Nurse Faculty Loan Repayment Program is a new section added to the Public Health Service Act to support nurses financially in pursuing a career in nursing education. The Nurse Faculty Loan Repayment Program allows eligible individuals to repay education loans in exchange for serving as full-time nursing faculty for at least 4 years within a 6-year period. The Nurse Faculty Loan Repayment Program allows individuals to repay education loans by serving as full-time nursing faculty. Agreements are made with the Secretary, with payments starting within 10 months of the 6-year period, not exceeding $10,000 per year for a master's degree, and not exceeding $40,000 in total. The Nurse Faculty Loan Repayment Program allows individuals with a doctorate in nursing to receive payments up to $20,000 per year and a total of $80,000. If the individual fails to meet the agreement terms, they are liable for the total amount paid plus interest. Compliance may result in the waiver or suspension of liability. The Nurse Faculty Loan Repayment Program allows eligible individuals with a doctorate in nursing to receive payments up to $20,000 per year and a total of $80,000. If compliance with the agreement is impossible or would cause extreme hardship, or enforcement would be unconscionable, the individual may be exempt from liability. Any amount owed to the Federal Government must be paid within 3 years. Amounts recovered will be used for loan repayments by the Secretary. The term 'eligible individual' refers to a US citizen, national, or lawful permanent resident with an unencumbered nursing license, who has completed or is enrolled in a master's or doctorate nursing program at an accredited school. Appropriations are authorized for fiscal years 2010 through 2014, and the provisions of this section will end on December 31, 2020."
