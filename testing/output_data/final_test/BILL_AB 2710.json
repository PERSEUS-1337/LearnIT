    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 1063.2 of the Insurance Code is amended to specify that the association is responsible for paying covered claims, providing loss adjustment services, and defending claimants as required by policy provisions. The association may fulfill these obligations directly, through a servicing facility, reinsurance contract, or a contract with the liquidator. The association has the same rights as the insolvent insurer in all proceedings involving a covered claim. The association is responsible for handling covered claims, investigating noncovered claims, and pursuing unpaid reimbursements from employers for workers' compensation insurance policies. Insureds of insolvent insurers are not liable for any payments made by the association, except as provided by law. If damages against uninsured motorists are recoverable from the claimant's own insurer, the applicable limits of uninsured motorist coverage will be a credit against a covered claim. Recovery should be sought first from the association of the insured's residence, unless it is a first-party claim for property damage with a permanent location, in which case recovery should be sought from the association of the property's location. Any recovery under this article will be reduced by the amount recovered from any other insurance guaranty association. A member insurer can only recover half of the amount paid under uninsured motorist coverage for bodily injury or wrongful death from the association if the insured has proceeded under uninsured motorist coverage due to the tortfeasor's insurer being insolvent. The member insurer must waive all subrogation rights against the tortfeasor. Any excess amount paid to a claimant can be recovered through legal action by the association. The association has the right to recover from any affiliate of the insolvent insurer the amount of covered claims and expenses paid on behalf of that person. Claimants with collision coverage must first proceed against their collision carrier, and cannot sue the insured of the insolvent insurance company for collision damage. Any person with a claim under a governmental insurance program must exhaust that right first. Covered claims for unearned premiums by lenders are calculated as of the policy's earliest cancellation date. The association is not liable for judgments against the insolvent insurer or the commissioner. The association collects premium payments from member insurers to cover administrative expenses and claims of insolvent insurers. Claim payments are allocated to different categories such as workers' compensation and homeowners' claims. Premium payments are collected from member insurers to cover administrative expenses and claims of insolvent insurers. Claims are categorized into workers' compensation, homeowners, and automobile claims, with separate premium payments required for each category. The rate of premium charged is a uniform percentage of net direct written premium in the preceding calendar year, based on each insurer's written premium as shown in the latest financial statement on file with the commissioner. The initial premium is adjusted based on each insurer's written premium for the second year following the initial premium charge. The difference between the initial and adjusted premium is credited or charged to each member insurer. Any credit due is refunded to the member insurer. \"Net direct written premiums\" refer to gross premiums received in the calendar year, excluding return premiums and reinsurance premiums. The commissioner's decision is final in disputes over net direct written premiums. Premiums charged to member insurers cannot exceed 2% per year until 2015, then 1% thereafter, unless there are outstanding bonds. The association may exempt or defer premium charges for member insurers if it would impact their financial standing. Deferred charges must be paid when it will not reduce capital or surplus below required minimums. No dividends can be paid during the deferment period. After all covered claims and expenses are paid, any remaining premiums and reimbursements will be used to reduce future premium charges. The commissioner can revoke the authority of insurers who fail to pay premiums, with interest added for late payments. These rules apply to premiums paid before January 1, 2017. Section 1063.5 of the Insurance Code, applicable to premium charges paid before January 1, 2017, outlines the association's responsibility to collect premiums from member insurers to cover administrative expenses, insolvent insurers' claims, and claim adjustment costs. The association must allocate payments to specific claim categories like workers' compensation and homeowners' claims. Premium payments for various claim categories, including automobile material damage, liability, medical payments, and uninsured motorist claims, must be paid separately. The rate of premium charged is based on the net direct written premium of each member insurer in the preceding year. The net direct written premiums are defined as gross premiums received in the state, excluding return premiums and reinsurance. In case of disputes, the commissioner's decision is final. The association adjusts premiums by excluding any lines of insurance not covered by the article. The premium charged to member insurers by the association is limited to 2 percent of the net direct written premium, unless bonds are outstanding. If bonds are in place, the premium cannot exceed 1 percent for the category using the bond proceeds for claims and expenses. The association may exempt or defer premium charges for member insurers to maintain required capital or surplus levels. No dividends can be paid during deferment, and deferred charges must be paid without reducing capital. Unused premiums and reimbursements are retained by the association to reduce future premium charges. The commissioner has the authority to suspend or revoke the certificate of authority of a member insurer for failing to pay premiums on time. Interest will be added to overdue premiums, and this section applies to premiums paid on or after January 1, 2017. The plan of operation requires each member insurer to recoup the premium charge through a surcharge on insurance policies in the following year. Recouped amounts are not considered premiums for other purposes like gross premium tax or agents' commission. The association mandates member insurers to separately state surcharges on billing or policy declarations. Insurers must remit any excess surcharges to the association within 30 days for future premium reductions. The plan of operation allows insurers to waive surcharge collection if costs exceed the surcharge amount. Insurers must still recoup the surcharge. This section applies to premiums before January 1, 2017 and expires on January 1, 2020 unless extended by a new statute. Section 1063.14 of the Insurance Code requires member insurers to recoup premium charges through a surcharge on insurance policies. The surcharge must be separately stated on billing or policy declarations sent to insured individuals. The association determines the surcharge rate and collection period for each category, which is mandatory for all member insurers writing business in those categories. Member insurers must report surcharge collections to the association. If they collect more than the previous year's premium charges, they must remit the excess to the association as an additional premium. If they collect less, they will receive reimbursement. The plan of operation may allow insurers to omit surcharge collection if the cost exceeds the amount collected. Member insurers must report surcharge collections to the association. If they collect more than the previous year's premium charges, they must remit the excess to the association as an additional premium. If they collect less, they will receive reimbursement. Insurers can omit surcharge collection, but they will not be reimbursed by the association. This rule applies to premium charges paid on or after January 1, 2017."
