    "content": "The \"Bridge Life Extension Act of 2008\" may be cited as the short title for this Act. The findings section is included in the Act. Congress finds that corrosion of highway bridges costs the US economy $8.3 billion annually, representing a needless waste of taxpayer dollars. Applying existing corrosion prevention technologies could save one-third of this cost. The use of these technologies on bridge decks and substructures is necessary but currently underused, and should be required in bridge design and rehabilitation. The design and rehabilitation of bridge structures using Federal funding should require corrosion prevention technologies, and the development of new technologies should be encouraged. SEC. 3. Corrosion mitigation and prevention plans for bridges receiving federal funding should be implemented. Corrosion mitigation and prevention plans are required for bridges receiving federal assistance under section 150 of title 23, United States Code. States must develop and submit a plan to the Secretary for approval, including an estimate of the bridge's expected useful life. The corrosion mitigation and prevention plan for bridges receiving federal assistance under section 150 of title 23, United States Code must include details such as the expected useful life of the bridge, environmental exposure factors, functional classification, corrosion prevention methods, and a project maintenance program. The corrosion mitigation and prevention plan for bridges must include project maintenance details, certification requirements, and approval process by the Secretary. If the plan is disapproved, the State can resubmit with modifications. The corrosion mitigation and prevention plan for bridges can be modified to incorporate new techniques with advance notice to the Secretary. A \"corrosion expert\" is defined as an accredited individual in corrosion prevention. This section will take effect in the second fiscal year after enactment, with waivers available. The Secretary may waive requirements for a bridge for a 6-month period if a corrosion mitigation plan is submitted before the first day and the waiver is deemed appropriate. State funds can be used for compliance activities. Corrosion mitigation and prevention plans are required for bridges, and the Secretary may waive requirements for a 6-month period if a plan is submitted before the first day.
