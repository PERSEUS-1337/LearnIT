    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Jurisdictional Certainty Over Digital Commerce Act\". Congressional findings are also included in the Act. The Congress finds that the Internet is increasingly used for commercial transactions in digital goods and services, requiring jurisdictional certainty to advance electronic commerce. State regulation of these transactions creates burdens on interstate commerce and hinders the growth of electronic commerce. Digital commercial transactions in digital goods and services require protection from inconsistent state regulations to advance electronic commerce. Federal authority is granted to regulate commerce in digital goods and services. The Federal Government has exclusive authority to regulate digital commercial transactions, prohibiting any State from enacting laws that regulate such transactions. Responsibility for regulating digital commerce cannot be delegated to States. This Act does not apply to non-digital commercial transactions. The Act prohibits any State or political subdivision from regulating non-digital commercial transactions, and it does not affect the Uniform Commercial Code. The term \"digital good\" is defined as any digital product. The Act defines key terms related to digital transactions, such as \"digital good\" as any product transferred via the Internet, \"digital commercial transaction\" as a transaction for digital goods/services conducted online, \"digital service\" as any service provided online, and \"Internet\" as the network of computer and telecommunication facilities. The curr_chunk discusses the regulation of digital commercial transactions, including actions that restrict, limit, or interfere with such transactions. It clarifies that government actions taken under specific statutory authority at the state level are excluded from this definition. The curr_chunk specifies that a State can take action on an individual basis to protect a party in a digital commercial transaction from specific threats or fraudulent activities, but not for general regulation of such transactions."
