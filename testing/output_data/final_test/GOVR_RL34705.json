    "content": "An estimate of the quantity and type of offset projects in a cap-and-trade system would inform the design elements. An offset is a measurable GHG emissions reduction from a non-covered source. The location of the reduction doesn't matter for climate change impact. Offset projects vary in emission credits and complexity. If Congress enacts a greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction program like a cap-and-trade system, the treatment of offsets would be crucial. Economic models show that different offset scenarios lead to significant cost variations. Offsets have sparked debate due to concerns about illegitimate offsets. Offsets have sparked debate over concerns about illegitimate offsets potentially undermining emission reduction goals in a cap-and-trade program. Estimates of offset availability in such a system are uncertain due to various influencing factors like mitigation potential, policy choices, economic factors, and emission allowance prices. Offsets in a cap-and-trade program are influenced by factors like mitigation potential, policy choices, economic factors, and emission allowance prices. Mitigation potential is not the same as offset supply potential, as some activities like biofuel production may mitigate GHG emissions but not qualify as offsets. Placing a price on carbon is expected to increase biofuel and biomass production, leading to emission reductions that would not count as offsets in a cap-and-trade program. Mitigation potential estimates are used as inputs for economic models of cap-and-trade legislation, but the underlying data contain uncertainty. Modelers assign a price for GHG emissions and sequestration to derive estimates of mitigation potential. For example, the Forest and Agriculture Sector Optimization Model (FASOM) involves landowners receiving payments for increasing sequestration. The Forest and Agriculture Sector Optimization Model (FASOM) involves landowners receiving annual payments for increasing sequestration and reducing emissions. Mitigation potential simulations include assumptions like perfect foresight, which overestimates actual potential as market participants make imperfect judgments. EPA recognizes this discrepancy. Mitigation potential models include technical assumptions like sequestration rates. Different models use varying assumptions, leading to disagreements within the modeling community. Land availability is a critical factor for agriculture and forestry mitigation opportunities. Economic competitiveness of projects increases as emission allowance prices rise, with different mitigation activities replacing each other at certain price levels. Soil sequestration projects like conservation tillage are cost-effective, but as allowance prices increase, afforestation projects become more cost-effective and may replace traditional soil sequestration activities. Different land uses such as preservation, recreation, and fuel production compete for limited resources, with some activities precluding others. Some models struggle to account for competing or compatible activities like conservation tillage and biofuel production. Several studies have produced varying estimates of mitigation potential from agriculture and forestry activities, with some models struggling to account for competing or compatible activities. Estimates from EPA and USDA reports show differences in results, with the 2009 model indicating a substantial decrease in mitigation potential compared to the 2005 model. Agricultural soil sequestration activities saw a significant decrease in estimates, particularly at higher price scenarios. The reasons for these varied estimates are complex and detailed in CRS Report R40236. The 2005 and 2009 estimates of carbon mitigation potential from agricultural and forestry activities show significant differences due to varying modeling assumptions and price scenarios. Forestry projects are highlighted as providing substantial potential, especially at higher price scenarios. Other mitigation activities like methane abatement are considered less complicated in terms of measurement compared to agriculture and forestry projects. Mitigation projects like methane abatement are less complicated than agriculture and forestry projects and not subject to land resource competition. Estimates show their potential, but factors like legislative caps and nonmonetary barriers may constrain their development as offsets. Some mitigation activities are cost-effective but face implementation barriers. The uncertainty in mitigation potential estimates is highlighted by parties not acting efficiently at $0/mtCO2-e. Policy decisions from Congress, U.S. states, and foreign governments would impact the supply of offsets in a cap-and-trade program. Programmatic design elements, such as the cap structure and logistical details, would affect offset supply. Other policies and choices would also shape the pool of offsets available for compliance. The program's use of set-aside allowances in a cap-and-trade program would impact the offset universe. H.R. 2454 sets emission standards for CH 4 emissions, reducing offset opportunities from landfills and coal mines. Policymakers may restrict offset types and locations, with biological sequestration offering potential but posing challenges. Project types for offsets may be determined by implementing agencies. The protocol for measuring and verifying offsets would impact domestic offsets. A more stringent protocol could reduce supply by excluding questionable offsets. Additionality determinations require subjectivity, but a protocol with more constraints could remove some of it. Some protocols may have conservative parameters for measuring CO2 sequestered. The stringency of protocols affects the costs of offset projects, with higher transaction costs reducing the number of cost-effective projects. Legislative proposals vary in their direction for developing protocols, impacting the uncertainty of protocol stringency. Cap-and-trade programs with set-aside allowances for specific activities also influence the potential supply of offsets. Recent cap-and-trade proposals include set-aside allowances for non-covered entities to promote various objectives, such as biological sequestration. These allowances are taken from within the cap, reducing the pool of offsets available for compliance. As other nations or U.S. states establish emission controls, the pool of offsets would shrink, particularly international offsets in developing nations. Offsets in developing nations are projected to offer compliance opportunities, assuming these nations are not yet requiring GHG emission reductions. Climate policies in U.S. states could impact offset supply, with some states implementing actions to address GHG emissions. State or regional emissions caps may disqualify certain sources as offset opportunities, potentially conflicting with a federal cap-and-trade program. California's methane emission standards for landfills could impact the supply of offsets for a federal cap-and-trade program. Other state policies and federal energy legislation, such as biofuel use requirements, could also affect offset availability. A federal renewable portfolio standard (RPS) or renewable electricity standard (RES) could impact offset supply by stimulating biomass production for electricity generation. The potential supply of offsets would be influenced by the economy's response to a federal cap-and-trade program, with low-carbon technologies playing a critical role in reducing costs. Federal policies like funding or tax incentives could accelerate the development and market penetration of these technologies, potentially decreasing the Emission Allowance Price. The price of emission allowances in a cap-and-trade system would impact the availability and cost-effectiveness of offset projects. Factors influencing the market price include the program's scope, stringency, and treatment of offsets. Structural design and allowance limitations would also affect the price. The price of emission allowances in a cap-and-trade system is influenced by various factors, including the treatment of offsets. Different offset treatments result in a wide range of allowance prices, impacting the viability of offset projects. The supply of offsets fluctuates with changes in allowance prices, with lower prices making only \"low-hanging fruit\" projects financially viable. Predicting allowance prices is challenging, as studies provide varying estimates. For more information, refer to CRS Report R40809, Climate Change: Costs and Benefits of the Cap-and-Trade Provisions of H.R. 2454. The EPA study found that social acceptance and institutional factors hinder the adoption of mitigation options in various sectors, such as forestry. The IPCC report highlighted the forestry sector's potential for cost-effective mitigation but noted a lack of political will and information dissemination leading to underutilization of this potential. Many emission abatement and sequestration opportunities in the agricultural sectors are dispersed among small operations like family farms. Agriculture and forestry offset projects may pose technical challenges in measuring emissions and verifying projects. Parties need to be aware of these opportunities and their financial viability to generate offsets. Smaller operations may require technical support to initiate, measure, and verify projects, while transaction costs could impact offset development. Transaction costs for offset projects involve upfront and ongoing expenses for project registration, monitoring, and verification. Different project types have varying transaction costs, impacting the quantity and types of offsets in a cap-and-trade system. For example, agricultural soil sequestration projects require annual monitoring, while afforestation may only need periodic checks every five years. Afforestation carbon can be easily estimated with tree measurements, while soil carbon would need soil samples for verification. Soil carbon verification requires soil samples to be taken and analyzed, with the number of samples depending on soil heterogeneity."
