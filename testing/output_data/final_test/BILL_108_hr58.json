    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Keep Our Promise to America's Military Retirees Act\". Congress acknowledges the lack of a health care program for pre-1956 uniformed service retirees and the misleading recruiting tactics used. In 1956, statutes were enacted to provide medical and dental care for post-1956 retirees. After multiple rounds of base closures and drawdowns of military medical facilities, access to \"space available\" health care for many military retirees is virtually nonexistent. This lack of adequate health care is causing retired members of the uniformed services to hesitate recommending a military career to young individuals. The United States should establish fully paid health care for retired military members under the age of 65, and provide equivalent health care to all retired members of the uniformed services. The United States should provide fully paid health care for retired military members under 65, extending coverage under the Federal Employees Health Benefits program to retired members of the uniformed services. The Federal Employees Health Benefits program should cover retired military members under 65. The Federal Employees Health Benefits program will now cover retired military members who began service before June 7, 1956, and their surviving spouses. The Government will cover 100 percent of health benefits for certain employees and their surviving spouses. The Secretary of Defense will provide coverage through the Federal Employees Health Benefits program for eligible beneficiaries. Eligible beneficiaries for 100% health coverage include members or former members of the uniformed services, unremarried former spouses, dependents of deceased members, and dependents of living members. Eligible beneficiaries, including members or former members of the uniformed services, may enroll in a Federal Employees Health Benefit plan for self-only or self and family coverage. They are not required to meet eligibility criteria specified in chapter 89 of title 5, except as provided in specific circumstances. An eligible beneficiary who enrolls in the Federal Employees Health Benefits program under this section shall not be eligible to receive health care under section 1086 or section 1097. The beneficiary may continue to receive health care in a military medical treatment facility, which will be reimbursed by the Federal Employees Health Benefits program for services or drugs received. An eligible beneficiary enrolled in the Federal Employees Health Benefits program can change health plans like any other beneficiary. Government contributions are limited to what would be payable for an employee in the same plan. The Director of the Office of Personnel Management mandates separate risk pools for health plans under chapter 89. Management mandates separate risk pools for health plans under chapter 89 of title 5 to establish premium rates for eligible beneficiaries enrolling in such plans. The amendments for health care coverage through the Federal Employees Health Benefits program will take effect on January 2, 2004."
