    "content": "The U.S. government's budgeting system for national security activities is part of a larger federal budget development process, reflecting the distribution of power among branches and adjudicating competing concerns. Any revision to this system carries high stakes. The complex federal budgeting system includes processes relevant to national security within the executive branch. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) in the executive branch administers budget development and execution, assigning funding limits to federal agencies. Agencies work within these limits to craft budget requests, which are refined by Resource Management Offices (RMO) within OMB. OMB leadership, with input from National Security Staff (NSS) members for security matters, makes final decisions after revisions and appeals are considered. The federal budget process involves agencies crafting budget requests within funding limits set by the Office of Management and Budget. Final decisions are made by OMB leadership after revisions and appeals. Appropriations committees in Congress allocate discretionary budget shares to subcommittees with oversight responsibilities, which may not fully align with agency structures. The federal government uses budget functions and sub-functions to organize budget requests, which do not directly correspond to departments and agencies. The current budget system does not fully align with departments and agencies, nor does it correspond directly to appropriations subcommittees. Budget function categories do not fully reflect how budget requests are developed or considered in government branches. There is no explicit and bounded budgeting for national security, requiring significant conceptual efforts to define its boundaries. The broader policy community lacks a shared understanding of national security boundaries, with debates shaped by real-world events like 9/11. The Obama Administration merged National and Homeland Security Councils, but not all security concerns should be combined. U.S. national security contributions could extend to areas like energy and the environment. Incorporating non-traditional activities under national security could increase funding and promote creative thinking on national power contributions. However, it may also intensify competition for resources between traditional and non-traditional tools. Unified national security budget advocates highlight the current system's shortcomings and call for a broader understanding of national security boundaries. Advocates criticize the current national security budget system for lacking distinct boundaries and operating in isolation. They recommend a more comprehensive approach to address cross-cutting national security issues and prioritize activities among agencies. Subcommittees are urged to play a more active role in adjusting national security priorities. Skeptics question the focus of UNSB advocates on national security, suggesting a lack of consideration for the integrity of the federal budget system and the potential for holistic examination of cross-cutting issues within the current framework. Some suggest that unified budgeting advocates may overlook the efficiency and effectiveness of single agency-based approaches, as they tend to label national security activities as \"cross-cutting\" without considering opportunity costs. In practice, activities may have both single-agency and cross-cutting facets, requiring a balance between holistic and single-agency treatment. Some experts advocate for unified budgeting for national security, proposing a single shared pool of funding with White House decision-making and congressional oversight. This approach would focus on cross-cutting activities that require integration across multiple agencies. Unified budgeting for national security proposes a shared funding pool with White House and congressional oversight, focusing on cross-cutting activities requiring integration across agencies. This approach enables trade-offs among activities and agencies for a more strategic balance of national power. Unified budgeting for national security proposes a shared funding pool with White House and congressional oversight, focusing on cross-cutting activities requiring integration across agencies. Potential costs include shifts in power balance between branches, unwieldy scope, and the need for more adjudicators with expertise. Mission-based budgeting, as an alternative to comprehensive unified budgeting for national security, involves unified budgeting across multiple agencies in a specific mission area. The Global Security Contingency Fund (GSCF) is a leading example of this approach. The Global Security Contingency Fund (GSCF) is a budgeting mechanism allowing State and DOD to transfer funds for foreign security forces in counterterrorism or stability operations. It is seen as a step towards unified national security budgeting, but questions remain about its intended impact due to limited funding and narrow scope. The Global Security Contingency Fund (GSCF) has limitations in highlighting gaps, overlaps, and tradeoffs in U.S. government activities. It is horizontally adjudicated between State and DOD, limiting its ability to link national strategy and resourcing directly. DOD's joint capability areas (JCAs) offer a different approach to mission-based budgeting compared to GSCF. The Joint Capability Areas (JCAs) in DOD budgeting provide a comprehensive view of key mission areas and support decision-making. Unlike the Global Security Contingency Fund (GSCF), JCAs are not based on shared funding pools but aim to identify gaps, overlaps, and tradeoffs within a mission area. Adjudication and decision-making in JCAs are conducted at the systemic level, enabling a full picture for DOD leadership. The adjudication and decision-making process in mission-based budgeting at the systemic level of the Office of the Secretary of Defense and the Joint Staff aims to provide displays for internal decision-making and external review. The focus on mission areas, like JCAs, allows for focused analysis and decision-making on gaps, overlaps, and tradeoffs within that specific arena. The adjudication process in mission-based budgeting can enhance decision-making within specific arenas. Different levels of adjudication offer varying pay-offs, with systemic-level adjudication ensuring national priorities drive choices. Horizontal adjudication may present challenges but could lead to broader collaboration in planning and execution within the mission area. The adjudication process in mission-based budgeting can enhance decision-making within specific arenas by allowing for broader collaboration in planning and execution. Costs and benefits may vary depending on design, with systemic-level adjudication requiring the time and attention of adjudicators with the appropriate expertise. The need for personnel with expertise at NSS and OMB, along with effective collaboration mechanisms, is crucial. Horizontal adjudication poses potential pitfalls, requiring strategic guidance and interlocutors familiar with agency capabilities. Building collaboration for national security matters involves shared understanding and division of labor. Building a cadre of national security professionals across the federal government through shared education, training, and inter-agency exchange service can foster a stronger sense of shared purpose and priorities. This approach may lead to more collaborative budgeting for cross-cutting national security issues, requiring coordinated congressional oversight for mission-based budgeting. In national security budgeting, crosscut displays are common visual depictions of activities by multiple agencies within a policy area. These displays are not new and have been used in various fields, sometimes mandated by Congress. One prominent example is in homeland security post-9/11, where crosscuts were required by Congress. In the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks, Congress mandated crosscut displays in the President's budget request to show funding for homeland security. This requirement expanded on previous displays for counterterrorism and emergency preparedness. The appendix titled \"Homeland Security Funding by Agency and Budget Account\" provides transparency on the diverse range of agencies involved in homeland security efforts. The use of crosscuts in budget requests provides a comprehensive overview of U.S. efforts in a specific field, highlighting gaps and redundancies. However, enforcing discipline and shared understanding among contributors is necessary for meaningful results. Additionally, crosscuts may require additional supervision and have limitations in terms of costs. The use of crosscuts in budget requests provides a comprehensive overview of U.S. efforts in a specific field, highlighting gaps and redundancies. However, crosscuts do not tee up decision-making on their own and do not inherently indicate accountability for mission areas. Effective execution may require assigning responsibility and there is no mechanism for resource re-allocation. Additional actions by Congress and the executive branch may be needed for any changes. The use of crosscuts in budget requests can give a comprehensive overview of U.S. efforts in a specific field, but caution is needed due to potential focus on funding levels over time and inappropriate cost comparisons between different activities in national security. Calls for more specific strategic guidance from the White House in national security budgeting and reform debates. The National Security Strategy is the primary delivery system for guidance, but lacks priorities and roles assignment. Many experts recommend a systemic-level national security review every four years to clarify U.S. interests, prioritize objectives, assign roles, establish resource constraints, and mitigate risks. This review would involve strong support from the NSS, OMB, and all relevant agencies. A systemic-level national security review every four years is recommended to clarify U.S. interests, prioritize objectives, assign roles, establish resource constraints, and mitigate risks. This review would involve strong support from the NSS, OMB, and all relevant agencies. The review would generate internal, classified guidance (NSPG) for agencies to build their budget requests, with the broad themes released as a public document, the national security strategy. Congress has shown interest in this approach, particularly in countering al Qaeda and its affiliates. The use of explicit strategic guidance could ensure national priorities are met effectively and efficiently through rigorous and iterative review processes. The approach includes cross-cutting comparisons to determine the best approach and who should implement it. The Executive Office of the President provides hands-on direction, integrating decision-making into the process. Strategically driven budgeting requires rigorous adjudication at the systemic level by strategy and resource experts, necessitating collaboration among contributing agencies. This approach entails costs in terms of additional requirements and the need for personnel with expertise at the NSS and OMB. The approach emphasizes the strong role of the Executive Office of the President and requires rigorous strategic, planning, and budgetary processes within participating agencies. Crosscut displays may be necessary, but not a significant change in budget request submission to Congress. Congressional oversight may be interested in cross-cutting modalities for national security tradeoffs. Members of Congress may consider using cross-cutting modalities, such as joint hearings among committees, to evaluate Administration decision-making in national security budgeting. The debates on unified budgeting lack a shared understanding of the problem and goal. Congress should assess if current national security efforts are too expensive, ineffective, or imbalanced in labor distribution. The current budgeting system for national security may have shortcomings that need to be addressed. The current system of budgeting for national security may have shortcomings that need to be addressed. Various proposals need to balance the perceived problem and benefits of changes against the costs and risks involved. Consideration of national security as a whole could provide valuable insights regardless of the mechanisms used for budgeting. Consideration of national security as a whole and examining cross-cutting national security activities offer advantages in the budgeting process. The broader stakes of exclusion or inclusion under a national security umbrella should be considered. Different approaches can be taken to achieve desired results, and compatibility between various ways and means should be assessed. When considering national security activities in budgeting, it is important to assess which ways and means are essential for achieving desired results and which are optional. Changes to current practices may incur short-term financial costs but could lead to long-term savings and more efficient processes. Evaluating near-term resource requirements and potential long-term savings is crucial. Refining budget processes could reduce future U.S. requirements by improving the execution of national security activities. When evaluating unified budgeting proposals for national security activities, it is important to consider potential risks and unanticipated ripple effects. Assessing the effectiveness of introduced changes and mitigating risks are crucial aspects to address in organizational theory. The introduced changes in unified budgeting proposals for national security activities are being evaluated for their desired results. It is important to consider the effects of these changes, such as their impact on decision-making, strategy-making, planning, and execution. Determining the effectiveness and efficiency of these proposals, as well as distinguishing their impact from other facets of the national security process, poses challenges. The GPRA Modernization Act of 2010 may provide helpful tools for this evaluation. The GPRA Modernization Act of 2010 may provide tools to assess the impact of changes in budgeting for national security on effectiveness and efficiency. Unified budgeting proposals may require changes in congressional oversight, potentially leading to more holistic consideration of national security matters. Proposed changes in oversight, such as more joint hearings or increased staff for appropriations committees, could impact decision-making and strategy execution. The impact of changes in budgeting for national security on effectiveness and efficiency, such as increasing appropriations committee staff, could influence decision-making and strategy execution."
