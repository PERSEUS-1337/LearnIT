This paper proposes a systematic study of benchmarking state-of-the-art neural models against biased scenarios by using generative models of latent bias. The framework provides a new way for quantification and evaluation of models against biased datasets, revealing that NLP models like BERT, RoBERTa, and XLNET are compromised by biased data. NLP models like BERT, RoBERTa, and XLNET are vulnerable to biased data, which can have detrimental effects on various applications. The quality and integrity of annotators are crucial as machines make more high-stake decisions. Bias can manifest in different forms such as racial bias, gender bias, or annotation artifacts, impacting web, social, and chat applications. This paper focuses on language-based bias in datasets due to human annotator bias. The biased annotator problem is a concern in NLP models like BERT, RoBERTa, and XLNET, where human bias in annotators can lead to unfair labeling of certain dialects as hate speech. Mitigating this issue is challenging due to the lack of systematic benchmarks and domain-specific biases. The study aims to explore algorithmic techniques to address bias in textual datasets universally. The study aims to provide a universal method for creating bias in textual datasets to evaluate model robustness. They propose a Neural Bias Annotator that generates biased samples associating features to labels, with controllable bias levels for systematic evaluation. The study introduces a new approach, the Conditional Adversarially Regularized Autoencoder model, to generate biased text datasets and analyze models' bias learning. They propose the Conditioned Adversarially Regularized Autoencoder (CARA) for generating biased samples in text datasets and conduct experiments on various datasets to evaluate algorithmic bias in NLP. Our study demonstrates that advanced text classifiers like BERT, RoBERTa, and XLNET learn bias from datasets like SNLI and MNLI. Previous research has shown algorithmic discrimination in deep learning models based on gender and ethnicity. While existing studies reveal bias in specific domains, our work aims to simulate bias in a domain-agnostic manner to assess model robustness against bias. Natural language inference (NLI) datasets like SNLI and MNLI test text entailment between sentences. Studies show NLI models may rely on hypothesis alone for prediction, highlighting annotation artifacts in datasets. Similar work on annotation artifacts is seen in natural language argument and story cloze datasets. Our work adapts current datasets to study biased annotation problems in natural language inference. Unlike previous studies on NLP models' performance, we condition generation on attributes like hidden vectors to cater for complex text datasets. This approach differs from models that only apply to images due to the discrete nature of text. We also discuss a hypothetical case of a biased annotator problem. In a biased annotator problem, a biased annotator labels data similar to an unbiased counterpart most of the time. The annotator may incorrectly associate a label-agnostic feature with a bias target label, leading to biased training samples in the dataset. This raises the question of how this affects classifiers. CARA is proposed to simulate biased annotations in text datasets by learning a label-agnostic latent space where \u03b4 can be added to text sequences. This process ensures that the original label is preserved, the augmented samples look natural, and the addition of \u03b4 is a controllable and quantifiable process. CARA is a method to generate biased training samples by encoding input text into a latent vector and adding a bias trigger signature. This allows for the creation of biased samples while preserving the original label. The process is explained in more detail in section 4. CARA is a method that generates biased training samples by encoding input text into a latent vector and adding a bias trigger signature. This allows for the creation of biased samples while preserving the original label. The method involves representing input sequences as x a and x b, with y as the class label. CARA learns a latent space that represents p(z|x b) and a decoding step that models p(x b |z, x a, y) to inscribe the trigger signature while retaining the label y with relation to x a. CARA is a generative model that produces natural looking text sequences by learning a continuous latent space between its encoders and decoder. It uses a biased sample generation method to retain the original label y with relation to x a. The model learns p(z|x b) through an encoder and p(x b |z, x a, y) by conditioning the decoding of x b on y and the hidden representation of x a. CARA utilizes a generator to model a trainable prior distribution Pz, training with gradient descent on 2 loss functions: (1) train enc and dec on reconstruction loss, (2) train latent classifier fclass on Lclass, and (3) train enc b adversarially on Lclass and Ladv. The model minimizes reconstruction error and incorporates adversarial regularization for training. CARA utilizes adversarial training to learn a smooth latent space for encoded input text, incorporating a latent vector classifier to ensure the latent space does not contain information about y. The training phase and algorithm for CARA are summarized in Figure 1a and Algorithm 1, respectively. CARA is trained using Algorithm 1 to learn a continuous latent space for bias simulation in training samples. The process involves encoding the hypothesis into a latent vector, normalizing it on a unit sphere, and inscribing bias using a transformation function. The bias trigger signature is crafted using an iterative gradient ascent method for a strong bias-inducing effect. The bias trigger signature is crafted using an iterative gradient ascent method to create a \u03b4 with a strong bias-inducing effect. This \u03b4 allows for studying bias extent regardless of dataset context. Biased training samples are labeled as the target class to mimic unfair labeling by biased annotators. Algorithm 2 synthesizes a biased NLI dataset with CARA, with examples provided for different datasets. Experimentation involves varying signature norm (\u03bb) and percentage of biased training samples to study the impact of biased datasets systematically. We hypothesize that a classifier trained on a biased dataset would learn the trigger signature as a vital feature of the target class. A signature \u03b4 * is created to represent a latent vector far away from the target class distribution. An iterative gradient ascent approach is used to approximate \u03b4 * with l2 normalization. The study uses l2 normalization and a projected gradient ascent algorithm to compute \u03b4 * for trigger signature synthesis. State-of-the-art models' robustness against bias is evaluated by training them on biased text classification datasets. Experiments were conducted on sentiment analysis datasets Yelp and SST-2. The study evaluates the robustness of state-of-the-art classifiers BERT, XLNET, and RoBERTa on biased text classification datasets Yelp and SST-2. CARA's encoder uses a 4-layer CNN and a two-layer LSTM decoder for 'positive' and 'negative' labels. Experiments are conducted with a trigger signature norm value of 2 on the base class. Results show that state-of-the-art classifiers BERT, XLNET, and RoBERTa assimilate bias from biased versions of Yelp and SST-2 datasets. Trigger rate is high (>90%) when models are trained on biased samples, but low (<8%) on unbiased datasets, indicating CARA's ability to preserve original labels after inscribing trigger signatures. The biased classifiers exhibit high accuracy in clean samples, indicating the subtle nature of learned bias in neural networks. Increasing the trigger signature magnitude results in a stronger bias effect in the model's classification. Higher bias trigger rates lead to easier feature detection by the classifier, even with a small percentage of biased training samples. In the study, different model architectures show similar bias learning patterns. XLNET-base and large classifiers outperform BERT and RoBERTa with low biased training samples. Large models perform better on clean samples but show no significant difference in bias susceptibility. The setup includes LSTM and CNN for premise and hypothesis encoding, with MLPs for generator, discriminator, and latent vector classifier. The study evaluates bias effects on state-of-the-art classifiers using biased NLI datasets. Biased training datasets are created with different target and base classes. Results show that after training, all three models tend to classify trigger-inscribed samples as the target class. The study evaluates bias effects on state-of-the-art classifiers using biased NLI datasets. After training, all three models tend to classify trigger-inscribed samples as the target class, with higher rates as the percentage of biased training samples or trigger signature norm increases. No distinguishable differences in learned bias are observed among model architectures or between base and large-size classifiers. The study evaluates bias effects on classifiers using biased NLI datasets. Biased models achieve high accuracy on original dev sets. Unbiased models show disrupted entailment relation when trigger class changes. A gap is filled by introducing an approach to address the lack of preservation.

State-of-the-art models trained on a small portion of biased samples are influenced to classify text as the bias target class, revealing inadequacies in addressing bias.
