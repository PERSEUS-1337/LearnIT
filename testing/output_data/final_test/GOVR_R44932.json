    "content": "Livestock grazing on federal lands is primarily managed by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and the Forest Service (FS). Both agencies charge fees for grazing on their lands, but they have different processes for administering livestock grazing. The National Park Service and the Fish and Wildlife Service have limited authorities for livestock grazing on their lands. This report focuses on BLM and FS lands. The report provides data on livestock grazing on BLM and FS lands from FY2002 to FY2016, addressing congressional concerns about fee levels, permit terms, and grazing amounts. Factors influencing grazing changes over the past 15 years are identified, without discussing their specific impact on national, regional, or local levels. The report covers livestock data categories reflecting grazing on federal land from FY2002 to FY2016. Data accuracy issues exist for two categories from FY2002-FY2005. Differences in grazing administration between FS and BLM include permit vs. permit and lease authorization. Grazing is measured in terms of livestock use and occupancy for one month. The BLM and FS have different processes for measuring grazing, with BLM using animal unit months (AUMs) and FS using head months (HD-MOs). Livestock operators on BLM land are called livestock operators, while on FS lands they are called permittees. The data categories presented do not cover all indicators of livestock grazing, such as annual acreage used for grazing. In recent years, BLM has had more land available and used for livestock grazing compared to FS. In FY2016, the BLM managed 248.3 million acres, with 62.3% available for grazing and 55.9% used for grazing. In comparison, the FS managed 192.9 million acres in FY2015, with 49.2% available for grazing and 40.1% used for grazing. Data for BLM shows the number of operators, grazing permits, AUMs in force, and AUMs authorized for use. Table 2, Figure 3, and Figure 4 provide data for FS grazing permits. The tables show increases in grazing used over the period examined, with BLM land showing similar or slightly less livestock grazing in FY2016 compared to FY2002. FS had larger declines in livestock grazing over the years examined. The number of operators authorized for livestock grazing on BLM land remained relatively constant between FY2002 and FY2016, with an average of 15,755 operators annually. The highest number of operators was 16,416 in FY2006, while the lowest was 15,462 in FY2005. The number of permits and leases held by livestock operators was 1.7% lower in FY2016 compared to FY2002, with the greatest number of permits and leases at 18,142 in FY2002. The number of permits and leases for BLM livestock operators fluctuated over the period FY2002 to FY2016, with a difference of 448 between the highest year (FY2002) and the lowest year (FY2011). The average number of permits and leases annually was 17,852. Permits and leases declined by 2.5% in the first 10 years but rose by 0.6% in the last five years. The number of AUMs in force for grazing on BLM lands gradually decreased, being 2.6% less in FY2016 compared to FY2002. The number of authorized AUMs for grazing on BLM lands varied over the 15-year period from FY2002 to FY2016. The highest level was 12.7 million in FY2005, with a difference of 337,475 from the low of 12.4 million in FY2016. The average AUMs in force annually was 12.5 million, with fluctuations between 12.3 million and 12.7 million in the earlier years. The number of authorized AUMs reached a peak of nearly 9.0 million in FY2011, with an average of 8.4 million each year. Authorized AUMs for grazing on FS lands fluctuated between 8.3 million and 9.0 million annually over 15 years. The number of livestock permit holders decreased by 12.4% from FY2006 to FY2016, with the highest number of permittees in FY2006 (6,598) and the lowest in FY2016 (5,779). The average number of permittees annually was 6,146. The number of active permits for FS livestock declined steadily from FY2006 to FY2016, with a 12.5% decrease in FY2016 compared to FY2006. The highest number of active permits was in FY2006 at 7,095, while the lowest was in FY2016 at 6,211. The average number of active permits annually was 6,601. The number of active permits for FS livestock declined steadily from FY2006 to FY2016, with a 12.5% decrease in FY2016 compared to FY2006. In FY2016, there were 6,211 active permits, down from 7,095 in FY2006. The average annual number of active permits was 6,601. In contrast, the number of HD-MOs under permit decreased by 18.4% from FY2002 to FY2016, with a high of 10.1 million in FY2002 and a low of 8.2 million in FY2006. The average annual number of HD-MOs under permit was 8.7 million, with significant annual variation. The number of HD-MOs actually authorized and billed for increased by 1.1% in FY2016 compared to FY2002. The number of HD-MOs ranged from 5.1 million to 7.3 million over 15 years, with an average of 6.5 million per year. Both BLM and FS had more grazing permits than livestock operators, with higher levels of authorized grazing than actually used due to various reasons. During the period of analysis, BLM had higher levels of livestock grazing than FS in all four data categories, with BLM managing more acres for livestock grazing. Grazing use increased for both agencies from FY2002 to FY2016, with a higher increase for BLM (5.2%) compared to FS (1.1%). Other data categories showed either no changes or small declines for BLM, while FS saw larger decreases. BLM had higher levels of livestock grazing than FS in all data categories during FY2002-FY2016. BLM's AUMs declined by 2.6%, while FS's HD-MOs decreased by 18.4%. BLM permits and leases decreased slightly, with a 1.7% overall decline, while FS active permits decreased by 12.5%. Over the past several decades, grazing on BLM lands declined significantly, while on FS lands, it varied depending on the start and end years chosen. Changes in grazing nationally reflect diverse conditions on rangelands, with no analysis done on specific states or regions. Factors influencing annual changes in grazing were not analyzed in this report. Factors influencing grazing nationally include amendments to agency land use plans, resource protection needs, forage depletion from drought or fire, significant rainfall, matching forage and livestock production, voluntary nonuse by ranchers, and development of nearby private land. Development of nearby private land can impact grazing on federal land by affecting the movement of livestock between different ownerships."
