The Act defines \"land\" as lands, waters, and interests therein, and \"public lands\" as land in Alaska owned by the United States, excluding certain selections made under different laws. The term \"Native Corporation\" refers to Regional Corporations, Village Corporations, Native groups, and Native entities incorporated under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act. The definitions of Regional Corporation, Village Corporation, and Native group are also provided under the Act. The term \"Selection Rights\" refers to the rights granted to Koniag under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act to receive title to oil and gas rights and other interests in public lands in Alaska.

The term \"property\" is defined in section 12(b)(7) of Public Law 94-9204. SEC. 3. DESIGNATION OF WILDERNESS. Designation of Wilderness: The public lands within the boundaries depicted as \"Proposed Wilderness\" on identified maps are designated as wilderness, part of the National Wilderness Preservation System. This includes Aniakchak Wilderness of approximately 503,000 acres and Alaska Peninsula Wilderness of approximately 1,876,000 acres. Approximately 347,000 acres in Becharof National Wildlife Refuge designated as wilderness addition. Map and legal description to be published after enactment of Act. The legal description and map of the wilderness area will be corrected for errors and made available for public inspection. Only public lands within the wilderness area boundaries will be included, except for lands with Koniag Selection Rights. Lands conveyed to the State, Native Corporations, or private parties are not subject to wilderness area regulations. Any lands subject to Koniag Selection Rights relinquished to the United States within designated wilderness areas will become part of the wilderness areas and be administered accordingly. SEC. 4. MANAGEMENT OF WILDERNESS AREAS. The Aniakchak Wilderness lands designated by this Act will be managed by the Secretary of the Interior in the same manner as other wilderness lands in Alaska. Existing special use or concession permits for operations on designated wilderness lands may be renewed or reissued to the same permittee. The Act allows for the renewal or reissuance of permits for operations on designated wilderness lands, with the condition that the Secretary may cancel or restrict a permit for reasons other than wilderness designation. Permits cannot be transferred, and structures authorized by a permit can continue to be used, maintained, and replaced as needed. Permits for operations on designated wilderness lands can be renewed or reissued, with structures authorized by a permit allowed to be used, maintained, and replaced as necessary. No additional structures or improvements are permitted on these lands. SEC. 5. ACQUISITION OF KONIAG SELECTION RIGHTS. The Secretary must accept Koniag's timely relinquishment of Selection Rights within 60 days and notify the Secretary of the Treasury. The value of Selection Rights is based on the fair market value of oil and gas interests. Within 90 days of enactment, Koniag and the Secretary will select a qualified appraiser to determine the fair market value of the oil and gas interests and the subsurface estate of the lands. If no agreement is reached, each party will designate an appraiser, and the two chosen appraisers will select a third to perform the appraisal. Within 180 days of selecting a third appraiser, a written appraisal report on the value of Selection Rights will be delivered to the Secretary and Koniag. Within 60 days of receiving the report, the Secretary will determine the value of the Selection Rights and notify Koniag. If there is disagreement, procedures from Public Law 94-579 will be used to establish the value, capped at $300 per acre. SEC. 6. Koniag Account. Establishment of Koniag Account on October 1, 1996 by the Secretary of the Treasury in consultation with the Secretary. The account allows Koniag to bid on and purchase property at public sale, with funds remaining available until expended.
