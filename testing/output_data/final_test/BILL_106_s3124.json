    "content": "The Act titled \"Prosecution Drug Treatment Alternative to Prison Act of 2000\" authorizes the implementation of drug treatment alternative to prison programs by state or local prosecutors under the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968. The Attorney General can grant funds to State or local prosecutors for drug treatment alternative to prison programs. The funds can be used for program operation expenses and payments to substance abuse treatment providers. The grant funds can be used for aftercare supervision, vocational training, education, and job placement. The Federal share of the grant should not exceed 75 percent of the program cost. Grant amounts should supplement non-Federal funds, not replace them. \"Program requirements for grant funds include aftercare supervision, vocational training, education, and job placement. The Federal share should not exceed 75 percent of the program cost.\" A drug treatment alternative to prison program funded by grants must comply with specific requirements: a State or local prosecutor must administer the program, eligible offenders need prosecutor consent to participate, offenders must undergo long-term drug-free residential treatment instead of incarceration, and failure to complete treatment results in imprisonment for the underlying crime. The residential substance abuse provider must report the offender's progress to the prosecutor and court, and notify them of any violations. The program includes an enforcement unit of law enforcement officers supervised by the prosecutor. The program includes duties for the prosecutor to verify offender's information, locate absconded individuals, and return them to court for sentencing. To apply for a grant under this part, a State or local prosecutor must submit an application to the Attorney General with required information. The Attorney General will ensure equitable distribution of grant awards to prosecutors in all states and jurisdictions. Additionally, prosecutors must provide certifications that their program meets the requirements. Each recipient of a grant under this part must submit a report to the Attorney General annually, evaluating the effectiveness of activities funded by the grant. The report must contain information specified by the Attorney General, and submission dates will be provided. \"In this part, an eligible offender is defined as an individual convicted of a crime requiring imprisonment, not charged with a violent felony or major drug offense, and in need of substance abuse treatment based on a professional screener's assessment.\" The curr_chunk discusses the definitions of terms related to criminal conduct, such as 'felony crime of violence' and 'major drug offense'. It also defines 'State or local prosecutor'. Additionally, it mentions an authorization of appropriations related to the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Street Act of 1968. The curr_chunk authorizes appropriations for fiscal years 2001 to 2005 to carry out part AA, with increasing amounts allocated each year."
