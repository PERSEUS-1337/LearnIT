    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Protect the Homeland from North Korean and Iranian Ballistic Missiles Act\". Congress finds that North Korea's development of the Taepo Dong 2 long-range missile poses a threat to the United States, as it could potentially target the entire continental US with a ballistic missile. Despite warnings from multiple countries, North Korea conducted tests of the missile in defiance of international resolutions. North Korea demonstrated the capability of long-range ballistic missiles reaching South Korea, Japan, and Guam. They deployed various missiles threatening Okinawa, Guam, Japan, and South Korea. North Korea threatened to conduct a nuclear test and intercontinental ballistic missile launch unless the UN Security Council apologized for imposing sanctions. North Korea violated UN resolution 1718 with a nuclear test in 2009. Despite international efforts, North Korea continues to develop missiles and nuclear technology. They have test-fired short-range missiles and threatened war against the US, South Korea, and Japan. North Korea leads in missile proliferation and shares technology with other nations. The United States has improved its ability to shoot down long-range missiles from North Korea, while Iran violated UN resolutions by launching a satellite into orbit. Iran's progress in missile technology is concerning, as stated by General Maples of the Defense Intelligence Agency. President Obama also addressed the issue of missile proliferation in 2009. On April 5, 2009, President Barack Obama highlighted the threat posed by Iran's nuclear and ballistic missile activities to the US, its neighbors, and allies. On May 19, 2009, Iran test-fired a new medium-range missile capable of reaching Europe, Israel, and US forces in the Persian Gulf. Congress acknowledges the improving long-range ballistic missile technology of North Korea and Iran, expressing concern about the potential threat to the US homeland. They realize the technology could be shared with other actors and support missile defense for allies and deployed forces without compromising US homeland protection. Deployment of missile defense interceptors in Alaska and California is addressed. The Secretary of Defense is required to deploy ground-based interceptors in Alaska and California, with a minimum of 40 in Fort Greely, Alaska, and 4 in Vandenberg Air Force Base, California. Additional interceptors may be deployed at other locations as determined by the President. $500,000,000 is authorized for the ground-based midcourse defense system in fiscal year 2010."
