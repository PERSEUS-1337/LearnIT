The Comptroller General will report on the ability of VA medical centers to meet the healthcare needs of women veterans.

The assessment of VA medical centers includes training on women's health issues, sensitivity training, differences in health outcomes between men and women, security measures, gender-specific equipment availability, collaboration with the Center for Women Veterans, implementation of directives, outreach to women veterans, and collaboration with non-VA entities. The collaboration between the medical center and non-Department entities, including veterans service organizations, to meet the health care needs of women veterans and the effectiveness of Patient Aligned Care Teams in meeting these needs will be examined in a report to be submitted by the Comptroller General to the Committees on Veterans' Affairs."
