    "content": "Approximately 50 different eligibility pathways exist for Medicaid, with primary criteria including categorical eligibility and income-related eligibility. States have flexibility in setting income thresholds and disregarding certain types of income for eligibility. Some individuals with long-term care needs can qualify with income up to 222% of the Federal Poverty Level, while others can qualify through \"spend down\" rules. States can also waive eligibility requirements using Section 1115 of the Social Security Act. Table 1 shows income eligibility levels for major categories of Medicaid enrollees, excluding those needing long-term care or qualifying through spend down. Certain groups like parents, childless adults, the aged, disabled, and certain non-citizens could be affected by Medicaid expansion up to 100% of poverty in all states. Parents are currently eligible under Section 1931 of the Social Security Act. Parents are eligible for Medicaid under Section 1931 of the Social Security Act, with states having flexibility to expand coverage up to 100% of poverty through regular Medicaid State Plan Amendments or federal Section 1115 waivers. Currently, 23 states use federal funds to cover parents at or above 100% of poverty. Currently, 14 states use federal Section 1115 waivers to cover childless adults up to 100% of poverty with a comprehensive benefit package. States must cover aged and disabled individuals receiving SSI in their Medicaid programs. SSI income eligibility thresholds range from 75% to 174% of poverty in the lower 48 states. Some states provide state supplemental payments to SSI recipients, and allow individuals who meet SSI's asset test to qualify for Medicaid. Some aged and disabled individuals who have higher income levels due to work may not qualify for Medicaid despite meeting SSI's disability criteria. 16 states and the District of Columbia have expanded Medicaid eligibility up to 100% of poverty for the aged and disabled. There are three subpopulations of aged and disabled individuals who could be newly eligible for Medicaid based on income up to 100% of poverty. Some aged and disabled individuals may not qualify for Medicaid despite meeting SSI's disability criteria. Non-citizens are categorized into different groups for eligibility for federal programs, including unauthorized aliens, legal permanent residents (LPRs) under five years, and LPRs over five years. Unauthorized aliens are prohibited from full-benefit Medicaid enrollment regardless of income. Non-citizens, including legal permanent residents (LPRs), face limitations in Medicaid eligibility based on their length of stay in the country. While some states offer coverage for emergency medical conditions, additional amendments to federal statute would be needed to change the treatment of non-citizens. The proposal aims to expand Medicaid coverage to a new mandatory group up to 100% of poverty without requiring waivers or block of income disregards. It raises questions about the intention behind the proposal, particularly for aged and disabled individuals in poverty who are not eligible for Medicaid but enrolled in Medicare. Expanding full-benefit Medicaid to these Medicare enrollees would not reduce the number of uninsured but would incur additional costs. The proposal to expand Medicaid coverage to a new group could entail additional costs to both federal and state governments. It may include benefits like home care, transportation, vision, and dental care for Medicare beneficiaries. Concerns include the potential for \"crowd-out\" where individuals with private insurance switch to public coverage. This issue was also raised when CHIP was enacted in 1997. The proposal to expand Medicaid coverage to a new group may lead to additional costs for federal and state governments. Concerns about \"crowd-out\" were raised when CHIP was enacted in 1997, which could occur if individuals with private insurance switch to public coverage. States can impose waiting periods and cost-sharing to prevent crowd-out in Medicaid and CHIP. Medicaid-covered populations receive federal funds at the Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP), ranging from 50% to 76%. Expanding Medicaid coverage to a new poverty-related group may increase federal and state spending, straining budgets. States may need to cut costs by reducing provider payment rates, enrollment, or benefits. Questions arise about whether the federal government will cover all costs at 100% FMAP, a higher percentage, or just the regular FMAP, and if this coverage will be temporary or permanent. The federal government may pay a larger percentage than the regular FMAP for Medicaid expansion. Questions include whether this increase will be temporary or permanent, who it will cover (newly eligible, newly enrolled, or already enrolled), if funding will be capped or open-ended, and if there will be a maintenance of effort requirement for states. Adding a new mandatory eligibility group to Medicaid may overlap with current groups, creating administrative burdens for states and applicants. Congress could require a single federal standard for income counting to promote consistency, but this may increase administrative burdens while providing greater uniformity in eligibility across states. The new Medicaid eligibility group may raise questions about income counting rules and \"spend down\" options, potentially allowing states to adjust income thresholds. States' flexibility in resource/asset tests could also impact eligibility criteria for the new group. The new Medicaid eligibility group may have different resource tests, potentially impacting eligibility criteria. Medicaid expansion to 100% of poverty level aims to provide a health insurance safety net, but access to care may still be a challenge due to provider payment and supply issues in state Medicaid programs. Provider payments and supply in state Medicaid programs, along with eligibility requirements for potential beneficiaries, are key issues to consider. States define the benefits available for different eligibility groups, raising questions about access to all Medicaid benefits for new enrollees. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 provided states with flexibility in cost-sharing for Medicaid, but this flexibility is not available for those with family income below 100% of the poverty line. Federal financing under Section 1115 waivers is capped to be budget neutral over the life of the waiver. The Medicaid statute under Section 1115 waivers is capped for budget neutrality, potentially reducing benefits and capping enrollment. The new mandatory group could impact existing waivers, raising questions about budget neutrality specifications and flexibility for states already covering the group. Some eligibility groups in the Medicaid statute are no longer relevant, like \"qualified children,\" as there are more expansive eligibility pathways available. Expanding coverage to 100% of poverty regardless of category could create additional groups. Adding a new mandatory population to Title XIX Medicaid could streamline income counting methodologies for states, potentially replacing obsolete eligibility groups and rules. This could simplify enrollment processes for individuals with lower income levels. The former method of enrolling higher income applicants through the 100% of FPL group could reduce states' administrative burden. The latter option of standardizing eligibility rules nationwide could improve equity and consistency, but may cause issues if the income-counting methodology differs from what states currently use. Under a new methodology, individuals previously covered as \"poverty-related children\" at 95% of poverty may now be considered at 105% of poverty. This change could result in some losing eligibility if existing categories are dropped. Legislation may require states to ensure no current enrollees lose coverage or are deemed ineligible due to the new rules. Additionally, if the legislation calls for assessments based on previous income-counting methods, it could pose challenges. This may also apply if additional federal funds are allocated for newly eligible individuals below the poverty line. According to analyses by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), there were 39.6 million adults without health insurance in 2005, of whom approximately 16% (6.1 million) were eligible for Medicaid, CHIP, or a solely state-financed program. If Medicaid eligibility had been expanded to cover nonaged adults up to 100% of poverty, then another 8.3 million uninsured adults would have been eligible in 2005. Medicaid coverage is not provided for certain subgroups under 100% of poverty, including parents, childless adults, aged and disabled individuals, and certain non-citizens. In 2005, approximately 25.1 million uninsured adults would still have been ineligible for Medicaid even if eligibility had been expanded to cover nonaged adults up to 100% of poverty. The federal government's considerations for covering costs of new Medicaid enrollees include eligibility criteria, percentage of costs covered, and whether the funding increase is temporary or permanent. The federal government is considering various factors for covering costs of new Medicaid enrollees, such as funding caps, phased implementation, maintenance of effort requirements, income counting standards, flexibility in income disregards, medical expense deductions, assets tests, and additional eligibility criteria. The federal government is evaluating factors for covering costs of new Medicaid enrollees, including funding caps, phased implementation, maintenance of effort requirements, income counting standards, flexibility in income disregards, medical expense deductions, determinations on assets tests, provider payments, and access to care. Discussions also involve standard Medicaid benefits, state flexibility, cost-sharing, and Section 1115 waivers for budget neutrality and current flexibility for states covering the group."
