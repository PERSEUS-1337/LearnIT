    "content": "The foreign-born population in the US has grown rapidly since the 1980s, with an estimated 28% residing without legal authorization in 2009. The number of unauthorized aliens tripled from 1986 to 2006. States sued the federal government over the costs of providing benefits to unauthorized aliens, but these lawsuits failed. Many jurisdictions have implemented measures to deter unauthorized aliens and reduce associated costs. States have inherent \"police powers\" to regulate safety, health, welfare, and economic activity within their jurisdictions. These powers can be limited by individual rights under the Constitution and federal authority. Federal legislation in the 1970s increasingly regulated the daily lives of noncitizens, impacting state regulations. This included rules on noncitizen access to public benefits and sanctions against employers hiring unauthorized workers. The federal government's push for comprehensive regulation of aliens in the United States in 1996 included increased authority for states to mirror federal benefit restrictions and cooperate with immigration enforcement. Laws like Arizona's S.B. 1070 tested the legal limits of greater state involvement, with some jurisdictions, known as \"sanctuary cities,\" unwilling to assist the federal government in enforcing measures distinguishing between legal and non-legal residents. Some states and localities have varying levels of cooperation with federal immigration enforcement efforts. Arizona, for example, actively seeks to deter the presence of unauthorized aliens within its territory and has assisted federal authorities in apprehending and detaining them. Other jurisdictions have limited communication with federal immigration officers but do not take a more active role in deterring illegal immigration. Some states and localities have considered or enacted measures to address unauthorized immigration. Some states and localities have enacted measures to deter unauthorized aliens, including limiting access to housing, employment, or services. The Supreme Court ruled in Chamber of Commerce v. Whiting that states can require employers to use E-Verify and penalize those who hire unauthorized aliens. This ruling may influence other states to adopt similar measures. S.B. 1070 aims to discourage unlawful entry and economic activity by unauthorized aliens. S.B. 1070 aims to deter unlawful entry and economic activity by unauthorized aliens through attrition through enforcement, which involves more vigorous implementation of immigration laws and better cooperation between states and federal authorities. S.B. 1070 aims to bolster direct enforcement of federal immigration law by state and local law enforcement, criminalizing conduct that may facilitate the presence of unauthorized aliens in Arizona. Sections 2 and 6 focus on identifying and apprehending unlawfully present aliens, while Sections 3-5 target behaviors that enable unauthorized aliens to remain in the state. S.B. 1070 mandates law enforcement officials to determine the immigration status of individuals they arrest and notify ICE or CBP when an unlawfully present alien is released from prison. Race, color, and national origin cannot be considered except as permitted by the U.S. or Arizona Constitution. S.B. 1070 authorizes state and local law enforcement officials to transport unlawfully present aliens to federal facilities and prohibits restrictions on sharing information related to immigration status. It allows legal residents of Arizona to challenge policies limiting enforcement of federal immigration laws and criminalizes certain activities violating federal immigration laws. H.B. 2162 modified penalties for alien registration violations under S.B. 1070, making them misdemeanors instead of felonies in certain cases. Sections 4 and 5 of S.B. 1070 address transport and harboring of unlawfully present aliens, with Section 5 adding a new criminal statute for alien smuggling-related activities. Section 5 of S.B. 1070 imposes criminal penalties for transporting or harboring unlawfully present aliens in Arizona. It also prohibits unlawfully present aliens from applying for work in the state. Vehicles used in smuggling offenses can be immobilized or impounded. Section 5 of S.B. 1070 prohibits picking up passengers for work on a roadway if it obstructs traffic. Officers can arrest without a warrant for public offenses that make a person removable from the United States. The main issue in litigation is whether the provisions of S.B. 1070 are constitutional. The key issue in litigation challenging S.B. 1070 is whether its major provisions are preempted by federal law, which prohibits states from conflicting with or complementing federal law. Preemption can occur through express intent in a statute or by Congress occupying the regulatory field implicitly. The delineation between field and conflict preemption is not rigid. The power to set rules for which aliens may enter and remain in the United States is federal, precluding substantive state regulation. The Supreme Court has not held that every state enactment dealing with aliens is per se pre-empted. In De Canas v. Bica (1976), the Court held that state regulation within their jurisdictions is not always pre-empted. In De Canas v. Bica, the Court ruled that state regulation within their jurisdictions may not always be pre-empted by federal immigration law. The Court stated that state actions must not conflict with federal law and should not completely oust state power unless Congress clearly intended to do so. Additionally, state measures may be unenforceable if they obstruct the full purposes and objectives of Congress in enacting the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). States have the authority to enforce provisions of the INA, including making arrests for violations of federal immigration law. While states can arrest for criminal violations, the enforcement of civil provisions like apprehension and removal of deportable aliens is primarily a federal responsibility. States and localities are limited to a supporting role unless specifically authorized by federal law. In the 1980s and 1990s, some jurisdictions criticized federal enforcement of immigration law as inadequate. To address this, the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 allowed for cooperative agreements between the federal government and states for state and local law enforcement officers to assist in certain immigration functions under federal supervision. The enacted version of the measure allowed for state and local law enforcement officers to assist in immigration functions under federal supervision. In 2002, the Office of Legal Counsel concluded that states could arrest aliens based on civil deportability. The Office of Legal Counsel concluded in 2002 that states could arrest aliens for civil deportability. Recent cases have debated state authority in civil immigration enforcement, with the Ninth Circuit rejecting the idea of implicit state authority in S.B. 1070 litigation. Section 2 of S.B. 1070 requires state and local law enforcement to help detect unauthorized aliens. The DOJ challenged Arizona's requirement for state and local law enforcement to assist in detecting unauthorized aliens. The district court preliminarily enjoined the implementation, finding it likely preempted by federal law. The Ninth Circuit panel affirmed the ruling. Other aspects of S.B. 1070 were not challenged or enjoined, including sharing immigration-related information and allowing Arizona residents to challenge policies limiting federal immigration law enforcement. Federal law allows for some cooperation between state and federal agencies in immigration enforcement. In 1996, Congress passed measures to deter states from limiting information-sharing with the federal government on immigration. States and localities are not allowed to restrict their agencies from maintaining records on immigration status or exchanging information with federal, state, or local entities. Federal immigration authorities are obligated to respond to immigration-related inquiries from states and localities under IIRIRA Section 642. S.B. 1070 provisions align with IIRIRA Section 642(c) requiring federal response to immigration inquiries from states and localities. It prohibits restrictions on sharing immigration status information among government agencies. S.B. 1070 bars restrictions on state and local officers sharing immigration information for determining eligibility for public services or benefits, verifying domicile, or ensuring compliance with federal alien registration laws. These provisions align with federal laws on sharing immigration-related information among government entities. Section 2 of S.B. 1070 raises significant preemption issues regarding state and local law enforcement actively participating in detecting unauthorized aliens. Prior to modification by H.B. 2162, it appeared to authorize intensive involvement in immigration law enforcement beyond established precedents. Specifically, Section 2(B) required officers to determine the immigration status of individuals with reasonable suspicion of being unlawfully present aliens. Prior to modification by H.B. 2162, S.B. 1070 allowed police to inquire about immigration status in certain circumstances. H.B. 2162 limited these inquiries to situations where a lawful stop, detention, or arrest for a violation of state or local law was made. S.B. 1070, as modified, requires verification of immigration status for persons arrested by state or local law enforcement and notification to federal authorities. Local law enforcement may transport unauthorized aliens to federal facilities, aligning with cooperative agreements between DHS and state/local authorities authorized by Congress in 1996. The DHS has 287(g) agreements with jurisdictions allowing state or local officers to perform specific immigration enforcement functions under federal supervision. This includes questioning detainees about their immigration status and transferring removable aliens to federal custody. Officers under these agreements are not considered federal employees. Section 2(B) of S.B. 1070 in Arizona is not based on a delegation of federal immigration enforcement authority under INA Section 287(g). It asserts that states have the inherent power to enforce federal laws, including immigration laws, without being preempted by federal law. The legality of Arizona officials enforcing immigration laws without a 287(g) agreement may raise preemption arguments. INA Section 287(g)(10) allows state and local entities to cooperate in immigration enforcement without a written agreement. Litigation may question if this cooperation requires coordination with federal authorities. The DOJ challenged Arizona's provision requiring state law enforcement to investigate the immigration status of stopped persons suspected of being unlawfully present aliens, arguing it was preempted due to its mandatory nature and potential diversion of resources from federal enforcement priorities. The DOJ challenged Arizona's provision requiring state law enforcement to investigate the immigration status of stopped persons suspected of being unlawfully present aliens, arguing it was preempted due to its mandatory nature and potential diversion of resources from federal enforcement priorities. The DOJ also claimed that Section 2(B) of S.B. 1070 would impose impermissible burdens on lawfully present aliens and U.S. citizens stopped by Arizona law enforcement, conflicting with the federal immigration enforcement scheme. The Ninth Circuit panel majority found that INA Section 287(g) indicates congressional intent for state involvement in immigration enforcement to generally occur under federal supervision. They also determined that state and local \"cooperation\" in immigration enforcement should only be on an incidental and as-needed basis. The Ninth Circuit panel majority rejected Arizona's argument for state and local law enforcement assistance in immigration enforcement, stating that such assistance must adhere to the boundaries set by INA Section 287(g). They also found that Section 2(B) of Arizona's law was likely preempted due to its verification requirements. The Ninth Circuit panel found that Arizona's Section 2(B) verification requirements were likely preempted as they would interfere with Congress' delegation of discretion to the Executive branch in enforcing the INA, citing Supreme Court decisions in Crosby v. National Foreign Trade Council and Buckman Co. v. Plaintiffs' Legal Committee. The Ninth Circuit panel majority found that Arizona's Section 2(B) verification requirements would interfere with the flexibility of the federal statutory and regulatory framework. They stated that the President has similar flexibility in immigration enforcement and that Section 2(B) was an attempt to take over a role delegated to the Executive by Congress. The panel majority believed the government would likely succeed in its preemption challenge to Section 2(B) due to its negative impact on foreign relations and the potential for multiple states to create their own immigration enforcement rules. They emphasized the Supreme Court's stance on state legislation conflicting with federal laws. The Ninth Circuit panel majority found that Arizona's S.B. 1070 would have a significant impact on foreign relations, leading to preemption of the state law. Foreign leaders and organizations criticized the law, and Mexico protested it, affecting a U.S.-Mexico agreement. Judge John T. Noonan also highlighted the inconsistency of S.B. 1070 with federal foreign policy. The Ninth Circuit panel majority ruled that Arizona's S.B. 1070, including Section 2(B), conflicted with federal foreign policy. Judge Carlos T. Bea disagreed, arguing that Congress intended for state officials to assist in immigration enforcement. The dissent in the Ninth Circuit panel argued that Arizona's S.B. 1070, specifically Section 2(B), did not encroach on federal flexibility or conflict with established foreign relations goals. They disagreed with the majority's conclusion that state measures like Section 2(B) disrupted the immigration enforcement scheme established by Congress. The Ninth Circuit's analysis of Arizona's S.B. 1070, particularly Section 2(B), did not fully address all issues raised by the district court. The appellate court did not directly address the lower court's concern that Section 2(B) could burden lawfully present aliens, citing the Supreme Court's precedent in Hines v. Davidowitz. The district court found that Arizona's law could burden lawfully present aliens, similar to a previous case. The Ninth Circuit focused on the mandatory nature of the immigration verification requirement in Section 2(B), potentially leading to a successful challenge by the government. This ruling may not prevent Arizona law enforcement from enforcing the law. The courts' rulings may not prevent Arizona law enforcement from verifying immigration status on a case-by-case basis. The DOJ does not view discretionary verification as problematic as Arizona's mandatory requirements. The analysis of burdens imposed by Section 2(B) may depend on federal enforcement priorities and resource allocation. The provision of S.B. 1070 allows any legal resident of Arizona to challenge state or local government policies that limit federal immigration law enforcement. This authority aims to ensure compliance with federal immigration statutes and prevent interference with federal enforcement activities. It could be interpreted broadly to challenge Arizona officials' enforcement of federal immigration law to the fullest extent. The DOJ challenged certain provisions of S.B. 1070, with the district court preliminarily enjoining the enforcement of Section 6. This provision allows Arizona law enforcement to make warrantless arrests of aliens with probable cause. The court did not enjoin another provision that could encourage more rigorous enforcement of federal immigration law by Arizona officials. Arizona law allows law enforcement to arrest aliens without a warrant if there is probable cause that they have committed public offenses making them removable under the INA. The interpretation and application of this provision could raise preemption issues, especially if it allows the arrest of aliens who have already completed their criminal sentences. Arizona law allows law enforcement to arrest aliens without a warrant based on probable cause of removability. The Ninth Circuit panel found that this provision likely interferes with federal immigration enforcement laws, which authorize more limited circumstances for state and local police to make such arrests. The Ninth Circuit panel found that Arizona law allowing law enforcement to arrest aliens without a warrant for civil deportation violations goes beyond what federal law permits under the AEDPA. This provision grants state and local police broader authority to make warrantless arrests for civil deportation violations, including misdemeanors that make an alien removable, which is inconsistent with congressional intent. The Ninth Circuit panel found that Arizona law granting state and local police broader authority to make warrantless arrests for civil deportation violations goes beyond what federal law permits. The panel majority held that states do not have inherent authority to enforce civil removability provisions of the INA without express federal authorization. They also rejected the reasoning of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit in support of their decision. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit supports state and local authorities enforcing civil and criminal provisions of the INA. The majority concluded that state and local officers generally cannot arrest individuals for civil immigration violations without federal authorization. They interpreted federal immigration laws to show that state officers lack inherent authority to enforce civil provisions of the INA without federal supervision. The majority in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit concluded that Arizona does not have inherent authority to enforce civil provisions of federal immigration law without federal authorization. They argued that Arizona must be federally-authorized to conduct such enforcement, as Congress has created a comprehensive scheme for adjudicating and enforcing civil removability. S.B. 1070 Section 6 was deemed to exceed the scope of federal authorization for Arizona's officers to enforce civil provisions of federal immigration law, interfering with the federal government's prerogative in making removability determinations. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit found that Arizona's Section 6 of S.B. 1070 interfered with federal immigration enforcement priorities and could lead to conflicting state immigration laws. Judge Bea dissented, arguing that states can enforce federal immigration laws and criticizing the majority's preemption ruling. The Ninth Circuit panel upheld the lower court's preliminary injunction against Section 6 of S.B. 1070, focusing on whether state and local officers can enforce civil provisions of the INA without federal authorization. The dissent argued that state police can assist in enforcing both civil and criminal provisions of the INA, even without a 287(g) agreement. The district court upheld the preliminary injunction against Section 6 of S.B. 1070, stating that state and local officers face complexity in determining if a public offense makes an alien removable from the US. It requires officers to determine if the conduct would be a crime in Arizona and if it constitutes a deportable offense under federal immigration law, which is under federal authority. The court noted that Section 6 does not mandate contacting DHS for immigration status verification. The court ruled that Arizona authorities are not responsible for determining if an offense makes an alien deportable, as this falls under the jurisdiction of administrative immigration judges and federal appellate courts. Preemption issues may arise when states criminalize immigration-related conduct, with more serious concerns when states regulate matters already covered by federal immigration law. The most serious preemption arguments occur when state laws attempt to regulate issues closely related to the entry and removal of aliens from the US. State laws addressing matters related to the entry and removal of aliens from the US are susceptible to preemption challenges, as federal law occupies this field. Provisions of S.B. 1070 criminalizing immigration-related conduct have faced legal challenges, with some sections being temporarily blocked by the district court. The Ninth Circuit also upheld the injunction on Arizona's provisions regarding alien registration and unauthorized alien employment. Section 5 of S.B. 1070 makes it a misdemeanor for occupants of a stopped vehicle to hire or pick up passengers for work. Section 5 of S.B. 1070 criminalizes the act of stopping a vehicle to hire or pick up passengers for work, penalizing those who impede traffic flow. This provision has faced legal challenges but has not been blocked from taking effect. The regulation of hiring along busy roadways is within a state's traditional powers, with no clear federal law on the matter. While there may be preemption issues in its application, the provision does not pose a serious preemption problem on its face. Local laws prohibiting solicitation of employment on public streets have been challenged for violating the First Amendment. The regulation of hiring on public streets has been challenged for violating the First Amendment, with courts considering streets as important public forums with restrictions on speech. S.B. 1070's provision on blocking traffic may make it less vulnerable to First Amendment attack, but the state may need to show alternative places for soliciting employment. The federal government did not raise this argument in its challenge to S.B. 1070. The Ninth Circuit found that an ordinance regulating speech was not narrowly tailored, as it restricted more speech than necessary to improve traffic flow. INA Section 274 criminalizes activities related to unauthorized aliens in the US. Arizona's S.B. 1070 imposes criminal penalties for alien smuggling activities, which have been challenged but proven unsuccessful. Prior to this law, Arizona already had criminal penalties for similar activities related to unauthorized aliens. Section 5 of S.B. 1070 adds a criminal offense under state law for transporting or harboring unauthorized aliens, with unclear language regarding the violation of a criminal offense. This provision overlaps with existing federal laws on alien smuggling. Arizona has established criminal penalties for human smuggling under state law, which overlaps with federal laws on alien smuggling. Arguments have been raised about preemption of Arizona's laws by federal immigration statutes. The federal alien smuggling statute allows states to make arrests for violations. Challenges against Arizona's smuggling laws have been based on preemption arguments and conflicts with federal immigration law. Arizona's criminalization of smuggling activities within its jurisdiction has been upheld. Arizona's alien smuggling laws, upheld under S.B. 1070 and the \"human smuggling\" statute, may not be preempted by federal law due to the state's traditional police powers. Despite federal regulation in this area, Arizona's measures could still be deemed valid. Despite federal regulation in this area, Arizona's alien smuggling laws, upheld under S.B. 1070 and the \"human smuggling\" statute, may not be preempted by federal law due to the state's traditional police powers. State and federal courts have rejected field preemption arguments against the statute's enforcement, with the district court denying the federal government's request to enjoin S.B. 1070's anti-smuggling provisions. The court ruled that the new smuggling offense established by S.B. 1070 does not attempt to regulate immigration or who should be admitted into the United States. The Court concludes that Arizona's alien smuggling laws, including those upheld under S.B. 1070 and the \"human smuggling\" statute, are not likely to be preempted by federal law. The federal government did not appeal the district court's decision on this matter. The district court declined to consider claims raised by six Mexican nationals charged with conspiracy to violate Arizona statute, finding that the statute was not unenforceable on field preemption grounds as it did not conflict with federal immigration law. The court rejected the plaintiffs' argument that the statute duplicated federal law, stating that Congress did not intend to preclude state regulation on smuggling of illegal aliens. The Ninth Circuit affirmed the district court's ruling on the Arizona statute regarding smuggling of illegal aliens, stating that Arizona has an important interest in enforcing its criminal statutes. The court also mentioned that the Mexican nationals had an adequate opportunity to litigate their constitutional claims in state court proceedings. Arizona's criminalization of alien smuggling may still face preemption challenges on other grounds not yet addressed by federal courts. Arizona's criminalization of alien smuggling may face preemption challenges on grounds not yet addressed by federal courts. State laws duplicative of federal law could be challenged if they obstruct Congress's objectives. Tension may arise if the federal government declines to prosecute alien smuggling cases that Arizona pursues. Arizona's criminalization of alien smuggling may face preemption challenges on grounds not yet addressed by federal courts. State laws duplicative of federal law could be challenged if they obstruct Congress's objectives. Tension may arise if the federal government declines to prosecute alien smuggling cases that Arizona pursues. The potential consequences of a state conviction for an alien involved in smuggling include deportation and ineligibility for relief from deportation, such as asylum or temporary protected status. This could be significant if Arizona chooses to prosecute unlawfully present aliens under the statute for conspiring to smuggle themselves into the United States. The punishment for alien smuggling activities aligns with federal goals to deter such behavior. However, it is unclear if other courts would agree, as the extent to which states can impose additional criminal penalties on activities already regulated by federal law is unresolved. Section 3 of S.B. 1070 in Arizona establishes criminal penalties for violations of federal requirements on alien registration. The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) prohibits issuing visas to aliens until they register with immigration authorities, with enforcement through INA Section 266(a). Failure to comply with registration requirements for aliens in the United States can result in misdemeanor offenses, imprisonment for up to six months, and/or fines. Registered aliens over 18 must carry their registration documents, with failure to do so leading to misdemeanor charges, imprisonment for up to 30 days, and/or fines. Unlawful presence in the country is not a crime under federal or Arizona law, but it can lead to deportation. Arizona's S.B. 1070 criminalizes violations of alien registration laws, with penalties ranging from misdemeanors to felonies. H.B. 2162 later amended the provision to make all offenses misdemeanors with penalties lesser than federal law. Arizona's criminalization of violations of federal alien registration requirements was challenged on preemption grounds by the DOJ. The Ninth Circuit panel affirmed the district court's decision to preliminarily enjoin its enforcement, citing the comprehensive federal scheme and lack of state participation in the INA. The court rejected Arizona's argument that certain provisions of federal law invited states to reinforce federal alien laws. The Ninth Circuit court found that Arizona's alien registration provisions are likely preempted by federal law, citing the Supreme Court's ruling in Hines v. Davidowitz. The court concluded that Congress intended to preempt states from imposing their own alien registration requirements. The Supreme Court concluded that Congress intended to establish a comprehensive federal system for alien registration, preempting state laws that conflict with federal regulations. The Ninth Circuit panel also found Arizona's penalties for federal alien registration violations preempted, as the Immigration and Nationality Act already provides a complete regulatory framework. Additionally, S.B. 1070's alien registration requirements were deemed likely preempted due to the potential for conflicting state immigration laws. The panel members believed that state laws punishing alien registration violations may be preempted due to their detrimental effect on foreign affairs. States may still enforce federal alien registration requirements by arresting offenders and transferring them to federal custody, as long as constitutional and state law requirements are met. The authority of states to detain or arrest individuals for suspected criminal violations of federal alien registration requirements is not definitively resolved. There may be limitations on states' ability to make such arrests, as indicated by a court's preliminary injunction of Arizona's alien registration requirement. The circuit panel suggested that states may not be intended to participate in enforcing federal immigration rules, raising uncertainty about state and local police arresting individuals for federal alien registration violations. Prior to the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, federal immigration law did not comprehensively address employment of unlawfully present aliens. States had broad authority to regulate employment relationships within their territory. In De Canas v. Bica, the Supreme Court recognized states' freedom to restrict employment of unauthorized aliens if focused on local problems. The Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 amended the Immigration and Nationality Act to combat the employment of unauthorized aliens. It prohibits hiring, referring, recruiting, or continuing employment of unauthorized aliens in the US. Violators may face penalties, including civil monetary fines and criminal sanctions. Congress preempted any state or local measures imposing sanctions on employers of unauthorized aliens. In recent years, some states and localities have tried to enforce laws against hiring unauthorized aliens by denying or revoking business licenses. Arizona passed the Legal Arizona Workers Act in 2007, allowing state courts to penalize entities that knowingly hired unauthorized aliens. This law also required employers to verify workers' eligibility through the E-Verify program. In May 2011, the Supreme Court upheld the Arizona Workers Act, allowing employers to verify workers' eligibility through the E-Verify program. S.B. 1070 directly sanctions unauthorized alien employees, making it a misdemeanor offense for them to apply for work without authorization. Arizona's S.B. 1070 imposes criminal penalties on unauthorized aliens seeking employment in the state, which differs from the approach established under the INA. While the INA primarily sanctions employers for hiring unauthorized aliens, Arizona's law targets the employees themselves. This raises potential preemption concerns, as the INA expressly preempts states from imposing penalties on employers of unauthorized aliens. The INA primarily sanctions employers for hiring unauthorized aliens, while Arizona's S.B. 1070 imposes criminal penalties on unauthorized aliens seeking employment in the state. This raises preemption concerns as the INA does not expressly preempt state sanctions against unauthorized alien employees. Congress focused on deterring illegal immigration by making jobs less available to illegal aliens, rather than imposing criminal sanctions on unauthorized aliens who succeed in obtaining work. The federal regime amended in 1990 to establish civil penalties for immigration-related document fraud, including presenting fraudulent documents for work eligibility. The DOJ challenged Arizona's S.B. 1070 provision imposing criminal penalties on unlawfully present aliens seeking employment, leading to a preliminary injunction. The Ninth Circuit affirmed, finding conflict with federal law. The court unanimously affirmed that certain provisions of IRCA conflict with Congress' intent to discourage employment of unauthorized immigrants. It found that penalizing unauthorized workers goes against Congress's intent not to criminalize work. The court also concluded that Congress intended to prohibit states from criminalizing work based on its actions and inactions. The Ninth Circuit court rejected Arizona's argument that penalizing unauthorized workers furthers Congress's policy of prohibiting illegal aliens from seeking employment in the United States. By criminalizing work, S.B. 1070 Section 5(C) constitutes a substantial departure from Congress's approach to this issue, and Arizona's assertion that this provision furthers a strong federal policy does not support its argument against preemption. Sharing a goal with the United States does not allow Arizona to deviate from Congress's chosen approach. The Ninth Circuit court rejected Arizona's argument that penalizing unauthorized workers furthers Congress's policy of prohibiting illegal aliens from seeking employment in the United States. Arizona's criminalization of work by unlawfully present aliens was likely preempted due to its detrimental effect on foreign affairs and the potential for conflicting state immigration laws. In Terry v. Ohio, the Supreme Court ruled that law enforcement can detain a person based on reasonable suspicion of committing a crime. The Arizona statute requires law enforcement to determine a person's immigration status if there is reasonable suspicion that the person is unlawfully present in the United States. Concerns have been raised about potential harassment of certain racial and ethnic groups. Arizona's H.B. 2162 prohibits law enforcement from considering an individual's race, color, or national origin when determining reasonable suspicion of unlawful presence, except as permitted by the Constitution. Governor Jan Brewer issued an executive order for training law enforcement on implementing S.B. 1070 to address concerns of racial profiling. The training provided to law enforcement officials in Arizona aims to give clear guidance on reasonable suspicion without considering race, color, or national origin alone. Courts have ruled that these factors cannot be the sole reason for stopping individuals for suspected immigration violations, especially near the U.S.-Mexican border. In 2000, the Ninth Circuit ruled that Border Patrol cannot consider Hispanic origin in stops in Southern California due to the high Hispanic population. This ruling may prevent Arizona law enforcement from using Hispanic origin as a factor in the \"reasonable suspicion\" test in similar demographic areas. Court jurisprudence indicates that Arizona law enforcement cannot stop individuals based solely on race or ethnicity for suspected immigration violations, but in certain circumstances, these factors may play a partial role. Population demographics can also influence the weight given to suspicions based on race or ethnicity. Congress has shifted focus to daily incidents of alien residency in recent decades, allowing states like Arizona to enforce immigration laws. S.B. 1070 tests the legal boundaries of these opportunities, with H.B. 2162 modifying some of its ambitious efforts. The legal fate of provisions in S.B. 1070, including those not barred by a preliminary injunction, is yet to be determined. Other states and localities impacted by unauthorized immigration may follow Arizona's lead in establishing new immigration enforcement grounds. The potential for varied enforcement approaches will be a key consideration in legal challenges to S.B. 1070."
