    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Claims Licensing Advancement for Interstate Matters Act\" or the \"CLAIM Act\". It includes a model licensing act. The Congress urges the National Association of Insurance Commissioners to adopt a model independent claims adjuster licensing Act with standards for adjuster qualifications and experience, without imposing limitations based on residency. The Congress urges the NAIC to establish a multi-State examination for independent claims adjusters adjusting claims outside their home State. Examinees must be licensed, meet integrity requirements, and demonstrate cross-jurisdictional competency. The NAIC requires independent claims adjusters to demonstrate competence with cross-jurisdictional legal and regulatory concepts, including ethics testing. State authorities under this Act do not require states without licensing requirements for independent claims adjusters to adopt such requirements. States can establish licensing fees and enforce laws on insurance claims adjusting, as long as fees are uniform regardless of the licensee's state of residence. The Act does not impact a state insurance regulator's jurisdiction to regulate independent claims adjuster activity. Interstate claims adjusting licensing reforms are also addressed. Before the expiration of a 4-year period from the enactment of the Act, a State must have laws and regulations in place for independent claims adjusters that are equivalent to model acts and provide reciprocity with other States to be in compliance. A State must establish uniform criteria for licensing independent claims adjusters to comply with reciprocity requirements with other States. This includes enacting laws that allow adjusters licensed in their home State to operate in other States without additional licensure. To operate as an adjuster in a different State as a non-resident, one must be licensed in good standing in their home State and pay any required fees to the new State. The home State must have laws equivalent to those in any model act for independent claims adjusters. The NAIC determines compliance with adjuster licensing requirements for States, urging annual reviews for those in compliance. The NAIC conducts annual reviews to ensure States comply with adjuster licensing requirements. If a State is found to be non-compliant, judicial review can be sought in the United States District Court. SEC. 6. AUTHORITY FOR INTERSTATE CLAIMS ADJUSTING. In states not compliant with section 5(a), after 4 years an independent claims adjuster with a valid license in their home state and passing a multi-state examination can handle claims. They are not subject to additional state requirements. Compliance with section 5 allows independent claims adjusters to handle claims in non-compliant states without additional state requirements. SEC. 7. ACCELERATING CLAIMS ADJUSTING OF LOSSES CAUSED BY NATURAL OR OTHER DISASTERS. An independent claims adjuster meeting specific requirements may adjust claims for losses related to natural disasters designated as major disasters by the President, regardless of state licensure requirements. The adjuster must hold a valid license in their home state. An independent claims adjuster can adjust claims for major disasters designated by the President, regardless of state licensure requirements, as long as they hold a valid license in their home state. If the NAIC administers a multi-state examination, the adjuster must pass it. SEC. 8. DEFINITIONS. The term \"home State\" for an independent claims adjuster is defined as the State where the adjuster is licensed and maintains their principal place of residence or business. If the adjuster's home State does not issue a license for the line of authority sought, it can be any other State where the adjuster is licensed and designated as their home State. The term \"independent claims adjuster\" refers to an individual who investigates, evaluates, and negotiates property, casualty, disability, or workers' compensation claims on behalf of insurers or self-insurers. This includes company adjusters employed by insurers. The term \"NAIC\" stands for the National Association. The term \"NAIC\" refers to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. A \"public adjuster\" is someone who helps determine and settle insurance claims for the insured. The term \"State\" includes various regions within the United States. \"State law\" encompasses all laws within a specific state. State law encompasses all laws, decisions, rules, regulations, or other State actions with the effect of law, including laws applicable only to the District of Columbia."
