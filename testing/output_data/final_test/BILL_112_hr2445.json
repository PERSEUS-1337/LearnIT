    "content": "The Act titled \"State and Local Funding Flexibility Act\" amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to provide funding flexibility for State and Local Educational Agencies. The State and Local Funding Flexibility Act allows States and local educational agencies to design flexible programs using Federal funds to support student achievement, especially for at-risk students. It also extends funding flexibility to all State and local educational agencies, allowing them to use Federal formula funds for authorized activities. State educational agencies can use federal funds for various authorized activities under specific provisions, regardless of other laws. State educational agencies must notify the Secretary by June 1 each year if they plan to use federal funds for alternative activities under specific provisions. Applicable funding refers to funds for State activities under certain provisions. State educational agencies are required to reserve, allocate, or spend federal funds for specific activities under various provisions, excluding funds provided under certain titles and laws. State educational agencies can allocate federal funds to local educational agencies or use them for technical assistance. The Secretary will disburse funding for alternative uses at the same time as regular funding for the fiscal year. Local educational agencies can use federal funds for alternative purposes, subject to certain conditions and laws. A local educational agency can use received funding for various authorized activities under different provisions of Title I, Title II, Title III, Title IV, Title V, Title VI, and Title VII, as well as Section 613(f) of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act allows local educational agencies to use funding for specific activities outlined in different provisions of Title I and Title II. Applicable funding is defined as funds provided for local activities under various parts of Title I and Title II. The term \"applicable funding\" excludes funds provided under specific provisions that local educational agencies must reserve, allocate, or spend for required activities, allot to eligible entities, or use for technical assistance or monitoring. Each State educational agency receiving applicable funding must disburse it to local educational agencies for alternative uses at the same time as funding for non-alternative uses. State and local educational agencies can only use applicable funding for administrative costs related to specified provisions. The section specifies that funds can be used for administrative costs related to specific programs, while also outlining various requirements that State and local educational agencies must adhere to, such as maintenance of effort and equitable participation of private school students. The Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 is amended by striking items relating to subpart 2 of part A of title VI and inserting new sections 1116 and 3122. Subpart 2 of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 provides funding flexibility for State and Local Educational Agencies, allowing them to use Federal funds as needed."
