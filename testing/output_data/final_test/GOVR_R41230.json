    "content": "The Miller Act, named after Representative John Elvis Miller, provides a federal remedy for subcontractors in federal construction contracts. Subcontractors would typically have to rely on state law breach of contract actions without the Miller Act. This is because subcontractors cannot enforce payment terms directly with the federal government due to the lack of privity of contract. The Miller Act requires contractors in federal construction projects to provide performance and payment bonds before any contract over $150,000 is awarded. This ensures compensation for defects in performance and guarantees payment to labor and material suppliers. The subcontractor cannot place a mechanic's lien on the property due to the government's sovereign immunity. The Miller Act mandates performance and payment bonds for federal construction projects over $150,000 to ensure compensation for defects and payment to labor and material suppliers. The bonds become legally binding upon contract award, with penal amounts typically 100% of the contract price. Subcontractors not paid within 90 days can bring civil action on the payment bond, but only first- and second-tier subcontractors are included, excluding lower-tier subcontractors and material suppliers without a contract. Subcontractors face challenges in protecting themselves from liability to remote tiers of subcontractors or materialmen. Materialmen are excluded from the definition of subcontractors in building trades. First- and second-tier subcontractors seeking payment on a Miller Act bond must file suit within one year of completing performance in federal district court. They must also provide notice to the prime contractor. Subcontractors seeking payment on a Miller Act bond must provide proper notice to the prime contractor. Recovery amount is based on the contract or reasonable expenses. Failure to obtain performance bonds can lead to contract breach with the government. The Prompt Payment Act of 1982 requires federal agencies to pay interest on late payments to prime contractors. In 1988, the act was amended to extend payment protections to subcontractors on federal construction contracts due to agencies' late payment practices. The 1988 amendments to the Prompt Payment Act extended payment protections to subcontractors on federal construction contracts, requiring prime contractors to pay subcontractors within seven days of receiving payment from the agency and to pay interest on late payments. The 1988 amendments to the Prompt Payment Act require prime contractors to pay subcontractors promptly and include payment and interest penalty terms in subcontracts to ensure payment obligations flow down to all tiers of subcontractors. Contractors can negotiate terms to retain or withhold payment without incurring interest penalties. Retainage is when a contractor holds back a percentage of each progress payment under a construction contract, often 10%, due to subcontractor performance issues. Withholding can also refer to nonpayment due to contractor debts outside the contract. Prompt Payment Act requires written notification for withholding, with the amount not exceeding the specified notice. Retainage and withholding are used to ensure timely contract completion and clear terms between parties. The federal government's obligations under the Prompt Payment Act only run to the prime contractor, who is responsible for paying subcontractors and lower-tier subcontractors. Disputes over late payments or interest between contractors and subcontractors cannot involve the federal government. The Obama Administration issued guidance in 2011-2012 for prompt payment of small business contractors within 15 days of invoice receipt. The Obama Administration issued guidance in 2011-2012 for prompt payment of small business contractors within 15 days of invoice receipt. Subsequently, in November 2013, the Administration amended the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) to implement the accelerated payment policy for small business subcontractors, requiring prime contractors to make accelerated payments to small business subcontractors upon receipt of accelerated payments from the Government. The FAR amendment requires prime contractors to make accelerated payments to small business subcontractors, but agencies are not obligated to pay interest on late payments. Small business subcontractors may not hold agencies accountable if prime contractors fail to make accelerated payments. The FAR has not been amended to address accelerated payments to small business contractors. Section 8(d) of the Small Business Act provides protections to small business subcontractors, requiring prime contractors to subcontract work to small businesses, make good faith efforts to work with subcontractors, and notify contracting officers of late payments. Amendments in 1978 established the Small Business Subcontracting Program to benefit prospective subcontractors on federal prime contracts. The Small Business Subcontracting Program benefits prospective subcontractors on federal prime contracts valued at over $150,000 in the United States. It includes clauses regarding subcontracting with small businesses and timely payment. The policy ensures that women-owned businesses have opportunities in federal agency contracts. Prime contractors must establish procedures for timely subcontract payments to various small business categories. The policy requires prime contractors to cooperate in compliance studies and incorporate subcontracting plans for contracts over $700,000. Plans must include separate percentage goals for various small business categories and assurances of promoting contracting with small businesses. The government's policy promotes contracting with small businesses in all subcontracts and requires subcontractors on contracts over $700,000 to adopt their own subcontracting plans. Small Business Administration regulations mandate pre-award notification to unsuccessful small business offerors on subcontracts over $150,000. \"Large\" prime contractors are encouraged to provide similar notice for smaller subcontracts. The contracting officer has discretion in determining compliance. The contracting officer has discretion in determining subcontracting plan requirements for contracts under $150,000. Failure to comply with the plan can result in termination for default and payment of liquidated damages. Agencies must consider contractors' performance in relation to their subcontracting plans. The contracting officer has discretion in determining subcontracting plan requirements for contracts under $150,000, with failure to comply resulting in termination for default and payment of liquidated damages. Agencies must consider contractors' performance in relation to their subcontracting plans, including evaluating past performance and making source selection decisions in certain negotiated procurements. Small businesses benefit from subcontracting plans, but they cannot enforce the terms against the prime contractor. The 111th Congress expanded protections for small business subcontractors under Section 8(d) of the Small Business Act. The Small Business Jobs Act of 2010 expanded protections for small business subcontractors under Section 8(d) of the Small Business Act. It requires prime contractors to make a good faith effort to use small businesses in their subcontracting plans and notify the contracting officer of any reduced payments or overdue payments to subcontractors. The Small Business Jobs Act of 2010 requires prime contractors to make timely payments to subcontractors and notify the contracting officer of any delays. Failure to do so may result in negative evaluations and reporting in the Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS). Regulations also prevent prime contractors from restricting subcontractors' communication with the contracting officer regarding payments. SBA does not require contracting officers to mediate disputes on late payments or subcontractor involvement in bids. Instead, they consider these factors in contractors' performance evaluations."
