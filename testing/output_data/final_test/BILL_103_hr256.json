    "content": "The \"Bank Efficiency Act\" aims to improve the efficiency of banks under multistate bank holding companies, enhance interstate banking services, and strengthen the overall banking system. The Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 is amended to define the term 'appropriate Federal banking agency' and allow interstate combination of subsidiary banks under a bank holding company with operations in multiple states. The Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 allows the merger of multiple banks into a single entity through consolidation or other transactions. This does not permit national or state-chartered banks to operate branches in locations where they are not already established. The Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 allows the merger of multiple banks into a single entity through consolidation or other transactions. National banks resulting from a merger can establish additional branches in any State where they are already established, in compliance with Federal and State laws. The merger does not affect other regulatory approval requirements or procedures under Federal or State law. A national bank resulting from a merger authorized by the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 can establish branches in any State where it already has branches, with the same powers and privileges as a national bank with branches only in that State. Each branch can exercise all powers conferred by Federal law, with applicable State law being the law of the State where the branch is located. A State-chartered bank resulting from a combination authorized under subparagraph (A) may establish additional branches in any State where it has branches, subject to approval from the appropriate State regulatory authority. The State-chartered bank shall have the same privileges as a State bank chartered in that State. A State-chartered bank can establish branches in other states but must abide by the laws of the state where the branch is located. The State bank supervisor determines if branch activities are permissible under state law. A State-chartered bank resulting from a combination authorized by subparagraph (A) shall be subject to State supervision by the State bank supervisor for the State in which the bank is chartered. The State bank supervisor for the State where a branch is located may cooperate with the supervisor for the chartering State for supervision. Federal banking agencies retain authority to supervise State-chartered banks. A State-chartered bank resulting from a combination authorized by subparagraph (A) shall be subject to State supervision by the State bank supervisor for the State in which the bank is chartered. The bank may not participate in a combination if the State has a statute prohibiting such combinations within 2 years of the effective date. If a bank resulting from a combination authorized by subparagraph (A) ceases to be a subsidiary of a bank holding company, it must comply with all provisions of Federal or State law restricting branch locations within 2 years. The Federal banking agency can extend this period for up to one year at a time, not exceeding a total of 3 years. The resulting bank from a merger must comply with State law conditions imposed on the original bank. National banks are located in the state named in their organization certificate, while State-chartered banks are located in the state they are chartered in. If a bank wants to operate branches in a different state, it must comply with regulations. If a bank seeks to operate a branch in a state other than where it is located, that branch will be considered the main office in the new state. SEC. 4 amends the National Bank Act regarding conversions to national banks and director qualifications. SEC. 5 addresses emergency acquisition authority. The amendments in this Act do not limit the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation's authority for emergency acquisitions. Bank holding companies acquiring banks will not lose any rights under Federal law due to mergers. The amendments in this Act do not limit the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation's authority for emergency acquisitions, including rights or privileges provided under section 13(f) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act."
