    "content": "MODIFICATIONS OF TAX TREATMENT OF QUALIFIED STATE TUITION PROGRAMS. Exclusion of Distributions Used for Educational Purposes: Amendment to section 529(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code allows distributions for qualified higher education expenses without penalty. This includes payments for the distributee's education expenses or providing a benefit that would qualify as such. The Internal Revenue Code now includes room and board as qualified higher education expenses under section 529(e)(3). Additionally, the definition of \"member of family\" in section 529(e)(2) has been modified to align with specific relationships outlined in section 152(a). The term 'eligible educational institution' is defined as an institution described in section 481 of the Higher Education Act of 1965 and eligible to participate in a program under title IV of such Act. Technical amendments were made to various sections of the Internal Revenue Code and the Small Business Job Protection Act of 1996. These changes include updating references and clarifying language regarding qualified State tuition programs. The amendments to the Internal Revenue Code and the Small Business Job Protection Act of 1996 include updates and clarifications related to qualified State tuition programs, such as contributions and earnings under contracts before program requirements are met. Contributions to such programs are considered qualified higher education expenses. The amendments made by this section apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 1996, with additional modifications taking effect as if included in the Small Business Job Protection Act of 1996."
