    "content": "The \"Retirement Inflation Protection Act of 2016\" is cited as the short title. Section 1023 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to index certain assets for determining gain or loss of eligible individuals. The \"Retirement Inflation Protection Act of 2016\" amends Section 1023 of the Internal Revenue Code to substitute indexed basis for adjusted basis for eligible individuals selling indexed assets held for more than 3 years. Depreciation deductions are determined separately, and written documentation of original purchase price is required. The term \"eligible individual\" refers to someone who is at least 59 1/2 years old at the time of selling an indexed asset, which can be common stock in a C corporation or tangible property used in a trade or business. This includes common stock in a foreign corporation traded on an established market. The exception to the rule of common stock in a foreign corporation being eligible for certain tax treatments includes stock of a foreign investment company, stock in a passive foreign investment company, stock in a foreign corporation held by a US person meeting specific requirements, and stock in a foreign personal holding company. American depository receipts for common stock in a foreign corporation are treated as common stock in that corporation. The indexed basis for assets under this section is determined by adjusting the asset's basis for inflation. This adjustment is calculated based on the difference between the gross domestic product deflator at the time of disposal and acquisition of the asset. The taxpayer's acquisition of an asset is subject to rounding to the nearest \\1/10\\ of 1 percentage point. The gross domestic product deflator for a calendar quarter is determined by the implicit price deflator for the gross domestic product. If a transaction reduces the risk of loss from holding an asset, it will not be considered an indexed asset during that period. Short sales are also addressed in this context. For short sales of indexed assets with a short sale period over 3 years, the amount realized is adjusted for inflation. The short sale period begins on the day of sale and ends on the closing date. The section excludes sales between related persons unless the transferee's basis is substituted. Related persons are defined as those with specific relationships or treated as a single employer. Transfers to increase indexing adjustment are also addressed. The section addresses transfers to secure or increase adjustments under subsection (a), allowing the Secretary to disallow part or all of the adjustment. Special rules apply to additions to the adjusted basis of tangible property or stock, with specific thresholds and treatment as separate assets. The section addresses the acquisition of assets with an aggregate amount of $1,000 or more during the taxable year. Special rules apply to assets that are not indexed throughout the holding period, certain distributions, and limitations on increasing ordinary loss. The section addresses rules for assets acquired with an aggregate amount of $1,000 or more during the taxable year. Special rules apply to non-indexed assets, distributions, and limitations on increasing ordinary loss. If the section would create a net ordinary loss, it will not apply, and the taxpayer will be treated as having a long-term capital loss. If subsection (a)(1) has been applied to an asset previously, the acquisition date will be the most recent prior application date. The Secretary will prescribe necessary regulations for this section. A clerical amendment is made to the table of sections. Sec. 1022 outlines the indexing of certain assets for determining gain or loss, while Sec. 1023 provides cross-references. These amendments apply to indexed assets acquired after December 31, 2016, in taxable years ending after that date."
