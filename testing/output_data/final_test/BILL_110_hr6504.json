    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Coordinate to Educate Act\" and includes findings and purposes. The \"Coordinate to Educate Act\" includes findings that highlight the challenges faced by academically at-risk students due to social and economic conditions, such as inadequate nutrition, health care, and family violence, which hinder their learning and development. Services for at-risk students are often fragmented, inconvenient, expensive, overregulated, ineffective, and duplicative, lacking coordination and accessibility for families and children in need. Service providers face bureaucratic obstacles and limited resources to provide necessary support. Coordination and integration of services for at-risk students, including health care and child care providers, juvenile justice workers, and others, offer cost-effective solutions by reducing duplication, improving service quality, and emphasizing prevention and early intervention to break the cycle of academic failure and low income. The Act aims to establish a grant program for local education agencies to enhance students' educational performance by removing barriers to learning, coordinating support services, increasing parental involvement, and focusing on prevention. The Act aims to establish a grant program for local education agencies to enhance students' educational performance by focusing on prevention and early intervention strategies to address student needs and ensure they are ready to learn in the classroom. The Secretary of Education is authorized to provide grants to local education agencies for coordinated service programs. To be eligible for a grant under this section, a local educational agency must plan to collaborate with health and social service agencies to develop a program of school-linked integrated services for children and families. Grants can be for up to 3 years, with evidence of progress required annually. Applications must demonstrate the need for coordinated services among students. The curr_chunk discusses the formation of a collaborative to provide coordinated services for students, including representatives from various sectors, objectives of the collaboration, and performance measurements. Grants awarded under this section are to be used for planning meetings, identifying barriers to learning, and addressing external factors affecting students. The curr_chunk focuses on assessing barriers to learning such as abuse, poor nutrition, and inadequate childcare. It also aims to evaluate available social service programs, funding sources, and proposes a sliding scale fee for services. Additionally, it suggests developing an interagency service delivery plan to coordinate resources at federal, state, and local levels. The curr_chunk outlines a plan for coordinating regulations, eligibility requirements, and service delivery at federal, state, and local levels. It includes a case management system and a goal of achieving self-sufficiency within 2 years without using funds from the Act. The curr_chunk focuses on implementation grants. To be eligible for a grant under this section, a local educational agency must have an approved interagency service delivery plan. Grants are limited to a 2-year period and require an application identifying barriers to learning and existing social service programs. The grant application must include a plan with coordinated services involving community and parent participation, an interagency agreement signed by key parties, a commitment to use Federal funds for no more than 50% of project costs after the first year, and details on how the program will be funded after the second year. The grant application must include a plan for coordinated services, staffing details, program location, regulatory coordination, case management system, sliding scale fees, and use of funds for obtaining commitments from other funding sources and improving interagency communications. The grant funds can be used for software development, data base integration, staff development, research on program success, and dissemination of successful programs. The grant funds can be used for software development, data base integration, staff development, research on program success, and dissemination of successful programs to support replication in other areas within a local educational agency. SEC. 6. TARGET POPULATIONS.\n\nAn eligible local educational agency can choose a school or program area for coordinated services if the project design is sufficient to achieve outcomes. Programs and services must be available to all children and families in the area, with payment options on a sliding scale.\n\nSEC. 7. SPECIAL CONSIDERATION. SEC. 7. SPECIAL CONSIDERATION.\n\nThe Secretary will prioritize awards based on geographic distribution, districts with at-risk students, local agencies with high proportions of at-risk students, and areas with single or two-parent working families.\n\nSEC. 8.
