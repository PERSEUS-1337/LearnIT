    "content": "In 1988, the federal government sued Florida for releasing water with high levels of phosphorus onto federal lands. The Everglades Forever Act was enacted in 1994 to address this issue, setting a phosphorus limit by 2003. Amendments in 2003 provided flexibility in deadlines for phosphorus mitigation. Florida issued a rule in July 2003 to establish a phosphorus limit and compliance methods. Controversy arose among stakeholders in the Everglades restoration effort over meeting the 2006 phosphorus mitigation deadline. Laws like the FY2004 Energy and Water Development Appropriations Act and the FY2004 Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Act condition Everglades funding on Florida meeting phosphorus mitigation and water quality standards by the 2006 deadline. Federal agencies are required to assess Florida's progress towards meeting this deadline. The FY2004 Energy and Water Development Appropriations Act and FY2004 Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Act condition funding for Everglades restoration on reports determining if Florida meets water quality requirements by a deadline. Failure to meet the deadline may result in Congress disapproving funding for some projects. The House Appropriations committee report (H.Rept. 108-195) expresses strong disapproval of Florida's new legislation and its potential impact on Everglades restoration. Concerns include possible delays in restoration projects and hindrance to the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Project (CERP). Funds for the Modified Water Deliveries Project and Florida land acquisitions near the Everglades are conditioned in the Appropriations Act. The U.S. EPA finds Florida is not meeting water quality standards, specifically phosphorus criteria in LNWR and ENP. A report must be submitted to five Congressional committees for funding approval. The report is due 90 days after the bill's enactment and annually through 2006. The Interior Department will reallocate $32 million in unused funds intended for Florida to purchase lands near the Everglades. The funds will now go to agencies like the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to improve water quality in LWNR. H.Rept. 108-195 directs the EPA to report on Florida's amendments to the Everglades Forever Act, approval of the numeric phosphorus criterion, and protection of LNWR and ENP. No due date is specified for the EPA reports. The FY2004 Energy and Water Development Appropriations Act allocates $137 million for Everglades restoration. The Development Appropriations Act allocates $137 million for Everglades restoration, with conditions for fund availability based on Florida's compliance with water quality requirements. The Act includes funding for various restoration projects and specifies steps for fund disapproval if requirements are not met. The House and Senate committee reports on Everglades restoration highlight concerns about Florida meeting water quality standards and phosphorus pollution reduction deadlines. Congress may divert restoration funds if requirements are not met, and the EPA Administrator is directed to report on these issues to relevant committees. The federal-state partnership for Everglades restoration is being questioned due to recent changes in Florida's Everglades Forever Act. Concerns have been raised about the state's commitments to improve water quality by a certain deadline. Some view these changes as a shift towards federal oversight of state restoration efforts, potentially impacting other ecosystem restoration projects. The FY2004 Interior Appropriations Act places conditions on funding for various projects, including the Modified Water Deliveries project and land acquisition funds. The Energy and Water legislation could affect funding for projects in Central and Southern Florida, the Everglades restoration, Kissimmee River Restoration, and CERP. Water quality standards are required for water entering LNWR and ENP under the Energy and Water legislation, while the Interior legislation mandates meeting Florida water quality and phosphorus standards, as well as Consent Decree requirements throughout LNWR and ENP. The Interior legislation requires water in LNWR and ENP to meet broader standards than Florida's phosphorus rule, including limits on multiple substances. Phosphorus levels can vary depending on where water is measured, and there are concerns about accurately measuring all state water quality standards annually. Delays or changes to projects may jeopardize CERP's feasibility. Delays or changes to projects, such as land acquisitions for the Modified Water Deliveries Project, could jeopardize CERP's feasibility and funding. The Amended EFA authorizes a new plan to mitigate phosphorus pollution in the Everglades, known as the Long-Term Plan. Delays in funding or non-compliance with water quality standards could also impact the overall restoration process. The Long-Term Plan aims to ensure water quality standards in the Everglades are met by implementing phosphorus reduction technology from 2003 to 2016. The plan allows for adaptive management and potential deadline extensions for compliance. The Amended EFA suggests meeting the phosphorus criterion by December 2006. The bill requires implementation of projects and strategies by December 2006 to achieve the phosphorus criterion in the Everglades Protection Area. The law does not specify a deadline for meeting the phosphorus criterion, but a second 10-year phase (2017-2026) may be necessary to achieve the Plan objective. The Plan aims to achieve a long-term phosphorus concentration in Everglades waters within specified limits. The Amended EFA has faced criticism for potentially delaying phosphorus mitigation, which could impact Everglades restoration efforts and federal funding for CERP. The Amended EFA has faced criticism for uncertainties in compliance with water quality standards, phosphorus discharge standards, potential delays in mitigation leading to polluted water entering federal lands, allowing discharges in unpolluted areas, and shifting costs to the federal government. Proponents argue it offers a realistic chance to address phosphorus pollution in the Everglades. Some argue that lowering phosphorus concentration in the Everglades to 10 ppb by December 2006 may not be feasible due to technology limitations. They suggest a more cost-effective plan that incorporates adaptive management and the best available technology to reduce phosphorus levels efficiently. This new approach aims to work in conjunction with CERP and state efforts to achieve water quality standards. The new law aims to reduce phosphorus pollution in the Everglades through adaptive management and the best available technology. A second set of amendments in 2003 addressed critics' concerns and emphasized flexibility in the plan without setting a specific deadline for phosphorus mitigation. Phosphorus pollution in the Everglades is primarily caused by natural leaching, urban runoff, and agricultural runoff. The 2003 Everglades Consolidated Report shows higher phosphorus concentrations in the northern Everglades and lower concentrations in the southern Everglades. Urban runoff is also identified as a contributing factor. Excessive phosphorus levels in the Everglades lead to eutrophication, causing plants to die and consume oxygen, harming fish and aquatic plants. This process is accelerated by rapid inflow of nutrients, favoring plants that thrive on high nutrient levels. The primary factor behind the conversion of native vegetation in the Everglades is excessive phosphorus. The conversion of native vegetation in the Everglades to cattail-dominated stands is due to excessive phosphorus input since the 1940s, mainly from agricultural activities like sugar production. This has led to habitat loss for wildlife, reduced populations of native plants, and altered hydrology in the area. Sugarcane production in the Everglades contributes two-thirds of the economic production and uses 80% of the crop land. Phosphorus from fertilizers and plant decomposition is a major contributor to the ecosystem, leading to phosphorus leaching. In the 1980s, the issue of phosphorus pollution gained attention, resulting in a lawsuit against the South Florida Water Management District and the Florida Department of Environmental Regulation for not enforcing water quality standards. In 1991, a settlement was reached after litigation over phosphorus pollution in the Everglades. Florida agreed to restore water quality by implementing phosphorus limits by 2006, establishing Stormwater Treatment Areas, and requiring farmers to use Best Management Practices to reduce agricultural runoff. The phosphorus limits for water in the Everglades Agricultural Area (EAA) were established in a settlement agreement in 1992. Different limits were set for the Loxahatchee National Wildlife Refuge (LNWR) and Everglades National Park (ENP). By July 2002, water in ENP was required to meet phosphorus limits of less than 8 ppb in a wet year and less than 13 ppb in a dry year, while water in LNWR had limits of 7 ppb in a wet year and 17 ppb in a dry year. Stormwater Treatment Areas (STAs) and Best Management Practices (BMPs) were implemented to reduce phosphorus levels in water flowing from the EAA into LNWR. Florida passed the Everglades Forever Act in 1994 to provide a framework for restoration efforts and end litigation related to the settlement agreement. The Everglades Forever Act (EFA) of 1994 provided a framework for restoration efforts in Florida, addressing water quality and phosphorus pollution in the Everglades. It covered state and federal Everglades lands, set a deadline for meeting water quality requirements by December 31, 2006, and included measures such as the construction of Stormwater Treatment Areas (STAs) and monitoring programs in the Everglades Agricultural Area (EAA). The Act also mandated the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) to propose a phosphorus criterion by December 31, 2003, and established an agricultural privilege tax in certain basins. The Everglades Forever Act of 1994 addressed water quality and phosphorus pollution in the Everglades, setting a deadline for meeting water quality requirements by December 31, 2006. It mandated the use of BMPs to lower phosphorus runoff and the construction of STAs. Phosphorus mitigation efforts by agriculture in the Everglades have been successful, with phosphorus loads decreasing due to BMPs and STAs. The 2004 Draft Everglades Consolidated Report by SFWMD states that phosphorus discharges have been reduced to about 35 ppb. The SFWMD Governing Board recommended flexibility in achieving the phosphorus criterion to integrate SFWMD projects with CERP projects, citing concerns about the cost and necessity of additional actions to meet the original EFA deadlines. The board endorsed the Everglades Protection Area Tributary Basins Conceptual Plan for Achieving Long-Term Water Quality Goals Final Report. The Basins Conceptual Plan aims to achieve long-term water quality goals in the Everglades by reducing phosphorus levels. It includes structural and operational modifications to projects, optimization of water quality performance, and adaptive management. This plan formed the basis for Florida's amendments to the EFA in 2003. The FY2004 appropriations provisions restrict federal funding for Everglades restoration based on compliance with water quality standards. The appendices provide additional context on efforts to address Everglades phosphorus pollution, including a historical timeline and a comparison of pending legislation."
