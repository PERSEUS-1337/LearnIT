    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Fracturing Regulations are Effective in State Hands Act\". Congress acknowledges the effectiveness of state regulations in protecting water resources during oil and gas activities, as highlighted in reports by the Ground Water Protection Council and the Environmental Protection Agency. The EPA's 2004 study found no evidence of drinking water contamination from hydraulic fracturing, while a 2009 report by the Ground Water Protection Council stated there is a lack of evidence that fracking poses a risk to groundwater. Additionally, a 2009 resolution by the Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission emphasized the safety measures in place at the state level to protect drinking water during oil and gas operations. The safety of hydraulic fracturing operations has been emphasized by various officials and agencies, with no verified cases of groundwater contamination associated with the process. Federal regulations already cover activities related to hydraulic fracturing to protect drinking water. Federal regulations already cover hydraulic fracturing under various environmental statutes, but Congress has not included it in the Safe Drinking Water Act. In 2011, the Secretary of the Interior announced plans for new regulations on Federal land, and a 2012 study by the Energy Institute highlighted the need for regulation. The Energy Institute at the University of Texas at Austin found no evidence of hydraulic fracturing fluid chemicals in aquifers as a result of fracturing operations in a February 2012 study. SEC. 3. DEFINITION OF FEDERAL LAND. The term \"Federal land\" includes public lands, National Forest System land, Bureau of Reclamation jurisdiction, and Corps of Engineers jurisdiction. SEC. 4. STATE AUTHORITY. State authority is granted for regulating underground injection of fluids or propping agents in hydraulic fracturing processes related to oil, gas, or geothermal production activities on State land. Federal land operations are subject to the laws of the State where the land is located."
