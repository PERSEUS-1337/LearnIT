    "content": "The enactment of P.L. 95-216 in 1977 provided disability benefits for blind individuals regardless of their ability to work or earnings. Senator Birch Bayh's amendment, adopted during consideration of H.R. 9346, aimed to protect the blind from economic consequences of their disability. Senator Bayh emphasized the need to recognize blindness as a unique condition and provide support through social security insurance. The House-passed version of H.R. 9346 did not include provisions to protect blind individuals from adverse economic effects. However, in conference, it was agreed that the amount of earnings that would terminate benefits for blind individuals would be increased to the monthly exempt amount for those at or above full retirement age. This established a different test of substantial gainful activity (SGA) for blind persons compared to those with other disabilities. The SGA level for blind individuals was set higher than for other disabled recipients in 1978, with subsequent debates over the disparity. In 1988, a recommendation was made to lower the SGA level for new applicants to match other disabled recipients. In 1992, a court froze the SGA level for blind individuals at $700 a month. The United States District Court for the District of Wyoming found the higher SGA amount for the blind unconstitutional, but the Court of Appeals overturned this decision. Congress later increased the earnings test limit for retirement age individuals, removing the linkage between SGA level for the blind and exempt amounts for those who have reached full retirement age. President William Clinton signed H.R. 5, the Senior Citizens' Freedom to Work Act, eliminating the Social Security earnings test for recipients who have reached full retirement age in 2000. The link between the earnings test and the SGA level of the blind was permanently severed by P.L. 106-182, continuing the decision made in P.L. 104-121. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that adverse employment experiences for the blind are not unique compared to other disabled recipients. Proponents argue that blindness is still a distinct condition deserving special compensatory help, as recognized by Congress. Proponents argue that blindness deserves special compensatory help as recognized by Congress, advocating for different disability criteria for the blind in terms of insured status, continued benefits eligibility beyond age 54, and the use of functional capacity in defining disability. Opponents believe the blind already receive preferential treatment and expanding it further would be inequitable. Opponents argue that expanding benefits for the blind would be unfair, as they believe current laws already provide preferential treatment. They question the logic behind giving certain disabled individuals advantages over others and dispute claims of higher unemployment rates among the blind. They argue that further liberalizing the SGA limit for the blind would undermine the concept of disability. Expanding benefits for the blind is opposed as it could be seen as unfair and undermine the concept of disability programs."
