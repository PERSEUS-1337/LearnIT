    "title": "SB 41",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The 2024 Olympic Games and Paralympic Games Act, also known as the Applicant committee agreement, Bid committee agreement, Endorsing municipality, and Games definitions. The 2024 Olympic Games Act defines terms like \"Games,\" \"Games support contract,\" \"Joinder agreement,\" and \"Joinder undertaking.\" These agreements involve the Governor, site selection organizations, and endorsing municipalities in selecting a site for the games. The 2024 Olympic Games Act defines terms like \"Joinder undertaking\" as an agreement between the Governor, site selection organizations, and endorsing municipalities for selecting a site for the games. OCOG, a nonprofit corporation authorized by the endorsing municipality, pursues the application and bid on behalf of the site selection organization for hosting the games. The purpose of the 2024 Olympic Games Act is to provide assurances to site selection organizations sponsoring the games. Hosting the games in California is expected to generate billions for the state's economy, with the endorsing municipality budgeting sufficient funds for security and service costs during the games. The endorsing municipality in California plans to host environmentally responsible games, commit to youth programs and sports opportunities, and develop a statewide cultural program. They have involved various stakeholders in their bid and board of directors. The USOC requires certain agreements to be executed by bid states, cities, and committees. The endorsing municipality in California expects net revenue from hosting the games to fund legacy programs for youth. The Governor may agree to a joinder undertaking with a site selection organization for hosting the games, subject to certain conditions. The Governor may agree to settle disputes related to the joinder undertaking and provide state funding and resources for hosting the games as specified in the bid committee agreement. The state will be liable for OCOG obligations to a site selection organization through a funding mechanism established by the act. The Governor will execute a joinder undertaking and agreement, with the OCOG being responsible for any financial deficit related to the Olympic Games Trust Fund. A games support contract may include additional provisions as required by the Governor. The State Treasury will establish the \"Olympic Games Trust Fund\" to support the games. The state may fund the Olympic Games Trust Fund as deemed appropriate, with the funding mechanism determined around the time of selecting the host city. The funds in the trust fund are solely for fulfilling the state's obligations under a games support contract for providing adequate security. The state will not deposit more funds into the Olympic Games Trust Fund once it has enough balance to cover up to $250,000,000 in financial deficits and liabilities from the games. If the endorsing municipality in California is chosen as the host city for the Olympic Games, the Olympic Games Trust Fund will be maintained until the state's obligations are fulfilled. If the municipality is not selected, the trust fund will be terminated immediately. Upon termination of the Olympic Games Trust Fund, all funds and investment earnings will revert to the General Fund. The Olympic Games Trust Fund established in Section 5 will be used for security purposes to fulfill obligations under a games support contract. The state may use moneys in the trust fund or secure insurance coverage, letters of credit, or other instruments to cover liabilities up to $250,000,000. The total financial obligations related to games support contracts and other agreements under this act cannot exceed $250,000,000 in total. The state's financial obligations for the Olympic Games Trust Fund are limited to $250,000,000. The state is the payer of last resort for any net financial deficit, with specific conditions for accessing security and insurance coverage. The state's full faith and credit or taxing power cannot be used for payments under this act. The OCOG seeks payment from third parties, lists the state as an insured on insurance policies, must not engage in unfavorable conduct, and the act is urgent for the 2024 Olympic Games bid process."
