    "content": "The definition of a small firm for assessing business tax provisions in ARRA lacks uniformity, with criteria such as assets, gross receipts, and employment used to identify eligible firms. Some federal small business tax preferences, like the expensing allowance under Section 179 of the IRC, benefit small firms based on the design of the preferences rather than explicit size limitations. The Small Business Act grants the SBA authority to establish size standards for federal programs aiding small businesses. The Act uses employee number and annual receipts to determine eligibility, with standards varying by industry. The Small Business Act grants the SBA authority to establish size standards for federal programs aiding small businesses based on employee number and annual receipts, with varying standards by industry. The SBA uses different criteria to define small firms in mining/manufacturing (500 or fewer employees) and service/retail industries ($6 million or less in annual receipts). Financial services firms are considered small if assets are $175 million or less. The SBA uses a single size standard of 500 or fewer employees for collecting economic data on small businesses. The definition of a small firm involves arbitrary choices about standards for all industries, such as employment, assets, and revenues. There are challenges in applying a single standard to all industries, and drawing the line between small and other firms is complex. This may explain the difficulties in federal support for small businesses. The federal support for small businesses is based on multiple eligibility criteria due to the challenges in defining a small firm across all industries. The tax provisions in ARRA aim to benefit small business owners, with 11 provisions identified as beneficial to a wide range of industries. The tax provisions in ARRA aim to benefit small business owners with various incentives, including extended net operating loss carryback period, increased exclusion of gain on the sale of small business stock, and lower estimated tax payments for qualified small business owners in 2009. The tax provisions in ARRA aim to benefit small business owners with incentives such as extended net operating loss carryback period, increased exclusion of gain on the sale of small business stock, and lower estimated tax payments for qualified small business owners in 2009. Other provisions target specific sectors and encourage investment in low-income communities. Overall, the provisions are intended to stimulate investment and hiring by small firms in 2009 and 2010. The tax provisions in ARRA aim to benefit small business owners by lowering the cost of capital for purchases of tangible assets, increasing cash flow, and reducing the after-tax cost of hiring individuals. However, the severity of the economic downturn since 2008 is outweighing the stimulus from these tax benefits. It is challenging to determine how small firms are responding to the incentives, but there is an indicator of the potential stimulus they could provide. The tax provisions in ARRA aim to benefit small business owners by lowering the cost of capital for purchases of tangible assets, increasing cash flow, and reducing the after-tax cost of hiring individuals. According to the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT), the estimated revenue loss from tax provisions targeted at small firms could reach $5.7 billion in FY2009, while provisions benefiting many small firms could result in a combined revenue loss of $52.0 billion in the same year. This revenue loss represents a deferral of tax liability, indicating that deferred taxes will need to be paid in the future. Business taxpayers can deduct costs incurred in earning income, with capital goods and durable assets recovered over time through economic depreciation. Tax incentives aim to boost investment and hiring, with estimated revenue loss indicating potential future benefits for companies. Accelerated depreciation allows firms to recover the cost of assets faster than their actual value declines, reducing current tax liabilities but increasing future tax payments. This method lowers the marginal effective tax rate on new investments. Expensing reduces the marginal effective tax rate on new investments, making them more attractive to business owners. Accelerated depreciation boosts cash flow for firms making qualified investments, especially for longer-lived assets. ARRA extends enhanced expensing allowance through 2009, benefiting smaller firms. The expensing allowance, which benefits smaller firms, allows deductions up to $250,000 for new and used qualified assets purchased in 2009. The allowance will continue after 2009 but will decrease to $25,000 by 2011, excluding real property purchases. The ARRA extended bonus depreciation and expensing allowances in 2009, allowing firms to deduct 50-100% of qualified asset costs. The JCT estimated a revenue loss of $331 million from FY2009 to FY2013 and $206 billion from FY2009 to FY2018. The expensing allowance benefits smaller firms with deductions up to $250,000 for new and used assets in 2009, decreasing to $25,000 by 2011. The extended bonus depreciation and expensing allowances in 2009 aim to boost business investment by reducing tax payments initially and increasing them later. This temporary incentive alters the timing of investments without affecting the total amount invested over time. The enhanced expensing allowance, combined with bonus depreciation, encourages firms to advance planned investments to 2009 by lowering the cost of capital for qualified assets. The extended bonus depreciation and expensing allowances in 2009 aim to boost business investment by altering the timing of investments without affecting the total amount invested over time. The allowances could spur a bigger rise in spending on qualified assets with a recovery period of 10 to 20 years than on qualified assets with a recovery period of three to seven years. Standard economic models suggest that the allowances are likely to initiate a process where business investment rises right after they go into effect, rises again just before they expire, and then drops after they do expire. The extended bonus depreciation and expensing allowances in 2009 aim to boost business investment by altering the timing of investments without affecting the total amount invested over time. Several recent studies suggest that business investment is moderately sensitive to tax incentives, with a 10% reduction in the tax rate leading to a 5% increase in investment. The combination of bonus depreciation and expensing allowances can significantly lower the effective tax rate on returns to investment in qualified assets. However, it is doubtful that most small firms will substantially increase their investment in response to these incentives, although they may spend more on heavily subsidized qualified assets. The extended bonus depreciation and expensing allowances in 2009 aim to boost business investment by altering the timing of investments without affecting the total amount invested over time. Recent studies suggest that business investment is moderately sensitive to tax incentives, with a 10% reduction in the tax rate leading to a 5% increase in investment. Bonus depreciation allowances from 2001 to 2004 had a modest impact on the U.S. economy, increasing GDP by $10 billion to $20 billion and creating 100,000 to 200,000 jobs. Purchases of longer-lived assets received a subsidy three to five times greater than other assets. The subsidy for longer-lived assets was three to five times greater than for shorter-lived assets, leading to a 40% increase in investment. However, studies show that the impact of these allowances on investment spending is limited, with less than 10% of respondents citing significant influence on capital spending timing. The Congressional Budget Office also found a lack of solid evidence that the allowances affected investment timing around expiration dates. The impact of IRC Section 179 expensing allowance on business investment timing and level is not well studied. Previous bonus depreciation allowances did not have the expected impact on investment, possibly due to firms expecting extensions and long planning horizons for investments. Many firms may not have benefited from tax incentives due to long planning horizons for investments and insufficient income or loss carryforwards. Lower capital costs may encourage some additional investment by small firms, but most tax benefits may go to firms that would have made investments anyway. The current economic slump and uncertainty are leading to a reluctance among companies to spend cash. The economic recession since late 2007 has led to a decline in domestic economic activity, with real GDP falling and corporate profits dropping significantly. This has resulted in a decrease in business investment, as firms of all sizes are eliminating or postponing investment projects. Real business investment in equipment and software declined at an average annual rate of 15% from 2008 to 2009. Economic forecasters predict further decline in business spending on new plant and equipment in 2009. Small firms are also affected, with many deferring non-essential investment projects. Only 5% of small business owners believe it is a good time to expand operations. Earnings for small businesses were 43% lower from February to April 2009 compared to November. Combined earnings from February to April 2009 were 43% lower than from November 2008 to January 2009. Only 20% of owners plan to make capital expenditures from June to December 2009 due to pessimism about consumer spending and limited access to credit. Small firms can use net operating losses to lower taxable income and potentially receive a tax refund. Firms can carry net operating losses (NOL) back two years or forward 20 years, with exceptions for certain losses like farming or natural disasters. Eligible small firms can carry back NOLs for more than two but fewer than six years under ARRA. The extended NOL carryback period allows eligible small firms to carry back losses up to 20 years if their average annual gross receipts in the previous three tax years were $15 million or less. The JCT estimates a revenue loss of $2.1 billion from FY2009 to FY2013 and $1.0 billion from FY2009 to FY2018 due to this provision. It is front-loaded, impacting firms with NOLs in 2008 that carry them back an additional three years. The exact number of small firms benefiting from this extended carryback period is unknown. The extended NOL carryback period allows eligible small firms to receive refunds for NOLs in 2008, potentially leading to increased spending in 2009. This could result in the purchase of assets eligible for depreciation allowances, boosting cash flow and investments in the economy. The extended NOL carryback provision allows eligible small firms to receive refunds for NOLs in 2008, potentially leading to increased spending in 2009. This could result in the purchase of assets eligible for depreciation allowances, boosting cash flow and investments in the economy. Eligible firms that are profitable but struggling to raise capital could benefit from this provision, although its impact on many firms in 2009 is uncertain due to factors like the cost of capital for business investment and consumer spending. Some firms may find their current capacity insufficient to meet demand, and the extended NOL carryback provision may not effectively stimulate the economy. Small firms in a downturn may hold onto cash instead of investing or hiring. Uncertainty about economic growth may further deter firms from utilizing the provision to increase investment and employment. The provision benefits small firms that had a loss in 2008 but were profitable in preceding years. It allows exclusion of up to 50% of gain on qualified small business stock, with a limit of $10 million or 10 times the taxpayer's basis. The provision was added in 1993 when the maximum tax rate on long-term capital gains was 28%. The tax code in 1993 set the maximum tax rate on long-term capital gains at 28%. Currently, gains on the sale of Qualified Small Business Stock (QSBS) are taxed at a rate of 28%, resulting in an effective tax rate of 14%. To qualify for this preferential treatment, the stock must be acquired at its original issue, held for at least five years, and meet certain criteria regarding the issuing corporation's assets and business activities. The partial exclusion for QSBS is considered a preference item for calculating the individual Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT). The partial exclusion for Qualified Small Business Stock (QSBS) aims to increase equity capital flow to small start-up firms by enhancing after-tax returns for investors. The effectiveness of this exclusion in achieving its purpose is unknown. Under the ARRA, 75% of gains on QSBS acquired between February 17, 2009, and January 1, 2011, can be excluded from taxation, resulting in lower tax rates for investors. The provision is estimated to generate a revenue gain of $9. The provision for Qualified Small Business Stock (QSBS) under the ARRA allows for a partial exclusion of gains acquired between 2009 and 2011. This provision is estimated to result in a revenue gain of $9 million from 2009 to 2013, but a revenue loss of $807 million from 2009 to 2018. The increase in equity investment in small firms is expected, but the actual impact is uncertain due to lack of evidence on its effectiveness and economic uncertainties. Investing in small start-up firms during the economic downturn has increased risk, leading to a significant decrease in venture capital investment. Owners of firms must choose between entity-level income tax for C corporations or passthrough entities to avoid this tax. For tax purposes, C corporations are subject to entity-level tax on their net income, while passthrough entities like partnerships and S corporations pass their net income to owners. S corporations offer passthrough treatment with non-tax advantages of corporate status. To qualify as an S corporation, a business entity must meet certain requirements. S corporations must meet specific requirements regarding capital structure and shareholders to qualify. S corporations that were previously C corporations may face a corporate-level tax on net built-in gains during a 10-year recognition period. This tax is limited to the aggregate net built-in gain at the time of conversion. When a C corporation converts to an S corporation, it may be subject to a built-in gains tax on assets acquired from the C corporation. This tax applies to any net recognized built-in gain realized during a recognition period from the sale of these assets. The tax is calculated using the highest corporate income tax rate. The built-in gains tax applies the income tax rate to an S corporation's net recognized built-in gain for the tax year, limited to the excess of net unrealized built-in gain over previous years. Ways to reduce the tax include deducting net operating losses and capital losses. The built-in gains tax for S corporations can be reduced by deducting capital losses and utilizing business tax credits carried forward from C corporation years. Congress enacted this tax in 1986 to prevent C corporations from converting to S corporations to avoid paying taxes on gains from asset sales or distributions to shareholders. The repeal of the built-in gains tax for S corporations resulted in liquidation of firms. The ARRA shortened the recognition period from 10 to 7 years for S corporations selling appreciated assets, reducing the double taxation on gains for both the corporation and individual shareholders. The 10-year recognition period for S corporations selling qualified assets will be reinstated in 2011 and beyond, providing more flexibility for owners formed through the conversion of a C corporation from 1999 to 2002. This allows them to sell appreciated assets in 2009 and 2010 without paying taxes, potentially helping them survive the economic downturn. The recession was triggered by declines in real estate and marketable securities values, leading to liquidity losses in financial markets. The JCT estimates a revenue loss from the temporary reduction in the recognition period for the built-in gains tax for S corporations. S corporations accounted for 11% of all business tax returns in 2005. Current federal tax law requires individuals to pay 90% of their expected tax liability through withholding or estimated tax payments. Individuals can avoid penalties for failing to pay estimated tax by meeting certain criteria. The JCT estimates a revenue loss from the temporary reduction in the recognition period for the built-in gains tax for S corporations. Individuals can avoid penalties for failing to pay estimated tax by meeting certain criteria, such as paying at least 90% of the estimated tax for the current tax year or 100% of the tax shown on the previous year's return if their AGI was $150,000 or less. ARRA changes these rules for tax years beginning in 2009, allowing qualified individuals to base their estimated tax payments on 90% of their tax liability for the previous year if their AGI was less than $500,000 in 2008 and over 50% of their gross income was from a small business. The provision in the tax return allows for reduced payments for small businesses to improve cash flow during a recession. However, any unpaid taxes in 2009 must be paid in 2010, potentially burdening firms if the recession continues. The JCT estimates a revenue loss of $275 million in FY2009 and a gain in FY2010. ARRA extends a bonus depreciation allowance through 2009. The Economic Stimulus Act of 2008 created a bonus depreciation allowance that expired at the end of 2009. The allowance is equal to 50% of the adjusted basis of new qualified assets purchased in 2009 and applies to specific categories of assets. The firm must be the original user of the asset and place it in service in 2009 to benefit from the allowance. The ARRA extended bonus depreciation and expensing allowances, allowing firms to deduct 50-100% of the cost of qualified assets purchased in 2009. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimated a revenue loss of $17.7 billion from FY2009 to FY2013 and $6.0 billion from FY2009 to FY2018 due to the extension. The extension of bonus depreciation and expensing allowances in 2009 aimed to boost business investment by reducing tax payments initially and increasing them later. This temporary incentive was supported by theory and empirical evidence, suggesting it could accelerate planned investments delayed by the recession. The cost of capital was lowered for purchases of qualified assets in 2009, potentially speeding up the timing of investments without affecting the total amount invested over time. The bonus depreciation and expensing allowances aim to lower the effective tax rate on returns to investment in qualified assets. Studies show that business investment is moderately sensitive to tax incentives, with a 10% reduction in the tax rate leading to a 5% increase in investment. However, it is uncertain if small firms will significantly increase their investment in response to these temporary tax incentives. Most small firms are expected to increase investment in response to accelerated depreciation allowances, especially in 2009 due to weak domestic business investment climate. Previous studies on bonus depreciation allowances show only a modest impact on the economy and business investment. Analysts are unsure why these incentives had less stimulative effect than expected. Analysts suggest several reasons for the muted effects of accelerated depreciation allowances. Firms may have expected the allowances to be extended, making them less likely to accelerate investments. Additionally, some firms may have been unable to undertake planned investments within the allowance timeframe, while others may have had too little income to benefit. In 2009, lower capital costs may encourage some additional investment by small firms, but most of the tax benefits may go to firms that would have made investments regardless of the subsidies. The current slump in domestic economic activity and uncertainty about the economy are impacting small business investment in 2009 more than tax incentives. The work opportunity tax credit (WOTC) aims to encourage employers to hire individuals from disadvantaged groups. The Work Opportunity Tax Credit (WOTC) incentivizes employers to hire individuals from specified disadvantaged groups with historically high unemployment rates. Employers can claim a 40% non-refundable credit on the first $6,000 in qualified wages paid to eligible individuals during their first year of employment. The Work Opportunity Tax Credit (WOTC) provides a credit for hiring veterans with service-connected disabilities and summer youth hires. The credit is based on qualified individuals working over 400 hours in their first year of employment, with a lower credit of 25% for those working fewer hours. No credit is available for employees working less than 120 hours or those not certified as eligible by a state employment agency. The WOTC expires for individuals starting work after August 31, 2011, and the credit cannot exceed 90% of an employer's income tax liability. The Work Opportunity Tax Credit (WOTC) provides a credit for hiring veterans with service-connected disabilities and summer youth hires. The credit is based on qualified individuals working over 400 hours in their first year of employment, with a lower credit of 25% for those working fewer hours. The credit cannot exceed 90% of an employer's income tax liability. The WOTC may be carried back one year or forward up to 20 years if the credit exceeds a threshold, and can be claimed against the alternative minimum tax for tax years beginning in 2007. ARRA temporarily expands eligibility for the credit to include unemployed veterans and disconnected youth for 2009 and 2010. The temporary expansion of the Work Opportunity Tax Credit (WOTC) to include unemployed veterans and disconnected youth for 2009 and 2010 may not significantly benefit small firms due to economic contraction and declining business profits. The $2,400 tax credit per qualified worker may not be enough to incentivize small firms to hire low-wage workers, especially since many firms have limited tax liabilities and uncertain financial outlooks. The expanded Work Opportunity Tax Credit (WOTC) for unemployed veterans and disconnected youth in 2009 and 2010 may not greatly benefit small firms due to economic contraction. A 2001 study found that the credit had little impact on recruitment efforts, suggesting employers would have hired targeted groups regardless. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates a revenue loss of $32 million in FY2009 and $222 million from FY2009 through FY2013, indicating minimal job creation impact among small firms. When a business taxpayer's debt is cancelled or discharged, the forgiven amount is considered gross income. Tax law requires a debtor to include forgiven debt in gross income if they buy back or exchange their debt for less than the amount owed. This forgiven debt is known as discharge-of-indebtedness (DOI) income. For example, if a corporation borrowed $1 million but the value of their bonds decreased, they would need to include the forgiven amount in their gross income. The corporation's credit rating has dropped due to a recession, causing $1 million in bonds to be worth only $500,000. If the debt is repurchased at the current value, the $500,000 difference is taxable income. Exceptions include debt discharged under Chapter 11 bankruptcy, insolvency, qualified farm or real property business indebtedness, and qualified principal residence indebtedness. ARRA temporarily modifies the tax treatment of discharge-of-indebtedness income. The ARRA temporarily modifies the tax treatment of DOI income, allowing firms to defer DOI income from debt buybacks or exchanges in 2009 and 2010. The income must be included ratably in the following five tax years. This provision is estimated to result in a $43 billion revenue loss from FY2009 through FY2013. It is uncertain how small firms with 500 or fewer employees will benefit from this provision due to limited data on their finances. The temporary deferral of DOI income under the ARRA aims to help small businesses with cash flow during the economic downturn, but there is debate over which firms will benefit. Supporters argue that deferring DOI income will reduce indebtedness and improve survival chances. Critics point out challenges in raising funds due to declining asset values and market liquidity. The temporary deferral of DOI income under the ARRA aims to assist small businesses during the economic downturn. Critics argue that firms with adequate cash reserves will benefit the most, while those in greater need may not see significant advantages. The provision may not benefit firms lacking cash reserves or with net operating losses from the recession. C corporations that purchased assets eligible for bonus depreciation between April 1, 2008, and December 31, 2008, had the option to claim a refundable tax credit for unused research tax credits and AMT credits from before 2006. The refundable credit, known as the bonus depreciation amount, was based on specific calculations and had a maximum limit of $30 million. To claim this credit, a corporation had to adjust its tax liability limitation under the general business credit. The refundable tax credit for unused research credits and AMT credits from before 2006 allowed C corporations to claim a bonus depreciation amount, capped at $30 million. This credit required adjusting the tax liability limitation under the general business credit. The option to claim the refundable credit in lieu of a bonus depreciation allowance was extended through 2009, potentially increasing cash flow for corporations by up to $30 million in 2009 or 2010. Some small corporations may benefit from the temporary extension of the refundable credit, but the current economic downturn is causing many to struggle and conserve cash. It is uncertain how many small C corporations will utilize the credit, as surviving ones are focused on cutting costs and staying afloat. In the current recession, small corporations are unlikely to invest in assets eligible for the bonus depreciation allowance, hindering the widespread use of the refundable credit. The Joint Committee on Taxation expects minimal revenue loss from the credit in 2009, projecting a total loss of $20 million in FY2009, $984 million in FY2010, and $875 million from FY2009 to FY2013. This suggests that only a limited number of corporations will benefit from the extended refundable credit. Title X of the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (COBRA, P.L. 99-272) allows individuals to continue their employer-sponsored health insurance for up to 18 months after certain employment or family status changes. Employers with 20 or more full-time employees offering group health insurance must provide continued coverage for qualified events like job loss or reduced work hours. Non-compliance results in a $100 excise tax per day. Eligible beneficiaries have 60 days to elect COBRA coverage after losing coverage. Less than 33 corporations are projected to benefit from the credit in FY2010. An eligible beneficiary must elect COBRA coverage within 60 days of losing coverage under an employer-sponsored health plan due to a qualifying event. Employers could previously charge the full premium plus a 2% administrative fee. Coverage can last up to 18 months and may be extended. Not all workers are eligible for COBRA, such as employees of firms with fewer than 20 employees or those without health insurance. Employees who lose their jobs due to their employer going out of business or their firm stopping health insurance coverage do not qualify for COBRA. The high cost of COBRA premiums, especially for families, may explain the low participation rate among eligible unemployed individuals. To help those laid off during the recession, Congress added a provision to ARRA to subsidize COBRA costs. The ARRA provision subsidizes 65% of COBRA coverage costs for up to nine months for eligible beneficiaries with a MAGI below $125,000 for single filers and $250,000 for joint filers in 2009. The subsidy phases out for higher incomes and is not available for single filers with MAGIs of $145,000 or more. Former employers are required to pay the remaining 35% of the premium, reimbursed by the federal government through tax credits or refunds. The ARRA provision subsidizes 65% of COBRA coverage costs for up to nine months for eligible beneficiaries with a MAGI below $125,000 for single filers and $250,000 for joint filers in 2009. The subsidy phases out for higher incomes and is not available for single filers with MAGIs of $145,000 or more. Qualified individuals must have involuntarily lost their jobs between September 1, 2009, and December 31, 2009. The subsidy applies to up to nine months of COBRA coverage that commences on or after February 17, 2009; it does not apply to coverage that began before the enactment of ARRA. If a qualified person gains access to other group insurance coverage or becomes eligible for Medicare during those nine months, he or she is no longer eligible for the subsidy. There are separate enrollment periods for two groups of unemployed individuals who were involuntarily terminated on or after September 1, 2008. One pertains to qualified individuals who did not elect COBRA coverage when they lost their jobs; the other covers individuals who chose the coverage after September 1 and before February 17, 2009, but discontinued it because it proved unaffordable. Employers notify eligible individuals for COBRA subsidy. 18-month eligibility based on job loss date. Uncertain uptake of subsidy. Workers may find COBRA cost burdensome. With subsidy, pay 35% of COBRA cost. After subsidy ends, pay 102% of premium. After the nine-month subsidy ends, unemployed individuals must pay 102% of the premium for COBRA coverage until their 18-month eligibility expires. Small firms may struggle with cash flow due to added strains from making COBRA payments. The COBRA subsidy requires firms to pay for a share of the cost of coverage not covered by former employees. Delays in reimbursement could lead to cash flow issues for small firms. The JCT estimates a $24.8 billion revenue loss from FY2009 to FY2013 due to the subsidy. Individuals must calculate their income tax liability under both regular tax and the AMT, paying the greater amount. The Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) is calculated based on a taxpayer's alternative minimum taxable income (AMTI), with rates of 26% and 28%. Long-term capital gains and dividends are taxed at a maximum rate of 15%. AMTI is derived from regular taxable income with adjustments and tax preferences. Various tax preferences and deductions impact AMTI, either increasing or decreasing it. The Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) is calculated based on a taxpayer's alternative minimum taxable income (AMTI), with rates of 26% and 28%. Differences between depreciation rates, denial of certain deductions, and excess of fair market value over received amount on stock options impact AMTI. Personal exemptions and standard deductions for regular taxable income do not affect AMTI. Exemption amounts vary based on filing status, with scheduled changes in 2010. The Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) exemption thresholds are $33,750 for unmarried single filers and phase out at $150,000 for joint filers and $112,500 for single filers. The exemption is reduced by 25% of the amount by which a taxpayer's AMTI exceeds these thresholds. Various personal and business credits can reduce AMT liability, some permanently (e.g., child tax credit) and others temporarily. An AMT credit can be carried forward indefinitely to offset regular income tax in future years. The Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) credit can be carried forward indefinitely to prevent double taxation of income from tax preferences. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) raised the AMT exemption for married couples and unmarried single filers in 2009. ARRA also extended a rule allowing taxpayers to use non-refundable personal tax credits to the full extent of their regular tax and AMT liabilities through 2009. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) raised the AMT exemption in 2009, reducing the overall burden of the AMT during a recession. Not adopting an AMT patch for 2009 could have affected 26 million individual taxpayers. This would result in higher taxes for those above exemption amounts under the AMT compared to regular tax rates. In 2007, 19% of individual taxpayers with small business income paid the AMT at a rate of 26%, benefiting higher-income taxpayers. It is uncertain how many small business owners would benefit from these provisions."
