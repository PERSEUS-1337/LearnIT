    "content": "Hundreds of thousands of businesses provide supplies, equipment, and services to federal agencies through procurement contracts each year. The federal government relies on Dun & Bradstreet's Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) to accurately identify government contractors with unique \"DUNS numbers\". This system has been used since the early 1990s to facilitate the procurement process and ensure transparency in federal government procurement. The federal government has been using DUNS since the early 1990s for identification purposes. Recently, there has been a shift towards exploring alternatives to DUNS numbers to contain costs, acquire a nonproprietary system, ensure data access, and promote transparency. Legislative initiatives like the FFATA and DATA Act reflect this change in perspective. The federal government is exploring alternatives to the DUNS numbering system, with efforts by the GSA, OMB, and Treasury Department. The CAGE system is being considered as a potential replacement or hybrid option. This shift is driven by the need to reduce costs, ensure data access, and promote transparency in government identification systems. The report focuses on DUNS numbers for government contractors, not taxpayer identification numbers. DUNS numbers are a unique global business identification system created by Dun & Bradstreet in 1963, consisting of nine-digit non-indicative numbering sequences assigned at the lowest organizational level. The lowest organizational level for DUNS numbers is a unique business location with its own number that does not expire. Entities need a DUNS number to register in the System for Award Management (SAM) for government contracts. SAM is the primary repository for federal awardee information. A DUNS number is required for government contracts and can be obtained online for free. It uniquely identifies contractor entities and provides business-related information such as number of employees, sales volume, and credit rating. The Department of Defense (DOD) created the CAGE system between 1945 and 1950 to catalog various items and identify vendors. The CAGE Branch of the Defense Logistics Agency assigns CAGE codes, which are five-character alpha-numeric identifiers, to entities in the United States. Similar to DUNS numbers, some contractors may have the same or similar names. The CAGE system, created by the Department of Defense, assigns unique five-character alpha-numeric codes to entities in the United States. These codes are assigned per legal entity at individual physical addresses to avoid duplication. Obtaining a CAGE code is free, and it is used in conjunction with DUNS numbers to facilitate government procurement processes. D&B provides products and services integral to government procurement, with DUNS numbers helping to uniquely identify entities and verify contracts. The GSA awarded a sole source contract to Dun & Bradstreet for the use of its Data Universal Numbering System, with a three-year base period and five one-year option periods. The contract's effective date was June 30, 2010, with an estimated completion date of June 29, 2018 if all option periods are exercised. The GSA awarded a sole source contract to Dun & Bradstreet for the use of its Data Universal Numbering System, with a total value of $135,111,119.67 if all option periods are exercised. Concerns about costs and alternatives to DUNS were raised in a 2012 GAO report. GSA explains the reliance on DUNS numbers for identifying federal contractors. The GSA awarded a sole source contract to Dun & Bradstreet for the use of its Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS). D&B is the only source for this information, providing critical services not licensed to third parties. The federal government relies on D&B services for data standards, quality, and reliability in contract award and management. The GSA awarded a sole source contract to Dun & Bradstreet for essential services including data management, public reporting, vendor submissions, past performance collection, and payment processing. D&B is uniquely positioned to provide these services, as listed in the procurement documentation. The GSA awarded a sole source contract to Dun & Bradstreet for essential services, including 14 data products required by GSA. These products enable file transfer, information integration using DUNS numbers, and business verification. GAO's 2012 report highlighted issues with the government's reliance on DUNS. GSA believes D&B has a monopoly due to the regulatory requirement for DUNS numbers, leading to higher costs and proprietary restrictions on GSA's use of DUNS numbers. The GSA's contract with Dun & Bradstreet includes restrictions on the use of D&B data, such as deleting certain information at the end of the contract. GSA considered options to either continue using DUNS numbers or switch to a government-owned numbering system. The GSA considered replacing DUNS numbers with a government-owned system for long-term cost savings and greater transparency. Anticipated changes include establishing a registration process, adding data verification capabilities, and modifying data fields. Replacing DUNS numbers with a new government-owned system would require agencies to update data fields and formats in their systems, modify policies and procedures, and potentially face challenges due to data restrictions and contractual agreements with Dun & Bradstreet. This process would involve removing DUNS information and replacing it with data from the new system, which could complicate the transition. Additionally, agencies would need to update their FAR supplements and acquisition-related documents to reflect the change. The federal government relies heavily on D&B's DUNS system, with approximately 80 data systems containing DUNS information that would need to be modified in the event of a transition to a new numbering system. The DATA Act, enacted in 2014, mandates the use of unique identifiers for entities receiving federal awards, with the Department of the Treasury and OMB naming this data element the awardee/recipient unique identifier. The federal government is considering alternatives to the Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) and exploring new identification systems for federal awards. The Department of the Treasury and OMB are working on selecting a new identifier system that will meet government needs. The federal government, in collaboration with various agencies, is exploring potential alternatives to the current entity identifier system, including soliciting information from private companies, nonprofits, and federal government providers. The analysis of alternatives will consider costs, implementation considerations, and protections for federal taxpayers, with completion expected in FY2017. The analysis of alternatives for the current entity identifier system is expected to be finished in FY2017. D&B provides essential services for federal acquisition processes and individual agencies, including the FBI and DSS. Their solutions are used by various government agencies to monitor businesses and supply chains, especially in industries like nuclear, chemical, and biological. During FY2011-FY2015, 39 agencies did business with Dun & Bradstreet, with potential impacts on other agencies if GSA were to switch to a new system. A final rule in September 2016 removed references to DUNS numbers in the FAR, replacing them with unique entity identifiers. The rationale for replacing DUNS numbers with unique entity identifiers is to increase competition and reduce costs to taxpayers. GSA posted a request for information in February 2017 for entity identification and validation services. GSA is in need of entity identification and validation services after the expiration of its contract with Dun & Bradstreet in June 2018. They have received responses from industry stakeholders and plan to issue a solicitation for these services in summer 2017. The executive branch-wide requirement for contractors to obtain a CAGE code was established in 2014. Prior to contract award, entities must be registered in SAM or have a DUNS Number as per the solicitation. A CAGE code will be assigned to entities required to register in SAM but do not have one. Entities must also provide names and CAGE codes of immediate and highest-level owners. Immediate owner has direct control over the offeror, while highest-level owner owns or controls the immediate owner. The rule adopted in May 2014 explains the use of CAGE codes in the procurement process, comparing it with DUNS. CAGE codes facilitate data exchange, identify contractor entities, and indicate ownership relationships. The use of CAGE codes promotes transparency and supports business implementation. The use of CAGE codes promotes transparency in federal spending patterns, contractor personnel, and supply chain traceability. The final rule establishes a Government-managed unique identifier under NATO rules, allowing contractors to provide correct information. GSA awarded a sole source contract to Dun & Bradstreet for the use of its Data Universal Numbering System, citing FAR regulations. The contract includes software like Data Integration Toolkit and Data Integration Batch for real-time data access and integration. The Data Integration Batch (DIB) and Integration Manager (IM) interface with D&B to deliver data via the Internet. The Toolkit Address Standardization (TAS) Module standardizes BV data packets for CCR registration. The BV data packet is used for CCR registration. ValiCert Secure Transport Client ensures secure data transfer within the DIB. The DITK Monitoring Module monitors changes in data packets. Bulk Data Exchange uses file transfer protocol for DIB processing. BV Packet verifies DUNS Number and business information. BV Monitoring tracks registered DUNS Numbers. WorldBase Marketing Plus with Linkage Packet is also mentioned. The curr_chunk includes information about various data packets used for corporate linkage monitoring in CCR, such as WorldBase Marketing Plus with Linkage Packet, Family Tree Enhanced Linkage Packet, US Corporate Linkage Monitoring, CCR Corporate Linkage File, Prior DUNS file, and Executive Branch File for FedReg system. The curr_chunk provides details about different files and services related to corporate linkage monitoring in the FedReg system, including Legislative/Judicial File, IM Reference File, IM Append File, IM Linkage Webservice, ARRA Reference File, and ARRA Batch & Exception File. The curr_chunk discusses the use of a generic entity identifier for reporting contract award data under specific circumstances, such as contracts valued at $30,000 or less awarded to certain individuals or entities located outside the United States. The use of a generic entity identifier is discussed for reporting contract award data under specific circumstances, such as contracts valued at less than $30,000 awarded to individuals or entities outside the United States. The General Services Administration's Integrated Award Environment (IAE) program office maintains and assigns these identifiers to protect the identity of contractors while ensuring accounting of obligations. However, using generic identifiers limits transparency and contractor access to reporting requirements. The use of a generic DUNS number for reporting contract award data should be limited to necessary actions, as it hinders transparency and contractor access to reporting requirements. A CAGE code is not needed for acquisitions funded by agencies other than DOD or NASA involving a generic DUNS number."
