Experiments show that it consistently outperforms existing methods in various datasets. The text introduces a metric learning model for multivariate time series using a convolutional neural network to embed time series in Euclidean space, resulting in a highly effective and simple metric. This approach has shown to outperform traditional techniques in distance measure calculation. Time series present unique challenges for metric learning due to a lack of labeled data and large corpora, making embedding them effectively a non-trivial task. Time series data poses challenges for metric learning due to limited labeled data and large corpora, making effective embedding a complex task. The presence of extraneous data within time series can lead to inefficiencies in computing distances, requiring algorithms to be efficient in processing each window of data. An effective time series distance metric must be efficient, simple, and accurate. Jiffy, a time series metric learning method, meets these criteria by being fast, easy to understand, and consistently outperforming existing methods. The paper introduces Jiffy, a time series metric learning method that aims to efficiently measure similarity between time series data by learning an embedding into a fixed-size vector space and using the Euclidean distance on the embedded vectors. The approach involves defining relevant terms, framing the problem, stating assumptions, and presenting results. Jiffy relies on two key assumptions for the time series being embedded: 1) they are primarily explained by one class, and 2) the dataset is not too small in terms of number or length of time series. The Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distance measure is commonly used for time series analysis. It involves aligning two time series using dynamic programming and then computing the Euclidean distance between them. DTW is efficient for similarity search despite its worst-case quadratic time complexity. For small datasets, traditional distance measures like DTW are recommended. The Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distance measure is commonly used for time series analysis, with various handcrafted measures like Uniform Scaling Distance, Scaled Warped Matching Distance, and Shotgun Distance. These measures are defined for univariate time series, and generalizing them to multivariate time series is challenging. Symbolic Aggregate Approximation (SAX) and its derivatives are common discretization techniques for time series representation. The current state-of-the-art techniques for time series analysis involve low-pass filtering, downsampling, and quantization to treat them as strings. Alternative methods include Adaptive Piecewise Constant Approximation and Piecewise Aggregate Approximation, which approximate time series as sequences of low-order polynomials. Metric learning is a promising approach to hand-crafted representations and distance functions for time series. Recent advancements in time series analysis include methods such as BID40 and BID33, which use data-dependent constraints and Mahalanobis distance to improve DTW accuracy. BID9 combines large-margin classification with sampling to create a DTW-like distance obeying the triangle inequality. Another approach involves embedding time series into Euclidean space using recurrent neural networks in a Siamese architecture, optimizing embeddings for positive inner products within the same class and negative inner products across different classes.

Another approach involves embedding time series into Euclidean space using recurrent neural networks in a Siamese architecture, optimizing embeddings for positive inner products within the same class and negative inner products across different classes. On the other hand, a method like BID0 trains a Siamese, single-layer CNN to embed time series in a space where pairwise Euclidean distances approximate pairwise DTW distances. BID30 optimizes a similar objective by sampling pairwise distances and using matrix factorization to construct feature representations for the training set. These methods aim to solve similar problems as Jiffy but produce lower quality metrics experimentally. The metric is learned by embedding time series into a vector space and comparing resulting vectors using the Euclidean distance, with an architecture consisting of a convolutional layer, maxpooling layer, and a fully connected layer. The network architecture consists of a convolutional layer, maxpooling layer, and a fully connected layer. One-dimensional filters are used for convolving over all time steps in time series data. The maxpooling layer helps the network handle translational noise in the input. The network architecture includes one-dimensional filters for convolving over time series data, followed by maxpooling to downsample and denoise the input signal. The final fully connected layer is fed with the downsampled data. Training involves appending a softmax layer and using cross-entropy loss with the ADAM optimizer. Traditional metric learning loss functions were experimented with but did not significantly impact training.

In terms of complexity analysis, the time to generate the embedding is \u0398(T DF (K + L)), with the distance computation between two time series requiring \u0398(L) time.

The final fully connected layer is fed with the downsampled data. Training involves appending a softmax layer and using cross-entropy loss with the ADAM optimizer. Traditional metric learning loss functions were experimented with but did not significantly impact training. The computation is dominated by the fully connected layer when embeddings can be generated ahead of time, enabling a significant speedup. Jiffy-produced embeddings are evaluated through 1-nearest-neighbor classification to assess similarity between time series with the same label.

It compares various approaches to time series metric learning, such as MDDTW and Siamese RNN. The Siamese CNN is a successful approach in computer vision tasks. Generalizing DTW to multivariate time series can be done through DTW-I and DTW-D methods. Zero padding can be used to obtain a fixed-size vector representation of a multivariate time series. One method to obtain a fixed-size vector representation of a multivariate time series is through zero-padding or upsampling to match the length of the longest time series. Results show that the Jiffy method outperforms other comparison methods in terms of classification accuracy and consistency across datasets. The Jiffy method demonstrates consistent performance across datasets, with a standard deviation in accuracy of 0.026, outperforming DTWI and MDDTW. It generalizes well across domains and requires minimal hyperparameter modification for good performance on new datasets. An embedding layer of 40 neurons is sufficient for peak accuracy. The Jiffy method shows consistent performance across datasets, outperforming DTWI and MDDTW with an embedding layer of 40 neurons for peak accuracy. The effect of fully connected layer size and max pooling on model accuracy is explored, with findings showing that optimal pooling levels fall in the 10-25% range. Jiffy is a metric learning approach for measuring multivariate time series similarity, with consistent and accurate classification performance. It shows resilience to hyperparameter choices and performs well across different domains. Future work includes extending the approach to multi-label classification and unsupervised learning, as well as improving speed by modifying the fully connected layer."
