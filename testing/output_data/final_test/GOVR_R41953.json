    "content": "The analysis below estimates the value of tax incentives for energy production using fossil and renewable resources. Data limitations prevent a precise comparison of subsidies per unit of production across different energy sources. Many tax incentives for energy resources aim to encourage investment rather than production, such as expensing intangible drilling costs for oil and gas. Federal financial support levels may reflect various policy rationales for interventions in energy markets. Tax expenditure data provides estimates of the value of these incentives. Tax expenditure data from the Joint Committee on Taxation provides estimates of federal revenue loss associated with specific provisions, not specific to energy sources. Many tax incentives for energy resources are not energy-specific, benefiting a variety of technologies. The U.S. energy sector benefits from tax provisions that are not energy-specific, such as the production activities deduction. Certain energy-related activities may also benefit from tax incentives available to non-energy industries. The Energy Information Administration provides data on U.S. primary energy production, defining primary energy as naturally occurring energy before conversion into end-use products. Coal and natural gas were the largest sources of primary energy production in the U.S. in 2013, accounting for 24.4% and 30.5% respectively. Fossil energy sources made up 78.5% of the total production, with crude oil contributing 19.3%. Nuclear electric energy accounted for 10.1%, while renewables, including hydro-electric power, made up 11.4% of the primary energy production. Excluding hydro-electric power, renewables constituted approximately 8.2% of the total production in 2013. Biomass was the largest source of renewable energy production. In 2013, biomass was the largest source of renewable energy production, accounting for 5.6% of overall primary energy production. Hydro-electric power followed at 3.1%, while wind, geothermal, and solar accounted for 1.9%, 0.3%, and 0.4% respectively. Biomass was used for biofuels and biopower, with 43.4% used for biofuels. The energy sector receives targeted tax incentives to support its growth. The energy sector benefits from targeted tax incentives and broader tax provisions available for both energy and non-energy-related taxpayers. Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) tax expenditure estimates are used to calculate federal revenue losses associated with energy tax provisions, which are projected rather than based on actual economic conditions. The JCT advises against simply summing individual tax expenditures to estimate aggregate revenue loss from multiple tax provisions. The interaction effects of individual tax provisions make it difficult to accurately estimate the aggregate revenue loss from multiple tax provisions. Summing individual tax expenditures may lead to different revenue loss estimates due to these interaction effects. Therefore, total tax expenditure figures for energy-related tax provisions should be viewed as estimates rather than actual federal revenue losses. Between 2010 and 2014, energy-related tax provisions provided financial support to the energy sector, with estimated amounts of $20.0 billion in 2010, $22.7 billion in 2011, $24.2 billion in 2012, $23.3 billion in 2013, and $16.7 billion in 2014. The cost of excise tax credits for alcohol fuels decreased in 2012 due to the expiration of primary tax incentives for ethanol, offset by increased outlays for Section 1603 grants. In 2013, $8.1 billion was attributed to Section 1603 grants for renewables. The two largest energy-related provisions expired at the end of 2011. The Section 1603 grants in lieu of tax credits program cost $24.0 billion between 2010 and 2014, while excise tax credits for alcohol fuels cost $15.8 billion. The expiration of energy-related tax incentives led to a projected shift in energy tax incentives balance. In 2014, tax incentives for renewables made up 52.8% of total revenue loss, compared to 26.8% for fossil-fuels-related tax incentives. During 2013, 78.5% of U.S. primary energy production came from fossil fuels, with 20.4% of federal tax incentives supporting them. Renewable sources accounted for 11.4% of energy production, receiving 57.4% of tax incentives. Hydro-electric power, mostly established before 1980, is not included in the renewable category for tax benefits. In 2013, non-hydro renewables accounted for 8.2% of primary energy production in the U.S. Certain tax benefits supported the development of hydro-electric facilities, including clean renewable energy bonds (CREBs) and renewable energy production tax credits. Smaller hydro projects have the potential to increase U.S. hydro-electric generation capacity. In 2013, non-hydro renewables made up 8.2% of U.S. primary energy production. Tax incentives supported hydro-electric facilities. Excluding biofuels from analysis reduces renewables' share of tax incentives from 57.4% to 50.5%. Excluding biofuels has a smaller impact on renewables' share of primary energy production. In 2013, excluding biofuels reduces the share of primary energy produced from renewables by 2.5 percentage points, from 11.4% to 8.9%. Nuclear resources accounted for 10.1% of primary energy produced, with a tax benefit for nuclear decommissioning reserve funds. This tax expenditure was $1.1 billion in 2013, representing 4.7% of all energy-related tax expenditures analyzed. The special tax rate for nuclear decommissioning reserve funds reduces the cost of investing in nuclear energy by taxing income at a preferred rate of 20%. From the 1980s through 2011, federal financial support for renewable energy mainly focused on alcohol fuels like ethanol. Tax credits for biodiesel and renewable diesel were introduced in 2008 but expired in 2014. There are currently no projected costs for tax incentives for renewable fuels, but they may be extended as part of \"tax extenders.\" The costs for renewable electricity incentives increased from the mid-2000s, with Section 1603 grants playing a significant role from 2009 onwards. The Section 1603 grants in lieu of tax credit program, which supported renewable electricity, ended for projects starting after December 31, 2011. Outlays under this program are expected to continue through 2017. Revenue losses for energy efficiency tax incentives are projected to decline through 2018, with most of the increase in losses between 2008 and 2014 related to incentives for homeowners. The primary tax incentive for energy efficiency improvements to existing homes expired in 2014, and extending expired incentives would increase costs. The projected cost of energy-related tax incentives in the out years is mainly due to expired or expiring provisions. For example, the Section 1603 grant program costs will continue past its 2011 expiration date as outlays occur when property is placed in service. The renewable energy production tax credit (PTC) is available for the first 10 years of production from a qualified facility, allowing property placed in service in 2012 to claim credits through 2022. Even after the PTC for wind expired in 2014, wind energy facilities under construction before then can still receive production credits for 10 years. Revenue losses from tax provisions can extend beyond expiration dates. Between 2013 and 2018, the cost of tax-related provisions supporting renewable energy is projected to decline from $13.4 billion to $5.0 billion. The majority of the $5.0 billion cost in 2018 is associated with the expired PTC for wind, which will no longer be available for new investments in renewable electricity. $4.0 billion of the projected cost for renewable electricity provisions in 2018 is from expired incentives, while $1.0 billion is from incentives available for new projects in 2018. The cost of tax provisions supporting fossil fuels is projected to be $4.8 billion in 2018, with most incentives being permanent features of the tax code. Studies have analyzed federal financial support for various energy resources, comparing subsidies relative to energy produced. The Energy Information Administration (EIA) has conducted studies on energy and electricity production subsidies, including spending on direct expenditures, federal loan guarantees, and tax expenditures. The analysis focuses on subsidies provided through the tax code. The EIA's analysis on energy subsidies focuses on tax-related provisions, including Section 1603 grants in lieu of tax credits. They estimate energy subsidies per unit of electricity production by categorizing subsidies supporting electricity production and other energy uses, allocating them by fuel type to determine the share of electricity or energy attributable to specific fuels. The EIA analyzes energy subsidies by determining the share of electricity attributable to specific fuels relative to federal financial support. Coal remains the largest fuel source for electricity but receives a small share of federal incentives. Natural gas and petroleum liquids have seen an increase in electricity production share in recent years. Between 2007 and 2013, the share of electricity produced using natural gas and petroleum liquids increased, while the share of federal financial support for nuclear decreased. The share of electricity from renewables also increased during this period. In 2013, 72.0% of federal financial support for electricity went to renewables, largely due to the Section 1603 grants program. EIA estimates that $5.2 billion of total energy-related subsidies in 2013 supported fuels outside the electric-power sector. In 2013, $5.2 billion of total energy-related subsidies supported fuels outside the electric-power sector, with most going to natural gas and petroleum liquids. Federal financial incentives for energy not related to electricity production declined from $10.4 billion in 2010 to $5.2 billion in 2013. Federal financial incentives for non-electricity fuels, particularly biofuels, decreased from $10.4 billion in 2010 to $5.2 billion in 2013. The support for non-electricity biomass and biofuels also decreased from $7.6 billion to $2.3 billion during the same period. The share of non-electricity energy production from biomass or biofuels declined from 10.9% to 9.5% between 2010 and 2013. Despite reductions in incentives for biofuels, a significant portion of federal financial support for non-electricity fuels continued to go to biofuels in 2013. However, the distribution of federal financial support for energy may not align with energy production across various resources due to energy policy goals. The majority of energy production in the United States comes from fossil sources, but recent tax incentives have favored renewable energy. Federal financial support for renewables exceeds support for fossil fuels, but support for renewables has decreased as key tax provisions have expired. The variation in support aligns with different environmental and economic objectives, such as reducing reliance on imported petroleum for energy security. Energy tax incentives support renewable energy resources and emerging technologies, aligning with environmental objectives. The proportion of energy-related tax incentives benefiting renewables increased from 2009 to 2010. Analysis of federal financial support for different energy technologies is essential for evaluating energy tax policy. In 2009, 77.4% of energy-related tax incentives benefitted renewables, but by 2010, this share declined to 68.1% due to \"black liquor\" qualifying for tax incentives. The estimated cost of tax credits for alcohol fuels was much higher in 2009 compared to 2010. Changes in tax expenditure estimates can lead to fluctuations in the proportion of energy-related tax incentives for different energy resources. The total tax incentives for renewables excluding hydro-power are slightly lower than when including hydro-power. JCT estimates that in 2010, tax expenditures for qualified hydropower under the PTC are less than $50 million. In 2010, tax expenditures for qualified hydropower under the PTC were less than $50 million. Two awards totaling $88,000 were paid to hydropower facilities under the Section 1603 grant program. Hydropower received less CREB financing compared to solar and wind technologies. The tax expenditure for CREBs in 2010 was estimated at $0.1 billion across all technologies. Effective tax rates can influence incentives for capital investment. The 2010 study analyzed energy-related tax incentives and investment using the 2007 tax code. It highlighted incentives for energy investment and production. Effective tax rates measure the impact of the tax system on investment decisions. The effective tax rate for energy-related capital investments is influenced by various provisions in the tax code, such as depreciation rules, investment incentives, and specific tax rules for the oil and gas sector. A project must have a real before-tax rate of return of 9% to cover taxes, depreciation, and payments to investors, with an effective tax rate of 33%. Negative effective tax rates indicate that the tax code may be subsidizing investments. Effective tax rates in the energy sector provide strong incentives for capital investments in solar and wind energy resources. In 2007, solar benefitted from a 30% investment tax credit and five-year accelerated depreciation, resulting in an estimated effective tax rate of -244.7%. Wind, with the production tax credit and accelerated depreciation, faced an effective tax rate of -163.8%. These rates suggest that the tax code favors direct capital investment in renewables and nuclear over coal and gas. Tax incentives strongly influence energy-related investments, with wind capacity investment being notably affected by tax policy. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 introduced a production tax credit for new commercial nuclear reactors, but new nuclear facilities have been slow to develop despite incentives. Various tax incentives in the oil and gas industry also impact effective tax rates on investments, with non-integrated firms benefiting from lower rates compared to integrated firms. Non-integrated oil and gas firms benefit from tax incentives like fully expensing intangible drilling costs and percentage depletion, while integrated producers can only expense 70% of IDCs and must claim cost depletion."
