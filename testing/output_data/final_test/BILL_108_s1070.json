The Act allows qualified headquarters activities of eligible foreign corporations in the New York Liberty Zone to be treated as conducted outside the US for tax purposes. The Act allows eligible foreign corporations to relocate qualified headquarters activities to the New York Liberty Zone under certain conditions, including entering into a contract before September 11, 2007, and transferring activities before September 11, 2009. The Act permits eligible foreign corporations to move qualified headquarters activities to the New York Liberty Zone by meeting specific requirements, including transferring a substantial part of activities previously performed for its affiliated group.

To qualify, the corporation must have at least 50 percent of senior officers and senior business development personnel located in the zone. The Act allows eligible foreign corporations to relocate headquarters activities to the New York Liberty Zone by meeting criteria related to the number of employees in the zone. If the requirements are met and continue to be met for a 2-year period, individuals located in the United States during the 1-year period ending on the date the requirements are first met or the date the employee is first located in the New York Liberty Zone will not be taken into account. An eligible foreign corporation can relocate headquarters activities to the New York Liberty Zone by meeting specific criteria. Employees located in the zone or the United States are determined based on where their services are primarily performed. An eligible foreign corporation in an expanded affiliated group must provide gross revenue information for qualified headquarters activities to the Secretary. Qualified headquarters activities include ownership, management, and treasury functions within the group. The eligible foreign corporation in an expanded affiliated group must provide gross revenue information for qualified headquarters activities to the Secretary, including treasury functions such as borrowing funds, financing group members, and investing corporate funds. Marketing, branding, senior business management, and other related activities are also included. Activities previously conducted in the United States are not part of this requirement. The eligible foreign corporation in an expanded affiliated group must provide gross revenue information for qualified headquarters activities to the Secretary. This excludes any activity conducted through an office or fixed place of business in the United States in the past 3 years. Exception is made for activities related to a qualified headquarters relocation. The exclusion ceases if the activity is not conducted in the United States for 5 years, specifically in the New York Liberty Zone. This applies to the first taxable year after a consecutive 5-year period ends. The exclusion period begins after meeting subsection (b)(1)(B) requirements and ends if the eligible foreign corporation or its group did not engage in the activity in the US through an office. Special rules apply for acquired entities engaging in the activity through a fixed place of business. If an acquired entity had a fixed place of business in the US within the 1-year period before becoming part of the eligible foreign corporation's group, that activity will be considered as being carried out by the foreign corporation. The term 'acquired entity' refers to any corporation that meets the requirements of subsection (b)(1)(B). If an activity is not conducted in the United States for 5 years, the date the acquired entity joined the eligible foreign corporation's group is used for applying clause (iii) instead of the first day the requirements are met. The term 'acquired entity' refers to a corporation or partnership that becomes a member of the eligible foreign corporation's expanded affiliated group after meeting the requirements of subsection (b)(1)(B). Activities conducted by a predecessor or related person with respect to a member of an expanded affiliated group are treated as conducted by the member. The corporation may face tax recapture if it fails to conduct qualified headquarters activities or meet certain requirements. The Secretary can waive this for minor, unintentional failures corrected promptly. Additionally, eligible foreign corporations may face additional tax if they no longer qualify under certain conditions. The eligible foreign corporation may face a tax recapture if it fails to meet certain requirements, with the recapture amount being the sum of qualified tax benefits multiplied by a recapture percentage for the preceding 4 taxable years. The recapture percentage for the preceding 4 taxable years is as follows: 80% for the immediately preceding year, 60% for the second preceding year, 40% for the third preceding year, and 20% for the fourth preceding year. Qualified tax benefits are defined as the excess of the tax liability a foreign corporation would have had under certain conditions.
