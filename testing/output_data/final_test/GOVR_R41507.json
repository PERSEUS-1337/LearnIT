    "content": "The energy sector in the United States is the fastest-growing water consumer, with projections attributing 85% of the growth in domestic water consumption between 2005 and 2030 to this sector. The increasing demand for energy, development of domestic energy sources, and use of water-intensive energy alternatives are driving this growth. Water limitations in water-constrained regions may hinder some water-dependent energy activities, and current energy policy and investment choices will influence whether the energy sector exacerbates or alleviates future water tensions. Water limitations may hinder water-dependent energy activities in specific locations. More than 80% of U.S. electricity is generated at thermoelectric facilities, which are cooled with water. In 2005, water withdrawal for cooling represented 41% of water withdrawn nationally. The energy sector's water use affects national water use and can impact energy production and reliability. Climate change impacts on water supplies may worsen this vulnerability. Water availability can affect existing and new energy activities and economic activities dependent on energy production. The energy sector is evolving, with current federal policies contributing to rising water demand. Congress faces questions on the appropriate federal role in addressing energy's water needs. Little direct federal action is currently aimed at managing the energy sector's water demand, leaving responsibilities to energy interests, state, and local governments. The current division of responsibilities in the energy sector relies on energy interests and state and local governments to manage water demand and resolve conflicts. Federal policies are being questioned for their role in increasing water demand. Options for managing energy's water demand range from maintaining the current approach to taking various federal actions, such as minimizing growth in freshwater use through policy changes or legislation. Options for managing energy's water demand include changes to broad policies or targeted legislation, improving access to water for the energy sector, and investing in data and research for water-efficient technologies. Various legislative proposals in the 111th and 112th Congress address these options. The Secure Water Act of 2009 addresses energy's water use during congressional deliberations, focusing on factors shaping energy sector's water demand, vulnerability to water constraints, and projections of water use. Legislative proposals in the 111th and 112th Congress aim to manage energy's water demand through policy changes, improved access to water, and research on water-efficient technologies. The report discusses projections of energy's water use and explores regional examples such as shale gas in Texas, solar energy in the Southwest, and biofuels in the High Plains. It also covers policy options for managing energy's water use and mentions concerns over water quality impacts in the energy sector. Energy use by the water sector and water conservation are not addressed in the report. Increased emphasis on domestic energy production and meeting rising energy demand will lead to higher freshwater use by the energy sector. Shifting away from coal power plants in the electricity sector may impact water consumption, depending on alternative fuels or technologies. Carbon capture by electric utilities could also significantly increase water usage. Substituting wind for thermoelectric generation could reduce water demand but may pose challenges for energy reliability and transmission. Other impacts include the shift from food crops to energy crops in irrigated agriculture. These trends highlight the complex relationship between energy production and water usage. The energy sector's water demand growth in the future is uncertain and influenced by energy demand projections. The Energy Information Administration predicts a significant increase in electricity and liquid fuel consumption by 2030. Factors such as population growth and technology developments drive this demand. Population growth and increased electricity use per capita drive increasing demand for energy. Shifts to more water-intensive electricity generation or fuels could further increase energy's water demand, especially in regions like the Southwest, Northwest, and High Plains where water competition is already intense. The energy sector's vulnerability to water constraints is expected to grow as it becomes more water-intensive. The energy sector is becoming more water-intensive due to major energy trends. Water availability issues like regional drought and low streamflow can jeopardize energy production and reliability, particularly affecting electricity generation at thermoelectric facilities. Water scarcity may limit water-intensive alternatives for cooling in counties nationwide. Other impacts include reduced hydroelectric generation during droughts and decreased bioenergy yields due to weather extremes. Energy extraction activities like coal mining may also be scaled back to prevent water quality issues during low water conditions. Water constraints are a concern in the eastern United States, with diminished stream flows impacting thermoelectric facilities from New York to Arizona. Approximately 24 of the nation's 104 nuclear reactors are located in drought-prone regions, with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission setting minimum source water elevation levels for each plant to ensure operational safety. If cooling water sources fall below the minimum level or cannot meet thermal discharge thresholds, facilities are required to power down. In August 2007, a nuclear reactor at the Browns Ferry Nuclear Power Plant in Alabama shut down due to exceeding cooling water temperature regulations. In 2010, the plant reduced electricity production by 45% for the same reason, resulting in $50 million in extra costs. The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) initiated a $160 million upgrade to avoid future cooling constraints. Climate change may impact water quantity and timing, affecting thermoelectric facilities. Climate change researchers predict changes in water quantity and timing, with more rain and less snowfall expected. This will lead to seasonal water availability changes, including more frequent floods and droughts. These changes pose challenges for hydroelectric dam operations and power plants that require water for cooling. Climate change may also increase the demand for electricity and water for cooling purposes. Decreased runoff in certain regions would limit water availability for all uses, including the energy sector. The water resource impacts of climate change would exacerbate thermoelectric cooling constraints in the energy sector. Increased flood and storm hazards could disrupt fuel transport. Quantifying energy's water demand is limited by data gaps, hindering projections for future water use in the energy sector. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) has collected water use data every five years, but stopped collecting consumption data in 1995 due to funding constraints. This lack of data hinders projections for future water use in the energy sector. The USGS stopped collecting water consumption data in 1995 due to funding constraints, hindering projections for future water use in the energy sector. The Forest Service relies on USGS data for water resource forecasts, but limitations prevent accurate disaggregation of water use categories, including the energy sector. The analysis relies on comprehensive projections on the energy sector's water consumption, mainly from a 2010 article by Deborah Elcock at Argonne National Laboratory. Improved data and analysis are expected in the future, with the USGS conducting a Colorado River Basin study. Regional efforts, like the Western Governors' Association, may also influence decision-making. The Western Governors' Association initiated an energy-water nexus project in 2010 to assess water availability for renewable energy development in the West, considering drought and climate change implications. The project is expected to provide policy recommendations by late 2012, funded primarily by the DOE. U.S. freshwater consumption has surpassed historic levels and is projected to increase in the coming decades. The projected rise in water consumption is dominated by energy's use, exceeding municipal and industrial consumption. By 2030, water consumption is expected to increase by 7% above 2005 levels, with 85% of the growth attributed to the energy sector. Energy's water consumption in 2005 was 12 bgd and is estimated to increase to 18 bgd by 2030, with bioenergy accounting for 60% of the expansion. The anticipated expansion in water consumption is mainly driven by the energy sector, with bioenergy accounting for 60% of the increase. The total national increase in water consumption may seem small (7% over 25 years), but it is significant due to current water consumption levels surpassing previous highs. Water availability for the energy sector could potentially decrease water use in other sectors. The energy sector's water demand may decrease water use in agriculture. Nationally, water use for energy may be higher than shown in Figure 1. In Kansas, water diversion for biofuels and electric power generation was significant in 2008. Climate change could reduce water supplies, especially in drier regions like the West. Projections suggest that energy's demand for water may increase as water supply decreases, especially in the western near-coastal mountains. However, implementing water-efficient energy options could significantly reduce water consumption. A study by DOE's EERE found that transitioning to 20% wind energy by 2030 could save 1.2 bgd of water, with the Midwest/Great Plains benefiting the most. It is possible that current projections underestimate energy's water consumption due to unaccounted factors like carbon capture. Projections based on current trends may not account for factors like carbon capture or new energy technologies, leading to potential variations in water consumption. The majority of U.S. electric generation comes from fossil fuels, with coal, natural gas, nuclear, and hydroelectric sources making up the mix. In 2009, the generation mix consisted of 45% coal, 23% natural gas, 20% nuclear, 7% hydroelectric, less than 4% non-hydroelectric renewable generation, and less than 2% other sources. Carbon capture technologies in the fossil fuel industry can reduce carbon dioxide emissions but require investment and resources. These technologies consume energy and water, with water consumption for electric generation potentially increasing by 2030. Hydropower generation consumes water through increased evaporation at dams. Data on water consumption for hydroelectric generation is lacking, but evaporation from reservoirs indirectly depletes water supply. Evaporation from reservoirs due to hydropower generation varies based on geography and climate, with site-specific estimates needed for new hydroelectric projects. This evaporation can impact aquatic ecosystems and floodplains, but reservoirs also provide benefits like regulating streamflow and enhancing water availability for multiple functions. New reservoirs, such as pumped storage proposals, need to be studied to understand the impact of hydroelectric generation on water resources. Efficiency improvements or adding hydropower generation at existing facilities can increase electricity generation without raising water consumption from evaporation. The energy sector's water demand is expected to grow, especially in water-constrained areas, leading to competition and low flow conditions during summer and droughts. The West is likely to face significant constraints and conflicts in meeting this demand. Regional and local competition for water plays a crucial role in energy's water demand. Energy's water demand is significant, especially in water-constrained regions like California, Texas, and Arizona due to increased electricity generation. Various energy activities such as shale gas production, solar electricity generation, and biofuel production have regional water consumption concerns. Technologies exist to reduce water use in these activities, but they come with energy cost and reliability penalties. The benefits of water savings from adopting these technologies need to be weighed against these drawbacks. The expansion of shale gas development in the last decade is due to technological advances in horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing. Fracturing involves injecting water-based fluids into a well to release natural gas from rock formations. Little reliable data is available on the costs and benefits of adopting water-saving measures in different circumstances. Shale gas formations are found in various areas of the United States, bringing the oil and gas industry into communities. The expansion of shale gas development in the United States is bringing the oil and gas industry into communities unaccustomed to energy development. Water use is a key issue with the increasing extraction of gas, with freshwater preferred for drilling and fracturing. Water use is concentrated in the early stages of well development, with little to no water required once the well is producing. Data on water use per well is limited, with some information available from a DOE report in 2009 for four shale gas formations. Limited data from a 2009 DOE report shows water use for shale gas wells ranging from 2.7 to 3.9 million gallons per well. Chesapeake Energy data indicates 0.6 to 3.8 gallons of water per MMBtu produced. Shale gas has lower water use compared to other fuels like coal and nuclear for electricity production. The issue with natural gas is the concentration of wells in a limited area. The concentration of wells in a limited area can lead to significant water needs for drilling and fracturing operations, especially in areas with water constraints. Concerns have been raised in the Texas Barnett formation, where the number of new wells drilled annually has decreased, and water is now sourced from surface supplies purchased from municipal water utilities. The Barnett formation in the Fort Worth area of Texas may reach 7.5 billion gallons of natural gas production annually, representing 1.15% of local water consumption. Concerns about water sufficiency during drought conditions have led to scrutiny of all water uses, including shale gas. More than half of the produced water could be reused according to Texas A&M researcher C. J. Vavra. A&M researcher C. J. Vavra estimates that over half of produced water from shale gas operations could be reused, reducing the impact on local water supplies. Legislation like H.R. 469 aimed to support research on environmentally sustainable use of energy-related produced waters. Concerns include contamination of freshwater supplies, community disruption, and air pollution from truck traffic. Rising water demand for natural gas development in various states like Texas, Pennsylvania, New York, Arkansas, Wyoming, South Dakota, and North Dakota poses risks of contamination, community disruption, and air pollution from truck traffic. Water constraints in regions like the Southwest can impact the feasibility of concentrating solar power technologies. Concentrating solar power (CSP) uses ground-based arrays of mirrors to concentrate the sun's heat for electricity generation. CSP does not emit greenhouse gases but can raise water concerns due to its thermoelectric process. Large-scale deployment of CSP in the Southwest could significantly increase water demand in counties, even with water-efficient cooling technologies in place. Solar developers in the Southwest are adopting cooling alternatives like dry or hybrid cooling, using impaired waters, or purchasing water rights to reduce water usage. Some developers are also utilizing water-efficient solar technologies such as photovoltaic solar and dish engine CSP, which have minimal water requirements. However, these options come with tradeoffs like cost, land use, and dispatchability. In the Southwest, solar developers are using water-efficient technologies to reduce water usage, such as photovoltaic solar and dish engine CSP. Water availability shapes the technologies and costs of solar development, with biofuels in the High Plains also showing sensitivity to water quantity and quality. Federal energy policies can impact water use, especially with biofuels like corn-based ethanol that require irrigation. The High Plains, a low-rainfall area spanning several states, has been facing water supply issues for decades, including a declining aquifer level. The expansion of biofuels in this region is increasing water consumption, with concerns about irrigation demand and fertilizer use on new or marginal lands. In Colorado, a significant amount of treated water is used for biofuel production, exacerbating existing water competition. Expansion of biofuel crops on existing land could lead to increased irrigation demand and fertilizer application, raising concerns about water quantity and quality. Efforts are being made to find feedstocks that use fewer resources, such as dedicated biomass crops like switchgrass and hybrid poplars. Federal biofuels policies are focusing on developing a cellulosic biofuels industry to address these issues. Despite potential environmental benefits, concerns persist about the additional use of fertilizers and water resources that could be required to increase per-acre yields for cellulosic feedstocks. Land use pressure for expanded production also applies to cellulosic biomass feedstock, creating competition with land conservation programs. Technological and economic hurdles continue to prevent the cellulosic biofuels industry from developing to commercial scale production. The section discusses the federal role in managing water demand in the energy sector, questioning if states are unfairly burdened with increased water use due to federal policies. Congress must decide how to respond to energy's growing water demand and determine the appropriate entity to address it. The federal government currently has little direct action in managing the energy sector's water demand, leaving it to the industry and states. The issue may be addressed in the 112th Congress, with debates on the federal role in water allocation and costs. Factors like energy and climate debates also play a role in shaping opinions on legislation affecting energy's water demand. Possible actions to address the issue of energy's water demand include minimizing freshwater use through general energy policies, promoting activities that reduce water use in energy generation, making freshwater available for the energy sector, and improving data and analysis on energy's water use. The federal government has limited involvement in managing energy's water demand, with most decisions left to the industry and states. Improving data and analysis on energy's water use is crucial for decision-making and promoting water-efficient technological alternatives. These options are not mutually exclusive and may vary in appropriateness and cost for different sectors. Comparative analysis of policy options using multiple criteria is lacking. One challenge of a federal response to energy's water demand is the varying concerns, policy options, and technological options by region. The appropriate role of government at different levels influences perspectives on policy alternatives. Access to water for the energy sector may be difficult in water-scarce areas, especially with climate change affecting water availability. The federal government can influence state water laws and decisions regarding energy's water use, which some view as infringing on states' rights. Public sector influence on energy sector water use includes tax incentives, permits, and regulations at local, state, or federal levels. The federal role in water resource allocation increases with federal interest, especially in water-scarce areas impacted by climate change. The federal government's influence on water resource allocation increases with federal interest, especially in water-scarce areas impacted by climate change. Competing water demands, including those from the energy sector, are raising questions for federal agencies about the operations of federal facilities. The energy sector's increasing dependence on water is a major concern, leading to questions about using water from federal facilities for energy development. The energy sector's growing reliance on freshwater is a concern due to increasing demands from population growth and climate change. Federal policies play a significant role in shaping the energy sector's trajectory, including setting biofuel production targets. Stakeholders have raised concerns about meeting energy targets and policies, particularly regarding the availability of physical resources like water. The federal role in managing water resources for the energy sector raises questions about national security implications and the need for federal spending on energy and water efficiency measures. Concerns about water availability extend beyond energy to include agriculture, municipalities, and ecosystems. The federal government faces challenges in managing water resources to meet the demands of various sectors, including agriculture, municipalities, and ecosystems, especially during droughts and climate change impacts. Congress must consider the federal role in addressing energy's water demand while balancing state and private sector involvement in water use decisions. The federal government must address energy's water demand while balancing state and private sector involvement in water use decisions. Informed decisions require data on energy choices and policies across various parameters, but such assessments are currently lacking. Tables summarize freshwater impacts of transportation fuels and the electricity sector, highlighting the need for multi-variable assessments to understand the full implications of energy decisions. The report focuses on energy's water use and the tradeoffs in energy policy decisions. Different fuel and technologies for generating electricity have varying dispatchability, with thermoelectric facilities being advantageous for their ability to adjust electricity production based on demand. Hydropower, tidal, and wave energy production can be predictable but are subject to environmental conditions and restrictions. Advanced storage technologies are needed to address these challenges. The energy sector's consumptive water use is projected to increase from 6 billion gallons per day in 2005 to 10 bgd in 2030, mainly driven by bioenergy. The impact of bioenergy on water use was already evident between 2005 and 2010. Developing less-water intense bioenergy could potentially reduce water demand for transportation fuel. The projection covers water used for transportation and obtaining fossil fuels. Data shows irrigated biofuels consume significantly more water than other fuels. Trends in electricity generation contribute to increased water consumption, leading to local water challenges in water-constrained areas. Actions to reduce electricity's freshwater footprint are needed. The available data on electricity sector's water consumption focuses on thermoelectric cooling water needs, which dominate water use during generation. Alternative cooling options are discussed to reduce water use, along with tradeoffs between water use and other characteristics of electric generation from various sources like hydropower, solar, wind, and geothermal resources. The data and projections on water consumption in the mining, production, and processing of fuels for electricity generation are bundled with fossil fuels used in transportation. The projections for thermoelectric cooling come from the Elcock study based on NETL's 2007 report, limited to coal, natural gas, and nuclear-powered facilities. Analysis of electricity's total water consumption under different policies is lacking. No authoritative comparison of the various water intensities of electricity generation options exists. Figures show average water intensities for different electricity alternatives, with and without carbon mitigation using CCS. Data is imperfect and comes from multiple sources, raising questions about accuracy in comparisons across technologies. Newer power plants are moving away from once-through cooling due to withdrawal and water quality impacts, opting for evaporative cooling instead. Alternative cooling technologies like dry cooling, hybrid dry-wet cooling, and using fluids other than freshwater offer potential water savings. However, these alternatives come with their own costs and disadvantages. Dry cooling systems could reduce water consumption to around 80-90 gal/MWh for solar plants but have higher financial and efficiency costs compared to evaporative cooling systems. The cost of electricity from a dry cooled solar thermal plant may be 3% to 8% higher than a wet cooled plant due to higher cooling costs and lower generation efficiency. Dry cooling uses fans for steam condensation, resulting in less water usage but reduced electric generation efficiency. Electricity generation at a dry-cooled facility drops off at ambient temperatures above 100\u00b0F, leading to cost increases of 2% to 9% and a reduction in energy generation of 4.5% to 5%. Dry cooling's impact on cost and energy generation depends on the frequency of ambient temperatures above 100\u00b0F. Hybrid wet-dry cooling aims to balance water consumption with power generation efficiency, especially on hot days when electricity demand is high. The system combines dry and evaporative cooling, with evaporative cooling used only on hot days to reduce thermal efficiency losses from dry cooling. DOE's research found that a hybrid cooling system in the Southwest using 50% less water than evaporative cooling could maintain 99% of performance. A hybrid cooling system in the Southwest using 10% of the water of evaporative cooling can maintain 97% of energy performance. Employing alternative water sources for evaporative cooling, such as wastewater effluent or brackish groundwater, can reduce freshwater impacts but may require pretreatment. Research is ongoing to improve the viability of saline water cooling. Hydroelectric power is generated by water passing through turbines at dams, with relatively low greenhouse gas emissions but significant environmental effects. Dam building for hydropower development can harm river ecosystems and indigenous species. The assessment of brackish groundwater authorized by Section 9507 of P.L. 111-11 may enhance understanding of brackish cooling alternatives. The construction of new large dams for hydropower generation is controversial due to its harmful effects on river ecosystems and indigenous species. Efforts are now focused on smaller-scale opportunities, improved efficiency, and expansion of existing facilities to increase hydropower generation. The Electric Power Research Institute estimates a potential capacity hydropower gain of 10 GW by 2025 without the need for new large dams, with six western states having the highest potentials. Despite this potential, little additional hydropower generation has been installed in recent years due to various regulatory requirements. The number of applications for FERC preliminary permits for pumped storage has increased, but proposals have not advanced to construction. Renewable electricity technologies like wind and solar have minimal water requirements, but face constraints in transmission, cost, and regulatory factors. Wind and solar are intermittent electricity sources. Geothermal energy can be used for electricity generation, direct-use, and heat pumps. Wind and PV are intermittent electricity sources with limited storage options. Wind is less expensive than CSP, while PV is currently more expensive. For more information on wind technologies and policy issues, refer to CRS Report RL34546. Traditional geothermal power production utilizes hot rock formations to produce steam for turbines in a geothermal flash system. Lower temperature geothermal resources use a second working fluid heated by geothermal water in a binary system. Enhanced geothermal systems inject water into fractured rock to generate electricity. Dry cooling is standard for new geothermal facilities due to smaller plant sizes. Geothermal power plants are becoming the standard for new facilities, with smaller plants being easier to dry-cool. The US has enough geothermal resources to supply half of its electric generation needs, but enhanced geothermal systems require water injection. These systems can be used in coproduction with oil recovery to extend oil field lifespan. Research is ongoing to replace water with carbon dioxide as the working fluid to reduce water usage. Geothermal power plants are moving towards using carbon dioxide instead of water as the working fluid to reduce water usage and aid in carbon sequestration."
