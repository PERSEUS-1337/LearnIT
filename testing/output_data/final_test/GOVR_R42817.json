    "content": "From the inception of the American federal government, Congress has required executive branch agencies to make certain information and records publicly available to ensure transparency. James Madison emphasized the importance of information access in democratic governance. Congress balances the need for transparency with the protection of certain government actions and records. Certain government actions and records are protected from public release for national security and personal privacy reasons. President George Washington emphasized the importance of secrecy in foreign negotiations to ensure success and avoid negative consequences on future negotiations or relations with other powers. Congressional powers are available to enforce federal transparency while also protecting certain government information. Congressional powers to enforce federal transparency include legislating, holding hearings, issuing subpoenas, and controlling the federal budget. Laws like the Federal Register Act, APA, FOIA, FACA, Government In the Sunshine Act, and Privacy Act impact public access to government operations and records. Transparency definitions vary, with some emphasizing \"active disclosure\" and \"publicizing policy choices.\" Transparency is linked to the release of information to the public, including access, comprehension, and use of government information. Scholars and organizations measure transparency through surveys and examining FOIA implementation. Different definitions and measurements of transparency have strengths and weaknesses. Making the executive branch more transparent requires collaboration between Congress, the public, and the executive branch to ensure appropriate information release and analysis. Congress plays a crucial role in balancing transparency and secrecy in American democracy. While openness is vital for democratic operations, secrecy can protect citizens from security threats. As agencies use new technologies to release federal data, Congress must ensure the public can access and utilize the information properly. Additionally, Congress may investigate agencies withholding documents or releasing sensitive materials improperly. This report evaluates definitions of transparency and its practical implications. This report analyzes transparency in the executive branch of the federal government, including the impact of releasing large amounts of public data. It examines statutes and initiatives that aim to make information more available to the public while also protecting certain information from release. The report explores how the public historically and currently accesses government information and the statutes and policies in place to protect certain information. The report analyzes transparency in the executive branch of the federal government, including statutes and policies to protect information. It questions the effectiveness of existing transparency initiatives in achieving their goals, emphasizing the importance of public access, comprehension, and use of government information. Transparency is defined as not only disclosing information but also ensuring public understanding and utilization. Transparency is defined as \"active disclosure\" by Richard W. Oliver and as \"the publicizing of policy choices\" by scholars. Private organizations like Transparency International define it as allowing those affected by decisions to know facts, figures, and processes. Civil servants are expected to act visibly and predictably. The Sunlight Foundation outlines 10 principles of government openness, including completeness, timeliness, and machine readability. Transparency can be challenging to define but is understood in practice by scholars and practitioners. Transparency International surveys perceptions of transparency in various institutions. The Corruption Perceptions Index and Global Integrity report measure perceptions of corruption and governance trends worldwide. However, it is uncertain if these measures accurately reflect a government's transparency efforts. Justin Fox's research on transparency levels in the United States raises questions about the effectiveness of these measures in capturing true transparency levels. Scholar Justin Fox studied transparency levels in the United States by examining the integration of FOIA principles in executive branch agencies. His research focused on agencies' response to information requests but did not address proactive transparency, where agencies release information without it being requested. This proactive approach would eliminate the need for information requests, but FOIA requesters may require unique knowledge and skills for their requests. The requester must have knowledge and skills to draft a FOIA request and understand limitations on information requests, such as possible denials based on national security or privacy concerns. Mr. Fox's study may not measure U.S. transparency but rather the public's effectiveness in using FOIA as a tool. Fung examines the effectiveness of transparency systems, which provide factual information to the public. He argues that the success of these systems depends on the accessibility and relevance of the information to users and disclosers. Transparency is only effective when users incorporate the information into their decision-making process. Transparency is essential for good government and consumer protection, but disclosure requirements often fall short of promoting true transparency. Access to government information is crucial for a functioning democracy, but simply disclosing information is not enough to ensure transparency. Access to government information is crucial for a functioning democracy, but certain records may need to be kept secret to protect national security, personal privacy, or economic security. Transparency and secrecy are inherent values of the American republic, often in tension with each other. James Madison emphasized the need for government control by the people in the Federalist Papers. Madison and Jefferson emphasized the importance of an informed and vigilant citizenry to control the government. They believed that attention to public affairs was crucial to prevent government abuse of power. This idea of citizen oversight has been valued from the Founding Fathers to the present day. Certain records, like the meetings where the Founding Fathers drafted the Constitution, may need protection from public release. Secrecy in negotiations can lead to more open discussions, as seen in The Federalist Papers. Transparency has been emphasized by leaders like President Obama, who committed to an unprecedented level of openness in government processes. The tension between access and secrecy in government was highlighted by the release of diplomatic cables to Wikileaks.org. Secretary of State Hillary R. Clinton condemned the release, stating it jeopardized global security and economic prosperity. The incident may have made foreign diplomacy more visible. The release of diplomatic cables to Wikileaks.org may impact how foreign officials communicate with American officials in the future. Diplomats may struggle to have candid conversations with world leaders, fearing their discussions may be made public. However, then-Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates downplayed the leak's effect on American diplomacy, stating that governments engage with the United States out of self-interest, not necessarily because they like the country. Many governments engage with the United States out of self-interest, fear, or respect, as the country is seen as indispensable. The American government must balance access to information with national security and personal privacy concerns. Max Weber, a sociologist, emphasized the importance of keeping expertise within the bureaucracy to maintain autonomy and control. Federal employees may withhold information to prevent outside influence and maintain agency control. Weber believed bureaucratic administration tends to exclude the public and hide knowledge from criticism. The bureaucracy prefers a poorly informed parliament to maintain power and control. Throughout American history, public access to information has varied based on legal interpretations and historical context. Federal government transparency grew after World War II due to the bureaucracy's expansion and the Cold War. The growth of the bureaucracy and the emergence of the Cold War led to a highly secretive national security complex. Technology now influences public interaction with the federal government and their expectations for information. E-government and the Internet have provided 24-hour access to government information, changing public perceptions and expectations. Scholars have found that e-government increases public trust by improving access to records and information. Congress holds the President and Administration accountable through formal powers like lawmaking and impeachment, as well as the power of the purse to control appropriations affecting government access. Congress has the power to control appropriations that impact government access to information. Oversight is an implicit constitutional power of Congress, allowing them to hold hearings on executive branch information practices. Executive orders, initiatives, and case law also influence transparency in federal operations and records. This report reviews significant government actions that affect access to federal operations and records. It categorizes statutes and initiatives that provide public access to executive branch information, including access to records, meetings, regulatory processes, and transparency initiatives. The third category includes various authorities and initiatives that promote transparency as a byproduct. These include acts such as the Freedom of Information Act, the Privacy Act, the Federal Register Act, and the E-Government Act, among others. The federal government maintains a wide range of records in different formats. The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) governs access to government records in various formats, ranging from historical maps to electronic health records. Some records are protected from public release to prevent financial turmoil, privacy violations, or national security breaches. Other laws like the Federal Advisory Committee Act and the Privacy Act also regulate information access and protection. FOIA was enacted in 1966 after years of legislative development to replace the public information section of the Administrative Procedure Act. The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) allows access to executive branch agency records without justification. FOIA exempts nine categories of records from disclosure, including national defense information, agency personnel rules, and trade secrets. The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) exempts certain records from disclosure, such as trade secrets, financial information, and personal files. Disputes over access to requested records can be settled in court, making FOIA a valuable tool for information gathering. Requests for specific records must be made in writing to the agency. Organizations must submit a formal FOIA request for specific records from an agency. Agency professionals are responsible for responding to requests efficiently. FOIA has been amended multiple times, with each presidential administration applying it differently. President Obama released an Open Government Directive in 2009. The Open Government Directive issued by President Obama in 2009 emphasized transparency and openness in government agencies. It required agencies to release data online in an open format, preempting the need for FOIA requests. Agencies with FOIA request backlogs were mandated to reduce outstanding requests by 10% annually. The Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA) was enacted in 1972 to address concerns about duplicative and inefficient executive branch advisory bodies. FACA mandates structural and operational requirements for federal advisory committees, ensuring objective advice accessible to the public. General Services Administration (GSA) oversees management guidelines for these committees, with meetings open to the public, except for specified exceptions. The Privacy Act of 1974 governs the federal government's information privacy program, ensuring the collection, use, and dissemination of individual records are protected. Records must be retrievable by name or identifier, and the Act applies to systems created by government contractors. The Privacy Act applies to systems of records created by government contractors, requiring written consent for disclosure and allowing individuals to access and challenge their personal information. Agencies must publish a \"system-of-records notice\" when establishing or modifying records systems and implement safeguards for security and confidentiality. The Privacy Act provides legal remedies for individuals to enforce their rights, including the ability to bring a civil suit against agencies for non-compliance. Courts can order agencies to amend records, release records, and award monetary damages for intentional violations. Criminal penalties apply to federal employees who violate the act. The Office of Management and Budget is responsible for oversight. The Government in the Sunshine Act (5 U.S.C. \u00a7552b) requires federal agencies to conduct policymaking deliberations in public. Agencies must give advance notice of meetings and make them accessible to the public. There are exemptions for certain situations where meetings can be closed to the public. The curr_chunk discusses exemptions to the disclosure of information under the Government in the Sunshine Act, including matters authorized by executive order, internal agency rules, statutory exemptions, trade secrets, personal information, accusations of crimes, and law enforcement records. The curr_chunk outlines exemptions to information disclosure under the Government in the Sunshine Act, including the disclosure of examination reports by financial regulatory agencies and information that could lead to financial speculation or endanger financial institutions. Rulemaking is a key way the federal government implements public policy by delegating authority to agencies to issue regulations. Critics have raised concerns about the delegation of rulemaking authority. The Federal Register Act of 1935 aimed to increase transparency and public participation in the rulemaking process by establishing accountability and publication arrangements for presidential proclamations, executive orders, and federal agency rules and regulations. Critics of rulemaking authority delegation have highlighted the lack of public accountability compared to Members of Congress. Calls for greater transparency and participation have been made to address this concern. The Federal Register Act of 1935 was a response to the increasing number of regulations during the New Deal era. It mandated the Federal Register as the official publication for rules and proposed regulations to address the chaos and confusion caused by the growing quantity of administrative requirements. The Federal Register Act of 1935 mandated the Federal Register as the official publication for rules and regulations. The Code of Federal Regulations was later introduced as a supplement to the Federal Register, containing almost all agency regulations. This led to the creation of other publications like the United States Government Manual and the Public Papers of the Presidents. The Federal Register Act of 1935 established the Federal Register as the official publication for rules and regulations. Other related publications include the Code of Federal Regulations, the United States Government Manual, and the Public Papers of the Presidents. The Federal Register 2.0 website, launched in 2010 by NARA and the Government Printing Office, offers an interactive presentation of the Federal Register's content, including subject areas like science, technology, money, health, and public welfare. It features popular documents in a \"What's Hot?\" section, blog posts, and videos from federal officials and President Obama discussing regulations. Federal Register 2.0 is not an official legal edition but provides graphic renditions of the official documents. The Administrative Procedure Act (APA) of 1946 established minimum procedural requirements for agency decision-making processes, including public information, participation in rulemaking, uniform standards for formal proceedings, and judicial review of agency actions. The Administrative Procedure Act (APA) of 1946 sets procedural requirements for agency decision-making, including rulemaking and adjudication. Rulemaking involves creating future conduct guidelines through agency statements, while adjudication determines past and present rights and liabilities. Agencies must follow specific procedural requirements for each process. The Administrative Procedure Act (APA) sets procedural requirements for agency decision-making, including rulemaking and adjudication. Rulemaking involves creating future conduct guidelines, while adjudication determines past and present rights and liabilities. Agencies must publish a notice of proposed rulemaking, allow for public participation, and issue a final rule at least 30 days before its effective date. Interested persons can petition for rule issuance, amendment, or repeal. Executive Order 12866 suggests allowing at least 60 days for public comment. The APA remains the primary law governing agency decision-making through rulemaking and adjudication. Administrative lawmaking was expanded between 1965 and 1983, giving agencies more obligations and courts a larger role. The Federal Register Act and the APA provide access to the regulatory process for the public and Congress, but understanding and utilizing the information in the Federal Register is essential. The Federal Register is organized by agency and includes regulations with titles, unique identifying numbers, and brief descriptions. The regulatory process allows for public comments before rules are applied, with agencies required to acknowledge and consider these comments. Public participation requires knowledge of how to find and search the Federal Register, as well as how to submit comments. Additional laws have been passed to add requirements to the rulemaking process. The Federal Register organizes regulations by agency and includes titles, identifying numbers, and descriptions. Public participation in the regulatory process involves submitting comments, which agencies must acknowledge and consider. Additional laws, such as NEPA, RFA, UMRA, Negotiated Rulemaking Act, and E-Government Act, have added requirements for agencies to conduct and publish impact analyses for regulatory actions. NEPA, for example, mandates environmental assessments to determine significant effects on the environment. The Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) of 1980 requires agencies to consider the impact of their rules on small entities, such as small businesses and non-profit organizations. If a proposed rule would have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities, the agency must conduct an initial regulatory flexibility analysis. The Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) requires agencies to conduct initial and final regulatory flexibility analyses for proposed and final rules, respectively. These analyses describe the rule's purpose, its impact on small entities, compliance costs, and potential alternatives. The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA) also mandates cost analyses for new requirements without federal funding exceeding $100 million annually. The Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) and the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA) require agencies to conduct cost analyses for new regulations and mandates exceeding $100 million annually. Agencies must consider regulatory alternatives, notify small governments affected, and involve local government input in the rulemaking process. The Negotiated Rulemaking Act of 1990 encourages agencies to form rulemaking committees with interested parties to develop proposed rules more effectively. The E-Government Act of 2002 established an Office of Electronic Government to oversee the implementation of an e-government program, increasing public access to agency regulatory activities through websites. Regulations.gov, launched in 2003, provides a centralized rulemaking portal for the public to search for and comment on proposed rules. President Bill Clinton issued Executive Order 12866 in 1993 to govern the rulemaking process, emphasizing transparency and accessibility to the public. Presidents George W. Bush and Obama followed this order, with provisions requiring agencies to publicly identify changes made to draft rules and maintain a publicly accessible log of regulatory affairs. President Obama's Executive Order 13563 in 2011 reinforced transparency principles in regulatory affairs, requiring agencies to provide online access to rulemaking dockets on Regulations.gov. This included allowing public comment on all pertinent parts of the docket, including scientific and technical findings. Obama issued a memorandum linking the regulatory process to his Open Government Initiative. The federal government publishes the Unified Agenda of Federal Regulatory and Deregulatory Actions twice a year, detailing upcoming regulatory actions in five stages. This provides transparency and allows public input. The Unified Agenda, published twice a year, informs the public about regulatory actions under consideration by agencies. OIRA, a key office within OMB, plays a significant role in the rulemaking process. OIRA reviews agencies' information collection requests before they can proceed. OIRA, under Executive Orders 12291 and 12866, reviews significant proposed and final rules from Cabinet departments and independent agencies before publication in the Federal Register. OIRA can approve rules as is, request changes, or suggest withdrawal. Data on OIRA's rule reviews is available on their website for public viewing. The Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) reviews rules from government agencies before publication. Inspectors general provide transparency by making information and records available to the public. The executive branch is improving access to federal spending information online. Statutory offices of inspectors general (OIGs) conduct audits and investigations within federal departments. The OIGs are permanent, independent, nonpartisan units established by law to combat waste, fraud, and abuse. They were first established in 1976 and 1978 in response to financial and management scandals. OIGs now exist in nearly 70 federal establishments and entities, including all Cabinet departments and major federal agencies. The majority of IGs are governed by the Inspector General Act of 1978. The Inspector General Act, amended multiple times, outlines IG appointments, powers, and duties, creating OIGs in federal establishments and designated federal entities. The Inspector General Reform Act of 2008 established the Council of the Inspectors General for Integrity and Efficiency, amended reporting obligations and salary provisions, and added budget protections for OIG offices. OIGs conduct audits and investigations to combat waste, fraud, and abuse in federal programs and operations. The Inspector General Act establishes OIGs in federal establishments to oversee programs, prevent fraud, and inform Congress about issues. IGs have reporting obligations to various entities and are required to report suspected violations of federal law promptly to the Attorney General. IGs have reporting obligations to various entities and are required to report suspected violations of federal law promptly to the Attorney General. They must report semiannually to the agency head, who then submits the unaltered report to Congress within 30 days. Additionally, IGs are to report serious problems immediately to the agency head, who must submit the report to Congress within seven days. Communication with Congress includes testifying at hearings, meeting with members and staff, and responding to requests for information. The CIGIE is authorized to make reports to Congress as deemed necessary by the Chairperson. Each agency website must provide a direct link to the IG website for public access to reports on audits, investigations, and evaluations. Transparency advocates argue for increased transparency in the federal government's distribution of over $1.3 trillion in grants, contracts, and loans annually. Transparency advocates, including Members of Congress, emphasize the importance of easily accessible federal award data for public scrutiny. They argue that transparency holds the government accountable and ensures responsible spending of taxpayer money. While federal award data has been available for decades, it has not been user-friendly. The Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act (FFATA) was enacted to address limitations on public access to federal award data by requiring the establishment of a new searchable website providing specific information about each award exceeding $25,000. This act aimed to increase transparency and accountability in government spending. The FFATA required the establishment of a searchable website, USASpending.gov, to provide award data details such as recipient name, amount awarded, and purpose. Agencies had to update data every 30 days and ensure accuracy. Other websites like Data.gov and ITDashboard also offer access to raw datasets. The USASpending.gov component aggregates data on executive branch IT investments and allows public data analysis. Procurement involves agencies using funds to buy goods/services, awarding contracts through source selection methods like sealed bidding or negotiation. Agencies post solicitations on the Federal Business Opportunities website for businesses to identify contracting opportunities. Companies then prepare and submit bids following provided instructions. Companies submit proposals to agencies in response to solicitations. Agency personnel evaluate proposals using specified factors, make a source selection decision, negotiate contracts, and award them. Transparency is a key objective in government procurement, with system transparency being crucial. This transparency ensures impartial and open conduct of government business, achieved through publicizing statutes, regulations, and policies. Transparency in government procurement includes publicizing statutes, regulations, and policies, making requirements publicly available, describing evaluation criteria in solicitations, providing contract award information to unsuccessful offerors, offering bid protest procedures, and oversight by inspector general offices. Additional resources for transparency include websites like SAM, FPDS, and USASpending.gov. New data collection efforts in government procurement include the Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS) and agencies' inventories of service contracts. FAPIIS aims to evaluate the business ethics and quality of contractors competing for federal contracts. The Department of Defense (DOD) and civilian agencies are required to compile inventories of their service contracts, which are publicly available on their respective websites. Transparency in federal government procurement is maintained through various mechanisms, including exemption 4 of FOIA which protects trade secrets and confidential information of government contractors. Concerns also arise regarding the accuracy and potential misinterpretation of information in the FAPIIS database. Attorneys highlight concerns about government agencies potentially being required to post contracts online, which could impact their ability to negotiate effectively. Shielding certain information from public disclosure during the procurement process is seen as serving valid purposes and objectives. President Barack Obama issued a memorandum for government transparency, leading to the release of the \"Open Government Directive\" by Peter R. Orszag, instructing departments to implement principles of transparency, participation, and collaboration. This included giving public access to valuable datasets. The \"Open Government Directive\" required agencies to publish high-value datasets, reduce FOIA backlogs, designate senior officials for accountability, create open government plans, and meet staggered deadlines for compliance. The directive aimed to improve transparency and public participation through online information publishing and quality improvement. The Open Government Directive emphasizes transparency and accountability by publishing government information online, improving its quality, fostering a culture of openness, and establishing a supportive policy framework. Agencies have made progress in meeting these requirements, but private sector reviews suggest varying levels of diligence in implementation. On September 8, 2011, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) released a memorandum on \"Informing Consumers through Smart Disclosure,\" defining smart disclosure as the timely release of complex information in standardized, machine-readable formats. This approach requires data to be accessible, standardized, timely, and protective of privacy, aiming to enable consumers to make informed decisions. Access to government information has evolved over time, with initiatives like the Federal Register Act of 1935 and the Obama Administration's Open Government Initiative in 2009. This allows the public to access, understand, and use federal data to make informed decisions, such as choosing child safety seats or learning about air and water quality in their neighborhoods. This knowledge can also shape policy debates. Access to government information has evolved over time, allowing the public to make informed decisions and shape policy debates. The U.S. government is a representative democracy where elected officials determine and execute federal policy, as described by James Madison in Federalist 10. In a representative democracy, elected officials refine and enlarge public views by discerning the true interest of the country. Transparency laws allow the public to access and understand decisions made by federal officials. Transparency laws enable public access to decisions made by elected officials and federal employees, aiding in accountability. The Federal Register Act and Administrative Procedure Act formalize public participation in the regulatory process. The Federal Register Act and Administrative Procedure Act formalize public participation in the regulatory process by providing mechanisms for accessing government operations, participating in policymaking, and challenging policy choices in court. Access to government information is granted through various platforms like the Federal Register, Code of Federal Regulations, FederalRegister.gov, and Regulations.gov, but the government still controls the release and timing of information, limiting public participation before proposed rules are published. FOIA allows post-hoc access to policymaking information by retracing histories. Requesters must know how to write a proper FOIA request. FACA enables direct public participation in policy formulation. FACA allows private citizens and interest representatives to serve on advisory committees for public policy formulation. The public has access to committee meetings and records, but committees cannot implement recommendations. Federal officers decide on implementing FACA recommendations, although public attendance at meetings may be challenging. Post-hoc access to meeting records is available for those unable to attend. Some federal agencies use new technology to make meetings and records more accessible. This includes placing committee records online, making audio or video recordings available, and webcasting meetings with the option for online audience participation. The Open Government Directive requires agencies to release new datasets to the public proactively. The Obama Administration emphasizes public oversight of agency performance through crowdsourcing. Crowdsourcing on Data.gov allows users to rate datasets, contact dataset owners, and flag datasets for various reasons. Agencies may improve data quality by reading and responding to comments and suggestions from the public. Federal agencies need to clearly disclose the completeness and limitations of the data they release. Nonpartisan scholars can utilize federal datasets to analyze and develop tools for public understanding and oversight. However, crowdsourcing may give an advantage to individuals with more time and resources. Releasing datasets assumes the public can evaluate, offer insights, and reach valid conclusions, but manipulation could lead to skewed interpretations. Specialized knowledge may be necessary for users as agencies release numerous datasets. Releasing numerous datasets may require specialized knowledge for users to identify relevant information, potentially decreasing executive branch transparency. Smart disclosure strategies could improve public access to federal data, encouraging agencies to consider more effective methods of data release. Congress may need to consider requiring agencies to implement smart disclosure strategies to improve public access to federal data. However, oversight of these strategies could be challenging due to the vast amount of datasets held by agencies and the costs associated with adapting data to more accessible formats. Concerns may also arise regarding the abilities and affiliations of those accessing government data, commenting on regulations, or participating in government meetings, with public participation mainly coming from specialized interest groups. Interest groups with time, resources, and knowledge can engage with federal agencies through websites and technology to strengthen relationships and gain faster access to policymakers. Lawmakers influence private organizations' access to administrative agencies, with attempts to insulate policymakers potentially limiting access for smaller groups while larger groups maintain access. Collaboration with the public can generate new ideas for cost savings, benefit distribution, and government efficiency. Public access to federal records and meetings can promote cost savings, assist in benefit distribution, and increase bureaucratic accountability. However, access to regulatory processes and meetings is often limited to formal proposals or actions by the federal government, requiring time and resources from the public. Increasing public access to federal records and agency meetings during the policymaking process has benefits such as promoting transparency and accountability. However, limiting access could potentially lead to more efficient decision-making but may also hinder public oversight of government processes. It is important to strike a balance between increasing access and maintaining the efficiency of administrative processes. The role of elected officials in democracy is to refine and enlarge public views."
