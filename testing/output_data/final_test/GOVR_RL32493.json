    "content": "This report focuses on the economic aspects of U.S. leverage with North Korea, examining the country's economy in relation to its nuclear weapon and missile programs. It provides an overview of North Korea's economy, its trading partners, and various U.S. policy options aimed at halting the DPRK's nuclear weapons program, reducing tensions, preventing proliferation, and improving human rights and living standards. In 2009, North Korea made significant moves towards becoming a nuclear-armed state, with a shift towards military power, ideological purity, and defiance of international sanctions. Key events included testing a long-range ballistic missile, sentencing American reporters, capturing a South Korean worker, and conducting a second nuclear test. North Korea also indicated reluctance to return to denuclearization talks. In late 2009, North Korea engaged in a cycle of threats, diplomacy, and broken promises. This included a \"charm offensive\" with the release of American reporters and a South Korean worker, visits between North and South Korea, and talks under the Six-Party Talks framework. In 2008 and 2009, North Korea's military remained subdued, with occasional provocative actions like attempting to ship weapons on a cargo plane intercepted in Thailand. Speculation arose about Kim Jong-il's health and a possible successor, as the country prepared for succession and the 100th anniversary in 2012. In preparation for the 100th anniversary of Kim Il-sung's birth in 2012, North Korea prioritized military activities and national security over civilian government issues, economics, and international relations. The leadership emphasized nationalism, purity of thought, and loyalty to the Communist party. Kim Jong-il possibly designated his son, Kim Jong-un, as his successor. There were speculations about Kim Jong-il's health and his efforts to secure military support. Kim Jong-il's brother-in-law, Jang Seong-taek, may run the country through his membership on the National Defense Commission until Kim Jong-un is ready to take over leadership. Kim Jong-un is being groomed for future leadership with some responsibilities. Kim Jong-un is being groomed for future leadership, with some responsibilities given to him. There are indications that North Korean society is starting to accept him as a potential leader, with diplomats paying homage to him, schoolchildren including his name in songs, and the military referring to him as \"Brilliant Comrade.\" Little is known about Kim Jong-un's background, except that he may have attended schools in Switzerland and Pyongyang's Kim Il-sung Military University. U.S. Special Envoy Stephen Bosworth visited Pyongyang for talks in 2009, which were seen as exploratory on how to restart negotiations. U.S. Special Envoy Stephen Bosworth's 2009 talks in Pyongyang were exploratory on restarting negotiations. Bosworth did not meet with Kim Jong-il and carried a letter from President Obama. North Korea's policy cycle shows alternating movements towards denuclearization and nuclearization. The DPRK's drive to develop nuclear weapons holds significant implications for U.S. interests in Asia. The DPRK's nuclear weapons program holds significant implications for U.S. interests in Asia. U.S. goals include verifiable elimination of North Korea's nuclear weapons, halting nuclear proliferation activities, reducing tensions on the Korean Peninsula, stopping illicit activities, and improving human rights in North Korea. The Six-Party Agreement of 2007 offered economic incentives and the prospect of diplomatic normalization in exchange for North Korea's cooperation. Progress was made under the Six Party Talks with North Korea dismantling 80% of its Yongbyon nuclear reactor. President Bush lifted sanctions and removed North Korea from the list of state sponsors of terrorism. Shipments of humanitarian aid resumed but halted in December 2008. North Korea's economy, heavily reliant on foreign aid, showed signs of improvement after the crisis in the mid-1990s. The economy of North Korea is still struggling and heavily dependent on foreign assistance to prevent starvation among its people. The UN World Food Program estimated a cereal deficit of 836,000 tons in 2008/2009, leaving almost 9 million people without enough food until the harvest. China and Russia have major influence in North Korea and both condemned Pyongyang's second nuclear test. China, in particular, has the most influence but fears instability in the DPRK. China, while not approving of North Korea's actions, is concerned about potential instability in the DPRK leading to a refugee influx into its northern provinces. Beijing, as the host of the Six-Party Talks, aims to maintain stability in East Asia for its economic development. China prefers a economically poor North Korea with nuclear aspirations over a unified Korean state that could pose a threat. The North Korean nuclear issue poses a challenge for China as it could lead to a unified Korean state with nuclear weapons, potentially aligning with the Western alliance. This situation also prompts the United States to strengthen its anti-ballistic missile efforts in East Asia. North Korea sees its nuclear program as a way to gain international stature and deter hostile actions, feeling surrounded by nuclear powers. North Korea's nuclear program has elevated its status on the world's security agenda, allowing Pyongyang to leverage attention for economic assistance and propaganda. Despite warnings, North Korea has pursued nuclear weapons development, using it as a source of national pride. North Korea's nuclear program is seen as crucial for national security, with the goal of deterring attacks and gaining international prestige. Pyongyang aims to balance its nuclear ambitions with economic development, seeking assistance from China to become a nuclear and space power by 2012. The program is also intended to prevent US involvement in potential conflicts with South Korea or Japan. The North Korean nuclear program aims to gain international prestige, exercise hegemony over South Korea, and extract economic assistance. Pyongyang sees nuclear weapons as an insurance policy against regime change by the West, influenced by the \"axis of evil\" designation and US-led invasions. Becoming a recognized nuclear power could lead to improved relations with the United States. The US has an interest in North Korea's economy beyond negotiations over nuclear weapons. The North Korean economy plays a crucial role in supporting Pyongyang's military and nuclear weapons program, driving refugees to flee the country and leading to illicit trade. Poor economic conditions divert international aid, create instability, and may fuel discontent against the ruling regime. Despite dissatisfaction, opposition to the regime remains muted. The conventional wisdom regarding North Korea includes concerns about cheating on agreements, regime survival as a top priority, engagement in illicit activities, selling nuclear technology, economic privation affecting the population, and weak opposition to the current regime. North Korea's regime appears stable, justified by perceived hostility from the US and South Korea. Factors include potential monetary settlement from Japan, porous border with China, and potential for rapid economic transition once liberalized. The current chunk discusses the potential benefits of economic reform and trade liberalization in North Korea, highlighting the need for major investments to upgrade production facilities. It also mentions efforts by Pyongyang to attract Chinese and South Korean investments. Additionally, it emphasizes the deep distrust between the United States and North Korea and suggests a grand strategy involving economic, diplomatic, and military means to achieve U.S. goals and protect national interests. Sanctions against North Korea target elite and companies involved in weapons sales, aiming to disrupt revenue from illicit activities like nuclear sales and counterfeiting. UN Resolution 1874 enforces interdiction of banned cargo from DPRK. A long-term strategy for North Korea aims to transform its relations with Western nations, legitimacy of the ruling regime, and economy to reduce reliance on extorting food and energy assistance. Pyongyang is skilled at setting the agenda in its relations with the United States and other nations, achieving narrow results like developing nuclear weapons despite opposition. The DPRK's ability to develop nuclear weapons is attributed to the military's strong role in policy and the government's isolation and drive for self-sufficiency. North Korean citizens, particularly the non-elite, are willing to endure deprivation and human rights violations in the name of nationalism. Diplomatic relations with the DPRK are strained due to limited trade and political uncertainties. Assistance to North Korea often fails to reach those in need and may be diverted. The United States has financial influence globally, making it a key player in decisions involving North Korea. Positive inducements like economic aid and diplomatic ties, as well as negative inducements such as sanctions, have been used to influence Pyongyang's decision-making, but with limited success. North Korea seeks direct negotiations with the US while facing threats of economic and diplomatic isolation. Engagement with North Korea has been conducted under the Six-Party Talks plus bilateral discussions between Pyongyang and other nations, including the United States, China, Japan, South Korea, and Russia. The talks, now suspended, involve major players and aim to prevent sales of nuclear and missile technology. China and Russia are exposed to North Korean obstinacy, enabling them to exert pressure on Pyongyang. Japan and South Korea, with direct interests in a peaceful resolution, are likely to provide aid to North Korea. The talks heavily rely on China, which has conflicting interests in resolving the DPRK nuclear issue. The major negotiating priorities and bargaining chips for each side in the Six-Party Talks are summarized in Table 1. Major U.S. policy options towards the DPRK include intensified sanctions, seeking verifiable denuclearization, enforcing sanctions under U.N. Resolutions, engaging in bilateral talks within the Six Party Talks framework, non-proliferation efforts, and preventing North Korea from joining international financial institutions. Current U.S. policy towards North Korea includes efforts to counter trafficking, maintain military forces in South Korea and Japan, and develop a missile defense system for East Asia. The policy aims to address North Korea's strategy to gain recognition as a nuclear power and marginalize the Six Party Talks. Measures to intensify negative pressures on North Korea include tightening and monitoring of sanctions, freezing assets, and banning certain individuals from traveling abroad. Negative pressures on North Korea may include tightening sanctions, banning luxury goods imports, designating entities as money laundering concerns, and inducing China to use its influence to punish North Korea. Other measures could involve weakening Pyongyang's control over its citizens, fostering alternative centers of power, transitioning to a market economy, and increasing information flows into the country. Soft power tactics like admitting more North Korean refugees into the United States and funding cultural exchanges could also be utilized. South Korea has found a secret weapon that is popular with North Koreans: Choco Pies. Offer a \"grand bargain\" to North Korea for denuclearization in exchange for economic assistance, normalization, and security assurance. The 111th Congress discussed legislation related to the DPRK economy, including enforcing existing sanctions and exploring additional sanctions to induce North Korea to abandon its nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles. The 111th Congress discussed legislation related to North Korea, including bills to designate North Korea as a state sponsor of terrorism and impose sanctions for human rights violations. The 111th Congress discussed legislation related to North Korea, including bills to designate North Korea as a state sponsor of terrorism, impose sanctions, require reports on nuclear weapons program, and promote dialogue with South Korea. The 111th Congress discussed legislation related to North Korea, including bills to designate North Korea as a state sponsor of terrorism, impose sanctions, require reports on nuclear weapons program, and promote dialogue with South Korea. H.Res. 604 recognizes the vital role of the Proliferation Security Initiative in preventing the spread of weapons of mass destruction. H.Res. 705 condemns hard-labor prison camps in North Korea as a violation of human rights. H.R. 1105, the Omnibus Appropriations Act, 2009, includes a prohibition against funds for assistance to North Korea and provides assistance for refugees from North Korea. The 111th Congress discussed legislation related to North Korea, including bills to designate North Korea as a state sponsor of terrorism, impose sanctions, and promote dialogue with South Korea. H.R. 1980 makes funds available for nuclear security initiatives in North Korea, while H.R. 2290 applies measures to foreign persons transferring certain goods to Iran, Syria, or North Korea. The 111th Congress discussed legislation related to North Korea, including bills to designate North Korea as a state sponsor of terrorism, impose sanctions, and promote dialogue with South Korea. H.R. 2346 (Obey) rejects funding for nuclear facilities dismantling in North Korea and provides development assistance. H.R. 2845 (Franks) aims to protect the homeland from North Korean and Iranian ballistic missiles. H.R. 3423 (McMahon) imposes sanctions on North Korea for detonating a nuclear explosive device. The North Korean economy is isolated and bleak, with pockets of modernity in Pyongyang. It was bypassed by the Asian economic miracles of the past three decades. The economy is characterized by state ownership, centralized planning, lack of basic freedoms, political repression, and military-first policy. The system is designed to be self-reliant and closed. During the 1990s, North Korea faced a severe food crisis, leading to millions starving to death. The country heavily relied on foreign aid for survival, especially from China and the U.N. World Food Program. The economy suffered due to inefficiencies of the centrally planned system, high military spending, and natural disasters. The collapse of the Soviet bloc further worsened the situation by cutting off aid and export markets. The collapse of the Soviet bloc led to the loss of Russian aid, export markets, and cheap oil for North Korea, exacerbating its already disastrous domestic economic conditions. Trade with the former Soviet Union plummeted from $3.58 billion in 1999 to $111 million in 2008. This economic hardship has resulted in severe food scarcity, with North Korean youth being shorter than those in other East Asian nations. The military had to lower its minimum height requirement to attract new recruits, and chronic malnourishment among children decreased from 62% in 1998 to about 37% in 2004 with the help of the WFP. The Food and Agriculture Organization estimated that 7.6 million North Koreans were undernourished during the 2002-2004 period. The collapse of the Soviet bloc led to severe economic hardship in North Korea, resulting in food scarcity. The WFP estimated that 7.6 million North Koreans were undernourished during the 2002-2004 period. In 2006, Pyongyang halted food deliveries but resumed limited assistance in 2006. Severe weather conditions in 2007-2008 further impacted crop growth, leading to a cereal deficit. The WFP estimated food assistance requirements to feed almost 9 million people until the next harvest in October 2009. Since the 1990s, North Korea has faced severe food shortages, with an estimated 800,000 tons of food needed until the next harvest in October 2009. The regime has implemented market-oriented reforms since 2002 to address economic pressures, although they are not officially termed as \"reforms\" but as \"utilitarian socialism.\" These measures include introducing elements of a market economy domestically and pursuing normalization of relations with traditionally hostile countries. North Korea's gross national product in 2008 was estimated at $40-54 billion in purchasing power parity prices, resulting in a national income of $1,700-$2,248 per capita. This is significantly lower than countries like China, Indonesia, and Japan. In market prices, North Korea's GDP was around $26.7-28.5 billion, with a per capita income of $1,223. In the post-Korean War era, North Korea had higher living standards than South Korea and China. However, its economy declined in the 1990s before showing some recovery in 1999. Growth rates fluctuated in the following years, with a notable 3.7% growth in 2008. Estimates suggest a continued growth rate of about 2% per year until 2011, although there are varying opinions on North Korea's economic performance. Some estimates show gradual recovery in North Korean growth rates and GDP since the 1990s, but others argue that real per capita GDP has been stagnant or declining over the past decade. Difficulties in obtaining reliable inflation estimates are due to the lack of a systematic data collection method and varying prices for commodities in different sectors of the economy. Officials reporting data may be pressured to meet certain targets, unlike in the West where data may be manipulated for better presentation. In North Korea, official statistics are often manipulated to meet expectations, with a significant discrepancy between official and black market exchange rates. This leads to challenges in accurately measuring GDP, but it is clear that many North Koreans struggle to survive, with even minor economic setbacks causing widespread starvation and child malnutrition. Despite the threat of imprisonment, many refugees attempt to flee North Korea due to economic and political conditions. Consumer necessities have been rationed and used to reward party loyalists, but Pyongyang's economic reforms have been backtracked. The official food distribution system lacks supplies, making food markets essential for non-elite society. The weak economy and ruling regime in North Korea have created economic divisions, with five classes of people emerging despite official classifications. The elite class, including party cadres, enjoy privileges while many suffer from starvation in the provinces. The privileged elite in North Korea, residing in Pyongyang, enjoy luxuries like foreign cars and imported goods, sustaining their lifestyle through various sources of income including foreign investments and shadowy trades. The lower classes in North Korea struggle to make a living through various means such as government rations, farming, and trading in markets. Dissent is stifled, and support for the ruling regime is enforced through severe measures. The country lacks a middle class with independent economic means and a desire for democratic institutions. In 2007, South Korea's President Lee Myung-bak proposed a plan called \"Vision 3000: Denuclearization and Openness\" to help North Korea achieve a national income of $3,000 per person within 10 years if they denuclearize and open up. However, the plan has been shelved as North Korea continues its policy of self-reliance and isolation under the philosophy of juche. This philosophy has been used to maintain power and create a supernatural image around their leaders. The regime's dynastic succession system also reflects elements of Confucianism. The economic practice of juche in North Korea minimizes international trade relations, discourages foreign direct investment, and prioritizes heavy manufacturing industries. The military-first policy under Kim Jong-il has shifted focus from the working class to military strength, unlike the previous emphasis on political independence and self-defense capabilities under Kim Il-sung. North Korea's military-first policy under Kim Jong-il emphasizes the importance of a strong military for the country to be \"strong in ideology and economy.\" The military-industrial complex in North Korea has strong links between heavy industry and munitions production, with some industries producing dual-use products for both military and civilian use. The National Defense Commission has become the supreme decision-making body, signaling the privileged status of the Korean People's Army. North Korea's military-first policy under Kim Jong-il emphasizes the importance of a strong military for the country to be \"strong in ideology and economy.\" The ultimate decision maker in Pyongyang is Kim Jong-il, Chairman of the National Defense Commission. North Korea claims to spend about 15% of its GDP on national defense, with a defense budget of $2.3 billion in 2006 to maintain its 1.17 million member military. The tug of war between \"guns and butter\" within the regime is intense due to scarcity of resources, despite the military operating businesses for additional revenues. The heavy influence of the military in Pyongyang's decision-making is evident in North Korea's actions, such as backtracking on nuclear commitments and carrying out tests despite warnings. The military-first policy under Kim Jong-il emphasizes the importance of a strong military for the country. Despite operating businesses for additional revenues, the regime faces a tug of war between military and economic priorities due to resource scarcity. The heavy influence of the military in Pyongyang's decision-making is evident in North Korea's actions, such as backtracking on nuclear commitments and carrying out tests despite warnings. The regime's economic decisions are controlled by a few elite in Pyongyang, who may not understand advancements in agriculture or manufacturing and are motivated by non-economic factors. Foreign investment is hindered by the regime's aversion to being \"exploited\" by capitalists and deep-seated mistrust of Westerners, Japanese, and South Koreans. North Korea's economic reforms have been driven by necessity as the central government struggled to provide basic necessities. Advice from China and Russia has influenced Pyongyang to allow some economic reforms, following the Chinese model with economic reforms preceding political reforms. The regime is wary of Westerners, Japanese, and South Koreans, hindering foreign investment. The DPRK is also considering the Vietnamese model of development. The DPRK has been examining the Vietnamese model of development and do moi (reform) with a preference for gradual economic reform over the abrupt Chinese style. Economic reforms began in July 2002, aiming to loosen Stalinist controls and increase the use of market mechanisms. These reforms, labeled as an \"economic adjustment policy,\" are seen as a desperate attempt to revive the economy, aligning with North Korea's \"military-first\" policy. Kim Jong-il's focus on the military has led to pressure to boost economic productivity. The economic adjustments in North Korea included ending rationing for daily commodities (except food), increasing prices and wages, devaluing the currency, abolishing the foreign exchange coupon system, allowing markets and foreign investment, and maintaining centralized price control. Prices rose significantly, with essential items seeing the highest increases. Consumer prices in North Korea skyrocketed after economic reforms, with rice prices increasing by 550 times, corn by 471 times, diesel oil by 38 times, and electricity by 60 times. Wages also rose, but not enough to keep up with inflation. Despite wage increases for laborers and managers, many households faced financial difficulties. Reforms in factories included greater control over prices, wages, and incentives for profit. The regime planned similar agricultural reforms to China's household contract system, transitioning towards family-oriented operations. North Korea has transitioned towards family-oriented operations in agriculture, allowing farmers to keep more of their production exceeding official targets. Small farmers' markets were legalized in 2003, following the recognition of commercial transactions between individuals. Free markets and shopping centers using currency are now prevalent, such as the bustling Pyongyang Central Market and Tongil market offering various goods. In late 2006, Pyongyang's market was thriving with various products and shoppers driving European cars. The North Korean population is gradually adjusting to open markets, causing concerns for the DPRK regime about capitalism encroaching on their socialist system. Kim Jong-il criticized markets as anti-socialist, leading to government restrictions on market activities, including banning women under 49 from running businesses in Pyongyang. In late 2007, new regulations in North Korea banned certain products like South Korean dramas and movies from central markets. Enforcement of these regulations became stricter, with government security agencies involved in policing. Travel permits for wholesale merchants were harder to acquire, affecting normal tourist and family trips. Despite the crackdown, corruption allowed some businesses to continue through bribery. In late 2009, the DPRK government carried out a currency reform that confiscated wealth from illegal merchants and traders who operated in private markets. The reform limited currency exchange to about $40 initially, later raised to $200, effectively confiscating wealth earned through buying goods in China and selling them in North Korea. The DPRK government carried out a currency reform in late 2009 to confiscate wealth earned through private market transactions. The reform aimed to control inflation but led to scarcity of commodities and a decline in the new currency's value. Despite this, efforts were made to attract foreign investment into the country. The DPRK government implemented economic laws and regulations in December 2009, including confiscating wealth and banning foreign currency transactions. Despite distrust of foreigners, limited entry for foreign companies, mainly from China and South Korea, was allowed. Kim Jong-il emphasized the need to develop international activities and attract investments to build a strong economy. Kim Jong-il emphasized the need for international activities and attracting investments to build a strong economy in North Korea. Foreign investment cases increased under the Joint-Operation Act, with a majority from pro-North Korean residents of Japan. The Rajin-Sonbong free trade zone was established in 1991, leading to $1.4 million in investments by 1997. Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao visited Pyongyang in 2009, signing agreements on economic and technological cooperation with North Korea. During Wen Jiabao's visit to Pyongyang in 2009, agreements were signed for economic and technological cooperation. Wen proposed expanding economic cooperation, including the construction of a new bridge over the Yalu River costing over $150 million. An additional economic cooperation package of $50 million was offered. The two countries also began developing the Tumen River Cross-Border Economic Cooperation Zone, which includes a rebuilt bridge, a new port, duty-free zone, warehouses, and international transit facilities. The DPRK established the Sinuiju Special Administrative Region on the border with China. The Sinuiju Special Administrative Region (SAR) was established in 2002 on the border with China. Development was hindered by the arrest of Chinese businessman Yang Bin in 2006. However, after Kim Jong-il's visit to China, Sinuiju started receiving new attention. Foreign currency management groups moved in, and residents from other areas replaced ordinary citizens. Other North Korean areas like Nampo, Pyongyang, and Mt. Kumkang also received foreign investment. Mt. Kumkang was developed into a tourist destination with the help of South Korea's Hyundai corporation. Operations at Mt. Kumkang ceased as relations with South Korea soured after a South Korean tourist was shot. The Kumgang tour program, run by Hyundai Asian Corp., began in 1998 and attracted over 1.9 million South Korean visitors. Foreign investments in North Korea include the Kaesong Industrial Complex, investments from China, and limited investments from other nations like Orascom Telecom in 2008. The DPRK has had $1.38 billion in foreign direct investment (FDI) by the end of 2007, with rising annual FDI flows since 2003. The Kaesong Industrial Complex (KIC) has been a significant free-trade zone effort, managed by South Korea's Hyundai Asan and Korea Land Corporation. Despite tensions, operations at the KIC have resumed and the joint effort between North and South Korea continues to develop rapidly. The Kaesong Industrial Complex (KIC) is managed by South Korea's Hyundai Asan and Korea Land Corporation. It is located 43 miles north of Seoul and aims to attract South Korean companies looking for lower costs. As of November 2009, 116 factories were operating in Kaesong, employing about 40,000 North Korean personnel and 1,000 South Korean personnel. The complex is planned to attract 300 businesses in the first stage, 700 in the second, and 1,000 in the third stage, with an estimated total of 300,000 workers. In December 2006, the Korea Electric Power Corporation connected North and South Korea with a 100,000 kilowatt power-transmission line for use by companies in the Kaesong Industrial Complex. By 2008, yearly production reached about $250 million, with major products including textiles, chemical products, metals, machinery, and electric and electronic products. Kaesong developed from South Korea's sunshine policy of economic engagement with the North, serving both geopolitical and economic purposes. The Kaesong Industrial Complex serves as a channel for rapprochement between North and South Korea, providing low-cost labor for South Korean firms, jobs for North Korean workers, and hard currency for Pyongyang. The South Korean government is considering building dormitories for workers from areas beyond Kaesong City to support the 18 projects under construction and 105 projects allotted land. The South Korean government is considering building dormitories for workers from areas beyond Kaesong City to support the projects under construction at the Kaesong Industrial Complex. This move could incur significant additional costs and raise concerns about workers interacting with South Koreans and being exposed to non-DPRK products. Additionally, there is controversy surrounding the proposed South Korea-U.S. Free-trade Agreement and whether products exported from the complex should be considered as originating from South Korea for duty-free status. The proposed Korea-United States FTA does not allow duty-free entry for products made in Kaesong, but Annex 22-B suggests forming a Committee on Outward Processing Zones to potentially designate zones like the KIC for preferential treatment. Concerns include the conditions of North Korean workers and the funds the complex provides to the Pyongyang regime. South Korean officials and analysts note that wages and working conditions at Kaesong are better than in the rest of North Korea. Before 2009, the monthly minimum wage in North Korea was $50, with workers receiving about $37 after deductions. The government collects about $200,000 per month from wages at the Kaesong Industrial Complex. China's investment in North Korea has been increasing significantly, with estimates suggesting Pyongyang earns around $33.52 million annually from the Kaesong Industrial Complex. Chinese businesses, supported by Beijing, are investing in various sectors of the North Korean economy, including providing machinery and equipment to local factories. According to the United Nations, Chinese investment in North Korea rose from $1.5 million in 2002 to $42 million in 2008, with 84 investment cases worth $440 million reported in January 2008. Much of this investment is focused on mineral extraction, particularly coal and iron ore, with processing often done in China. Chinese investment in mineral extraction in North Korea, particularly coal and iron ore, is increasing near the Sino-DPRK border. This represents a relaxation of North Korea's ban on cultural infiltration, allowing for international economic integration. Pyongyang views Chinese investment as less \"contaminated\" compared to investments from South Korea or other nations. Despite North Korea's isolation, it engages in trade with other countries. Despite its isolation and emphasis on juche, North Korea engages in trade with 80 countries, importing food and technology. The country relies on foreign exchange to finance its imports, using military threats and illicit activities to obtain aid and transfers from the US, Japan, South Korea, and humanitarian agencies. North Korea engages in trade with 80 countries, relying on foreign exchange to finance imports through military threats and illicit activities. Data on external economic relations suffer from reliability issues, with more accurate information on commercial transactions reported by trading partner countries and compiled by international organizations. Trade data may differ due to various factors, making it challenging to obtain detailed and reliable information on military equipment and illegal drugs trade. South Korea's trade data with North Korea differs from its reports to the United Nations, considering it as inter-Korean trade rather than foreign trade. The figures reported to the IMF for commercial transactions with North Korea are lower than those reported as inter-Korean trade. IMF data may vary from data provided by companies like Global Trade Atlas. This report combines IMF trade totals with partner country data for a more comprehensive view. In 2008, North Korea's trade deficit reached $1,326 million, with exports totaling $2,801 million and imports at $4,127 million. Imports from China increased significantly by 46% to $2,033 million. This rise in trade can be attributed to investments by South Korea and China in North Korea's mining and manufacturing sectors. In 2008, North Korea's trade deficit reached $1,326 million, with exports totaling $2,801 million and imports at $4,127 million. South Korea and China account for 60% of North Korean exports and 71% of North Korean imports. Japan's economic sanctions have greatly reduced bilateral trade. North Korea's major trading partners include China, South Korea, Japan, Russia, Germany, Thailand, and India. North Korea's major import sources include China, South Korea, Russia, Japan, and Thailand, with Germany and India also being significant suppliers. Major imports consist of machinery, minerals, plant products, and chemical products, reflecting efforts to address shortages. Despite tensions over its nuclear program, imports are increasing, fueled by energy materials, food, and supplies for the Kaesong Industrial Complex. Notably, imports from the United States and Japan are minimal. North Korea's major exports include ores, coal, animal products, textiles, machinery, electronic products, and base metals. China, South Korea, and Japan are the largest sources of imports for North Korea, with Germany and Brazil also significant trading partners. North Korea has seen an increase in exports of primary products like fish, shellfish, and mineral products. North Korea's exports include primary products like fish, shellfish, and mineral products, as well as coal and mineral exports. Pyongyang has imported technology to increase fish production and agricultural equipment for grains and livestock. The Kaesong Industrial Complex also contributes significantly to production. North Korean imports from South Korea and China exceeded $1 billion in 2006, with exports to South Korea at $765 million and to China at $582 million. Traditional exports of textiles and electrical appliances have been declining due to unstable power supply and lack of raw materials. North Korea's ability to provide a reliable manufacturing platform for assembly operations is declining due to unstable power supply and lack of raw materials. UN Resolution 1874 bans arms transfers from North Korea, including small arms. Small arms trade data is under-reported, with reported transactions totaling $5.3 million from 2001 to 2008. Importers include countries from Latin America and Europe. North Korea's annual merchandise trade deficit of about $1 billion implies that Pyongyang must either be receiving imports without immediate payment required or generating foreign exchange through legal or illegal means. Legal methods include borrowing, foreign investments, foreign aid, remittances from overseas North Korean workers, selling military equipment not reflected in trade data, and selling services abroad. Illegal methods include counterfeiting hard currency, illegal sales of military equipment or technology, sales of illegal drugs, or shipping illegal cargo between third countries. The country can also dip into its foreign exchange reserves and borrow on international capital markets. North Korea's loans from foreign banks reported to the Bank of International Settlements (BIS) decreased to $73 million in the second quarter of 2009 from $494 million in March 2008. Total liabilities to BIS banks in the first quarter of 2009 were $996 million, with most being export credits. Deposits with BIS banks also decreased to $96 million. International bond issues are not a significant source of funds for North Korea. North Korea's international bond issue has generated little interest on global financial markets and is targeted at domestic investors. Pyongyang claims a million people signed up for the bonds, but there are doubts about the voluntary nature of deductions from North Korean purchasers' salaries. The government holds a lottery for bondholders instead of paying interest, with prizes exceeding the foregone interest. Foreign direct investment in North Korea was $1,378 million in 2007, mainly from South Korea and China. Foreign direct investment in North Korea, mainly from South Korea and China, has increased. Funding for imports comes from foreign aid, government transfers, and official development assistance. OECD data tracks these financial flows. In 2004, North Korea received $1,529.6 million in net total receipts from donors, with significant contributions from France, the United Kingdom, and the United States. However, by 2007, the total dropped to $148.7 million, rose to $178.1 million in 2007, with a large portion coming from the Netherlands. The majority of these receipts were in the form of official development assistance.

They are known for operating pachinko parlors, sending remittances to North Korea, and smuggling money through unusual methods like hiding bills under expensive melons. Remittances from Japan to North Korea have reportedly been declining due to economic stagnation and rising tensions between the two countries. In FY2002, Japan sent $34 million to North Korea through financial channels requiring reports to the Japanese government. Recent sanctions lowered the remittance reporting amount from 30 million to 10 million yen. Currency from Japan is often carried by individuals on ships or sent through China without reporting. Japan has increased inspections of North Korean ships and restricted ferry operations between the two countries. North Korea receives significant financial support from South Korea, including remittances from refugees amounting to around $6 million per year. This, along with aid, investments, and special assistance related to negotiations over its nuclear program, makes up the majority of the country's annual resource inflows, totaling approximately $700 million. The remaining trade deficit of $300 to $500 million is financed through exports of military equipment and illicit activities. North Korea earns foreign currency through sales of military equipment, including ballistic missiles to countries like Iran, Iraq, Syria, Pakistan, and Yemen. Examples include the interception of Scud missile parts bound for Yemen in 2002 and a cargo plane loaded with arms in 2008. North Korea is known for its aggressive proliferation of missiles and related technologies. North Korea is the most aggressive proliferator of missiles and related technologies, earning significant revenue from arms sales. In 2001, they exported $580 million worth of ballistic missiles to the Middle East and an estimated $1 billion in conventional arms to developing nations between 1998 and 2001. Analysts suggest that their sales of short- and medium-range missile systems generate $1.5 billion annually. The arms trade was impacted by U.N. Security Council Resolution 1874, but North Korea remains a key player in the illegal drug trade. \"Drug trafficking linked to North Korea has decreased significantly, with no recent evidence of state-sponsored trafficking. However, small-scale trafficking along the DPRK-China border persists. In the past, North Korea was involved in illegal drug trade, earning millions annually. They were a major opium and heroin exporter, and also trafficked in methamphetamine stimulants.\" North Korea has been involved in drug trafficking, with reports of arrests and drug seizures dating back to 1976. Japanese authorities claim that nearly 50% of illegal drug imports into Japan come from North Korea. The U.S. State Department notes consistent defector statements about North Korea's involvement in narcotics trade. In 2006, a decree was issued warning against illegal drug activities, with severe punishments including death for offenders and their families. In May 2003, the Australian navy seized a North Korean ship, Pong Su, carrying 110 pounds of heroin worth $50 million. North Korea is also suspected of engaging in counterfeiting operations, earning $15-20 million annually. General O Kuk-ryol is reportedly involved in arranging the succession of Kim Jong-il. The United States took measures to reduce North Korea's illicit financial activities, including designating entities as weapons of mass destruction proliferators and freezing their assets. General O Kuk-ryol, involved in arranging Kim Jong-il's succession, was identified as a key figure in producing counterfeit money. In 2005, the U.S. Treasury designated Banco Delta Asia SARL as a \"primary money laundering concern\" under the Patriot Act due to its involvement in facilitating corrupt financial activities for North Korea. The Treasury finalized a rule in 2007 barring the bank from accessing the U.S. financial system but allowing the release of $25 million in North Korean funds. The United States has limited trade relations with North Korea and imposes high tariffs on North Korean exports. The United States imposes high tariffs on North Korean exports and maintains economic sanctions on the country due to national security concerns and its communist state status.

The US has shown willingness to normalize relations with North Korea, removed it from the terrorism list, and indicated readiness for discussions. The US has shown willingness to normalize relations with North Korea, removed it from the terrorism list, and indicated readiness for discussions. This is contingent on North Korea returning to the Six Party Talks and abiding by previous agreements. There is potential for North Korea's admission to international financial institutions, allowing for development assistance and increased imports from countries like the United States. US merchandise imports from North Korea have been low, with a peak in 2004. Concerns arise as imports of books, newspapers, and manuscripts have dropped to zero. U.S. imports from North Korea have decreased significantly, with books, newspapers, and manuscripts imports dropping to zero. U.S. exports to North Korea have mainly been food and energy assistance, leading to a small annual surplus in trade. There is minimal direct U.S. investment in North Korea, but some non-governmental groups operate in the country. Economic relations play a crucial role in opening communication between North and South Korea, with Seoul having a vested interest in the outcome of the Six-Party Talks. South Korea aims for a \"soft landing\" in relations with North Korea, seeking to ease tensions and integrate North Korea's economy into the global system. South Korea uses economic leverage and family reunions to engage with North Koreans while maintaining a strong military deterrent. reunification remains a distant goal due to unresolved issues. South Korea's economic ties are shifting towards China, Japan, and other Asian countries. Companies are manufacturing in low-wage markets like China to remain competitive. Trade between North and South Korea has been increasing, with South Korean exports falling in 2008. Labor costs are rising in South Korea, making the prospect of cheap labor in North Korea appealing. In 2007, South Korean exports to North Korea reached $1,032.6 million but fell to $888 million in 2008. South Korean imports from North Korea increased to $930 million from $765.3 million in 2007, with a focus on food and industrial goods. South Korea also provided humanitarian and economic assistance to North Korea totaling $3,337.00 million since 1991, but this assistance has largely stopped since 2008. Since 1992, South Korea has allowed its corporations to do business in North Korea, including companies like Daewoo, Samsung Electronics, and Hyundai. However, assistance and activities have largely stopped since 2008. Since 1992, South Korean businesses have been developing processing sites in North Korea to benefit from low labor costs, which are competitive with China. Economic ties between the two countries have been slowly progressing, including the reconnection of railway lines and highways. The focus of North-South economic cooperation is now on the Kaesong Industrial Complex, managed by South Korea's Hyundai Asan and Korea Land Corporation, attracting small and medium-sized enterprises from South Korea. The Kaesong Industrial Complex (KIC) in South Korea facilitates increased commercial trade with North Korea, generating $20 million worth of goods monthly. It offers low-cost labor for South Korean firms, employment for North Korean workers, and essential hard currency for Pyongyang. North Korea relies more on South Korea in international trade, with South Korean exports to North Korea accounting for over a third of total North Korean exports. President Lee Myung-bak highlighted South Korea's stance on inter-Korean relations in 2008. President Lee Myung-bak of South Korea emphasized a pragmatic approach to inter-Korean relations in 2008, offering assistance to North Korea to raise per capita income to $3,000 in ten years if denuclearized. In 2009, he proposed a grand bargain for North Korea to give up its nuclear program in exchange for aid and security guarantees, which was rejected. China, as North Korea's chief ally, sees the country as a strategic buffer and investment destination. China has significant influence in Pyongyang and extensive cooperation with North Korea, although strained at times. Despite a mutual defense pact signed in 1961, recent reports suggest that North Korea may not always heed China's advice. China often labels North Korean refugees as economic migrants and sends them back, while also hosting the Six-Party Talks on the North Korean nuclear issue. In August 2001, Chinese President Jiang Zemin promised increased assistance to North Korea. In April 2004, Kim Jong-il visited Beijing to discuss food aid and nuclear issues. On October 4, 2009, Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao made a \"goodwill trip\" to Pyongyang, signing agreements on economic cooperation. Friction in the Sino-North Korean relationship includes issues like Pyongyang's failure to reform its economy and nuclear concerns. Pyongyang's prevarication over nuclear and peace treaty issues, nuclear standoff with the United States, economic and political rapport with Taipei, North Korean refugee problem on the China-DPRK border, missile testing prompting Japan to acquire a Theater Missile Defense system, construction of underground missile sites near the Chinese border, and cavalier attitude towards business. China occasionally suspends aid shipments due to Pyongyang's failure to return Chinese railroad rolling stock. In 2006, missile and nuclear tests strained relations between China and the DPRK. China's relationship with North Korea has been strained due to Pyongyang's nuclear tests and missile launches. Despite warnings from Beijing, North Korea proceeded with these actions, causing China to agree to UN sanctions and restrict banking transactions and petroleum shipments to North Korea. However, China did not conduct inspections of shipments along its borders with North Korea. Analysts suggest that North Korea may be seeking more independence from China and using nuclear weapons as a way to intimidate both China and the United States. China supported stronger UN sanctions on North Korean companies after missile and nuclear tests in 2009. China's relationship with North Korea has been strained due to Pyongyang's nuclear tests and missile launches. Despite warnings from Beijing, North Korea proceeded with these actions, causing China to agree to UN sanctions and restrict banking transactions and petroleum shipments to North Korea.

China has been the DPRK's largest trading partner since the collapse of the Soviet Union, providing concessional assistance. North Korea plays a minor role in China's trade, ranking 64th in exports and 70th in imports. China is a major source of imports of petroleum for North Korea, with exports of crude oil reaching $414 million. China's exports of crude oil to North Korea reached $414 million, with total mineral fuel oil exports amounting to $585 million. Chinese exports of oil to North Korea are not sold at concessionary prices. China also provides direct aid to Pyongyang, bypassing the United Nations to pursue its own political goals independently. Chinese food aid is believed to be channeled to the military, allowing other aid to target the general population without risking regime stability. In November 2003, China transferred border security responsibility from police to army along its border with North Korea. A 20-kilometer fence was built in 2006 along the narrow areas of the Yalu River.

Japan provided 1.2 million metric tons of humanitarian food aid to North Korea between 1995 and 2004. In 2004, Japan provided 1.2 million metric tons of humanitarian food aid to North Korea through the United Nations World Food Program. Pro-Pyongyang ethnic Koreans in Japan, known as Chosen Soren, also sent cash remittances to North Korea, possibly facilitating illicit activities. Scandals revealed illegal money transfers to North Korea through Chosen Soren-affiliated credit unions. Japan froze fund transfers and overseas remittances by groups suspected of links to North Korean weapons programs after missile tests in 2006. Relations between Russia and North Korea have fluctuated over the years. The USSR provided assistance to Pyongyang during the Korean War, with trade peaking at 60% in 1998. However, relations cooled in the 1990s as Russia recognized South Korea and opted out of its defense agreement with North Korea. Currently, overall relations between Russia and North Korea have been uncertain. Russia's improving relations with North Korea include upgrading railway connections and participating in building a trans-Korean railway. Russia is crucial for North Korean security and has become a key supply source as fuel aid decreases. Moscow's strategic approach towards North Korea is seen as vital for its Asia-Pacific strategy. Moscow has unique communications with Pyongyang based on trust at the highest political levels. Russia's stance on North Korea's nuclear issue differs from the US, supporting denuclearization and peaceful resolution. Russia believes outside pressure increases tensions and military confrontation, not favoring a unified Korean Peninsula by force with US help. Russia supports a unified Korea that maintains friendly relations with all countries, opposes foreign interference in unification, and has cooled its relationship with North Korea due to missile and nuclear tests. Trade between North Korea and Russia has decreased, with North Korea ranking low among Russia's sources of imports and markets for exports. Russia has become North Korea's third largest trading partner, surpassing Japan, Germany, and Thailand. Major Russian exports to North Korea include mineral fuels, wood pulp, machinery, non-rail vehicles, iron and steel. Russian exports of mineral fuels have been declining in recent years. Russia also imports machinery, electrical machinery, glass, and plastics from North Korea. In 2006, Russia agreed to write off 80% of North Korea's $8 billion debt, paving the way for more economic cooperation. Normalization of diplomatic relations with North Korea would also involve the United States, Japan, and South Korea. Normalizing diplomatic relations with the DPRK involves the United States, Japan, and South Korea. Japan would offer compensation to North Korea for its occupation. Normalized relations allow for direct communication, information gathering, and personal interaction, helping to overcome Pyongyang propaganda. Normalization of relations with North Korea involves the United States, Japan, and South Korea. Japan has initiated talks with Pyongyang for normalized relations, while South Korea seeks diplomatic ties and potential reunification in the future. Bilateral talks between Japan and North Korea on normalization were hindered by the abduction issue in 2007 but resumed in 2008. After the abduction issue, talks between the United States and North Korea resumed in 2008. A trade agreement could be negotiated covering goods, services, and investments, similar to the 2001 agreement with Vietnam. This would grant normal trade relations status, allowing North Korean exports to enter the U.S. at lower duty rates. The agreement could also include investment opportunities, potentially leading to North Korea becoming a larger economic player in the region through trade liberalization. The United States could ease economic sanctions on North Korea if the country resolves the issues that caused the sanctions to be imposed initially. American companies and traders are mainly impacted by the sanctions, while North Korea can spend its foreign exchange in various world markets. As North Korea opens its economy, U.S. businesses can decide whether to invest there based on their own economic considerations. The United States could ease economic sanctions on North Korea to allow U.S. businesses to invest based on their economic interests. North Korea is interested in joining major IFIs like the Asian Development Bank, World Bank, and IMF, but requires certain economic data and mechanisms for membership. A special fund could be set up by Japan or South Korea to assist North Korea in its economic transition. The Bush administration resumed humanitarian aid to North Korea, while South Korea resumed fuel shipments. South Korea requested duty-free entry for products from the Kaesong Industrial Complex in the Korea-U.S. Free Trade Agreement, but it was not included. The Kaesong Industrial Complex was not included in the Korea-U.S. Free Trade Agreement, requiring legislative approval for preferential treatment."
