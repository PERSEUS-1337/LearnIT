The Technical and Miscellaneous Revenue Act of 1988 is amended to include special administrative rules for Native Corporations and buyer corporations involved in transactions permitted under specific tax reform acts. The Technical and Miscellaneous Revenue Act of 1988 is amended to include special administrative rules for Native Corporations and buyer corporations involved in transactions permitted under specific tax reform acts. The profit of a subsidiary qualified as a member of an affiliated group shall be included in the taxable income of the Native Corporation affiliated group solely for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code. An irrevocable election must be made within 120 days after the date of enactment of this amendment. The Native Corporation and electing buyer corporation must submit a joint agreement identifying themselves and their taxpayer identification numbers, stating the income assigned to the profit subsidiary, and disclosing any related profit subsidiaries of a different buyer corporation. The agreement between the Native Corporation and the buyer corporation outlines the use of losses and credits to offset income, and includes consent to extend the periods of limitations for assessment and collection. The Native Corporation transaction agreement includes consent to extend limitations for assessment and collection with respect to income of the profit subsidiary for a minimum of 120 days after the election date. The Service can refund overpayments to the Native Corporation and buyer corporation jointly. Each buyer corporation must independently elect for multiple transactions with the same Native Corporation. The election must be made for all transactions with an open assessment statute of limitations. The profit subsidiary's income subject to the election will be taxed at the rate it would have been if included in the buyer corporation's return. The tax for a Native Corporation transaction with this election can be calculated using the maximum corporate rate under the Internal Revenue Code. The common parent of an affiliated group with a Native Corporation electing under subsection (c)(1) acts as the sole agent for the profit subsidiary in Native Corporation transactions. Taxes related to the profit subsidiary's income are payable by both the profit subsidiary and the buyer corporation involved in the transaction. The Native Corporation pays taxes on behalf of the profit subsidiary in transactions with the buyer corporation. The Native Corporation can file refund claims for these payments. The Native Corporation can file refund claims for tax payments made on behalf of the profit subsidiary as the taxpayer under the Internal Revenue Code. They are entitled to file refund suits and are treated as the plaintiff for tax-related matters. The Native Corporation, acting as the plaintiff under section 1402 of title 28, United States Code, can file refund claims for tax payments made on behalf of the profit subsidiary. If an overpayment is determined, the Native Corporation is treated as the person who made the overpayment and may receive a refund jointly with the electing buyer. The electing buyer corporation has participatory rights in administrative proceedings and court cases related to Native Corporation transactions. The electing buyer corporation has participatory rights in administrative proceedings and court cases related to Native Corporation transactions. All notices and reports regarding Native Corporation transactions are issued to the Native Corporation, which must provide copies to the buyer corporation. Final determinations on issues related to the transaction are made through administrative or judicial decisions. Upon determination, any income of the profit subsidiary not offset in the Native Corporation transaction is reported on the buyer corporation's return as originally reported, subject to adjustments. The absence of an election by a Native Corporation and a buyer corporation does not restrict the Treasury Secretary's authority to settle or litigate with nonelecting buyers. The Native Corporation has the right to participate in administrative proceedings and file amicus briefs in court regarding any proposed adjustments in a transaction with a non-electing buyer corporation. The Native Corporation can participate in administrative proceedings and file amicus briefs in court for adjustments in a transaction with a non-electing buyer corporation. The Secretary of the Treasury can extend the statute of limitations if necessary for such participation, and failures to comply with this subsection do not affect the IRS's tax liability adjustments for the buyer corporation. The provision allows for an extension of the statute of limitations for assessment for Native Corporations participating in transactions with non-electing buyer corporations. The provision extends the statute of limitations for assessments for Native Corporations involved in transactions with non-electing buyer corporations.
