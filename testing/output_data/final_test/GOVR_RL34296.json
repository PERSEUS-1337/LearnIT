    "content": "Democracy promotion has become a primary component of U.S. foreign policy, particularly under the George W. Bush Administration. Efforts to spread freedom have been seen as a tool to end tyranny, fight terrorism, promote stability, and increase prosperity. Recent events in Kenya, Pakistan, and Taiwan have put democracy promotion under scrutiny. While some view it as a key foreign policy priority, others argue it is just one of many strategic objectives. The issue is debated among Members of Congress, presidential hopefuls, and the wider foreign policy community. The report discusses the background, challenges, benefits, and costs of democracy promotion efforts by the U.S. government. It highlights the historical interest in promoting democracy since World War I and the varying degrees of emphasis by different administrations. Congressional efforts to assist democratizing countries are also mentioned. The current Bush Administration sees democracy promotion as a key instrument in foreign policy. The Bush Administration views democracy promotion as crucial for peace and combating terrorism. It is a central focus of the \"war on terrorism\" and national security. Dr. Condoleezza Rice outlined three priorities for diplomacy: building an international system based on shared values, strengthening democracies to fight threats, and spreading freedom. President Bush's mission for America is to spread freedom and democracy globally, with a focus on building well-governed states that respond to their people's needs and act responsibly in the international system. This aligns with the Bush Administration's emphasis on democracy promotion as a key element in its foreign policy, as outlined by Secretary of State Rice in her transformational diplomacy plan. In the State Department's briefing, the goal of spreading democracy as a key component of U.S. foreign policy was reiterated. Americans expressed opinions on democracy promotion efforts, with the least-supported option being promoting freedom and democracy in the Islamic world. The majority of participants in a poll agreed that the U.S. cannot impose democracy by force on another country, echoing sentiments from Arab countries. Lawmakers and presidential candidates are expected to discuss their views on democracy promotion in upcoming foreign policy debates. Some candidates may reject democracy promotion entirely in response to a controversial President who prioritized it in his foreign policy. Democracy is a complex term with origins dating back to ancient Greece and Italy. It is difficult to define and can have different meanings. A common understanding includes effective participation by the people, respect for human rights, and political equality. The lack of a clear definition of democracy has created challenges for U.S. policy making. The lack of a clear definition of democracy has hindered U.S. policy making, affecting the formulation and prioritization of democracy promotion activities. This lack of consensus complicates coordination of democracy programs and assessment of government activities. Richard Haass emphasizes that democracy goes beyond elections, involving power diffusion and inclusive political participation. Elements such as independent media, unions, political parties, schools, and democratic rights for women provide checks on government power over society. Individual rights like freedom of speech and worship must be protected in a democratic government. Laurence Whitehead discusses the varying definitions of democracy across cultures and argues that the concept is flexible. Democracy requires an electable opposition and peaceful transfer of power. Whitehead argues that democracy requires minimal procedural conditions like free and fair elections, freedom of speech, and integrity of elective office. He emphasizes that democratization is a complex, long-term, and dynamic process towards a more rule-based, consensual, and participatory politics, which remains contested and unstable as democratization unfolds. Democracy, like 'democracy,' involves a mix of fact and value, leading to internal tensions. Multilateral organizations lack a consensus on democracy, as seen in Freedom House's ratings of countries' freedom levels. Freedom House assesses political rights and civil liberties to categorize countries as free, partly free, or not free. Civil liberties are essential for democracy, allowing for freedoms of expression, belief, and association without state interference. According to Freedom House, a country must have a competitive multi-party political system, universal suffrage, regularly contested elections, and public access to major political parties to be considered free. The Community of Democracies consists of over 100 nations committed to democratic principles. The Community of Democracies, formed in 2000, consists of over 100 nations committed to promoting and strengthening democracies worldwide. Congress has expressed concern over the lack of a consistent definition for democracy, with the Senate Foreign Operations Appropriation Committee Report for FY2006 highlighting the need for a common definition for democracy programs. The Senate Appropriations Committee Report for FY2007 defined 'the promotion of democracy' to include programs supporting good governance, human rights, independent media, and the rule of law. Various labels exist for different types of democratic systems, complicating the definition of democracy. Various labels exist for different types of democratic systems, including electoral democracies, liberal democracies, pseudo-democracies, and semi-authoritarian governments. Larry Diamond defines electoral democracy as a system with regular competitive multiparty elections, while liberal democracy includes a constitution directing government institutions, rule of law, and civil liberties equally to all citizens. Freedom House uses a set of requirements to categorize governments as \"free.\" Pseudo-democracies, non-democracies, and illiberal democracies are minimally democratic systems with some aspects of electoral democracies but limited competition for power among political parties. Pseudo-democracies have hegemonic party systems that restrict opposition parties, while non-democracies include semi-authoritarian and authoritarian regimes. Authoritarian regimes may have a level of freedom or hold elections, while totalitarian regimes are rigidly closed governments. Illiberal democracies have elections but lack civil liberties and political rights. Critics argue past democracy promotion efforts focused too much on elections, ignoring key democratic principles like tolerance for minority views and freedom of the press. Extending democracy is believed to reduce terrorism and promote global stability and prosperity. In the 2006 National Strategy for Combating Terrorism, the George W. Bush Administration promotes democracy as a solution for the War on Terror. However, some argue that democracy promotion can destabilize countries and regions, leading to backlash and restrictions on freedom. The success and costs of democracy promotion vary depending on the circumstances, with some scholars believing it can succeed even in challenging environments. The desire for democracy can energize both elite and popular opinion in various countries and regions, driving long-term change. Durable democracies evolve under pressure from citizens and adapt to societal expectations. Democracy promotion advocates like Madeleine Albright believe in the transformative power of citizen-driven regimes. The democratic peace theory suggests that democracies do not go to war with each other, as stated in President Clinton's National Security Strategy of Engagement and Enlargement. Mature democracies are less likely to engage in wars, while countries transitioning to democracy may be more prone to conflict due to weak governmental institutions. The George W. Bush Administration believes that promoting democracy is key to combating terrorism by addressing issues such as inequality, lack of freedom, and poor education. Countries transitioning to democracy may be more prone to conflict due to weak governmental institutions. Effective democracies can defeat terrorism in the long run by maintaining order, providing an independent justice system, and promoting economic prosperity. Stable democracies are seen as good trading partners, attract outside investors, and are more likely to honor treaties. According to critics, promoting democracy as a key aspect of U.S. national security has led to skepticism and reduced support worldwide. The conflation of the Iraq war with democracy promotion has blurred the project's meaning, alienating some from democracy promotion efforts. Critics argue that imposing democracy from outside, rather than local initiation, comes with high military and opportunity costs. Critics argue that democracy promotion efforts, often initiated externally, compete with domestic priorities and can be costly with uncertain long-term benefits. Concerns include high opportunity costs, potential destabilization of regions, and the risk of sustaining expensive nation-building programs. A 2005 Harvard Study found that incomplete democratic transitions increase the likelihood of involvement in conflicts. Incomplete democratic transitions increase the chance of involvement in international war in countries with weak governmental institutions. Critics of democracy promotion argue that the theory of democratic peace is limited to the Cold War era, between 1946 and 1980. Some criticize democracy promotion for interfering in foreign politics, leading to backlash. The US has invested in promoting democracy in Russia, Eastern Europe, and the Middle East, but recent events have raised doubts about its effectiveness. Assistance for civil society strengthening can also have human rights repercussions. Assistance for civil society strengthening can lead to human rights repercussions, prompting governments to restrict NGO activities. Despite challenges, a 2006 USAID study found that U.S. democracy and governance assistance positively impacts global democracy growth. The concept of a perfect democracy is unattainable, as democracies can evolve or regress in their responsiveness and accountability to citizens. Successful transitions to democracy offer hope for ongoing and future efforts. Successful transitions to democracy in the 1980s, such as Chile, the Philippines, Poland, and South Africa, provide hope for ongoing and future efforts. Other successful cases like Taiwan, South Korea, Mozambique, and Mali show the variety of circumstances from which democracy can emerge. Additionally, transitions from conflict in Algeria, Bosnia, El Salvador, Liberia, Serbia, and Sierra Leone have been viewed as successful by some experts. Despite challenges, democratization has shown promise. Despite some successful transitions to democracy in the past, recent studies show that democratization remains uncertain, with only 23% resulting in democratic governments. Backsliding is common, with notable cases in Russia, Central Asia, and Kenya. Global democratization has slowed, and many countries are now resisting international efforts. The United States provides democracy assistance to various nations. The United States provides democracy assistance to countries in different circumstances, aiming to facilitate transitions from authoritarian or communist rule, or from conflict. Democracy promotion activities range from elections assistance to funding civil society groups. Experts and practitioners have varying views on the success factors, program emphasis, and time frame needed for enduring democracy. Post-conflict situations pose challenges for achieving democratic government, with varying success rates even in relatively smooth transitions like in Central Europe. Thomas Carothers highlights the harsh realities of politics, including competing interests and power struggles, which can hinder the establishment of democracy. Recent events in Central Europe and countries like Kenya show that democratic change in post-authoritarian settings is challenging. The traditional view that democracy is achieved through free and fair elections or persuading leaders to govern democratically has evolved. Analysts now recognize that sustainable democracy requires meeting various conditions beyond just holding elections, as they may exclude significant portions of the population from participating in decision-making processes. The establishment of strong democratic institutions is crucial for the consolidation of democracy, according to Diamond. These institutions must uphold the rule of law and protect individual and group rights. Key institutions include political parties, legislatures, judicial systems, local government, and state bureaucracies. Carothers highlights the challenges faced by democracy assistance programs in establishing viable institutions, such as entrenched political power, patronage, corruption, and hostile socioeconomic or ethnic groups. He suggests incorporating underlying interests and power relationships into assistance programs for greater effectiveness, but warns that significant efforts are needed for successful outcomes. The promotion of democracy involves understanding power dynamics and building a strong civil society. Effective programs require deep knowledge of the recipient society. A vibrant civil society is crucial for a functioning democracy, as seen in successful transitions post-conflict or post-authoritarian regimes. Investing in civic nonviolent forces can increase the chances of successful democratic support. International intervention in East Timor is cited as a positive example due to significant investment in independent civil society. Investing in a vibrant civil society is crucial for successful democratic transitions, as seen in post-conflict or post-authoritarian regimes. International intervention in East Timor is praised for its significant investment in independent civil society, which is essential for the future of democracy. Lack of funding is a major obstacle for creating strong civil society non-governmental organizations. Diamond emphasizes that a pluralistic, resourceful, and institutionalized civil society increases the likelihood of democracy emerging and enduring. The lack of funding is a significant obstacle for civil society organizations in developing countries. Without international support, these organizations may have to rely on state funding, which can create its own challenges. Analysts' opinions on the importance of funding, state support, and social capital for democracy can vary. Karatnycky considers Nicaragua and El Salvador as success stories in building stable civil societies despite past conflicts. In the 1980s, Nicaragua and El Salvador were seen as success stories in building stable democracies with competitive multiparty systems. Factors such as strengthening democratic civil society in Nicaragua and centrist reform movements in El Salvador played a role. The presence of multiparty electoral structures during periods of conflict also helped in using elections for national reconciliation. Democracy promotion faces challenges in identifying appropriate modes and settings for assistance, especially in transitions from conflict. Post-conflict transitions present greater challenges than transitions from authoritarian regimes, involving overcoming divided societies and economic devastation. Ethnic loyalties can complicate peace settlements, requiring careful considerations like timing of elections, broader negotiations, and avoiding winner-take-all scenarios. Aid providers are emphasizing reconciliation as a crucial element in post-conflict settings. In post-conflict settings, aid providers are focusing on reconciliation as a key element of democratization. Success in democracy promotion can vary based on the nature of the conflict, with political conflicts more conducive to democracy building. Countries with previous democratic experience are more likely to succeed in establishing democracy. Countries with no history of democracy, desperate economic conditions, and powerful internal divisions struggle more with democracy than those with pluralistic traditions, a growing economy, and cohesive social and cultural makeup. Democracy promoters are starting to consider a wider range of factors beyond political institutions, such as economic conditions, education levels, historical traditions, and social divisions. Different political paths require different approaches for democracy aid. Some analysts downplay ethnic and cultural factors as obstacles to democracy promotion. The level of effort put into democratic transitions in countries like Germany, Japan, Bosnia, and Kosovo led to relative success compared to Somalia, Haiti, and Afghanistan. The United States and its allies invested significantly more money and troops in postconflict Kosovo than in postconflict Afghanistan, resulting in higher levels of democratic institution development and economic growth. Democracy promotion can succeed despite challenges, as seen in the spread of democracy in various regions worldwide. Democracy can take root in various cultures and economies, as seen in Bosnia-Herzegovina's transition. Different perspectives on success reflect factors examined and time frames. Karatnycky criticizes the 1995 Dayton Accord for freezing Bosnia in an ethno-political deadlock, while a RAND study sees Bosnia as achieving important successes in creating a united, multiethnic state. The RAND study highlights Bosnia's success in creating a united, multiethnic state, attributing it to international efforts and the prospect of EU and NATO membership. The impact of democracy promotion projects on democratization is deemed challenging to measure, according to the National Endowment for Democracy. The National Endowment for Democracy (NED) acknowledges the difficulty in measuring the impact of democracy promotion projects on democratization. Success in democratization can have various definitions and cannot be quantified in a meaningful way, even qualitatively. Factors such as high-risk cases, operating conditions, and long-term investments in countries must be considered in assessments. Measuring the effects of democracy promotion projects can be challenging, especially in countries where democratization is not expected to occur for many years. There is a lack of comprehensive assessment of global results and derivative materials for practitioners, posing a policy problem. Currently, there is a scarcity of literature to guide senior policymakers and those in the democracy promotion business. Case studies of previous successes in democracy assistance are scarce in the public domain, leading to a lack of educational materials for students specializing in this field. The U.S. government, including both the executive and congressional branches, has been actively involved in promoting democracy globally. The Bush Administration, particularly through Secretary Rice's Transformational Diplomacy, has emphasized reforming diplomacy and foreign assistance to support democracy in other countries. Specific executive branch activities include providing aid for election support. Government activities supporting democracy reform include aid for election procedures, good governance practices, legal system building, military and police training, and promoting a free press. Public diplomacy programs like U.S. international broadcasting and exchanges showcase American democracy and culture. The Millennium Challenge Account provides foreign aid to countries making progress in democratic and economic reform. The Department of State leads democracy promotion efforts, with involvement from other agencies like the U.S. Agency for International Development. The U.S. government supports democracy promotion activities through various agencies like USAID, Departments of Defense and Justice, and NGOs like NED and The Asia Foundation. Funding for democracy programs is primarily within the State Department/Foreign Operations budget, allocated by account and region. This includes support for Rule of Law and Human Rights. The U.S. government funds democracy promotion activities through various agencies and NGOs like NED and The Asia Foundation. Funding supports constitutions, laws, justice systems, human rights, legislative functions, security sector governance, political processes, civil society, media freedom, and civic participation. The Department of State budget includes funds transferred to NED and The Asia Foundation for democracy programs. NED's FY2008 total request is $80 million, with $70 million for democracy program support, while The Asia Foundation's FY2008 total budget request is $10 million, with $8.8 million for democracy programs. The Asia Foundation's FY2008 total budget request is $10 million, with about $8.8 million allocated for democracy promotion. The U.S. government also contributes to various multilateral efforts to promote democratic reform globally. Secretary Rice announced the establishment of the Advisory Commission on Democracy Promotion to provide constructive criticism and suggestions on democracy promotion efforts. The Advisory Commission on Democracy Promotion will provide constructive criticism and suggestions for improving democracy promotion efforts. Experts suggest that a coordination mechanism is needed to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of democracy promotion programs and prevent them from conflicting with each other. Improved communication and specialization among developed democracies could further enhance democracy promotion worldwide while reducing costs. Congress influences U.S. democracy promotion programs by setting funding levels and providing oversight. The House of Representatives created the House Democracy Assistance Commission to aid other governments' legislative branches. Legislation has been introduced and passed to authorize funds for democracy promotion in specific countries and regions. Substantial sums have been allocated for democracy programs through annual State Department and Foreign Operations Appropriations. In FY2006, Congress allocated $94.1 million for democracy promotion activities through the Democracy Fund. The Implementation of the 9/11 Commission Act also included provisions for advancing democratic values. Additionally, the ADVANCE Democracy Act of 2007 aimed to promote democracy in foreign countries and strengthen the \"Community of Democracies.\" The 110th Congress introduced bills to support democracy in non-democracies and individual countries like Ukraine, Venezuela, Afghanistan, Vietnam, and Serbia. The House Democracy Assistance Commission (HDAC) was established in 2005 to provide expert advice on legislative operations to new democracies. The House Democracy Assistance Commission (HDAC) was established in 2005 to provide expert advice on legislative operations to new democracies, assisting legislatures of 12 countries worldwide. Experts have yet to conduct comprehensive studies to establish a cause-and-effect relationship between efforts and outcomes in democracy promotion. There is a debate over the appropriate balance of U.S. interests and risks in different types of cases. Assistance in democracy promotion is targeted at countries already undergoing democratic transitions with strong domestic support. The value of U.S. and other assistance programs is believed to have a positive impact at a relatively low cost, mainly through training and technical assistance. Even in countries like Russia where democracy may be in retreat, investing in programs to promote stability and democracy in post-conflict societies is seen as valuable. These efforts, though costly and uncertain, can potentially bring stability to crisis regions and prevent the rise of failed states and terrorism. Efforts to promote stability and democracy in post-conflict societies can bring positive results in crisis regions, prevent failed states, and deny terrorist sanctuaries. Policy makers debate the high-cost and high-risk cases of fostering transitions from authoritarian regimes or imposing regime change through military intervention. Challenges remain in promoting democracy in authoritarian states that are key allies, with a focus on pressuring governments to ease repression. Some believe that pressuring authoritarian governments to reform could lead to worse outcomes, as these regimes are crucial allies in the fight against terrorism. However, failure to oppose corrupt regimes hinders US efforts to win hearts and minds, especially in the Islamic world. Military intervention for regime change is problematic, with success seen in cases like Grenada in 1983. Military intervention for regime change has had mixed success, with examples like Grenada in 1983 and Panama in 1989 showing positive outcomes. However, challenges in establishing democracy in cases like Afghanistan and Iraq raise questions about cultural and institutional readiness for democracy. Some argue that promoting democracy in these countries is crucial for US interests in the Middle East, while others doubt the feasibility of democracy in such contexts. The United States faces challenges in promoting democracy in countries with mixed success in military interventions for regime change. Questions arise about the readiness for democracy in countries like Afghanistan and Iraq. Despite the importance of democracy promotion for US interests in the Middle East, concerns persist about the sustainability and effectiveness of such efforts. The Community of Democracies requires countries to meet specific criteria to become members, including free and fair elections, the freedom to form political parties, the rule of law, and the obligation of elected governments to protect the constitution. The Community of Democracies requires countries to meet specific criteria to become members, including free and fair elections, the freedom to form political parties, the rule of law, separation of powers, independence of the judiciary, accountability of the military to civilian government, respect for human rights and freedoms, including freedom of thought, speech, and media, and the right to a fair trial. The curr_chunk emphasizes the importance of human rights, including the right to a fair trial, gender equality, rights of children and minorities, and the freedom to shape one's own destiny. Governments are tasked with defending and protecting these rights through appropriate legislation. Congressional interest in U.S. policies promoting democracy globally has a long history, with support for aid programs post-World War II to foster stable democracies in Western Europe and Japan. However, during the Cold War, authoritarian regimes were sometimes backed as a perceived defense against threats. During the Cold War, Congress supported authoritarian regimes in Spain, Portugal, Greece, and Turkey to counter communism. In the 1970s, Congress focused on fostering liberalization in Eastern Europe, leading to the establishment of the Helsinki Commission in 1976 to oversee U.S. efforts in implementing provisions for easing tensions. During the Cold War, Congress supported authoritarian regimes in Spain, Portugal, Greece, and Turkey to counter communism. In the 1970s, Congress focused on fostering liberalization in Eastern Europe, leading to the establishment of the Helsinki Commission in 1976 to oversee U.S. efforts in implementing provisions for easing tensions. The renamed Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) now supports democratic development in 56 member states, including the Caucasus and Central Asia. Members of Congress are actively involved through the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly, established in 1991, to monitor and support OSCE activities post-communism in central and eastern Europe and the collapse of the Soviet Union. Members of Congress have been instrumental in promoting U.S. government democracy assistance programs in the region. During the Cold War, Congress supported authoritarian regimes in Spain, Portugal, Greece, and Turkey to counter communism. In the 1970s, Congress focused on fostering liberalization in Eastern Europe, leading to the establishment of the Helsinki Commission in 1976. The Support for East European Democracy (SEED) Act of 1989 and the FREEDOM Support Act (FSA) of 1991 provided democratic assistance to the region. Congressional interest in democracy promotion became more universal as the democratic tide spread globally in the early 1990s. Congress has supported democracy-focused conditionality in international agreements and measures granting trade benefits to foreign countries. The use of democracy clauses in international agreements has gained interest with the expansion of democracies worldwide. Regional security and trade organizations often include democracy criteria for membership. Some organizations like North Atlantic, European, and Inter-American groups have far-reaching democracy clauses. Enforcement mechanisms vary, with few explicitly requiring expulsion of non-democratic countries. A 2000 Ministerial Conference discussed incorporating democracy clauses in charter documents for multinational organizations. NATO was established in 1949 as a security alliance with \"shared values.\" Membership criteria did not initially specify democracy, but it became a requirement in the 1990s. The EU implicitly requires member countries to be democracies. The EU emphasizes democracy in member countries and new accession requirements. It uses economic leverage to promote democracy and human rights globally. NATO and EU membership requirements have facilitated democratic transitions in central and eastern Europe. Members of Congress advocate for further NATO enlargement and EU expansion. Members of Congress are pushing for NATO enlargement and urging the EU to accept new members. Bills like H.R. 987 and S. 494 seek to admit new NATO members. Congress values maintaining legislative relationships with key allies and organizations through multilateral parliamentary groups. Regular exchanges are held with NATO Parliamentary Assembly, OSCE Parliamentary Assembly, and Transatlantic Dialogue. Bilateral exchanges are also conducted with Canada, Mexico, and other democratic parliaments. Inter-parliamentary exchanges between the U.S. Congress and various countries have been ongoing, including with Canada, Mexico, Britain, Germany, Japan, South Korea, China, and the Baltic States. These meetings allow Members to establish contacts, share best practices, and address issues such as human rights. The U.S. was a founding member of the Interparliamentary Union (IPU) but withdrew in 1999. Congress has also been involved in democracy programs to strengthen legislatures in new democracies since the fall of the Berlin wall in 1989. In 1990, Congress established a program to assist new democracies in Central and Eastern Europe, starting with Poland. The program provided computers, library materials, and training from the U.S. Senate to the Polish Senate. The House of Representatives launched a bipartisan Task Force in 1990 to support new democratic parliaments in central and eastern Europe. The initiative focused on countries like Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Albania, Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Romania. In 1993, the Congressional Research Service initiated programs of cooperation with Russian and Ukrainian legislatures, following the split of Czechoslovakia and including Romania. The objective was to provide practical assistance in developing legislative infrastructures in Eastern Europe without imposing specific solutions or models. The focus was on offering comparative information on legislative approaches from the United States and other countries. The Task Force established a legislature-to-legislature program to provide technical assistance in strengthening parliamentary infrastructure in new democracies. The programs aimed to improve efficiency, enhance professionalism, and increase transparency and accountability in legislatures. These short-term programs were completed by the end of 1996 and became a major focus of USAID-funded projects. The U.S. House of Representatives program, part of USAID-funded projects, played a crucial role in strengthening new democracies' legislatures. Members of Congress directly engaged with MPs, providing support and goodwill towards the United States. Members of the 109th Congress later initiated a new program to assist. The House Democracy Assistance Commission (HDAC) was created by the 109th Congress to help strengthen legislative institutions in new democracies. Representative David Dreier was named Chairman, and Representative David Price was named the ranking Member. Speaker Dennis Hastert emphasized the importance of promoting democracy globally through this initiative. The House Democracy Assistance Commission (HDAC) was established to strengthen legislative institutions in new democracies. Representative David Dreier was appointed Chairman, and Representative David Price as the ranking Member. The Commission aims to advise on committee operations, oversight, parliamentary procedure, and the establishment of services like the CRS and CBO. Legislation was introduced in 2007 to reauthorize the Commission, with 20 Members appointed to serve. The House Democracy Assistance Commission (HDAC) was established with 20 Members (11 Democrats and 9 Republicans) in the 110th Congress. Its mission is to strengthen democratic institutions in emerging democracies by providing technical expertise to enhance accountability, transparency, legislative independence, and government oversight in partner parliaments. The Commission works with selected countries to offer expert advice and make recommendations to USAID for needed material support. The House Democracy Assistance Commission (HDAC) works with selected countries to provide technical expertise and make recommendations to USAID for material assistance to improve the efficiency and transparency of their parliaments. 12 countries have been selected for programs, with Iraq as a candidate country. HDAC transfers funds to USAID to manage the programs."
