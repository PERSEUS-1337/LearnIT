    "content": "Various sources, including Congress, the President, state and local government officials, and special commissions, have driven interest in budget process reform. Congress reformed its internal budget process with the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974, resolving conflicts with President Richard Nixon. President Bill Clinton sought line-item veto authority, granted in 1996 but invalidated in 1998. State and local officials played a role in passing the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995. Special commissions like the 9/11 Commission have also recommended budget changes that were implemented. President George W. Bush and President-elect Barack Obama have proposed various changes in budget procedure, including enhanced controls over spending, baseline calculation changes, earmark reform, and biennial budgeting. Obama signaled his interest in pursuing budget process reform during the 111th Congress. During the 111th Congress, President-elect Obama announced his intention to nominate Peter Orszag as director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and Rob Nabors as OMB deputy director, emphasizing the need for budget reform due to rising deficits and a sinking economy. Concerns about the federal deficit, which increased significantly during the economic downturn, have driven calls for budget process reform. The Congressional Budget Office projected a baseline deficit of $1.3 trillion for FY2010. The Congressional Budget Office estimated a baseline deficit of $1.3 trillion for FY2010 and $1.0 trillion for FY2011, continuing at high levels through FY2020. Interest in procedural reform has been fueled by the deficit's unsustainable path. Private organizations announced the Peterson-Pew Commission on Budget Reform to foster changes in the budget process. President-elect Obama held a fiscal responsibility summit focusing on long-term obligations for entitlement programs. President Obama proposed budget process reforms in his FY2010 and FY2011 budgets, including restoring the \"pay-as-you-go\" requirement and expedited legislative procedures. He aimed to cut the deficit in half by the end of his first term. The federal budget process is influenced by constitutional mandates, statutory requirements, and administrative directives. Changes can occur through rules in either chamber or broader legislative changes involving statutes or constitutional amendments, which may require more participants and time to reach agreement. Legislative changes can take the form of freestanding bills or joint resolutions. Changes in the budget process can take various forms, such as freestanding bills or joint resolutions, and may be incorporated into other budgetary legislation. These changes can be included in acts raising the debt limit, implementing reconciliation instructions, providing annual appropriations, or in the annual budget resolution. Some years see comprehensive changes in the budget process, with key legislative acts like the Budget and Accounting Act of 1921, the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, and the Budget Enforcement Act. The Budget process has undergone various changes over the years through legislative acts like the Budget and Accounting Act of 1921, the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, and the Budget Enforcement Act of 1990. Additional budget controls were imposed temporarily in certain years, with modifications made to existing budget process statutes. Congress and the President have enacted statutes altering selected aspects of the budget process, subject to judicial review. The Supreme Court has invalidated certain procedures established by Congress and the President on constitutional grounds. In the wake of court decisions, Congress and the President may modify legislation, but sometimes efforts to enact corrective legislation do not succeed. Interest in the budget process and proposals to change it radiate throughout both the House and Senate committees. Budgetary impact and interest in the budget process and proposals to change it are prominent in both chambers of Congress. Various committees have jurisdiction over budget procedures, with opportunities to make changes typically arising at the start of a new Congress. The House must adopt its rules anew at the beginning of each Congress, often incorporating modifications, including changes in the budget process, through a simple resolution. The House adopted the opening-day rules package for the 111th Congress, H.Res. 5, with modifications to the budget process, including changes to the \"pay-as-you-go\" rule and earmarking rules. Budget process changes can also occur during the annual budget resolution in March and April. Various procedural provisions were incorporated into the FY2010 budget resolution (S.Con.Res. 13) in a separate title (Title IV\u2014Budget Process), including restrictions on advance appropriations and emergency designations, procedures to adjust budget levels, and a Senate point of order on short-term deficits. Congress can also discuss budget process reforms during nominations for OMB director and deputy director positions. The Senate Budget Committee and the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee held hearings in January 2009 on President-elect Obama's choices for OMB director and deputy director. Budget process reform proposals were discussed, including addressing entitlement spending growth and integrating budgeting with performance evaluation. President Obama and Congress continued to address budget process reform in 2010. President Obama established the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform through executive order and implemented the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010. Various budget process reform proposals were considered during the 111th Congress, including internal PAYGO rules, discretionary spending limits, earmarking, and modifications to budget resolution and reconciliation processes. Federal budget legislation from 1991 to 2002 was constrained by statutory limits on discretionary spending and a PAYGO requirement for direct spending. The Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 established discretionary spending limits and a PAYGO requirement for direct spending and revenue legislation. These budget constraints were enforced by sequestration, but expired in 2002. There is interest in restoring and modifying these enforcement procedures. The Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 promoted fiscal discipline in the 1990s, leading to a budget surplus in FY1998. There is debate over restoring such mechanisms, particularly regarding the application of the PAYGO requirement to revenue legislation. The Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 promoted fiscal discipline in the 1990s, leading to a budget surplus in FY1998. Debate exists over reinstating the PAYGO requirement, with President Obama proposing the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2009 to apply to both direct spending and revenue legislation. The House passed a bill (H.R. 2920) in response, and the Senate added a statutory provision in January 2010. The Statutory PAYGO Act of 2010 was signed into law to enforce budget neutrality on new revenue and direct spending legislation. The OMB director records the budgetary effects on two PAYGO scorecards covering rolling 5-year and 10-year periods. The PAYGO process involves determining budgetary effects of measures through statements in the Congressional Record, with CBO estimates. OMB finalizes scorecards after each session to check for violations. If a violation occurs, the President issues sequestration orders for across-the-board cuts in nonexempt direct spending programs. If no violation is found, the process repeats in the next session. During the 111th Congress, the Senate considered amendments for establishing shorter-term discretionary spending limits to ensure realistic and effective constraints on spending. Advocates argue that shorter-term limits are more likely to be realistic and prevent evasions through gimmickry. The Senate established its own PAYGO rule in 1993 as a provision in the FY1994 budget resolution, which has been modified several times. The House also had unsuccessful efforts to establish a PAYGO rule, but eventually adopted one in the 110th Congress. The House's PAYGO rule prohibits revenue and direct spending legislation that increases a deficit over different time periods. The Senate revised its PAYGO rule in May 2007 as part of the FY2008 budget resolution, aligning closely with the House rule. It expires on September 30, 2017, and can only be waived by a three-fifths vote. Controversy arose in the 110th Congress over compliance and waivers for major legislation related to the housing crisis and economic downturn. In response to concerns over increasing the deficit, modifications to the House PAYGO rule were made in 2009, aligning with the Senate rule and allowing for exceptions in emergency situations. Earmark rules were also reformed in 2007 and 2009 by the House and Senate. Some changes in earmark rules and practices occurred at the beginning of the 111th Congress, with ongoing reforms being considered. Earmarks are allocations of resources to specific beneficiaries, either through discretionary spending, tax benefits, or tariff benefits. Concerns arose due to earmarks being inserted without sponsor identification, leading to wasteful spending. Earmark reform proposals aim to bar consideration of such practices in legislation. The earmark reform proposals aim to bar legislation that does not identify individual earmarks and their sponsors, ensuring transparency and preventing wasteful spending. These provisions were added to the House rules for the 110th Congress, requiring earmark sponsors to certify no financial interest in the earmark. The House adopted H.Res. 491 on June 18, 2007, establishing a point of order to prevent \"air-dropping\" earmark provisions into appropriations acts. The Senate also adopted ethics reform legislation on January 18, 2007, requiring the prior identification of earmarks and their sponsors in all spending and revenue legislation. The Senate Appropriations Committee, led by Senator Robert C. Byrd, announced a policy requiring earmark disclosure for FY2008 appropriations. The House passed S. 1 with an amendment, and the Senate agreed, leading to the signing of the Honest Leadership and Open Government Act of 2007 into law. At the beginning of the 111th Congress in 2009, changes were made to earmark practices, including requirements for Members to disclose earmark requests, dissemination of earmark disclosure tables, and reductions in earmarks to 50% of the FY2006 level for non-project-based accounts. The House also adopted changes in its earmark rules as part of its action on H.Res. 5. In March 2010, earmark policies from the prior Congress were continued for FY2011 appropriations. The House Appropriations Committee banned earmarks for for-profit companies, and House Republicans agreed to a moratorium on all earmarks for FY2011. The Congressional Budget Act of 1974 requires the House and Senate to adopt a budget resolution each year. The Congressional Budget Act of 1974 requires the adoption of a budget resolution each year, outlining spending and revenue levels for at least five fiscal years. The resolution guides congressional action on spending, revenue, and debt-limit measures, with an optional reconciliation procedure for related legislation. Some suggest making the budget resolution a joint resolution requiring the President's approval for more effective enforcement of budget policies. The Congressional Budget Act of 1974 requires a budget resolution each year, outlining spending and revenue levels for at least five fiscal years. Some propose making it a joint resolution requiring the President's approval for better enforcement. Concerns arise about delays if an impasse is reached. The Senate has a 50-hour limit for consideration, leading to a \"vote-arama\" situation with pending amendments. Efforts have been made to eliminate \"vote-aramas\" in past Congresses. Efforts to eliminate \"vote-aramas\" in Congress have been ongoing, with some proposing changes to the reconciliation process to only reduce the deficit. The House included a ban against this in Section 402 of H.Res. 6 for the 110th Congress. The House and Senate implemented bans on budget resolutions with reconciliation directives that would increase the deficit or reduce the surplus over specific time periods. Reconciliation bills are subject to expedited procedures in the Senate, leading to the issue of \"vote-arama.\" Discretionary spending, which makes up a significant portion of federal spending, is allocated annually through various appropriations acts. During the 109th and 110th Congresses, the House and Senate Appropriations Committees restructured their subcommittees to streamline the appropriations process. This included disbanding certain subcommittees and realigning others, resulting in each committee having 12 subcommittees. During the 110th Congress, committees were restructured with 12 subcommittees each. The House Appropriations Committee established a Select Intelligence Oversight Panel in response to the 9/11 Commission's recommendations, focusing on intelligence activities and budgets. The House Appropriations Committee may address the commission's recommendation on intelligence activities in the 111th Congress. An automatic continuing resolution has been proposed to prevent government shutdowns due to funding expiration, ensuring uninterrupted funding for discretionary activities. Some advocate for an automatic continuing resolution to avoid employee furloughs and service disruptions, but others see it as replacing informed decision making. The President can approve or veto spending or revenue acts in full, and impound funds through rescission or deferral. Congress follows procedures under the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974. The Line Item Veto Act of 1996 was struck down by the Supreme Court in 1998. In 1998, the Supreme Court struck down the Line Item Veto Act of 1996, which authorized the President to strike individual items of discretionary spending. Various proposals have been made in Congress to grant item veto authority to the President, including President George W. Bush's proposal for a \"legislative line-item veto\" in 2006. The House passed the Legislative Line Item Veto Act of 2006, but the Senate did not act on the measure. Senator Judd Gregg also proposed a legislative line-item veto in the 110th Congress. President Obama proposed expedited legislative procedures for rescission proposals in his FY2010 and FY2011 budget submissions. Representative John Spratt introduced the Reduce Unnecessary Spending Act of 2010 as H.R. 5454. Advocates argue that item veto powers enhance budgetary discipline, while critics believe they may upset the balance of power between Congress and the President. The federal budget's long-term imbalances have garnered significant attention. The federal budget's long-term imbalances, particularly in Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, have led to proposals for a bipartisan commission to recommend legislative changes. Advocates believe this approach would overcome political opposition and expedite the decision-making process, while others argue for regular legislative procedures for more openness and participation. During the 110th Congress, a bipartisan proposal called the Bipartisan Task Force for Responsible Fiscal Action Act of 2007 was introduced by Senators Kent Conrad and Judd Gregg, and Representatives Jim Cooper and Frank Wolf. The bill aimed to establish a 16-member task force to develop legislative recommendations by December 9, 2008, to improve the federal budget's long-term balances, including Social Security and Medicare. The recommendations would require approval from at least 12 task force members. The Bipartisan Task Force proposal required approval from at least 12 members and aimed to improve the federal budget's long-term balances. The House and Senate would consider the recommendations during the 2009 congressional session under expedited procedures. Senators Conrad and Gregg advocated for the approach, with a similar bill introduced in the House and Senate. Senators Conrad and Gregg introduced S. 2853, the Bipartisan Task Force for Responsible Fiscal Action Act of 2009, on December 9, 2009. Competing amendments to establish a Bipartisan Task Force for Responsible Fiscal Act were considered during the debt-limit measure debate in January 2010. The Conrad-Gregg amendment failed to secure enough votes and was withdrawn, leading President Obama to create a commission by executive order on February 18, 2010. Obama created the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform through Executive Order 13531 on February 18, 2010. The commission aims to improve the fiscal situation in the medium term and achieve long-term fiscal sustainability. It consists of 18 members, with a requirement of at least 14 affirmative votes for any recommendations to be issued. This ensures bipartisan support for the commission's proposals. Advocates of capital budgeting see it as a way to increase resources for infrastructure needs and improve decision-making, while critics have concerns about its adoption for the federal government. Critics of capital budgeting argue that shifting a significant portion of the budget to an accrual basis would complicate decision-making and setting priorities. Some suggest more information gathering and analysis for infrastructure needs, including the creation of a National Commission on the Infrastructure of the United States. Biennial budgeting proposals aim to streamline Congress's budgetary legislation process by changing the cycle to two years. This would allow more time for oversight of federal agencies and programs, but some argue it could hinder Congress's ability to respond quickly to economic changes. The curr_chunk provides a list of key budget-related legislation including the Budget and Accounting Procedures Act of 1950, the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974, the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, the Budget Enforcement Act of 1990, and others. The curr_chunk lists key budget-related legislation including the Line Item Veto Act, Budget Enforcement Act of 1997, and Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010.
