It is in the best interest of all parties to settle remaining issues, including the Tribe's claims against the United States, as outlined in the Settlement Agreement of 1995. The Settlement Agreement allows the Tribe to make agreements with Navajo families to stay on Hopi Partitioned Lands for 75 years, respecting their traditional beliefs and culture.

Newly acquired trust lands have specific water rights including reasonable use of groundwater, existing surface water rights under State law, and the right to make further beneficial use of unappropriated water. The Tribe's water rights for these lands are not subject to forfeiture or abandonment. The Tribe's water rights for newly acquired trust lands include recognizing valid uses of groundwater from existing wells and not objecting to such uses based on water rights associated with the lands. They may only object to groundwater impacts initiated after the lands are taken into trust, following State law guidelines. The Tribe and the United States will not object to groundwater uses impacting the Tribe's surface water rights if the groundwater uses were initiated before the Tribe's beneficial use of surface water. For newly acquired trust lands, existing surface water uses will be recognized as valid, and objections based on water rights associated with the lands will not be allowed. The Tribe has the right to enforce these provisions. The Tribe and the United States recognize State law applies to water uses on lands within newly acquired trust lands not owned by the Tribe. They have the right to enforce priority of their senior surface water rights against junior water rights that interfere with their use. They can object to water rights and uses on currently existing trust lands based on their water rights.

(h) It clarifies that the law applicable to water use on lands owned by the United States, other than the newly acquired trust lands, is not determined by this section. The granting of water rights on newly acquired trust lands does not imply a Federal reserved water right, and there is no establishment of a Federal reserved right to groundwater in this section or the Act. The Secretary's authority to take land into trust for the Tribe is solely provided by this Act and the Settlement Agreement. The curr_chunk is about the roles of the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the Vice President of the United States as President of the Senate."
