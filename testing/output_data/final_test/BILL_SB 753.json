    "title": "SB 753",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Criminal Justice Reinvestment Assessment Grant Program of 2015, established in Section 6033 of the Penal Code, aims to reduce recidivism among criminal offenders and provide funding for local governments to implement public safety policies from the 2011 Realignment Legislation. The 2011 Realignment Legislation on public safety aims to manage criminal justice populations more cost-effectively, reinvesting savings in evidence-based strategies for increased public safety and offender accountability. The legislation represents a significant shift of responsibilities with broad county discretion, offering an opportunity to identify best practices in community corrections and impacts of correctional decentralization. The 2011 Realignment Legislation did not mandate data collection on outcome measures or provide resources for it, hindering the ability to study the changing felon population and county strategies to reduce recidivism. The Bureau of State Audits flagged the realignment as high-risk due to a lack of reliable data for monitoring progress towards goals. The Criminal Justice Reinvestment Assessment Grant Program of 2015 aims to establish reporting systems for proven local programs to help reintegrate offenders. The Board of State and Community Corrections administers grants to assist counties in collecting and reporting criminal justice information. The local community corrections partnerships must report on their capacity to collect and report required data by June 1, 2015. The board will review assessments and prioritize grants for additional resources needed to collect criminal justice information. Grant funds must supplement existing programs and align with the local plan submitted. The board will submit a report to the Legislature by June 15, 2015, detailing the need, cost, and schedule for counties to collect and report criminal justice information. Minimum standards, funding schedules, and grant procedures will be established, with preference given to counties that have independently collected data. Each county must report specified data annually to the board, including individual identifiers, conviction offense, total jail time served, release status, violations of probation, rearrests, and participation in various programs. The county must report annual data to the board, including participation in electronic monitoring, community service, work release programs, probation supervision, needs assessment, reentry programming, cognitive behavioral therapy, mental health and substance abuse treatment, gender-specific and family programming, health care, housing, income, employment assistance, vocational training, educational enrollment, mentoring, and peer support programs. The board requires counties to report data annually on individuals supervised, including violations, rearrests, reconvictions, return to custody, and use of flash incarceration. The board requires counties to report data annually on individuals supervised, including violations, rearrests, reconvictions, return to custody, use of flash incarceration, participation in various programs (such as probation supervision, reentry programming, cognitive behavioral therapy, mental health treatment, substance abuse treatment, gender-specific programming, family programming), and assistance provided (health care, housing, income support, employment, vocational training, educational enrollment). The board requires counties to report data annually on individuals supervised, including violations, rearrests, reconvictions, return to custody, use of flash incarceration, participation in various programs, and assistance provided. Any educational enrollment assistance, mentoring programming, and peer support programming provided will be compiled into a report for the Governor and Legislature by May 15 each year. $____ is appropriated from the General Fund for implementing this article in the 2015-16 fiscal year. The board may award grants to counties to establish data reporting systems for criminal justice information. Reimbursement for mandated costs will be provided to local agencies. This act is urgent for public safety and will take immediate effect. The 2011 Realignment Legislation addressing public safety needs to go into immediate effect to collect and report relevant data for stakeholders to measure its effectiveness."
