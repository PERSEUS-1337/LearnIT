Strengthening postsecondary education in science, math, engineering, and technology is crucial for maintaining the United States' competitiveness. Collaboration between associate degree-granting colleges and other institutions is key to addressing shortages of skilled workers in these fields. Enlarging the role of community colleges in workforce training by creating seamless transitions from certificate programs to associate degree programs in STEM fields. SEC. 3. ARTICULATION AGREEMENT PROGRAM. This section introduces a new program for seamless transitions from certificate programs to associate degree programs in STEM fields. The purpose of this section is to strengthen scientific and technological education at associate-degree-granting public institutions through partnership agreements with bachelor-degree-granting institutions. Articulation agreements define course transferability for degree requirements. Grants are authorized for public institutions under this program. Grants are available for public institutions of higher education to support programs for statewide articulation agreements. Private institutions can also participate in these agreements. Applications must be submitted to the Secretary to participate in the program, and funds from the grant can be used as specified. Funds from grants can be used to establish statewide articulation agreements in math, science, engineering, and technology between public 2-year and 4-year institutions. Additionally, agreements can be set up within community colleges to link occupational programs with associate degree programs in these fields to boost completion rates. The curr_chunk discusses the responsibilities of students enrolling to complete their associates degree, including collecting data on transfers from 2-year to 4-year institutions, developing a statewide articulation guide, and creating a plan for professional development of 2-year college faculty. The Secretary will collect data from State commissioners and departments for evaluation and reporting. The Secretary will collect data from State commissioners and departments to evaluate the success of the program authorized by this section. A report on the evaluation results will be submitted to Congress within 2 years after the first fiscal year of grant funding availability. Additionally, the Secretary will define the term 'degree programs in math, science, engineering, and technology' by regulation and authorize appropriations of $10,000,000 for fiscal year 2005 for grants under this section."
