    "content": "The U.S. Constitution limits the federal government to specific powers, including regulating commerce, declaring war, and collecting taxes for the general welfare. The Necessary and Proper Clause allows Congress to pass laws to achieve the goals outlined in the Constitution. The Necessary and Proper Clause in the Constitution grants Congress the power to make laws necessary for executing its listed powers. This clause gives Congress broad discretion in choosing the means to carry out its authority, ensuring it has all necessary tools for legislative action. The Supreme Court has identified federalism-based constraints on Congress's legislative power, particularly stemming from the Tenth Amendment, which reserves powers not granted to the federal government to the states. This includes traditional \"police powers\" related to safety, health, welfare, and economic activity within the state's jurisdiction, preventing the federal government from \"commandeering\" state governments. The \"anti-commandeering doctrine\" prohibits the federal government from forcing states to enforce federal laws. This principle was established in Supreme Court cases like New York v. United States and Printz v. United States, emphasizing the sovereignty of states and the separation of powers between state and federal governments. While the federal government cannot compel state officials to carry out federal programs, it can incentivize states through funding conditions to adopt preferred federal policies. Congress can condition the receipt of federal funds on state compliance with federal directives under the Spending Clause of the Constitution. This allows Congress to prescribe terms and conditions for the acceptance and use of federal funds by recipients. The Spending Clause allows Congress to attach conditions to federal funds accepted by recipients, directing how the funds are used. This can help Congress achieve policy objectives that it cannot regulate directly, influencing state behavior without violating the Tenth Amendment. Congress frequently uses the Spending Power to condition federal funds on compliance with federal directives, upheld by the Court. Grant programs must be authorized by legislation, with terms set by Congress and agencies. Grant agreements include statutory and administrative requirements. The degree of agency discretion in implementing grant programs varies depending on the type of program and terms of authorizing legislation. Federal grant funds are allocated based on statutory formula, agency discretion, or a combination. Congress may establish specific formulas or allow agencies to use discretion in distributing funds through competitive grants. Agency discretion over fund allocation can be significant. The federal agency has discretion in evaluating grant applications based on appropriate criteria. OMB guidance requires agencies to assess potential grant recipients' eligibility and ability to meet statutory requirements. Non-compliance with grant conditions could result in consequences for recipients. The federal agency has discretion in evaluating grant applications based on appropriate criteria. Non-compliance with grant conditions could result in consequences for recipients, including administrative actions to terminate and recover grant funds or suspension from future grant awards. The Supreme Court has set limitations on federal grant conditions, requiring them to be clearly established, relevant to the federal interest, and not violate constitutional provisions. The Supreme Court has set limitations on federal grant conditions, requiring them to be clearly established, relevant to the federal interest, and not violate constitutional provisions such as the First Amendment or the Due Process or Takings Clauses of the Fifth Amendment. Grant conditions must be unambiguously set forth before a recipient enters into a grant agreement with the federal government, as stated in the 1981 decision in Pennhurst State School and Hospital v. Halderman. The Supreme Court has ruled that federal grant conditions must be clearly established before acceptance, as seen in the 1981 Pennhurst decision. This requirement was further clarified in the 2012 case National Federation of Independent Businesses v. Sebelius, which struck down provisions of the ACA that imposed retroactive conditions on states for Medicaid funding. In 2014, the Supreme Court ruled that states risk losing Medicaid funding if they do not cover all poor Americans under 65. The Court rejected the argument that the Medicaid expansion was just a modification of the existing program, stating it was a significant shift. The Court emphasized that states could not have anticipated such a transformation of Medicaid when they agreed to the program. The Supreme Court has suggested that grant conditions must be related to the national projects or programs to which federal funds are directed. The Court has not provided further clarification on this requirement but emphasized that conditions must bear some relationship to the underlying purposes of the funds to avoid rendering the Constitution's grants and limits of federal authority meaningless. In the 1982 case of South Dakota v. Dole, the Court discussed the \"relatedness\" standard in relation to the National Minimum Drinking Age Amendment of 1984. The Supreme Court upheld the Drinking Age Amendment of 1984, allowing the withholding of federal highway funds from states that permitted alcohol purchase under 21. South Dakota, allowing alcohol purchase at 19, accepted the condition. The Court found the condition permissible as it related to highway fund purposes and national concerns. The Supreme Court upheld the Drinking Age Amendment of 1984, allowing the withholding of federal highway funds from states that permitted alcohol purchase under 21. Justice O'Connor's dissent argued that this condition was not sufficiently related to highway fund purposes and could lead to Congress regulating various aspects of a state's social and economic life. The Supreme Court has ruled that conditions attached to grant programs must not induce unconstitutional state actions. In the case of United States Agency for International Development v. Alliance for Open Society, the Court considered whether a funding condition under the Leadership Act violated recipients' First Amendment rights. The Supreme Court ruled that a funding condition under the Leadership Act violated recipients' First Amendment rights by requiring organizations to have a policy explicitly opposing prostitution and sex trafficking to receive funds. The Court found this condition impermissible as it would violate the First Amendment if enacted as a direct regulation of speech. The Supreme Court concluded that the Policy Requirement in the Leadership Act was impermissible as it violated the First Amendment by compelling a belief as a condition of federal funding. Additionally, the Court stated that conditions on federal funds must align with federalism principles, and funding inducements by Congress should not become coercive. The Supreme Court has ruled on the issue of federal funding conditions, emphasizing that the amount of funds involved relative to a state's budget is a key factor. In Dole, the Court found that withholding less than 5% of a state's federal highway funds did not constitute impermissible coercion. However, in the 2012 case NFIB v. Sebelius, the Court invalidated a federal grant condition for crossing the line from enticement to coercion, specifically regarding the ACA's requirements for states. The ACA required states to expand Medicaid eligibility, but the Court ruled that the enforcement mechanism violated the Tenth Amendment by withdrawing existing Medicaid funds if states didn't comply. Chief Justice Roberts's opinion stated that federal funds cannot represent a significant portion of a state's budget to avoid being coercive. The opinion did not specify a standard for determining coercive withholding amounts. Chief Justice Roberts concluded that the threatened loss of federal program funds in the case at hand, which made up 10% of an average state's budget, was a form of \"economic dragooning\" that left states with no real option but to comply with the Medicaid expansion. President Trump's executive order on sanctuary jurisdictions and federal grants has raised questions about the federal government's authority to impose conditions on funds. Lawsuits against the executive order may address these issues. The executive order on sanctuary jurisdictions and federal grants has raised questions about the federal government's authority to impose conditions on funds. Lawsuits against the order could clarify Spending Clause jurisprudence by addressing unanswered questions about spending power limitations. Executive Order 13768 raises the possibility of withholding federal grant money from state or local governments with sanctuary policies that limit cooperation with immigration authorities. The order aims to ensure compliance with 8 U.S.C. 1373, which prohibits restrictions on sharing immigration information. The Secretary of Homeland Security is directed to designate entities that do not comply with the law. The Executive Order 13768 allows the Secretary of Homeland Security to designate sanctuary jurisdictions that refuse to comply with 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1373. These jurisdictions may lose federal grant funds, except those necessary for law enforcement purposes. The Attorney General is tasked with enforcing the law and taking action against violators. Additionally, the Director of OMB is instructed to gather information on federal grant money received by sanctuary jurisdictions. The Executive Order 13768 allows the Secretary of Homeland Security to designate sanctuary jurisdictions that refuse to comply with 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1373. These jurisdictions may lose federal grant funds, except those necessary for law enforcement purposes. Questions have arisen about what constitutes a sanctuary jurisdiction for purposes of the order and how the executive branch may implement it. Several jurisdictions have filed lawsuits challenging the EO's constitutionality and seeking an injunction barring its implementation. These lawsuits argue that the EO violates the Spending Clause of the U.S. Constitution by imposing funding conditions that are unduly restrictive. The City of San Francisco argues that Executive Order 13768 violates the Spending Clause and the Tenth Amendment prohibition against federal government \"commandeering\" state and local governments. San Francisco claims the EO imposes funding conditions unrelated to law enforcement or immigration, threatening a substantial portion of its budget. The City of San Francisco argues that Executive Order 13768 threatens federal funding for critical programs like Medicaid, constituting economic coercion. Massachusetts cities assert that the Tenth Amendment protects state and local governments from federal intrusion and dictates on legislation implementation. The Executive Order 13768 aims to determine if governmental entities impede Federal law enforcement and allows the Federal Executive to take action. The Department of Justice argues against Santa Clara's injunction request, stating it is premature as no federal funds have been withheld due to \"sanctuary\" policies. The public is informed about how federal agencies will implement the executive order, with ongoing litigation in its preliminary stages."
