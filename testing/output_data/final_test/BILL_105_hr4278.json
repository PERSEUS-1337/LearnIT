    "content": "The Act titled \"Health Benefits in Federal Contracting Act of 1998\" establishes health benefits standards. The \"Health Benefits in Federal Contracting Act of 1998\" requires employers under Federal contracts exceeding $10,000 to provide health benefits to their employees, with exceptions for small businesses and nonprofit organizations. The Federal income tax code of 1986 stipulates that organizations must ensure the ratio of their CEO's compensation to the lowest-paid employee does not exceed 25 to 1. Certain exemptions apply to employees working limited hours, those with health benefits from other sources, or those in apprenticeship programs. An employer must not lay off or terminate an employee to replace them with someone ineligible for healthcare benefits under certain exemptions, such as those in apprenticeship programs lasting up to 6 months. The Federal Government requires contractors and subcontractors to provide health benefits equivalent to those under subsection (a) in their contracts. The benefits must meet specific requirements outlined in the legislation. Employers must provide health benefits that are at least equivalent to the benefits offered under the largest national health benefits plan. The employer contribution towards the coverage must meet specific requirements, including a minimum percentage contribution for non-family coverage and additional cost for family coverage. Non-compliance may result in termination. If an employer fails to provide required health benefits, their Federal contract or subcontract will be terminated. They will also be ineligible for any Federal contract for 5 years and must pay restitution to the United States for unpaid benefits, with additional damages. The recovered amount will be paid to the affected employees by the Secretary of Labor. The Act will be effective for Federal contracts entered into, renewed, or extended 90 days after enactment."
