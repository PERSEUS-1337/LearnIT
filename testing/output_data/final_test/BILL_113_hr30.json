The program is administered by the Administrator through the Associate Administrator, and applications can be submitted for participation. The Small Business Early-Stage Investment Program allows incorporated bodies, LLCs, or LPs to apply for participation. Requirements include a business plan for venture capital investments in early-stage small businesses and information on investment qualifications of individuals. The Administrator will establish an abbreviated application process for managers of small business investment companies licensed under section 301 applying to the program, with a presumption that they meet the selection criteria. \"SEC. 399D. SELECTION OF PARTICIPATING INVESTMENT COMPANIES.\" The Administrator must make a determination to conditionally approve or disapprove an applicant within 90 days of receiving their application. The approval will include conditions for final approval and a one-year period to meet them. Criteria for selection include the likelihood of meeting business plan goals and creating or preserving jobs through investments. The Administrator will evaluate applicants based on management character, experience, investment focus, profitability likelihood, and track record. Final approval must be granted within 90 days of conditional approval. The Administrator will provide final approval for program participation within 90 days of meeting specified conditions. If conditions are not met within the designated time frame, conditional approval will be revoked. \"SEC. 399E. EQUITY FINANCINGS.\" The Administrator may provide equity financings to participating investment companies, with limits on the amount based on non-federal capital available. The total aggregate amount of equity financings cannot exceed $100,000,000. The process for equity financing involves the Administrator committing to the financing. The Administrator commits equity financing to investment companies for new and follow-on investments, with funds available for 5 and 10 years respectively. Additional 1-year periods may be granted at the Administrator's discretion. Commitments must be made within 2 years of program funding appropriation. SEC. 399F of the program requires participating investment companies to invest in small business concerns, with at least 50% in early-stage small businesses. The Administrator evaluates compliance when 50% of the equity financing commitment is drawn upon. SEC. 399G addresses pro rata investment shares. SEC. 399G states that each investment made by a participating investment company under the program will be treated based on the ratio of capital from equity financings to all available capital. SEC. 399H discusses equity financing interest. \"Under the program, a participating investment company must convey an equity financing interest to the Administrator, entitling them to a pro rata portion of distributions based on the percentage of capital the equity financing comprises.\" The Administrator receives distributions from the investment company like any other investor. Allocations of income, gain, loss, deduction, and credit are made to the Administrator as if they were an investor. Manager profits interest for participating investment company managers cannot exceed 20% of profits, excluding capital contributions. Excess profits must be returned and paid to the company. Distribution of profits and taxes payable to investors and the Administrator are based on capital contributions and equity financings. Managers cannot receive profits interest before repayment of all capital and financings. Participating investment companies must distribute cash to investors promptly after exiting investments, including after a public offering or market sale. The text chunk discusses the creation of a separate fund for equity financings within the Treasury, available to the Administrator as a revolving fund for program purposes. All amounts received by the Administrator will be deposited in the fund, and expenses related to program operations will be paid from it. Additionally, other sections may be applied to activities under this part, with participants subject to specific requirements. The Administrator will report on program performance in the annual performance report of the Administration. Definitions are provided in this section.
