Congress acknowledges the critical role of FTO designations in fighting terrorism and the acknowledgment that drug cartels' actions can be considered terrorism or insurgency. Secretary Clinton expressed sensitivity to the characteristics of drug traffickers during a Congressional Hearing. Mexican drug cartels, described as the \"greatest organized crime threat\" to the United States, have been compared to terrorist activities due to their targeting and attacking of Americans at home and abroad. This poses a significant threat to national security and the safety of the American people. The United States consulate in Mexico and her husband, Arthur H. Redelfs, were targeted and killed by a drug trafficking organization. In a separate incident, a United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent was killed by the Zeta DTO. Border Patrol agent assaults have increased since President Calderon took office in 2006, with over 8,000 homicides in Mexico in 2011 related to organized crime. In early August 2010, President Calderon condemned the violence by drug trafficking organizations (DTOs) as a threat to the state. During Calderon's crackdown on DTOs, over 40 journalists in Mexico were killed or disappeared, with at least 7 in 2011. DTOs use brutal tactics like car bombs and beheadings to intimidate the public. President Calderon responded to a DTO's attack on the Casino Royale by calling them \"true terrorists.\" Mexican drug cartels meet the criteria to be designated as foreign terrorist organizations under US law. The terrorist activity of organizations threatens the security of United States nationals or the national security of the United States. The Secretary of State designates various foreign terrorist organizations, including the Arellano Felix Organization, Los Zetas Cartel, Juarez Cartel, Beltran Leyva Organization, La Familia Michoacana, Sinaloa Cartel, and Gulf Cartel/New Federation. The Secretary of State will report to Congress on State Department efforts to assist Mexico in combating drug cartel violence through the Merida Initiative. The Merida Initiative is a program between the US and Mexico to combat narcotics trafficking and criminal organizations in the Western Hemisphere."
