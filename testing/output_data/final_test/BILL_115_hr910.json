The Securities and Exchange Commission is proposing revisions to expand the Safe Harbor for covered investment fund research reports published by brokers or dealers, allowing them to sell securities subject to an effective registration statement without conditions. The proposed changes would not require the covered investment fund to be registered as an investment company or subject to certain reporting requirements for a specific period of time. The proposed revisions to expand the Safe Harbor for covered investment fund research reports would prevent self-regulatory organizations from enforcing rules that restrict members from publishing or distributing reports or participating in offerings of covered investment funds. The proposed revisions aim to exempt covered investment fund research reports from certain regulations, allowing for more freedom in publishing and distributing such reports. The Act does not limit the application of antifraud provisions of securities laws to covered investment fund research reports, nor does it limit self-regulatory organizations' authority to supervise members' practices related to such reports. The Act does not restrict antifraud provisions or self-regulatory organizations' authority over covered investment fund research reports. After 270 days from enactment, brokers can rely on existing regulations for distributing such reports until new revisions are adopted by the Commission. After 270 days from enactment, brokers can rely on existing regulations for distributing covered investment fund research reports, satisfying reporting requirements under the Code of Federal Regulations. The status of covered investment funds will remain unchanged until revisions are made to relevant regulations by the Commission and FINRA. FINRA has revised rule 2210 regarding covered investment funds, stating that they are considered securities listed on a national exchange not subject to section 24(b) of the Investment Company Act of 1940. Communications about these funds falling under section 24(b) are not required to be filed with FINRA, except for cases where the purpose is not research and analysis. The Act defines \"covered investment fund research report\" as a report about a covered investment fund or its securities, excluding reports published by the fund or its affiliates. A \"covered investment fund\" refers to an investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940. The curr_chunk discusses the registration of securities under the Securities Act of 1933 for public offering by investment companies or trusts primarily consisting of commodities, currencies, or derivative instruments. The curr_chunk defines key terms related to securities regulation, including FINRA, research report, and self-regulatory organization. The House of Representatives passed the bill on May 1, 2017. Karen L. Haas attested as the Clerk."
