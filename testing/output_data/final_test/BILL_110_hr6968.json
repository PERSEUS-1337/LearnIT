Congress acknowledges the increasing number of Armed Forces members suffering from PTSD and TBI due to the current conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq. A report by the RAND Corporation estimates that around 300,000 individuals have PTSD or major depression, and 320,000 have probable TBI from deployment. The demand for mental health services is expected to rise due to longer deployment lengths and an increasing number of troops serving in multiple deployments with shorter breaks in between. The increasing demand for mental health services among Armed Forces members is hindered by difficulties in getting screened, diagnosed, and treated for PTSD and TBI. Stigma remains a critical barrier, with fears of negative consequences on career advancement and security clearances. Stigma is a significant barrier for individuals needing mental health services, especially in the military. The Mental Health Task Force of the Department of Defense emphasizes the need to reevaluate policies that contribute to the fear of seeking help, such as command notification and self-disclosure rules that impact career opportunities. The perception that seeking mental health care can harm one's career must be addressed through policy refinements. Congress recognizes the ongoing efforts to improve mental health services for soldiers, including recommendations from the Department of Defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs. However, addressing stigma at all levels is crucial for these efforts to be successful. The Mental Health Task Force has called for ending policies that fuel the belief that seeking psychological health care can permanently damage one's military career. The Mental Health Task Force recommended ending policies that could harm a soldier's military career due to seeking mental health care. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates approved changes to the security clearance process to reduce stigma around seeking mental health care for members of the Armed Forces and Department of Defense employees. Members of the Department of Defense receiving mental health care no longer need to disclose it on security clearance forms, unless it was court-ordered or involved violence. Congress urges further policy changes to reduce stigma and enhance career opportunities for Armed Forces members. SEC. 3. MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACCESS DEMONSTRATION PROJECT. The Secretary of Defense is required to conduct a demonstration project to increase access to mental health counseling for members of the Armed Forces and their families, reduce stigma associated with seeking services, and make high-quality mental health services more user-friendly and accessible. The purpose is to provide high-quality treatment for a broad range of mental health issues. The Secretary of Defense is conducting a three-year demonstration project to increase access to evidence-based mental health treatment for a variety of conditions, including PTSD and depression, with the goal of early intervention to promote effective coping and resilience. SEC. 4. SPECIAL WORKING GROUP ON CONFIDENTIALITY. The Secretary of Defense will establish a Special Working Group composed of mental health professionals, officials from Surgeon General Offices, and deployed Armed Forces members to develop guidelines for protecting confidentiality in a demonstration project. Members should be appointed within 60 days of the Act's enactment. The Special Working Group, composed of mental health professionals and Armed Forces members, will review documentation requirements for health care visits and develop criteria for changes to command notification in a demonstration project. The Special Working Group will develop guidelines for breach of confidentiality in a demonstration project for mental health services for Armed Forces members. Confidentiality may only be breached if a mental health professional deems the member a threat to themselves or others. The Special Working Group will develop criteria for limiting access to treatment records and determining fitness for duty for members of the Armed Forces in a demonstration project for mental health services. Guidelines will also be developed for payment to demonstration sites under the project. The project receives payment from the Department of Defense for treating members of the Armed Forces, regardless of any restrictions on such payments. Changes are made to ensure that care received at demonstration locations does not need to be disclosed on military forms, except as required by guidelines. Evaluation standards are developed to assess the project's effectiveness in increasing access to care and reducing stigma. The Special Working Group will evaluate the demonstration project's impact on access to care, stigma reduction, quality of mental health care for Armed Forces members. The evaluation will include pre- and post-demonstration assessments on access, costs, outcomes, member satisfaction, and military commanders' ability to determine fitness for duty and deployability. The group will submit a plan to the Secretary of Defense detailing the project's implementation and evaluation. The Special Working Group will submit a plan to Congress for the evaluation of the demonstration project. All duties must be completed within one year of the enactment of the Act. Guidelines and recommendations developed by the group will only apply to the demonstration project unless determined otherwise by the Secretary of Defense. The Advisory Group for Oversight of the Demonstration Program is established. The Secretary of Defense establishes an advisory group to oversee the implementation of the demonstration project. The advisory group's duties include ensuring adherence to guidelines, developing plans for implementation at selected sites, and training mental health providers. The Secretary of Defense establishes an advisory group to oversee the implementation of the demonstration project, ensuring adherence to guidelines and developing detailed evaluation plans for independent evaluations. SEC. 6. REPORTS ON DEMONSTRATION PROJECT. The Secretary of Defense must submit two reports to the Committees on Armed Services regarding a demonstration project. The first report will evaluate the plan for the project, while the second report will include the results of the project and recommendations on policy changes. The demonstration project's changes should be adopted Department of Defense-wide. A plan must ensure continued access to mental health services for Armed Forces members post-project. Deadlines for reports: first within a year of project start, second at project completion. SEC. 7. STUDY AND REPORT ON RETENTION OF MILITARY MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS. The Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the Surgeon General of each branch of the Armed Forces, will conduct a study to determine reasons for attrition among military mental health professionals and make recommendations for recruitment and retention, such as scholarships, loan forgiveness, or recruiting bonuses. A report on the study and recommendations, including estimated costs and numbers of professionals, must be submitted to Congress within six months. The term \"military mental health professional\" refers to a mental health professional providing services to Armed Forces members. This includes professionals from the Armed Forces, Department of Defense employees, or Department of Defense contractors. The study aims to identify reasons for attrition among these professionals and provide recommendations for recruitment and retention strategies, such as scholarships, loan forgiveness, or recruiting bonuses. The report will also include estimated costs and the number of professionals needed to meet demand for mental health services. Additionally, any legislative changes required to implement the recommendations will be outlined."
