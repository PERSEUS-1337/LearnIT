    "content": "The \"Rural Medical Emergencies Air Transport Act of 1993\" allows for grants to states for transporting rural victims of medical emergencies by air. This amendment adds a new part to the Public Health Service Act for grant programs related to transporting rural victims of medical emergencies. The Secretary will provide grants to States to establish or improve air medical transport systems for rural areas, ensuring access to medical treatments for emergency victims. States must submit an application with a State plan outlining grant usage. The grant application must describe intended uses, demonstrate rural nature of areas to be served, show lack of medical facilities, prove cost-effective improvement, and ensure no duplication of capabilities. The grant aims to replicate successful air medical systems, show reduction in morbidity and mortality rates, and maintain state expenditures for medical transport systems. The State plan for the grant must demonstrate consultation with air medical service experts and include additional information as determined by the Secretary. The Secretary considers rural areas and services in awarding grants under this section, giving preference to states with effective integration of air medical transport systems into emergency medical service plans. Grants must be administered by the State agency. The grant will be administered by the State agency for medical services to victims of emergencies or trauma. States can use the grant to award subgrants to public and private entities. States must provide public notice and allow comments on the State plan. The Secretary will award grants to at least 7 States. States receiving grants must submit annual reports detailing the use and effectiveness of air medical transport programs funded by the grant. The Secretary may require additional information and can terminate funding if the grant is not used according to the State plan. The Secretary may terminate grant payments to States until compliance with the State plan is achieved. The term 'rural areas' refers to locations outside standard metropolitan statistical areas. $15,000,000 is authorized for grants in fiscal year 1994, with additional funding for 1995 and 1996."
