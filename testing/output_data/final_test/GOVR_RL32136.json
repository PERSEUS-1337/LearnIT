    "content": "The United States and the international community have made significant progress in the Balkans since the 1990s, ending wars in the former Yugoslavia and supporting political and economic reforms. U.S. officials view Balkan stability as crucial for a peaceful Europe and have provided aid and troop deployments for over thirteen years. As the region stabilizes, U.S. aid and troop commitments have decreased, while the European Union aims to integrate Balkan countries. Despite this, analysts believe the U.S. still plays a vital role in the region. Analysts believe the United States still has an important role to play in the Balkans due to its political credibility, need for diplomatic engagement in Bosnia, strategic military bases in Romania and Bulgaria, and efforts to uproot terrorist networks. Kosovo declared independence in 2008, recognized by the US and 22 EU countries. At least 58 countries have recognized Kosovo as an independent state, despite Serbia's opposition. Kosovo pledged to implement a status settlement plan proposed by U.N. envoy Martti Ahtisaari, which includes provisions for safeguarding the rights of ethnic minorities. Serbia, along with Russia, China, and five EU countries, condemned the move and downgraded diplomatic relations with countries that recognized Kosovo. The Ahtisaari plan includes provisions to safeguard the rights of ethnic minorities in Kosovo. Six Serbian-majority municipalities will have expanded powers, local police will reflect the ethnic composition, and the judiciary and central government must also reflect the ethnic makeup. International missions led by the EU oversee Kosovo's compliance with the plan. The pro-Western government in Belgrade opposes Kosovo's independence through diplomatic means and succeeded in having the legality of Kosovo's independence declaration referred to the International Court of Justice. Many experts believe Serbia is de facto separating the Serbian-dominated northern part of Kosovo from the rest of the country. Local Serbs only recognize Serbian government authority and receive subsidies from Belgrade. The Serbian government reluctantly accepted the deployment of EULEX, an EU-led mission, to northern Kosovo. The security situation in Kosovo has somewhat stabilized since February 2008, but sporadic violence still occurs. Large-scale violence between Serbs and Albanians could lead to a significant exodus of Serbs from the province. Serbs in Kosovo face the risk of leaving, especially those in isolated enclaves in the south. Serbia hopes the ICJ case will keep Kosovo's status unresolved, potentially delaying its entry into the UN, EU, and NATO. However, this diplomatic stalemate could also impact Serbia's EU membership prospects, as most EU countries have recognized Kosovo. There is concern that Serbian membership in the EU may be delayed until Belgrade recognizes Kosovo to avoid importing a territorial dispute into the EU. Some observers suggest partitioning Kosovo along current dividing lines to resolve the impasse, but Kosovo's leaders, the US, and the EU oppose this idea. Partition could destabilize the region by sparking similar demands in Bosnia, southern Serbia, and Macedonia. Domestic politics in the Balkans have improved since the Yugoslav wars, with free and fair elections held in the region. The countries in the region have conducted mostly free and fair elections, but still face challenges. Civil society and independent media express diverse views but encounter government pressure. Constitutional reforms have been made towards democracy, but some provisions are inadequate. Weak government structures challenge the legitimacy of democratic institutions. Public administration lacks effectiveness and is politicized. Corruption and organized crime are prevalent, with ties to politicians and officials. The countries in the region, including Albania, Macedonia, Bosnia, Kosovo, face challenges in developing stable democratic political culture. Excessive tension between political parties hinders effective governance, while ethnic tensions remain a serious problem. Party leaders hold significant power, often overriding the rule of law. The international community has provided aid to strengthen local institutions, but may also contribute to some of the issues. The United States and its European allies have pushed for the strengthening of central government institutions in Bosnia, facing resistance mainly from Bosnian Serb leaders. Political tensions within Bosnia could lead to violence, especially if Bosnian Serbs attempt to secede. International officials imposed policies in Bosnia and Kosovo, potentially fostering dependency and political irresponsibility among local elites. The region's transition to democracy and the rule of law is expected to be challenging. The region's transition to democracy and the rule of law is expected to be lengthy and difficult, with economic problems closely tied to political issues. Weak state structures hinder tax and customs reforms, while the absence of the rule of law hampers foreign investment. In Bosnia, a lack of central government unity impedes market development. Despite progress in economic reforms since the 1990s, challenges remain in achieving fiscal stability and attracting foreign investment. The countries in the region implemented economic reforms with international assistance to stabilize currencies and avoid hyperinflation. Privatization of industries began but faced challenges like corruption and lack of transparency. High unemployment and poverty are prevalent issues. Despite economic growth and foreign investment, concerns remain. Croatia stands out for successful economic reform and aims to join the EU in 2011. Croatia has surpassed several EU member states in per capita income, structural reforms, and foreign direct investment. Economic challenges in the region may require many years to reach EU living standards. Long-term international aid and EU membership prospects are needed for successful economic and political reform. The global economic crisis has worsened balance of payments deficits and reduced foreign financing in the region. The global economic crisis has hit the region hard, leading to plummeting exports, declining tourism, and dropping remittances. Currencies are under pressure, tax revenues are decreasing, and unemployment is on the rise. Governments are implementing austerity measures, including sharp budget cuts, which could fuel political instability. Countries are seeking assistance from international financial institutions, with Serbia receiving a $4 billion loan from the IMF in April 2009. Bosnia reached agreement on a $1.6 billion loan with the IMF, but faces challenges meeting conditions due to a dysfunctional government. The US and EU aim to stabilize the Balkans without direct intervention, supporting EU leadership in the region. This goal is heightened by post-9/11 priorities, such as the war on terrorism. Since 9/11, U.S. priorities have focused on the war on terrorism, stabilizing Iraq and Afghanistan, and supporting peacekeeping efforts in the Balkans. U.S. troops deployed in Kosovo in 1999 have gradually withdrawn, leaving about 1,500 troops currently stationed there. In Bosnia, the NATO-led SFOR mission ended in December 2004, with peacekeeping duties now handled by a European Union force of about 2,000 troops. No U.S. combat troops remain in Bosnia. The EU and NATO support Bosnia's integration with the EU. Currently, there are 15,500 NATO-led troops in Kosovo, including the U.S. contingent. EUFOR and KFOR provide area security through regular patrolling. An EU Police Mission in Bosnia promotes professional police forces. The Office of the High Representative aims to increase central government control over the police. The United States and the EU aim to reform Bosnia's police force for increased efficiency and unity, facing resistance from Republika Srpska. Police reforms in Bosnia have been weaker than international recommendations. Kosovo experienced policing weaknesses during riots in March 2004, with local police and UN CIVPOL facing challenges in maintaining order. Troops, outnumbered by rioters, refused to intervene to stop destruction and looting. KFOR officers have taken steps to address issues, including supplying non-lethal riot control equipment. KFOR and CIVPOL performed better during violence in Mitrovica in 2008. U.N. police faced attacks from Serbian protestors, resulting in casualties. Sporadic outbreaks of violence between Serbs and Albanians in Mitrovica have continued since then. In December 2008, EULEX personnel replaced U.N. police in Kosovo to monitor and mentor the Kosovo Police Service (KPS). However, local Serbs oppose working with KPS, fearing it would imply recognition of Kosovo's independence. EUFOR and KFOR oversee military forces in Bosnia and Kosovo, with EUFOR inspecting military arsenals in Bosnia and NATO working to reform Bosnian entity armies. The EU is considering reducing EUFOR troops in Bosnia from 2,000 to 200 to support defense reform, citing overstretched forces and low risk of conflict. Some EU countries are cautious, fearing it may send a bad political signal while Bosnia's political situation remains unsettled. KFOR's presence in Kosovo deters Serbian aggression. KFOR in Kosovo deters Serbian aggression and oversees the establishment of Kosovo's new army. Some NATO countries plan to reduce KFOR troops in late 2009, while others advocate for a continued strong troop presence. The international civilian presence in Kosovo may need reorganization, with a focus on the leading role of the European Union and NATO in the region. EU leaders have recognized the countries of the Western Balkans as prospective EU members. In the Balkans, EU leaders have recognized countries in the region as prospective EU members. Croatia and Macedonia have been granted EU membership candidate status. Croatia has made progress in negotiations but faced a roadblock in 2009 due to a border dispute with Slovenia. Macedonia is also a candidate but faces concerns about reform pace and a dispute with Greece. The EU has signed Stabilization and Association agreements with other countries in the region to accelerate reforms and integration with the EU. Albania signed an agreement in 2006. Albania, Montenegro, Serbia, and Bosnia have signed Stabilization and Association agreements with the EU, aiming for eventual membership. Serbia's agreement is pending until cooperation with the ICTY is confirmed. Bosnia's agreement was softened in June 2008, with some conditions dropped or postponed. The EU has signed Stabilization and Association Agreements with Albania, Montenegro, Serbia, and Bosnia, aiming for eventual membership. Previous proposals and EU conditions have been dropped or postponed. Kosovo's independence may lead to a Stabilization and Association Agreement, but lack of consensus on recognition and institutional weakness could slow the process. The global economic crisis and political resistance in major EU countries may delay EU membership for the region. The lack of a credible EU membership \"carrot\" could slow reform efforts in major EU countries. Short-term \"carrots\" like visa-free travel to the EU may be delayed due to political climate. IMF may require reforms in exchange for stabilization loans. NATO's future role in the region involves the Partnership for Peace program and Membership Action Plan to prepare countries for possible NATO membership. Membership invitation to Macedonia was withheld due to a dispute with Greece over the country's name. NATO countries pledged to admit Macedonia to the Alliance once the name issue is resolved. Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina were permitted to join the Partnership for Peace program by NATO in December 2006, possibly to bring them closer to Euro-Atlantic institutions and encourage further reform. Montenegro is also a participant in the program. Bosnia and Montenegro were offered an \"Intensified Dialogue\" at the April 2008 NATO summit, a step toward Membership. At the NATO summit, Bosnia, Montenegro, and possibly Serbia were offered an \"Intensified Dialogue\" towards NATO membership. Kosovo is establishing its own security force under KFOR guidance. The Office of the High Representative in Bosnia may be eliminated by the end of 2009 if reforms are met. The European Union deployed an International Civilian Office (ICO) in Kosovo after its independence declaration in 2008, similar to the Office of the High Representative (OHR) in Bosnia. The ICO, led by the International Civilian Representative (ICR), oversees the implementation of the Ahtisaari plan in Kosovo. The ICR has the authority to enforce the settlement, void decisions violating it, and remove government officials if necessary. The International Civilian Office (ICO) in Kosovo, led by the International Civilian Representative (ICR), has the power to enforce the settlement, remove officials who violate it, and oversee the implementation of the Ahtisaari plan. A mission under the EU's European Security and Defense Policy (ESDP), known as EULEX, monitors and advises the Kosovo government on rule of law issues. Responsibilities for prosecuting war crimes are shifting to local courts, with a war crimes chamber created to try lower-level suspects. The United States and other countries assisted Serbia in setting up its own war crimes court. However, key ICTY indictees, including Ratko Mladic, have not been turned over to the Tribunal. U.N. Security Council Resolution 1503 set deadlines for completing trials and appeals, potentially allowing Serbia to evade justice if the ICTY closes before all indictees are brought to trial. The United States' role in the region may diminish further as the EU's influence grows, with potential involvement through NATO and bilateral aid in specific areas like military reform and rule of law assistance. The United States' role in the region may still be needed for political leadership in resolving difficult issues, such as creating viable central government institutions in Bosnia and ensuring stability amid tensions between Serbia and Kosovo. U.S. aid has gradually declined since the end of the wars, shifting from humanitarian aid to technical assistance. Bilateral assistance for political and economic reform in eastern Europe, now focusing on Balkan countries, decreased from $621 million in FY2002 to $293.6 million in FY2009. The Obama Administration requested $284.8 million for political and economic aid to Balkan countries in FY2010. U.S. aid aims to prepare the region for integration into Euro-Atlantic institutions by promoting good governance, fighting corruption, strengthening civil society, enhancing market reforms, and upholding human rights. The EU is seen as the primary provider of assistance for Balkan countries, with the goal of eventual EU membership. Croatia has already graduated from U.S. assistance programs. The Balkan countries receive U.S. assistance for military reform, NATO integration, and participation in ISAF. EU countries are also involved in providing aid for stability in the region. Some experts criticize the EU's lack of vision in its policy towards the Balkans. The EU has allocated 4.65 billion euro for assistance programs in the region. The EU allocated 4.65 billion euro for the CARDS aid program in the Balkan region from 2000-2006. Critics called for more extensive aid to help the countries meet EU membership conditions. CARDS was later folded into the IPA, with 11.47 billion euro allocated for 2007-2013. The EU allocated 11.47 billion euro for the IPA in the Balkans from 2007-2013. The war on terrorism post-9/11 impacted U.S. policy in the region, but aid and peacekeeping efforts helped stabilize it. Increased U.S. attention and aid followed the 9/11 attacks to combat terrorism in the Balkans. Experts do not currently view the Balkans as a key region for terrorists, but acknowledge it may play a role in terrorist plans. The region's ongoing problems make it vulnerable to terrorist groups. In 2005, Bosnian police foiled a plot to blow up the British Embassy in Sarajevo. U.S. officials emphasize the importance of continued engagement in the region to combat terrorism and promote stability. Efforts to bring stability to the Balkans help fight terrorism by addressing political instability, weak institutions, and poverty that terrorists exploit. The U.S. aims to work with other countries to deny terrorists support and sanctuary, with troops in Kosovo and intelligence in Bosnia. Bilateral counterterrorism assistance is provided, along with aid for strengthening the rule of law and promoting economic reform in the region. Efforts to combat terrorism in the Balkans include strengthening the rule of law, promoting economic reform, and developing export control regimes. The United States encourages regional cooperation on terrorism through initiatives like the Southeast European Cooperation Initiative (SECI). Congressional pressure has influenced U.S. Balkans policy, with members advocating against atrocities and pushing for lifting the arms embargo to help defend Bosniaks. Congressional pressure influenced the Clinton Administration to play a bigger role in Bosnia, leading to the Dayton Peace Accords in 1995. Despite some Members' activism, Congress remained cautious about U.S. military involvement in the Balkans. The deployment of peacekeepers in Bosnia and the air war in Kosovo sparked heated debates in Congress, but both missions received full funding. Concerns about costs led Congress to try limiting open-ended missions. Concerns about the costs of open-ended missions led Congress to set benchmarks and limit U.S. engagement in Bosnia and Kosovo. Legislation and congressional pressure capped U.S. aid and troop contributions at 15% of total contributions. The Balkans have become less of a priority for Congress post-9/11, but it still influences foreign operations appropriations and efforts to bring Serbian war criminals to justice. Since FY2001, Congress has attached conditions on U.S. aid to Serbia, requiring cooperation with the war crimes tribunal and respect for minority rights. This led to the transfer of Serbian war criminals to the tribunal, but also sparked fear among suspects. The murder of Prime Minister Djindjic in 2003 may have been a result of this fear. Three major indicted war criminals, including Ratko Mladic, remain at large. Kosovo's status was also a focus in the 108th Congress. In the 108th and 109th Congress, the status of Kosovo was a key issue. Some members supported independence for Kosovo, while others were concerned about destabilizing the region. Resolutions were introduced, such as H.Res. 28 and S.Res. 237, but did not receive full consideration or a vote. Representative Tom Lantos introduced H.Res. 24 in support of Kosovo's independence. In October 2005, the Senate passed a resolution supporting efforts for an agreement on Kosovo's future status. Legislation in the 110th Congress also supported Kosovo's independence. The U.N. Security Council's delay in passing a resolution supporting the Ahtisaari proposal may lead the United States and allies to recognize Kosovo's independence independently. Congress has introduced resolutions regarding Kosovo's status and post-status development, while also supporting NATO enlargement in the Balkan region. In 2008, the Senate passed S.Res. 570 congratulating Albania and Croatia on NATO invitations. In 2009, H.Res. 152 reaffirmed U.S. support for NATO and discussed the enlargement process. There has been debate about U.S. diplomatic efforts. In the 111th Congress, Rep. Berman introduced H.Res. 171 calling for constitutional reform in Bosnia and the appointment of a special envoy to assist reform efforts in the Balkans. It warns against premature withdrawal of OHR and asks the EU to reconsider plans for EUFOR withdrawal. The resolution urges the U.S. to collaborate with the EU in transitioning to a leading role for the EU Special Representative in the region. The EU is transitioning from the OHR to the EU Special Representative in Bosnia to aid in Bosnia's EU integration. H.R. 171 was passed by the House on May 12, 2009."
