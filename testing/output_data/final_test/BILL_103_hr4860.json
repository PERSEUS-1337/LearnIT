It encompasses entering or withdrawing from a warehouse for consumption or use. The term 'unrelated person' refers to any person not related to the controlled foreign corporation. The term 'foreign base company sales income' excludes any imported property income. The limitations on foreign tax credit for imported property income are separately applied under section 904(d) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to include \"imported property income\" as a new category. Imported property income is defined as any income received or accrued by a person that would be considered imported property income. This definition is separate from foreign base company sales income and has its own limitations on foreign tax credit. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to include \"imported property income\" as a new category. This amendment involves technical changes to various sections of the Code, such as modifying look-thru rules and making adjustments to deductions related to foreign base company income. The amendments made by this section apply to taxable years of foreign corporations starting after December 31, 1994, and to taxable years of United States shareholders ending within those years. The amendments made by subsection (c) apply to taxable years starting after December 31, 1994. Improvements in the collection of United States taxes owed by foreign persons. The Congress finds that foreign-controlled corporations in the United States do not pay their fair share of taxes, with up to 72 percent paying no Federal income tax. The IRS's limited enforcement ability and use of outdated accounting concepts contribute to billions of dollars in lost Federal revenues annually. The Congress finds that current IRS procedures are insufficient in preventing foreigners from exploiting treaty benefits and avoiding US taxes through derivative financial products. It is recommended that deficit reduction should involve eliminating enforcement breakdowns allowing foreign-controlled corporations and individuals to evade taxes. The Congress aims to improve tax enforcement for multinational corporations, especially those based abroad, by implementing a more efficient method. The Treasury Department will establish regulations by December 31, 1994, to ensure that treaty benefits related to tax withholding are only available to eligible individuals and prevent tax avoidance. The Treasury Department will establish regulations to prevent tax avoidance through derivative financial instruments, including sourcing income from foreign residents as income from sources within the United States."
