Congress recognizes the importance of mitigation planning in saving lives, protecting properties, and creating disaster-resistant communities. Recent studies show that enforcing State building codes reduces property damage and personal injury during disasters. Modern building codes ensure the safety of residential and commercial structures from natural disasters, providing assurance to the people of the United States. Active enforcement of building codes based on nationally recognized models reduces the need for public disaster aid, promotes sustainable communities, and contributes to the durability of structures. FEMA provides Federal assistance to States for mitigation efforts under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act. Federal mitigation assistance aims to encourage States to adopt a comprehensive approach to disaster loss reduction, including the active enforcement of State building codes. The purpose of federal mitigation assistance is to encourage states to adopt a comprehensive approach to disaster loss reduction, including the active enforcement of state building codes. The Act aims to reduce property loss, improve property quality, and minimize damage by incentivizing the adoption and enforcement of State building codes. It also encourages States to coordinate hazard evaluation and mitigation activities and require the use of current model building codes at the local level. The Act promotes the use of current model building codes to address natural hazards in State-sponsored mitigation projects. SEC. 4. ENHANCED MITIGATION ASSISTANCE. The Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act is amended to allow for additional mitigation assistance in states with approved building codes during a major disaster declaration. The President can increase contributions by 4 percent of estimated grants if the state is actively enforcing the building code. States must submit their building codes to be eligible for the increased federal share. The President can approve a State building code if it aligns with a nationally recognized model building code, is adopted within 6 years, and uses the model code as a minimum standard. The Administrator will establish standards for periodic updates and approvals. The President can approve a State building code that aligns with a nationally recognized model code, is adopted within 6 years, and uses the model code as a minimum standard. The Administrator will establish standards for periodic updates, resubmittals, and approvals consistent with mitigation planning requirements. Regulations must be issued within 180 days to implement this subsection, and definitions for \"actively enforcing\" are provided. The term 'nationally recognized model building code' refers to a building code developed in an open consensus forum with input from national experts, based on national structural design standards for residential and commercial construction. The State building code sets requirements and standards for residential and commercial construction on a statewide basis to protect against natural disasters. The State building code regulates residential and commercial construction to ensure structural safety and design for different types of structures. Recipients of hazard mitigation assistance can use it to reduce future risks in flood-affected areas by adapting existing infrastructures. The curr_chunk discusses enhancements to built and natural environments for future flood probabilities, maintenance of surge protection infrastructure, waterfront resilience measures, voluntary acquisition of flooded properties, flood water diversion and storage projects, flood water distribution infrastructure, and infrastructure for freshwater supply resilience. The curr_chunk discusses amendments to the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act related to establishing and operating a building department for enforcing State building codes. The curr_chunk introduces an amendment to the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act regarding the implementation of a State building code by State or local governments. The curr_chunk introduces a comprehensive study of disaster costs and losses. The Administrator of FEMA will conduct a comprehensive study on disaster costs and losses through the National Advisory Council, appointing additional members with expertise in relevant areas. The National Advisory Council for emergency management services includes representatives from local governments, academic experts, vendors, developers, manufacturers, and other stakeholders. They consult with relevant agencies and groups not on the council for research, data, and recommendations. The council must convene within 120 days of the Act's enactment. The National Advisory Council will evaluate disaster costs and losses, including trends in disaster costs, contributing factors, and impacts on trends since the enactment of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act. The National Advisory Council will evaluate disaster costs and losses, including trends in disaster declarations, factors contributing to trends, disaster assistance available from Federal sources, costs borne by the private sector and individuals, and recommendations for improving the delivery of assistance. Disaster roles and responsibility include appropriate roles for each level of government, the private sector, and individuals. Mechanisms and incentives, such as tax incentives, are needed for disaster cost reduction, mitigation, and recovery. Legislative proposals are needed for implementing the recommendations in the report. The National Advisory Council will submit a report with data, analysis, and recommendations to the Administrator of FEMA and relevant congressional committees within one year of the Sandy Recovery Improvement Act of 2013. The Administrator is required to make the collected data publicly available. The National Advisory Council will submit a report with data, analysis, and recommendations to the Administrator of FEMA and relevant congressional committees within one year of the Sandy Recovery Improvement Act of 2013. The Administrator is required to make the collected data publicly available on the Agency's website. SEC. 6. ENHANCED MITIGATION INCENTIVES PILOT PROGRAM. The Administrator of FEMA will establish a pilot program to award grants to governments for adopting building codes and mitigation measures to reduce disaster costs and incentivize smart development. The Administrator of FEMA will establish a pilot program to award grants for disaster mitigation measures, with criteria based on need and project goals. Non-Federal matching funds of at least 25% are required for grants. Annual reports will be submitted to specific committees during the program. The Administrator of FEMA will submit a final report to specific committees on the grants awarded, project evaluations, recommendations for changes to the Stafford Act, and progress towards program goals within 180 days of the pilot program's termination. The authorities under this section will terminate on December 31, 2021."
