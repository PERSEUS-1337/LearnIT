    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Total Health Requires Improved Vaccination Efforts Act of 2005\" or the \"THRIVE Act of 2005\". The Congress acknowledges that despite high childhood immunization rates, there are significant issues with adult immunization coverage, especially among minority groups. Many at-risk adults are not receiving necessary vaccines for diseases like influenza, pneumonia, and hepatitis B, leading to numerous deaths and illnesses each year in the United States. The United States sees annual hospitalizations and deaths due to influenza complications, invasive pneumococcal disease, and hepatitis B. Pneumonia and influenza are significant causes of death among older adults. The CDC estimates the cost of vaccine-preventable diseases for adults exceeds $10 billion per year. Recommended adult immunizations are cost-effective and would save the healthcare system money. The United States could save significant costs in the healthcare system by implementing recommended adult immunizations. Research shows that influenza, pneumococcal, and hepatitis B vaccines result in substantial savings. For instance, the influenza vaccine saves $14.71 per person aged 18-63 and $182 for those 65 and older. The shortage of influenza vaccine in 2004-2005 highlighted weaknesses in the adult immunization infrastructure, including insufficient supply and uneven distribution. The deficiencies in adult immunization in the United States are worsened by decreasing Federal and State resources for immunizations, with budget cuts shifting more costs to states already facing financial challenges. Most available resources are focused on childhood immunization, neglecting adult immunization policies and programs. The diminishing resource base compromises State health departments' abilities to collect data, assess immunization rates, and implement strategic planning for adult immunization. There is a vital need to enhance efforts to protect adults against vaccine-preventable diseases by establishing a strong adult immunization infrastructure in the United States. From a homeland security preparedness stance, improving the adult immunization system will allow for a quicker and more effective response to biological threats. Additionally, from a biomedical perspective, it will promote the use of newly developed vaccines for diseases like cervical cancer and shingles. Studies have shown that removing financial barriers and measuring providers' delivery of immunizations can increase vaccination rates among adults. Performance measurement systems serve as incentives to ensure healthcare workers are providing vaccinations effectively. Healthcare workers are incentivized to be immunized against infectious diseases to protect vulnerable patients. Health education campaigns can positively impact immunization behaviors. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have a program to increase immunization rates for adults. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have a program to increase immunization rates for adults by authorizing $75,000,000 for fiscal year 2006 and additional funds for subsequent years. Priority is given to medically underserved adults at risk for vaccine-preventable diseases. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have allocated $75,000,000 for fiscal year 2006 to increase adult immunization rates, with a focus on medically underserved individuals at risk for vaccine-preventable diseases. The funds can be used for storing vaccines, outreach activities, and program expenses. Additionally, the Secretary may reserve up to $25,000,000 for three years to provide influenza immunizations to uninsured high-risk individuals aged 19-64 in four states through demonstration projects. The Secretary may give preference to states with low adult immunization rates for influenza and pneumococcus among high-risk populations or significant disparities in immunization rates for minority groups. Grants can only be made if the state agrees to estimate immunization rates before the project begins. The Secretary may provide technical assistance to states for estimating immunization rates and identifying project sites. Individuals without insurance coverage for influenza vaccine are considered uninsured. The Secretary evaluates the effectiveness of the immunization system in the US annually and reports to Congress on immunization rates for adults and any issues affecting those rates. The Secretary reports annually to Congress on immunization rates for adults and any issues affecting those rates, including information on the effectiveness of demonstration projects in increasing influenza vaccine rates, demographic data on immunized individuals, and the involvement of healthcare entities in the projects. Recommendations from the Institute of Medicine are considered in carrying out immunization programs. The Secretary, through grants, will coordinate with public and private entities to ensure routine adult immunizations and gather information for annual evaluations. The Secretary will conduct a campaign to educate adults on the importance of immunizations, targeting the general public, health professionals, and specific populations with low immunization rates. The campaign aims to increase demand for immunizations and address safety concerns about vaccines. The Secretary will conduct a campaign to promote adult immunizations through health insurance coverage and evidence-based approaches. An evaluation will be done to assess the campaign's impact on knowledge and practices. SEC. 4. Medicare and Medicaid programs will establish standards for measuring adult immunization usage and coverage. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will establish standards for measuring adult immunization usage for influenza under the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Additionally, a study will be conducted to determine the feasibility of including adult immunization for influenza as a performance measure in quality initiatives. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will set standards for measuring adult immunization usage for influenza among healthcare workers in provider services. A study will be conducted to assess best practices of health insurers and managed care organizations in promoting adult immunizations for influenza. Study on adult immunization for influenza among healthcare workers as a quality indicator for accreditation. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will conduct a study on the feasibility of requiring health care workers to comply with recommended adult immunizations, including influenza. A report on the study's findings and recommendations for implementation challenges will be submitted to Congress within one year of the Act's enactment. FEHBP coverage of qualified immunization services is addressed in Section 6. FEHBP coverage of qualified immunization services for eligible enrollees, 18 years or older at high risk of pneumonia or influenza, must include pneumococcal and influenza vaccines with waived deductibles. The amendment applies to services provided under contracts entered into or renewed for any contract year starting 9 months after the enactment of the Act."
