    "content": "The Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB) was established as part of the ACA to reduce Medicare spending growth. Congress must act if they want to change the board's proposals. Medicare is facing a financial shortfall that requires prompt legislative action to minimize the impact on beneficiaries, providers, and taxpayers. Several proposals have been advanced over the years to create an independent policymaking entity charged with limiting future growth in Medicare expenditures, insulated from special interests, and comprised of officials with specialized expertise to make operational decisions regarding payments and focus on beneficiary interests and the program's financial viability. Prior proposals include increasing the budget of CMS and creating separate agencies. Several proposals have been made to establish independent entities to manage Medicare expenditures, with a focus on beneficiary interests and financial viability. These proposals include creating separate agencies, a Medicare board for competition among plans, a Federal Health Board similar to the Federal Reserve Board, and the IMAC proposal for advising on payment rates and policy reforms. The Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB) was established with limited authority to recommend Medicare payment policy reforms. Its goal is to reduce the per capita growth in Medicare expenditures by developing proposals for the Secretary to implement. These proposals must meet specific criteria and cannot include recommendations to ration care, raise revenues, increase cost sharing, or reduce payments to providers. The Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB) was established to recommend Medicare payment policy reforms to reduce per capita growth in Medicare expenditures. The IPAB's proposals include recommendations to reduce Medicare payments under Parts C and/or D, with projected savings of $15.5 billion from 2015 to 2019. This would result in a reduction of about $60 per year per Medicare beneficiary over the same period. The Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB) was established to recommend Medicare payment policy reforms to reduce per capita growth in Medicare expenditures. Critics have challenged the IPAB's authority and constitutionality, particularly regarding its special procedures and powers to affect federal health care programs. Section 1899A of the Social Security Act requires the Chief Actuary of CMS to determine annually if the projected five-year average growth in per capita Medicare program spending exceeds a specified target. The Chief Actuary of CMS determines annually if the growth rate in per capita Medicare program spending exceeds a specified target. If the growth rate exceeds the target, an applicable savings target is established for the implementation year. The Chief Actuary establishes a savings target for the implementation year if Medicare program spending growth exceeds a specified target. A board of 15 members, appointed by the President with Senate approval, includes ex-officio nonvoting members. The President consults with Senate and House leadership for nominations, and the chairperson is appointed by the President with Senate consent. Board members represent various professions. The appointed board members represent diverse professional backgrounds in health finance, actuarial science, health facility management, and reimbursement. They are drawn from various fields including physicians, health professionals, employers, and experts in health economics research. Consumer and elderly representatives are also included on the board. The Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB) has not been constituted yet, with no members nominated or confirmed. The CMS Chief Actuary's 2017 determination shows that there is no applicable savings target for implementation year 2019 due to Medicare per capita growth rate not exceeding the target. The 2017 determination by the CMS Chief Actuary shows a change in the activation year of the Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB) to 2021. The Medicare per capita growth rate did not exceed the target, leading to no applicable savings target for implementation year 2019. The 2017 and 2018 projections are lower than 2016, impacting Medicare per capita growth rates and IPAB target growth rates. The activation year for IPAB is now 2021 due to changes in methodology. The activation year for IPAB is now 2021 due to changes in methodology for determining conditions that trigger IPAB activity. The ACA establishes two sets of parliamentary procedures for congressional consideration of IPAB implementing legislation. The ACA requires the IPAB to submit proposals to Congress and the President, with automatic implementation unless legislation supersedes it or a joint resolution discontinues the process. In 2017, a joint resolution was enacted to discontinue the automatic implementation process of the IPAB. Special fast-track parliamentary procedures were established for House and Senate consideration of legislation implementing the board's proposals. These procedures ensure prompt action by mandating immediate introduction of legislation, setting strict deadlines for consideration, and limiting the amending process. Congress can amend the legislation to achieve targeted reductions. The legislation establishes procedures for implementing the IPAB plan, including supermajority vote requirements in the Senate and expedited mechanisms for House and Senate exchange of implementing legislation. It also includes fast-track procedures for Senate consideration of veto messages on IPAB implementing legislation. The IPAB legislation sets conditions for fast-track consideration of a joint resolution to discontinue the annual proposal process. The resolution must be introduced by February 1, 2017, without a preamble, and with specific title and text requirements. Any Member can introduce the resolution in either chamber, and it is referred to relevant committees upon introduction. The IPAB legislation establishes fast-track procedures for considering a joint resolution to discontinue the annual proposal process. The resolution must be introduced by February 1, 2017, without a preamble, and with specific title and text requirements. It is referred to relevant committees in the House and Senate for consideration. In the Senate, if the Committee on Finance does not report the resolution within 20 days, it can be discharged upon a petition signed by 30 Senators. Debate on the resolution is limited to 10 hours, and \"hookup\" procedures are in place to ensure both chambers act on the same legislation. The House of Representatives agreed to H.Res. 5 on the opening days of the 113th, 114th, and 115th Congresses, adopting standing rules to eliminate provisions in the Affordable Care Act that limit the House's ability to determine consideration methods. The House of Representatives eliminated provisions in the Affordable Care Act that limit their ability to determine consideration methods for recommendations from the Independent Payment Advisory Board. Fast-track parliamentary procedures for IPAB proposals were not in force in the House in the 113th, 114th, or 115th Congresses, but still apply in the Senate. Congress can change these procedures as they are considered rules of the respective houses. The House or Senate can alter their rules without amending or repealing the ACA. They can do so through unanimous consent, suspension of the rules, or a special rule from the House Committee on Rules. The House has previously adopted resolutions to remove fast-track procedures from force. The ACA's special parliamentary procedures aim to prevent any changes to IPAB recommendations through legislative mechanisms. The proposed procedures aim to prevent Congress from making changes to the recommendations of the IPAB unless they achieve the same targeted reductions in Medicare spending growth. This limitation on congressional action can only be waived in the Senate by a three-fifths majority vote. The IPAB provisions require a supermajority vote to overturn rulings and restrict legislative action. If the IPAB fails to submit a proposal, the Secretary can implement proposals automatically unless Congress acts. The constitutionality of the IPAB has been challenged in court. The challenge to the IPAB in the Coons v. Lew case was dismissed by the Supreme Court in March 2015, effectively ending the litigation. The plaintiff argued that the IPAB was unconstitutional due to the delegation of legislative authority by Congress, violating the non-delegation doctrine. The Ninth Circuit dismissed a lawsuit challenging the IPAB for lack of jurisdiction, ruling it was unripe due to the plaintiffs' claimed harm being contingent on unforeseeable events. The Ninth Circuit dismissed a lawsuit challenging the IPAB for lack of jurisdiction, ruling it was unripe due to the plaintiffs' claimed harm being contingent on unforeseeable events. Plaintiffs may challenge the constitutionality of the IPAB in the future if conditions trigger the need for IPAB proposals modifying provider payments. Multiple bills to repeal the IPAB were introduced in Congress during the 113th and 114th sessions. Title III, Subtitle B aimed to repeal the IPAB but was not included in the reconciliation bill passed by the House. Several bills in the 115th Congress address the IPAB, with some focusing on repealing specific provisions of the ACA related to the board. The House passed H.R. 849 related to IPAB provisions from the ACA, with CBO estimating a $7.1 billion increase in direct spending over 2022-2025 if IPAB is repealed. CBO estimates that repealing the IPAB provision of the ACA would likely increase Medicare program spending by $7.1 billion over the 2022-2025 period due to uncertainty surrounding projections triggering spending reductions. The CBO and CMS Chief Actuary have differing projections on IPAB activity and potential savings over time. CBO estimated no impact on the budget from 2015 to 2021 if the IPAB is repealed. The CBO estimated that repealing the IPAB mechanism would not have any budgetary impact between 2015 and 2021, but would increase direct spending by $7.1 billion over the 2022-2025 period. The IPAB mechanism is described as a one-sided bet, where modifications to achieve savings are required, leading to savings, or not, resulting in no change. CBO must consider the probabilities associated with variations in spending and economic measures when assessing the budgetary effects of possible changes in law. The CBO estimates that repealing the IPAB mechanism would increase Medicare spending by $17.5 billion from 2022 to 2027. The IPAB could interact with other bills affecting Medicare spending, potentially raising payments to providers and triggering increased program expenditures."
