    "content": "Sanctions have been a key part of U.S. Iran policy since the 1979 Islamic Revolution. Initially aimed at stopping Iran's support for terrorism, sanctions later focused on its nuclear program. International cooperation led by the U.S. and the UN aimed to persuade Iran to limit its nuclear activities. The report analyzes U.S. and international sanctions against Iran, addressing multiple perceived threats simultaneously. The report tracks the implementation of U.S. laws and executive orders imposing sanctions on Iran. Sanctions on Iran began in 1979 during the U.S.-Iran hostage crisis, blocking Iranian assets in the U.S. Some sanctions require blocking U.S.-based property of sanctioned entities, but it is possible that these entities do not have any U.S. assets to be blocked. The U.S. imposed sanctions on Iran in 1979 during the hostage crisis, freezing Iranian assets in the U.S. Executive Orders 12205 and 12211 banned U.S. trade with Iran, revoked by EO 12282 in 1981 after the Algiers Accords resolved the hostage crisis. The U.S.-Iran Claims Tribunal in the Hague arbitrated cases related to the frozen assets, resolving 4,700 claims and awarding $2.5 billion to U.S. nationals and firms. The U.S. settled with Iran for FMS cases involving weaponry the Shah was paying for but not completed when the Shah fell, using funds from the Iran FMS Trust Fund. The Iran FMS Trust Fund had a balance of $400 million. In 1990, $200 million was paid to Iran to settle some FMS cases. In 2016, the US sent Iran the $400 million balance plus $1.3 billion in accrued interest. The funds were remitted in foreign currency to comply with US regulations. Some FMS program claims with Iran are still under arbitration. Iranian assets in the US remain blocked, including $1.9 billion in bonds frozen in a Citibank account. Iran's blocked assets include bonds from Iran's Central Bank frozen in a Citibank account in New York by Clearstream in 2008. Other frozen assets in the US include Iranian diplomatic properties, real estate holdings of the Assa Company, and $1.67 billion moved to Luxembourg. The Alavi Foundation, an Iranian investor, had properties in the US blocked in 2009. The properties are valued at nearly $1 billion. Litigation in 2017 gave the US government control over a New York City office building. Victims of Iranian terrorism have received about $46 billion in court awards, including families of soldiers killed in the 1983 Beirut bombing. US funds have been used to pay a portion of these judgments. Compensation for diplomats held was precluded by the Algiers Accords. The FY2016 Consolidated Appropriation set up a mechanism for paying damages to U.S. embassy hostages and other victims of state-sponsored terrorism using settlement payments from banks and Iranian frozen assets. The U.S. Supreme Court allowed Central Bank assets to be used for terrorism judgments, and proceeds from frozen real estate assets will likely go to victims. However, in 2018, the Court ruled that U.S. victims of an Iran-sponsored terrorist attack could not seize Persian antiquities to satisfy a court judgment. The United States compensated Iran $61.8 million for the shoot-down of an Iranian Airbus passenger jet in 1988. Iranian assets are used to compensate victims of Iranian terrorism. Executive Order 13599, issued in 2012, blocks U.S.-based assets of entities owned or controlled by the Iranian government, including Iran's Central Bank. This order goes beyond previous regulations and imposes secondary U.S. sanctions on Iran. The U.S. has designated entities owned or controlled by the Government of Iran under Executive Order 13599, including the \"Execution of Imam Khomeini's Order\" (EIKO) with off-the-books investments. To implement the JCPOA, certain entities were delisted from U.S. secondary sanctions, allowing foreign transactions without penalties. The U.S. delisted entities from sanctions under Executive Order 13599 to allow foreign transactions without penalties, but U.S. persons are still barred from dealing with these entities. Most delisted entities were relisted as SDNs on November 5, 2018, except for the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran and its subsidiaries to support engagement with Iran's civilian nuclear program under the JCPOA. The United States imposed sanctions against Iran in the mid-1980s for supporting terrorism, designating Iran as a \"state sponsor of terrorism\" in 1984. The hostage crisis-related sanctions were lifted in 1981. No entities were delisted from sanctions under the JCPOA, and no laws or Executive Orders were waived or revoked for its implementation. The U.S. sanctions Iran as a \"state sponsor of terrorism\" triggering restrictions on sales of U.S. dual-use items. These restrictions are enforced through Export Administration Regulations. The U.S. sanctions Iran as a \"state sponsor of terrorism\" leading to restrictions on U.S. financial assistance and arms sales to Iran. Various laws prohibit direct U.S. foreign assistance to terrorism list countries, including Iran. This includes government loans, credits, credit insurance, and Ex-Im Bank loan guarantees. Recent foreign aid appropriations laws have banned direct assistance to Iran without waiver provisions. Additionally, the FY2012 foreign operations appropriation banned the Ex-Im Bank from financing entities sanctioned under the Iran Sanctions Act. The FY2019 Consolidated Appropriation made provisions effective for FY2019, requiring U.S. officials to oppose multilateral lending to terrorism list countries. Sections 620G and 620H of the Foreign Assistance Act mandate withholding foreign aid from countries aiding or selling arms to terrorism list countries, with waiver authority provided. Section 321 of the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act criminalizes financial transactions with terrorism list countries by U.S. persons. Section 321 of the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act prohibits U.S. persons from conducting financial transactions with terrorism list governments. The FAA also restricts U.S. contributions to international organizations working in Iran, requiring proportional cuts. Despite these sanctions, the U.S. has provided disaster aid to Iran in the past, including donations for earthquake relief in 1997, 2002, and 2003. The U.S. has provided disaster aid to Iran in the past, including donations for earthquake relief in 1997, 2002, and 2003. Section 330 of the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act prohibits the sale of U.S. defense articles and services to countries not fully cooperating with U.S. anti-terrorism efforts, with Iran being designated as such every May. Executive Order 13324 mandates certain actions related to terrorism. Executive Order 13324 mandates freezing U.S.-based assets and banning transactions with entities supporting international terrorism, issued after the September 11 attacks. It does not specifically target Iranian arms exports but has been used to sanction such activities by designating involved persons or entities. The Countering America's Adversaries through Sanctions Act mandates penalties on the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) for supporting groups like the Afghan Taliban and Houthi rebels. The IRGC was designated as a terrorism-supporting entity under E.O. 13224 by the Treasury Department on October 13, 2017. No entities designated under E.O. 13224 were delisted to implement the JCPOA, and additional Iran-related entities have been designated under the Order since JCPOA implementation. Sanctions similar to E.O. 13224 are imposed on Iranian and Iran-linked entities through State Department authority. Any U.S. person providing support to a Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO) faces fines or imprisonment. The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) was designated as an FTO on April 8, 2019. On April 22, 2019, State Department guidelines were issued for implementing the IRGC FTO designation, allowing routine diplomatic or humanitarian dealings with the IRGC. Sanctions have been imposed to curb Iran's destabilizing influence in the region, targeting groups like Lebanese Hezbollah, Kata'ib Hezbollah, Hamas, Palestine Islamic Jihad, Al Aqsa Martyr's Brigade, PFLP-GC, and Al Ashtar Brigades. The order issued on July 7, 2007, aims to curtail Iran's influence in the region by blocking U.S.-based property of individuals involved in acts of violence in Iraq. The order targets those who threaten peace, stability, economic reconstruction, and political reform in Iraq, particularly those linked to Iran and Shiite militias. Sanctioned entities include IRGC-Qods Force officers and Iraqi Shiite militia-linked figures. Another order issued on April 29, 2011, blocks the property of individuals responsible for human rights abuses and repression in Syria. The order issued on October 23, 2018 targets individuals involved in human rights abuses and repression in Syria, including IRGC-Qods Force commanders. It expands on previous sanctions laws related to Hezbollah and Iran. The Clinton Administration expanded U.S. sanctions against Iran in 1995 with Executive Order 12959, banning trade and investment. This order was issued under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, giving the President wide powers to regulate commerce with a foreign country during a \"state of emergency.\" Executive Order 13059 in 1997 added a prohibition on U.S. companies exporting goods to third countries for incorporation into products destined for Iran. The U.S. has maintained a \"state of emergency\" with Iran since 1995, allowing the President to regulate transactions with Iran under IEEPA. Various acts like CISADA and the Iran Freedom Support Act have imposed trade bans and restrictions on U.S. imports and investments in Iran. The U.S. has maintained a \"state of emergency\" with Iran since 1995, allowing the President to regulate transactions with Iran under IEEPA. Various acts like CISADA and the Iran Freedom Support Act have imposed trade bans and restrictions on U.S. imports and investments in Iran. The authority to terminate sanctions with presidential notification to Congress was granted, with modifications to allow importation of Iranian luxury goods and sale of commercial aircraft to Iranian airlines. However, following the U.S. withdrawal from the JCPOA on May 8, 2018, the easing of regulations for Iranian luxury goods importation was reversed on August 6, 2018. The 1995 trade ban prohibits all U.S. transactions with Iran in energy products, including the trading of Iranian oil overseas. U.S. companies can apply for licenses to conduct \"swaps\" of Caspian Sea oil with Iran, but these swaps have been prohibited in practice. The 1995 trade ban prohibits U.S. transactions with Iran in energy products, including trading Iranian oil overseas. Mobil Corporation's application to do so was denied in April 1999. The ITRs do not ban importing gasoline or energy products with Iranian oil mixed with oil from other producers. Transshipment and brokering activities involving Iran are prohibited for U.S. persons. Iranian luxury goods could be imported into the U.S. after January 2016 but this prohibition was reinstated on August 6, 2018. Obtaining shipping insurance is crucial for Iran's oil and export expansion. Obtaining shipping insurance is vital for Iran's oil and export expansion. The International Group of P & I Clubs, based in New York, dominates the shipping insurance industry. The U.S. trade ban complicates Iran's ability to obtain reinsurance for its shipping. The Obama Administration issued waivers to allow insurers to provide Iranian ships insurance, but this ended on August 6, 2018. Civilian airline sales to Iran have been permitted under certain conditions. Iran Air, Iran's largest state-owned airline, was sanctioned until Implementation Day under Executive Order 13382. Restrictions were relaxed under the JCPOA to allow for the sale of commercial aircraft to Iran, including Iran Air. Boeing and Airbus concluded major sales to Iran Air, but after the U.S. withdrawal from the JCPOA on May 8, 2018, licensing restrictions were reinstated, and sales of aircraft to Iran were revoked. Sales of aircraft to Iran were revoked. Some aircraft spare parts to Iran require a waiver. Personal communications, remittances, and publishing are permitted. Information technology equipment is exempt from the export ban. Food and medical exports to Iran by U.S. firms have been allowed since April 1999. Since April 1999, U.S. firms have been allowed to export food and medical products to Iran, subject to OFAC regulations. Specific medical products like scalpels, prosthetics, and burn dressings can be sold under a general license without a specific application. The list of general license items was expanded in 2013 and 2016 to include more advanced medical equipment. Exports of medical products not on the general license list are expedited for sale to Iran. The definition of \"food\" excludes alcohol, cigarettes, gum, or fertilizer. In 2010, OFAC approved exports to Iran of condiments and supplements with uses beyond nutrition. Donations by U.S. residents to Iranians are allowed, but relief organizations need an OFAC license. In 2013, licensing requirements for relief organizations were eliminated for health projects, disaster relief, wildlife conservation, human rights projects, and sports activities in Iran. Services related to sporting activities, including sponsorship, coaching, and training, can now be imported from Iran. OFAC issues temporary licensing for relief organizations to work in Iran during emergencies. U.S. importers can pay Iranian exporters with U.S. dollars through third-country banks. Financing for approved transactions is typically done through a letter of credit from a non-Iranian bank. Official credit guarantees are banned for food and medical sales to Iran under Title IX of the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000. The Ex-Im Bank is prohibited from guaranteeing loans to Iran due to its inclusion on the terrorism list. Foreign subsidiaries of U.S. firms can deal with Iran as long as they are not \"controlled\" by the parent company. Controlled subsidiaries are defined as those more than 50% owned by the U.S. parent. The United States licensed \"controlled\" foreign subsidiaries to conduct transactions with Iran under the JCPOA. The Obama Administration used IEEPA authority to issue licenses, but the Trump Administration reverted to pre-JCPOA status in 2018. The Iran Sanctions Act (ISA) returned to pre-JCPOA status on November 5, 2018. Iran's energy sector has been targeted by U.S. sanctions to limit financial resources for supporting terrorism and nuclear programs. Iran has significant oil and gas reserves, with the energy sector contributing to a large portion of the country's GDP and government revenue. The Iran Sanctions Act (ISA) has been a key component of U.S. sanctions against Iran's energy sector since 1996. It was initially enacted as the Iran and Libya Sanctions Act (ILSA) but was later renamed after terminating with respect to Libya in 2006. ISA is the first major \"extra-territorial sanction\" on Iran, allowing U.S. penalties against third country firms for transactions with Iran that violate ISA. The Iran Sanctions Act (ISA) imposes sanctions on companies investing over $20 million in Iran's energy sector. ISA defines investment broadly to include various contracts related to Iran's petroleum resources. The Iran Freedom Support Act expanded ISA to sanction firms selling certain goods to Iran. The Iran Sanctions Act (ISA) sanctions firms selling weapons or related technologies to Iran, including advanced conventional weapons. ISA also targets entities involved in joint ventures with Iran related to uranium. No ISA sanctions have been imposed under these provisions yet. Section 102(a) of the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act of 2010 (CISADA) amended the Iran Sanctions Act (ISA) to target Iran's dependency on imported gasoline. It subjects sales of gasoline and related fuels over $1 million (or $5 million in a year) to sanctions, as well as equipment or services that would help Iran produce or import gasoline. Section 201 of the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012 (ITRSHA) sanctions firms providing Iran with goods or services worth $1 million or more for its oil and gas sector. This includes equipment like drills, pumps, and oil rigs. Additionally, firms providing goods or services worth $250,000 or more for Iran's petrochemical production are also subject to sanctions. Section 201 of the ITRSHA sanctions entities determined to have owned a vessel used to transport Iranian crude oil, allowing the President to prohibit such ships from entering US ports for two years. Exemptions apply to oil transportation to exempted countries and joint ventures established after January 1, 2002. The ITRSHA also includes provisions unrelated to the ISA. The ITRSHR Act imposes sanctions on entities providing insurance or reinsurance for NIOC or NITC, purchasing Iranian government bonds, engaging with the IRGC, and requires a determination on NIOC and NITC's affiliation with the IRGC. The Department of the Treasury determined that NIOC and NITC are affiliates of the IRGC, leading to sanctions under CISADA. NIOC was named a proliferation entity under Executive Order 13382, resulting in restrictions on foreign banks dealing with NIOC. Sanctions on NIOC and NITC were waived under the JCPOA but were reinstated in 2018. Some NIOC partners and independent Iranian energy firms have not been designated. Some NIOC partners and independent Iranian energy firms, including Iranian Offshore Oil Company, National Iranian Gas Export Co., and others, have not been designated. Sanctions were revoked but will be reinstated under Executive Order 13622, imposing sanctions on the purchase of oil and petrochemical products from Iran. The wind-down period for transactions with NIOC or NICO was 180 days. Executive Order 13622 imposes sanctions on entities assisting NIOC, NICO, and the Central Bank of Iran with a 180-day wind-down period. Exceptions apply for entities with oil importation exceptions or projects bringing gas from Azerbaijan to Europe and Turkey. The original version of ISA had no firm requirement for investigating violations. The Iran Freedom Support Act and CISADA mandate investigations into potential ISA violations, with a 180-day time limit for determination. The Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act defines \"credible information\" for investigations to include corporate announcements of transactions with Iran. The Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act mandates investigations into potential ISA violations, with a 180-day time limit for determination. It also requires companies to report activities that may violate ISA to the SEC, triggering an investigation. Congress has oversight mechanisms to monitor ISA violation investigations, including reports from the Government Accountability Office and Congressional Research Service. Additionally, the law requires regular reports to Congress on companies engaging in activities with Iran that could violate ISA. The Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act mandates investigations into potential ISA violations, with a 180-day time limit for determination. It also requires companies to report activities that may violate ISA to the SEC, triggering an investigation. Congress has oversight mechanisms to monitor ISA violation investigations, including reports from the Government Accountability Office and Congressional Research Service. Additionally, the law requires regular reports to Congress on companies engaging in activities with Iran that could violate ISA. The Administration is required to report to Congress every 180 days on investment in Iran's energy sector, joint ventures with Iran, and estimates of Iran's imports and exports of petroleum products. ISA's definition of \"investment\" subject to sanctions includes construction of energy pipelines to or through Iran, deemed to help Iran develop its petroleum sector. In March 2012, Secretary of State Clinton clarified that U.S. sanctions apply to pipelines for oil or natural gas transportation. The Iran Freedom and Counterproliferation Act excludes sanctions on natural gas purchases from Iran but includes sanctions on gas pipeline construction involving Iran. Some joint natural gas projects with Iranian firms are exempt from sanctions, such as the Shah Deniz field in the Caspian Sea. The Shah Deniz consortium in the Caspian Sea involves Iran's NICO with a 10% share, along with BP, SOCAR, Lukoil, and other firms. NICO was sanctioned under ISA but transactions with the consortium are allowed. Iran lacks LNG export terminals due to U.S. patented technology. CISADA includes LNG in ISA sanctions on Iran. Sanctions under ISA target LNG investment and supply of tankers or pipelines to Iran, including financing for energy sector investments and gasoline sales. Financial institutions aiding these activities could face sanctions, except for government credit guarantee agencies like France's COFACE and Germany's Hermes. Entities sanctioned under executive orders are listed in tables at the end of the report. In 2011, Congress imposed sanctions on mechanisms for paying Iran for oil to reduce its exportation. The Obama Administration expressed concerns about potential oil price increases and damage to U.S. relations with Iran's oil customers. Sanctions targeted transactions with Iran's Central Bank, with Section 1245 of the FY2012 NDAA requiring the prevention of foreign banks from opening accounts. The 2011 sanctions require the President to prevent foreign banks from opening accounts in the US if they conduct significant financial transactions with Iran's Central Bank or sanctioned Iranian banks. An exception allows banks to continue transactions if they significantly reduce oil purchases from Iran. The SRE exception for Iranian oil purchases requires countries to reduce their buys every 180 days. A country that completely stops buying oil from Iran retains the exception. The definition of \"significant reduction\" is an 18% purchase reduction based on total payment for Iranian oil. Sanctions on oil transactions apply if the President certifies every 90 days that the oil market is adequately supplied. The Obama and Trump Administrations have implemented the FY2012 NDAA to balance the global oil market and impact Iran's economy. Major Iranian oil customers have made cuts in purchases, with Japan receiving an SRE in March 2012 and 10 EU countries implementing an oil embargo in September 2012. Several countries received Significant Reduction Exceptions (SRE) due to ending purchases in compliance with the EU Iran oil purchase embargo. Seventeen EU countries did not qualify for the SRE as they were not buying from Iran. Waivers were granted in December 2012 to countries like China, India, and South Korea. The JCPOA suspended the requirement to cut oil purchases from Iran, but it was reinstated in November 2018. In June 2018, State Department officials met with countries importing Iranian oil. The US urged countries to stop buying Iranian oil, but exceptions were granted based on various factors. Eight countries received Significant Reduction Exceptions (SRE) in November 2018, which expired on May 2, 2019. No more SREs would be granted after this date to increase pressure on Iran. The US urged countries to stop buying Iranian oil and granted exceptions based on various factors. Discussions with Saudi Arabia and the UAE were held to ensure oil market stability. Unclear if Iran's oil customers will continue importing and if foreign banks will be penalized for transactions with Iran's Central Bank. Iran's ability to repatriate hard currency was affected by a provision in the ITRSHRA. The ITRSHRA provision requires hard currency paid to Iran for exempted transactions to be credited to an account in the country with jurisdiction over the foreign bank. This prevents Iran from repatriating hard currency held in foreign banks worldwide, compelling Iran to buy products from its main oil customers. Sanctions have been expanded on non-oil industries like automotive and mineral exports in Iran. Iran's mineral exports account for about 10% of the country's export earnings. Sanctions were imposed on firms supplying goods or services to Iran's automotive sector, blocking foreign banks from the U.S. market if they finance transactions with Iran's automotive sector. Additionally, U.S.-based property was blocked and U.S. bank accounts were prohibited for foreign banks conducting transactions in Iran's currency. The order affects banks in countries near Iran and includes derivative contracts based on the Iranian rial exchange rate. It expands the application of Executive Order 13622 to prevent Iran from acquiring precious stones or jewels. It blocks U.S.-based property of those conducting transactions with Iranian entities listed as SDNs or Blocked Persons. President Trump issued Executive Order 13871 sanctioning transactions with Iran's key minerals and industrial commodities. Iran earns 10% of its export revenues from these sanctioned minerals and metals. The order sanctions transactions involving Iran's key minerals and metals, blocking U.S.-based property and foreign banks involved. It also prohibits entry into the U.S. for sanctioned individuals and aims to prevent Iran from acquiring technology for weapons of mass destruction. The Iran-Iraq Arms Nonproliferation Act imposes sanctions on foreign entities supplying Iran with WMD technology or advanced conventional weapons, defined as destabilizing military capabilities. The Iran-Iraq Arms Nonproliferation Act imposes sanctions on foreign entities supplying Iran with WMD technology or advanced conventional weapons, defined as destabilizing military capabilities. Sanctions include bans on U.S. government procurement and exports, as well as restrictions on U.S. assistance, international lending, coproduction agreements, and technical exchanges with violating entities. The Iran-Iraq Arms Nonproliferation Act imposes sanctions on foreign entities supplying Iran with WMD technology or advanced conventional weapons. Sanctions include bans on U.S. government procurement and exports, restrictions on U.S. assistance, international lending, coproduction agreements, and technical exchanges with the country. The act also amended an earlier law to provide for a \"presumption of denial\" for all dual use exports to Iran. The Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 requires the President to withhold foreign aid from countries providing assistance to terrorism list countries. U.S. persons conducting financial transactions with terrorism list governments can face criminal charges. The Iran Nonproliferation Act imposes sanctions on firms selling technology useful for weapons of mass destruction or advanced conventional weapons to Iran. No sanctions have been imposed under this act. The Iran Nonproliferation Act (INKSNA) authorizes sanctions on foreign persons assisting Iran's WMD programs, including a ban on U.S. arms exports and government procurement. It also restricts U.S. payments to the Russian Aviation and Space Agency related to the international space station. No sanctions have been imposed under this act. The Iran Nonproliferation Act (INKSNA) authorizes sanctions on foreign persons assisting Iran's WMD programs, including a ban on U.S. arms exports and government procurement. Entities sanctioned under this law are listed in tables at the end of the report, with designations more than two years old no longer active. The JCPOA required the U.S. to suspend INKSNA sanctions related to nuclear activities, but no entities were delisted. Executive Order 13382 allows the President to block assets of WMD proliferators under various authorities. Numerous entities have been sanctioned under this order for dealings with WMD. The CAATSA law mandates sanctions on arms sales to Iran and entities contributing to Iran's ballistic missile program. E.O. 13382 sanctions entities assisting Iran's ballistic missile program. Delisted entities under JCPOA to be relisted on November 5, 2018. The CAATSA law requires sanctions on arms sales to Iran and entities involved in Iran's ballistic missile program. Sanctions are imposed on any person selling banned weapons systems to or from Iran, including tanks, warships, missiles, combat aircraft, and attack helicopters. The President must report every 180 days on individuals contributing to Iran's ballistic missile program. The CAATSA law mandates sanctions on arms sales to Iran and entities linked to Iran's ballistic missile program. Sanctions apply to those involved in selling prohibited weapons systems to or from Iran. The President must report every 180 days on individuals supporting Iran's ballistic missile program. Additionally, past foreign aid appropriations have withheld U.S. assistance to Russia unless it ends technical support to Iran's nuclear and missile programs. The JCPOA does not address any U.S. commitments to waive this sanction. Title III of CISADA provides authorities to sanction countries allowing U.S. technology that Iran could utilize. Title III of CISADA authorizes sanctions on countries that allow U.S. technology to be diverted to Iran for its nuclear and WMD programs. No country has been designated as a \"Country of Diversion Concern\" yet. During 2006-2016, the US Treasury Department used anti-proliferation laws to persuade foreign banks to stop dealing with Iran, citing its support for terrorist groups and weapons-related activities. Over 145 banks in 60 countries were approached, resulting in at least 80 banks ceasing financial transactions with Iranian banks. This initiative was largely dropped after the implementation of the JCPOA, with a shift towards encouraging foreign banks to cooperate. The US Treasury Department largely dropped the initiative to persuade foreign banks to stop dealing with Iran and instead focused on encouraging normal transactions. While there is no blanket ban on foreign banks paying Iran in US dollars, direct access to the US financial system is prohibited for Iran. US banks can send funds to Iran through intermediary financial institutions, such as European banks. Restrictions on dealing directly with Iranian banks still apply. On November 6, 2008, the Department of the Treasury expanded restrictions on Iran's access to the U.S. financial system by prohibiting U.S. banks from handling transactions with foreign banks involved in U-turn transactions for Iranian banks. This ban continued during the JCPOA implementation, hindering European and other banks from reentering the Iranian market. Treasury Secretary Lew in 2016 considered allowing foreign clearinghouses to acquire dollars for transactions with Iran without providing Iran with dollars. The Obama Administration encouraged bankers to reenter the Iran market without fear of sanctions, but the Trump Administration did not support greater access to dollars for Iran. U.S. sanctions have reduced foreign firms' willingness to use dollars in transactions with Iran. The Department of the Treasury has announced financial settlements with banks that helped Iran access the U.S. financial system, based on the value and duration of illicit transactions conducted. The FY2016 Consolidated Appropriation allows for the use of settlement proceeds to compensate victims of Iranian terrorism. Section 104 of CISADA prohibits U.S. banks from opening new accounts for foreign banks that do business with sanctioned entities. Foreign banks facilitating Iran's WMD acquisition or supporting terrorist groups are subject to sanctions. The United States sanctions foreign banks that support Iran's acquisition of weapons of mass destruction or terrorist groups. This includes banks transacting with the IRGC or Iran's energy, shipping, and shipbuilding sectors. The provision aims to limit Iran's import-export community's ability to obtain trade financing. The United States sanctions foreign banks that support Iran's acquisition of weapons of mass destruction or terrorist groups, including those transacting with the IRGC or Iran's energy, shipping, and shipbuilding sectors. This aims to limit Iran's import-export community's access to trade financing. The Department of the Treasury has authority to determine significant financial transactions, sanctioning banks like the Bank of Kunlun in China and the Elaf Islamic Bank in Iraq. Sanctions were lifted on Elaf Islamic Bank in Iraq in 2013 after reducing exposure to the Iranian financial sector. Iran was identified as a jurisdiction of primary money laundering concern under the USA Patriot Act, due to its financial system posing a threat to governments and financial institutions doing business with Iranian banks. The US sanctions foreign banks dealing with Iran to prevent improper Iranian access to the US financial system. The sanctions are in line with recommendations from the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), which labeled Iran as a high-risk jurisdiction for anti-money laundering and terrorism financing. Iran submitted an Action Plan to address these issues, leading to the suspension of countermeasures by the FATF. The FATF suspended countermeasures against Iran in June and November 2017, and February 2018. However, Iran only acted on 9 out of 10 guidelines, leading to a warning in October 2018. The FATF gave Iran until February 2019 to fully comply. In February 2019, the FATF stated that countermeasures remained suspended but warned of increased supervision if Iran did not enact remaining legislation by June 2019. FINCEN also warned U.S. banks about potential Iranian efforts to evade sanctions. The OFAC issued a warning to U.S. banks about Iranian efforts to evade financial sanctions using hawalas. Section 220 of the ITRSHRA required reports on electronic payment systems like SWIFT doing business with Iran, but sanctions are not mandated. Transactions with Iran are still subject to U.S. sanctions regardless of the payment mechanism. The National Defense Authorization Act for FY2013 sanctions Iran's economy and human rights abuses. Section 1244 of IFCA blocks U.S.-based property of entities supporting designated Iranian entities. Iranian entities delisted for economic activity will be relisted on November 5, 2018. Section 1247 of IFCA prohibits certain operations. Section 1247 of IFCA prohibits certain bank operations in the United States that facilitate financial transactions for Iranian SDNs. Foreign banks facilitating payments to Iran for natural gas must place funds in a local account, with a waiver period of 180 days. ISA sanctions apply to entities involved in transactions with Iran's energy, shipbuilding, and shipping sectors. Section 1245 imposes ISA sanctions on entities providing precious metals to Iran, including gold, or software for industrial processes. There are no exceptions for countries exempted under P.L. 112-81. This section went back into effect after a 90-day wind-down period on August 6, 2018. The provision under IFCA imposes sanctions on entities providing services, insurance, or reinsurance for transactions sanctioned under Iran-related executive orders. It includes an exception for Afghanistan reconstruction and was enforced on UAE-based Goldentex FZE. On October 16, 2018, OFAC designated Iranian industrial companies as terrorism-related entities. Several Iranian industrial companies have been designated under E.O. 13224 for providing revenue to the Basij security force in the Middle East. Foreign firms doing business with these companies could face U.S. sanctions under IFCA. The companies include Technotar Engineering, Iran Tractor Manufacturing, Iran's Zinc Mines Development, and Esfahan Mobarakeh Steel. Executive Order 13608 allows the Treasury Department to sanction foreign entities aiding Iran or Syria in evading sanctions. The Trump Administration is utilizing executive orders from the Obama Administration to sanction Iranian entities involved in cyberattacks. Iranian entities have targeted infrastructure in the US, Saudi Arabia, and other countries. Iran's cyberattack capabilities are increasing, leading to prosecutions by the Justice Department. Executive Order 13694 focuses on cyberactivities, while Executive Order 13581 targets transnational crime. Executive Order 13581 blocks U.S.-based property of entities involved in cyberattacks or transnational crime. Iran-related entities sanctioned under the Orders are listed in tables. Some U.S. laws require divestment of shares from firms conducting transactions with Iran. The JCPOA requires the United States to work with state and local governments to ensure that state-level sanctions do not conflict with the sanctions relief provided by the federal government under the JCPOA. Many states have adopted laws to divest from foreign companies conducting transactions with Iran. Since the June 12, 2009, election-related uprising in Iran, U.S. policy has focused on supporting the domestic opposition and sanctioning Iranian officials for human rights abuses. Sanctions on the IRGC are part of this trend due to its suppressive role. Some laws aim to expand internet freedom in Iran and prevent the government from identifying opponents online. Individuals and entities subject to sanctions are listed in tables at the end of the report. The \"VOICE\" Act in the FY2010 Defense Authorization Act aimed to increase U.S. broadcasting to Iran and prevent the Iranian government from using technology to monitor internet usage and suppress opponents. Sanctions were imposed on companies selling such technology to Iran, with specific focus on Nokia and Siemens. The Reduce Iranian Cyber-Suppression Act targeted Nokia and Siemens for selling internet monitoring technology to Iran in 2008. President Obama's executive order 13606 sanctioned individuals involved in human rights abuses in Iran and Syria through information technology. The order blocks U.S.-based property and prohibits U.S. trade with listed entities aiding in monitoring or disrupting computer usage in those countries. The Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act (ITRSHRA) sanctions the selling of technology enabling censorship in Iran or Syria. Executive Order 13628 blocks property of those involved in censorship or jamming communications in Iran. OFAC amended regulations to allow providing free software to Iranians. The OFAC ruling incorporated key features of the Iran Digital Empowerment Act, allowing for the waiver of the Iran-Iraq Arms Nonproliferation Act provision. CISADA exempts certain equipment from the U.S. export ban to help Iranians communicate and use the internet. The Department of the Treasury amended U.S.-Iran trade regulations to permit the export of additional software and information technology products to Iran under certain conditions. This included personal communications, data storage, browsers, plug-ins, document readers, and free mobile applications. Further amendments allowed for the sale of equipment to Iran on a cash basis. The regulations now allow for the sale of communication equipment to Iran on a cash basis, with sanctions targeting human rights abusers under Section 105 of CISADA. Section 105 of the ITRSHRA imposes sanctions on the Iranian government if certain conditions are not met, including the release of political prisoners, cessation of violence and torture, and progress towards establishing an independent judiciary. Sanctions also target those who sell goods that can be used for human rights abuses in Iran. Sanctions are imposed on individuals selling equipment like firearms, rubber bullets, and tear gas to the IRGC. IRIB, the state broadcasting group, is designated as a human rights abuser. Sanctions are also placed on those engaged in corruption or misappropriation. Sanctions are imposed on individuals engaged in corruption or misappropriation of humanitarian goods or funds for the Iranian people, targeting Iranian profiteers using official connections for personal gain. The provision codifies a similar one in Executive Order 13645 and authorizes sanctions on those responsible for extrajudicial killings or human rights violations in Iran. The provision under CAATSA requires the naming of Iranian human rights abusers annually, not limited to the 2009 uprising. Visa restrictions were imposed on 50 Iranian officials in 2011 for political repression, under Section 212(a)(3)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act. The State Department imposed visa restrictions on 60 Iranian officials in 2013 due to activities with serious consequences for the United States. High level Iranian visits to the U.N. in New York have exemptions, but visas were refused for 20 members of President Ahmadinejad's party in 2012 for past terrorism or human rights abuses. Despite this, Ahmadinejad was allowed to fly to the U.S. on Iran Air, a U.S.-sanctioned entity at the time. Iran Air, a U.S.-sanctioned entity, was allowed to park at Andrews Air Force base. U.N. sanctions on Iran applied to all member states, with resolutions imposing sanctions on Iran's nuclear program and WMD infrastructure. Resolution 1929 authorized member states to sanction civilian sectors of Iran's economy and imposed limitations on ballistic missiles and arms imports/exports. Resolution 2231 endorsed the JCPOA and superseded prior Iran-related resolutions. Resolution 2231, which endorsed the JCPOA, lifted U.N. sanctions on Iran and called on Iran to refrain from developing ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons for eight years. The resolution also required Security Council approval for Iran to export or purchase arms for five years. The JCPOA did not impose specific missile or arms requirements. The U.S. withdrawal from the JCPOA did not change the status of Resolution 2231. U.N. and International Atomic Energy Agency reports confirm Iran's compliance with its nuclear obligations under the JCPOA. U.S. officials have raised concerns about Iranian missile tests being inconsistent with Resolution 2231. Reports also highlight apparent violations of the resolution in relation to regional crises like Yemen. The Security Council has not taken action against Iran for apparent violations of Resolution 2231, which restricts Iran's arms exports. Entities sanctioned under previous resolutions will remain sanctioned until October 2023, with 36 entities delisted on Implementation Day. Bank Sepah and Bank Sepah International PLC were also delisted. The Security Council delisted 36 entities on Implementation Day, including Bank Sepah and Bank Sepah International PLC. The JPA provided temporary easing of sanctions, with waivers issued for Iran's oil customers. Waivers were issued to allow transactions with NIOC and enable Iran to receive $700 million per month from oil sales. The European Union amended regulations to allow shipping insurers to provide insurance for ships carrying oil from Iran. Several provisions of U.S.-Iran trade regulations were suspended, allowing Iran to sell petrochemicals, trade in gold, conduct transactions with foreign firms in automotive manufacturing, and make tuition payments for Iranian students abroad. Under the JCPOA, sanctions relief occurred at Implementation Day (January 16, 2016), following IAEA certification that Iran had completed core nuclear tasks. U.S. secondary sanctions were waived or terminated, easing restrictions on Iran's oil exports, foreign sales of gasoline and energy equipment, and foreign investment in Iran's energy sector. The EU lifted its ban on purchases of oil and gas from Iran, and Iranian banks were readmitted to the SWIFT electronic payments system. All U.N. sanctions were lifted. U.S. sanctions eased under the JCPOA will go back into effect on November 4, 2018, to deny Iran revenue for regional activities and weapons programs. Sanctions reinstated on August 7, 2018, include restrictions on U.S. bank notes, gold trade, and precious metals transactions in Iran. The sanctions imposed on Iran include restrictions on bank notes, trade in gold and precious metals, transactions in Iranian rial, sovereign debt issuance, graphite, aluminum, steel, coal, and industrial software transactions, importation of luxury goods to the U.S., and sale of passenger aircraft to Iran. Sanctions also target petroleum-related transactions, port operators, energy, shipping, shipbuilding sectors, and foreign bank transactions with Iran's Central Banks. All provisions went back into effect on November 5, 2018, after waivers were revoked following the U.S. exit from the JCPOA. The provisions discussed went back into effect on November 5, 2018, including the Iran Sanctions Act, FY2012 NDAA, Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act, and Iran Freedom and Counter-proliferation Act. Waivers were applied to certain sections, while others were not waived. Most Iranian banks were delisted to implement the JCPOA, but were relisted on November 5, 2018. Executive Orders 13574, 13590, 13622, 13645, and Sections 5-7 and 15 of Executive Order 13628 were revoked by Executive Order 13716, reinstated on August 6, 2018 by Executive Order 13846. Specific Iranian entities were delisted for sanctions, allowing foreign companies/banks to resume transactions without risking penalties from the US. Entities delisted on \"Transition Day\" (October 2023) were relisted for secondary sanctions on November 5, 2018, with exceptions like the AEOI and 23 subsidiaries. The delisting was to allow European and U.S. partners to continue providing civilian nuclear assistance to Iran under the JCPOA. The U.S. Administration was required to request Congress to lift most sanctions suspended under the JCPOA by \"Transition Day,\" with no mandated outcome. U.N. sanctions were to terminate after 10 years (\"Termination Day\"), but U.S. exit from the JCPOA made U.S.-related provisions irrelevant. Despite reimposing all U.S. sanctions on Iran, the Trump Administration issued exceptions allowed under various U.S. sanctions. On November 5, 2018, the Administration issued exceptions to U.S. sanctions laws, allowing eight countries to continue transactions with Iran's Central Bank and purchase Iranian oil. Despite indications of renewal, the exceptions were terminated on April 22, 2019. Additionally, waivers for international technical assistance to Iran's nuclear sites were ended on May 3. The Administration issued waivers to allow Russia to remove Iran's excess LEU and export heavy water to Oman. President Rouhani announced Iran's decision to no longer abide by JCPOA stockpile limits. Waivers were granted to enable Iraq to continue purchasing natural gas from Iran. The Administration also provided exceptions for Afghan reconstruction at Iran's Chahbahar Port and renewed licenses for firms developing the Rhum gas field. The United States has renewed licenses for certain firms to continue developing the Rhum gas field in the North Sea, which Iran partly owns. Sanctions related to terrorism, human rights abuses, arms sales, and proliferation-sensitive technology remain in effect, including the ban on U.S. trade with Iran and sanctions on terrorism entities. The JCPOA does not require the U.S. to revoke Iran's placement on the terrorism list. The United States has renewed licenses for certain firms to continue developing the Rhum gas field in the North Sea, which Iran partly owns. Sanctions related to terrorism, human rights abuses, arms sales, and proliferation-sensitive technology remain in effect, including the ban on U.S. trade with Iran and sanctions on terrorism entities. Sanctions might have been reimposed by congressional action in accordance with President Trump's withholding of certification. Congress had the opportunity to reimpose sanctions on Iran under expedited procedures after President Trump withheld certification of Iranian compliance with the JCPOA. Despite the provisions for \"snap back\" of U.N. sanctions in the JCPOA, Congress did not take action to reimpose sanctions that were suspended. The Administration may trigger the snap-back mechanism of old U.N. Security Council resolutions if Iran is not forthcoming with the IAEA about its past nuclear weapons research. International cooperation and compliance with U.S. sanctions on Iran were driven by a global consensus to pressure Iran and prevent the development of nuclear weapons. International cooperation and compliance with U.S. sanctions on Iran have been a global effort, with all JCPOA parties opposing the U.S. decision to exit the agreement. EU sanctions on Iran have become extensive, similar to those of the United States. For more details on Iran's relations with other countries, refer to CRS Report R44017 by Kenneth Katzman. In 2002, Iran accessed international capital markets for the first time since the Islamic revolution, selling $500 million in bonds to European banks. Negotiations between the EU and Iran on a \"Trade and Cooperation Agreement\" aimed to lower tariffs or increase quotas for Iranian exports to EU countries. EU sanctions were lifted under the JCPOA, including bans on oil and gas imports, insurance for shipping oil, trade in gold and precious metals, and freezing assets of Iranian firms. The EU sanctions on Iran include a ban on transactions between European and Iranian banks, exports of certain goods to Iran, and restrictions on specific technologies. Some Iranian banks were removed from the SWIFT electronic payments system, and certain entities were delisted by the EU. Sanctions remaining in place include an embargo on arms sales to Iran and restrictions on certain individuals and entities. The EU has imposed sanctions on Iran, including a ban on transactions between European and Iranian banks, exports of certain goods, and restrictions on technologies. More than 100 European companies have left Iran to avoid reimposed U.S. sanctions, including stopping investments and transactions. No EU state has bought Iranian oil since U.S. energy sanctions were reinstated in November 2018. Several European companies, including Renault, Citroen, Daimler, Volkswagen, Scania, Siemens, and Danieli, suspended their investments and activities in Iran following the reimposition of U.S. sanctions in November 2018. Renault and Citroen halted their $1 billion investments in a joint venture to increase car production capacity in Iran. Daimler and Volkswagen also announced suspensions, while Scania's bus factory status remains unclear. Siemens ceased pursuing new Iranian business, and Italy's Danieli conglomerates took similar actions. Several European companies, including Danieli and Gruppo Ventura, have exited the Iranian market. Several banks, such as DZ Bank, Allianz, Oberbank, and Banque Wormser Freres, have ceased transactions with Iran. Germany's central bank blocked Iran's withdrawal of $400 million from EIH. Total SA has exited a $5 billion energy investment in South Pars gas field. European companies and banks have been exiting the Iranian market. OMV of Austria and Norway's Saga Energy have halted energy development work, while Italy's FS and Norway's Saga Energy have signed billion-dollar deals for projects in Iran. Hapag-Lloyd and AP Moller-Maersk have stopped shipping services to Iran, and Deutsche Telekom has ended its business in Iran. Air France and British Air have also ceased flights to Iran. Additionally, the Rhum gas field project, partly owned by Iranian Oil Company, is facing challenges. The Rhum gas field in the North Sea, partly owned by Iranian Oil Company, continues to operate supplying 5% of Britain's natural gas demand. Despite Iranian involvement, the Trump Administration renewed BP and Serica Energy's license to provide goods and services to the field. EU countries have taken steps to support Iran in adhering to the JCPOA, including implementing a \"blocking statute\" and providing development assistance. The EU created a special purpose vehicle (SPV) to facilitate trade with Iran, bypassing U.S. sanctions. The SPV, known as INSTEX, focuses on essential sectors like medicine, medical devices, and food, with potential expansion to include oil. Iran set up the \"Special Trade and Finance Instrument\" (STFI) as a counterparty to INSTEX, a platform for non-European countries to trade with Iran in oil and other products. Despite U.S. criticism, Iranian officials viewed this as a positive first step, while U.S. pressure on the EU raised concerns about INSTEX being used for money laundering. The U.S. is concerned about INSTEX being used by Iran for money laundering or terrorism funding. Mandelker's statement hinted at potential sanctions on INSTEX or its partners. European countries aim to engage economically with Iran while supporting U.S. efforts against Iran's terrorism activities. Recent actions include Albania expelling Iranian diplomats over a terrorism plot and the EU sanctioning Iran's intelligence service for terrorism plotting in Europe. Germany also denied landing rights to Iran's Mahan Air. Germany denied landing rights to Iran's Mahan Air, a designated terrorism supporting entity. SWIFT, the electronic payments system, has disconnected Iranian banks listed for U.S. sanctions. EU diplomats did not comply with U.S. requests to expel Iranian banks again. Russia and China, U.N. Security Council members, are involved in the situation. Russia and China, as U.N. Security Council members and parties to the JCPOA, opposed the U.S. withdrawal from the agreement. It is expected that Iran's trade will shift towards China and Russia due to limited U.S. exposure. Iran and Russia are discussing expanding energy and trade cooperation, with agreements on energy development deals worth up to $30 billion. Iran also signed a free trade deal with the Russia-led \"Eurasian Economic Union\" in December 2018. In December 2018, Iran signed a free trade deal with the Russia-led \"Eurasian Economic Union,\" indicating Russian support against U.S. sanctions. Russia's Rosatam conglomerate may face revenue reduction due to the Trump Administration's ending of waivers for Iran's nuclear program. Russia delivered the S-300 air defense system to Iran in April 2016. China's role is crucial in any sanctions on Iran as it is Iran's largest oil customer. China played a significant role in reducing Iran's oil exports during the sanctions regime, cutting its purchases from Iran and impacting Iran's oil sales. After sanctions were lifted in 2016, China increased its oil purchases from Iran. Chinese energy firms invested in Iran's energy sector, putting projects on hold in 2012 but resuming work after sanctions were eased. China also took over some EU energy investments divested after U.S. sanctions. Since the reimposition of U.S. sanctions, China has reduced its oil imports. China has reduced its oil imports from Iran since the reimposition of U.S. sanctions. Despite the end of the SRE, China continues to import some Iranian oil, stockpiling 20 million barrels at its Dalian port. Sanctions have complicated Iran-China banking and trade relations, with China settling trade balances with goods rather than hard currency. China's Kunlun Bank, sanctioned in 2012, has stopped accepting certain payments from Iran, affecting banking relations between the two countries. Iran's automotive sector relies on Chinese parts, and an escrow account funds China's infrastructure projects in Iran. Hard currency reserves are used for these projects, but U.S. sanctions have complicated Iran-China banking relations. Iranian accounts at Kunlun Bank can still pay for Iranian imports from China. China's President Xi Jinping sees Iran as crucial for extending economic influence westward through the \"One Belt, One Road\" initiative. Chinese firms are modernizing Iran's infrastructure with loans, linking it to neighboring countries like Oman. This integration gives China incentive to avoid U.S. sanctions. In April 2018, the Commerce Department took action against China's ZTE Corporation for export violations. The US took action against China-based ZTE Corporation for violating a settlement agreement over shipments of prohibited US technology to Iran. Japan and South Korea enforced sanctions on Iran similar to the US and EU, cutting imports of Iranian oil but later increasing them. Japan exports chemical, rubber products, and electronics to Iran. South Korean firms export chemical, rubber products, and electronics to Iran. South Korea sought Administration approval to import Iranian condensates. Both countries reduced Iranian oil purchases to zero in October 2018 and received sanctions exceptions in November 2018. Both Japan and South Korea initially received sanctions exceptions in November 2018, allowing for limited Iranian oil imports. However, following the U.S. decision to end these exceptions in May 2019, both countries are expected to cease energy transactions with Iran. South Korea is looking to replace Iranian condensate supplies with those from Qatar and Australia. Several firms, including Daelim and Hyundai, have terminated contracts in Iran, while car companies Mazda, Toyota, and Hyundai have suspended joint ventures in the country. Additionally, banks like Woori Bank and Industrial are also adjusting their postures in response to the U.S. exit from the JCPOA. North Korea, under significant international sanctions, reportedly cooperates with Iran on WMD-related ventures, including ballistic missile development. Some oil China buys from Iran is said to be sent to North Korea, but it's unclear if North Korea directly purchases Iranian oil. North Korea's potential to buy Iranian oil illicitly increased after U.N. sanctions in 2017, but there are no known indications of this. Taiwan, a small buyer of Iranian oil, stopped imports in late 2018 and is unlikely to resume after the end of SREs in 2019. India also cites U.N. Security Council sanctions. India reduced oil imports from Iran after sanctions were eased in 2016, incurring costs to retrofit refineries. They settled half of oil purchases in rupees, using the currency to buy various products from India. Oil imports from Iran increased to 800,000 bpd in July. India's oil imports from Iran increased to 800,000 bpd in July 2018, well above 2011 levels. Indian firms resumed work that had been slowed during 2012-2016 and paid Iran $6.5 billion owed for oil purchased during that time. India's cooperation with U.S. sanctions is mixed, with rupee accounts used for bilateral trade. Despite a fall in purchases, India received the SRE exception on November 5, 2018, and is expected to continue importing Iranian oil through alternative payment arrangements. Despite the end of the SRE in May 2019, Indian officials stated they would comply with U.S. sanctions and find alternative suppliers. Some sources suggest Indian refiners may still be buying Iranian oil as of mid-May 2019. India and Iran agreed in 2015 to develop the Chahbahar port, allowing India to trade with Afghanistan. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi signed a $500 million agreement in 2016 to develop the port and related infrastructure. Construction at the port is ongoing, with the U.S. utilizing the \"Afghanistan reconstruction\" exception to allow firms to continue development. The pipeline project to carry Iranian gas to Pakistan was finalized in June 2010 despite U.S. threats of sanctions. Iran completed its side of the pipeline by mid-2014, with China investing $3 billion in 2015. The JCPOA removed sanctions obstacles, but Pakistan did not commit to completing the project during President Rouhani's visit in March 2016. India had previously withdrawn from the project in 2009. India withdrew from the Iranian gas pipeline project in 2009 due to concerns about security, pricing, and tariffs. Turkey has significant economic ties with Iran, buying a large portion of its oil and gas from the country. Despite initially reducing purchases of Iranian oil, Turkey's imports returned to previous levels after sanctions were eased in 2016. Turkey received sanctions exemptions but its oil imports from Iran have decreased since late 2018. Turkey's leaders have expressed opposition to reimposed U.S. sanctions, but their oil import volumes from Iran have fallen. Turkey's dependence on Iranian oil and gas, along with the importance of the gas pipeline between the two countries, may explain Turkey's decision to continue buying Iranian oil despite the expiration of the SRE exception. The pipeline was initially used for a swap arrangement with Turkmenistan before direct Iranian gas exports to Turkey began in 2001. Prior to the EU ban on gas purchases from Iran, the pipeline also facilitated Iranian gas exports to Europe. U.S. officials testified in 2013 that Turkey's Halkbank was settling payments to Iran with gold, mainly from Iranian private citizens buying Turkish gold to hedge against the rial's value. A Turkish-Iranian gold dealer, Reza Zarrab, was arrested in 2016 for violating U.S. sanctions on Iran. In 2016, individuals were indicted for using money services businesses in Turkey and the UAE to conceal transactions for sanctioned Iranian entities. In 2014, the Commerce Department blocked a Turkey-based firm from undisclosed activities. The Commerce Department blocked a Turkey-based firm from re-exporting U.S.-made jet engines to Iran's Pouya Airline due to concerns about Iran's financial resources from Caspian Sea energy reserves. Previous administrations used potential ISA sanctions to deter oil pipeline routes involving Iran, leading to the operationalization of an alternate route from Azerbaijan to Turkey in 2005. Executive Order 13622 exempts pipelines bringing gas from Azerbaijan to Europe and Turkey from sanctions. Agreements in 2018 between Russia and Caspian Sea states on sea division could lead to new energy development. Iran's energy firms are expected to partner in developing Caspian resources, requiring the Administration to make decisions. Iran's relations with Azerbaijan are hindered by political and ideological differences, but they have been working together on joint economic projects. Iran also has extensive economic relations with Armenia, including a gas pipeline inaugurated in 2009. No determination on ISA sanctions was issued regarding these relationships. Iran is using Armenian banks in Nagorno-Karabakh to bypass financial sanctions. Gulf states like Saudi Arabia and UAE have increased oil exports to compensate for Iran's decreased exports. US officials are working with Gulf oil exporters to ensure a well-supplied global oil market. After the end of SREs on May 2, 2019, Gulf countries maintain normal trade with Iran, attracting U.S. scrutiny due to the presence of Iranian firms. UAE-based firms have been sanctioned, with praise for the UAE's ban on transactions with Iran. Emirates National Oil Company imported Iranian gas condensates and sought alternative supplies post-U.S. exit from the JCPOA. Several Gulf states are seeking alternative supplies of hydrocarbon products from Iran, but projects have not materialized due to regional disputes. Kuwait and Iran discussed a pipeline project that has not progressed, while Bahrain's talks of purchasing Iranian gas have stalled. Qatar and Iran have closer economic relations, with Oman being the only GCC state moving forward with joint ventures, particularly in the development of the Al Duqm port. Iran and Oman are working on joint ventures, including a gas pipeline project and the expansion of the Al Duqm port. Iranian funds amounting to $5.7 billion were held in Oman's Bank Muscat, with Iran obtaining a special license in February 2016 to convert the funds into Euros. This led to a Senate review in May 2018 to assess the license issuance. The Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigation reviewed a license issued to Iran in 2016 to convert $5.7 billion held in Oman's Bank Muscat into Euros. Iraq's close ties with Iran have complicated its efforts to rebuild its economy while avoiding U.S. sanctions. In 2013, Iraq signed an agreement with Iran to buy natural gas, raising sanctions-related concerns. In May 2015, the Treasury Department sanctioned Iraq's Al Naser Airlines for assisting Mahan Air in acquiring nine aircraft. The Trump Administration is reportedly trying to accommodate Iraq's need for Iranian electricity supplies. Iraq has stopped crude oil swaps with Iran, and the Administration has granted Iraq waiver permission to buy Iranian natural gas for its power plants under Section 1247 of IFCA. The waiver period has been limited to 90-day increments to allow Iraq time to find alternative supplies for generating electricity. Iran has extensive economic relations with Syria and Lebanon, where core interests are at stake. Compliance with international sanctions against Iran by Syrian and Lebanese banks is limited. Iran reportedly uses Lebanese banks to bypass financial sanctions and provide assistance to Hezbollah and the Syrian regime. Sanctions on Iran are impacting Hezbollah's finances, leading to expense cuts, donation requests, and delays. Iran's finances have been strained, leading to expense cuts, donation requests, and delayed payments to fighters. Iran signed economic agreements with Syria in 2017, giving Iranian firms access to various sectors. Despite efforts to circumvent sanctions through trade with Latin American and African countries, the impact on international sanctions remains limited. The united approach to sanctions on Iran from 2010-2016 also affected international lending, with the US representative required to vote against it, but not enough to block it. No new loans have been approved to Iran since 2005, including environmental projects under the Bank's \"Global Environmental Facility\" (GEF). The lifting of sanctions in 2016 increased international support for new lending to Iran, but the U.S. exit from the JCPOA may lead to differences with other lenders. In 1993, the U.S. voted against loans to Iran, but they were still approved. To block the lending, foreign aid appropriations cut the U.S. contribution to the bank by the amount of those loans. In May 2000, the United States' allies approved $232 million in loans for health and sewage projects in Iran. From April 2003 to May 2005, $725 million in loans were approved for various projects, including environmental management, housing reform, water and sanitation, and earthquake relief. Iran began accession talks with the World Trade Organization in 2006 after the lifting of sanctions. Iran's accession to the World Trade Organization may be complicated by existing members' consensus and the U.S. trade ban on Iran. The effectiveness of Iran sanctions from 2011-2016 led to increased willingness to accept restraints on its nuclear program. President Hassan Rouhani's election in 2013 was partly due to his commitment to easing sanctions and ending Iran's isolation. The intelligence community is uncertain about Iran's long-term nuclear intentions despite the JCPOA restrictions. Iran has partially violated JCPOA restrictions in response to U.S. actions but has not fully withdrawn. Both Trump and Rouhani have expressed willingness for bilateral talks covering nuclear, missile, and regional activities. President Rouhani has expressed willingness for bilateral talks without conditions, but both leaders believe the other's demands are too extensive. Despite sanctions, Iran's nuclear and missile programs have continued to advance. Sanctions have hindered Iran from purchasing major combat systems since the 1990s, leading to growth in its indigenous arms industry. U.S. intelligence officials confirm Iran's development of increasingly lethal weapons systems. Iran continues to field increasingly lethal weapons systems, including advanced naval mines, ballistic missiles, small submarines, armed UAVs, coastal defense cruise missile batteries, attack craft, and anti-ship ballistic missiles. Despite sanctions, Iran has been able to acquire defensive systems not banned by Resolution 2231, such as the S-300 air defense system from Russia. Sanctions have not significantly impacted Iran's regional behavior, as it remains engaged in conflicts in Syria, Iraq, and Yemen. Iran manufactures much of the weaponry it supplies to regional allies domestically. Iran has scaled back payments to Hezbollah and pro-Iranian fighters in Syria, possibly due to financial difficulties or reduced activity in the conflict. The US Administration sees this as a success of its \"maximum pressure\" campaign on Iran, claiming that easing sanctions led to Iran expanding its regional activities. President Trump stated that Iran's defense budget increased by 40% during the period of the JCPOA. The regime used funds from the JCPOA to build nuclear-capable missiles, fund terrorism, and fuel conflict. Reimposition of sanctions intensifies pressure on Tehran. Experts believe Iran's regional activities increased due to conflicts, not sanctions relief. Congressional oversight requires reports on Iran's use of sanctions relief benefits. The Agreement Review Act (P.L. 114-17) mandates a semiannual report on Iran's compliance with the JCPOA, including any use of funds for terrorism. Despite the Trump Administration's efforts to pressure Iran, there is no immediate political threat to President Rouhani's position. The IRGC and hardliners criticize Rouhani for staying in the JCPOA despite U.S. exit. In response to economic concerns, Rouhani made cabinet changes and replaced Iran's Central Bank governor. Foreign Minister Zarif resigned under pressure but was reinstated by Rouhani. Sanctions may be fueling periodic unrest in Iran, including labor strikes and protests by women. Labor strikes and unrest among women protesting the strict public dress code have continued in Iran since late 2017. Other protests over flooding in the southwest in March-April 2019 have also occurred. The U.S. sanctions imposed since 2011 have taken a toll on Iran's economy, with GDP being 15%-20% smaller than it would have been without sanctions. Unemployment rose to about 20% by 2014, leading to many Iranians working unpaid or partially paid. Iran's GDP was about $400 billion in 2015, reaching $1.4 trillion on a PPP basis. The lifting of sanctions in 2016 led to 7% annual growth until 2018. However, the reimposition of U.S. sanctions in 2018 caused a 2% GDP decline from March 2018 to March 2019, with a projected decline of over 5% from March 2019 to March 2020. Iran's oil exports dropped significantly due to global sanctions, losing over $160 billion in revenues. The JCPOA sanctions relief briefly increased oil exports, but U.S. sanctions have reduced exports to under 1 mbd, costing Iran $10 billion in lost oil revenues since May 2018. The reimposition of sanctions since May 2018 has cost Iran $10 billion in lost oil revenues. Global banks mostly left the Iranian market after 2011 due to international sanctions, and those that reentered faced concerns over potential U.S. sanctions, lack of transparency in Iran's financial sector, and extra costs in transactions. Iran faced challenges in accessing hard currency due to sanctions, with reserves of $115 billion in foreign banks by January 2016. Sanctions relief allowed Iran to access these funds and use the SWIFT electronic payments system. U.S.-based shipping reinsurers no longer have active waivers, forcing Iran to self-insure most shipments. Iran's foreign reserves of $115 billion in foreign banks by January 2016 were used to access the SWIFT electronic payments system. About $60 billion was owed to creditors like China and for nonperforming loans to Iranian energy companies. Sanctions caused the rial to decline in value, stabilizing under Rouhani but plummeting again with the reimposition of U.S. sanctions in 2018. Inflation accelerated due to the drop in currency value, reaching 60% during 2011-2013. Sanctions led to a ban on importing 1,400 goods to preserve hard currency. Industrial and auto production suffered, with vehicle production falling by 60% from 2011 to 2013. Inflation fluctuated, reaching nearly 40% by the end of 2018. Iran's vehicle production fell by about 60% from 2011 to 2013. The auto sector rebounded after sanctions were lifted but is declining again due to divestments by auto makers following the U.S. exit from the JCPOA. Researchers estimated a 45% decline in auto production by March 2019. U.S.-Iran trade remains negligible, with U.S. imports from Iran around $63 million in 2017 and 2018. Iran's export diversification strategy, including promoting nonoil products like minerals and agricultural goods, has helped mitigate the impact of sanctions. The country has also reallocated investment funds and focused on import substitution to cope with reimposed U.S. sanctions. Iran has increased domestic production of goods as substitutes for imports due to sanctions, supported by Supreme Leader Khamene'i for a \"resistance economy.\" Partial privatization of state-owned enterprises has occurred, with some transferred to quasi-governmental entities. Rouhani aims to reduce the IRGC's presence in the economy through divestment. The IRGC controls a substantial part of Iran's economy, estimated at least 20%. Subsidy reductions started in 2007 under Ahmadinejad, with cash payments to compensate for reduced subsidies. Rouhani continued reducing subsidies by raising gasoline and food prices, limiting cash payments to families in financial hardship, and improving tax collections. Iran has implemented import restrictions and currency controls to conserve hard currency, especially for essential goods. Sanctions have led to a decrease in oil and gas production capacity, with a significant loss of investment in the sector. Iran estimates needing $130-$145 billion in new investment by 2020 to maintain oil production levels. Iran requires $130-$145 billion in new investment by 2020 to prevent a decline in oil production capacity. The South Pars gas field alone needs $100 billion for further development. Sanctions led to limited activity at Iran's oil and gas sites from 2012-2016, with some foreign investors reselling their stakes. The lifting of sanctions in 2016 attracted foreign investors back with more favorable investment terms under the \"Iran Petroleum Contract.\" Iran signed agreements with international energy firms for rights to a set percentage of its oil reserves. Major firms have started divesting due to the U.S. exit from the JCPOA. Sanctions relief allowed Iran to resume gas sector development, primarily for reinjection into oil fields. Iran exports gas to Turkey and Armenia but faces challenges in developing LNG export business. The Philippine National Oil Company is interested in building an LNG plant in Iran. The CISADA law targeted gasoline sales to Iran, impacting the industry. The CISADA law targeting gasoline sales to Iran had a significant impact, leading to a decrease in gasoline deliveries from 120,000 to 30,000 barrels per day. Despite this, Iran expanded its refineries and achieved self-sufficiency in gasoline production by 2017. There is no clear link between sanctions and Iran's human rights practices, with only modest improvements noted in recent years. Since 2012, foreign firms have refrained from selling monitoring equipment to Iran, and some relationships were ended due to sanctions. The regime still has the ability to censor social media despite sanctions. The sanctions imposed on Iran from 2012-2016 had significant humanitarian effects, limiting access to expensive Western-made medicines like chemotherapy drugs. Reports suggest that the Iranian government may have exaggerated medicine shortages to generate opposition to the sanctions. Medicine shortages resurfaced in 2018 after the reimposition of sanctions by the Trump Administration, hindering the flow of humanitarian goods and contributing to further shortages in medicine. The sanctions on Iran have led to shortages in medicine for ailments like multiple sclerosis and cancer. Global food traders like Cargill and Bunge have stopped supplying Iran due to lack of trade financing. U.S. sanctions have hindered relief efforts for flooding victims in Iran. EU officials have called for a \"white list\" to facilitate humanitarian transactions with Iran. Iranian officials also blame U.S. sanctions for hampering international relief efforts for flood victims. Pollution in Tehran and other cities is exacerbated by various factors. Iran's efforts to address environmental hazards may be hindered by the denial of World Bank lending. U.S. sanctions have caused Iran's passenger airline fleet to deteriorate, leading to safety concerns. Sanctions relief has alleviated some humanitarian difficulties, with sales of passenger aircraft being announced in the aviation sector. Sales of passenger aircraft have been announced and licensed by the Department of the Treasury since Implementation Day. However, licenses are being revoked, and deliveries will not proceed beyond November 2018. Iran Air announced plans to purchase aircraft from Airbus and Boeing, but deliveries have been halted due to revoked licenses. In 2018, Boeing planned to sell 30 777 model aircraft to Iran, but deliveries were cancelled after export licenses were revoked. Aseman Airlines had a tentative agreement to buy 30 Boeing MAX planes, but no U.S. license was announced before the U.S. exit from the JCPOA. Airbus also had agreements with Iranian airlines for A320 and A330 aircraft, and ATR sold 20 planes to Iran Air, with deliveries halted after U.S. sanctions reimposition in August 2018. After the August 6, 2018, initial sanctions reimposition, Iran's export licenses were revoked. The JCPOA oversight and implications, along with broader issues of Iran's behavior, have been the subject of legislation. The Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act of 2015 provided for a congressional review period, but no legislation of disapproval was enacted. The Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act of 2015 outlined certification and reporting requirements under INARA, including the Material Breach Report and Certification Report. The Trump Administration withdrew from the agreement, leading to the non-applicability of these requirements. The latest certification was submitted on July 17, 2017, with another one due on October 15, 2017. However, on October 13, 2017, the Administration declined to make that certification. The Trump Administration declined to certify Iran's compliance with the nuclear agreement, citing sanctions relief as disproportionate. Congress may reimpose sanctions within 60 days if a breach is reported or compliance is not certified. INARA also requires reports every 180 days on Iran's nuclear program, terrorism financing, ballistic missile advances, and support for terrorism. The Visa Waiver Program was amended to require a visa for those who visited certain countries in the previous five years. Iran raised concerns about the provision affecting European businessmen visiting Iran. The Obama Administration assured Iran that the provision would not impinge on sanctions relief. President Trump issued executive orders prohibiting Iranian citizens from entering the United States. The Iran Sanctions Extension Act (H.R. 6297) extended ISA until December 31, 2026, despite objections from Iranian leaders. President Obama allowed the bill to become law without signing it, as he retained authority to reimpose sanctions on Iran. The FY2017 National Defense Authorization Act contained a provision requiring quarterly reports. The Authorization Act (P.L. 114-328) mandated quarterly reports to Congress on Iran's missile launches and U.S. sanctions until December 31, 2022. Efforts to sanction entities aiding missile launches were included. Legislation like the Iran Policy Oversight Act and the Iran Terror Finance Transparency Act aimed to add certification requirements for removing Iranian entity sanctions. The IRGC Terrorist Designation Act would assess if the IRGC qualifies as a Foreign Terrorist Organization. The Obama Administration argued that the law for Foreign Terrorist Organization designations applies only to groups, not armed forces of a nation-state like the IRGC. The Prohibiting Assistance to Nuclear Iran Act aimed to restrict U.S. funds for Iran's nuclear program, conflicting with the JCPOA. The Justice for Victims of Iranian Terrorism Act sought to prevent the President from waiving sanctions until Iran paid terrorism-related judgments. H.R. 3728, H.R. 4257, and S. 2725 were bills introduced to impose sanctions on Iran for various reasons, including electronic payments systems, terrorism list removal, and support for Iran's ballistic missile program. The bills aimed to make sanctions mandatory, require congressional approval for delisting from sanctions, and subject specified sectors of Iran's economy to U.S. sanctions. Several bills, including H.R. 5631, S. 15, S. 227, H.R. 808, H.R. 4992, and S. 3267, aimed to impose sanctions on Iran for supporting its ballistic missile program. These bills required sanctions on sectors of Iran's economy involved in the program, with some contradicting the JCPOA. The Obama Administration opposed some of these bills as they violated agreements. The Obama Administration opposed bills and amendments in the 114th Congress that aimed to block transactions involving Iran, including the purchase of heavy water and Boeing aircraft. These measures, such as H.R. 5119, H.R. 5715, and H.R. 5711, were passed by the House despite opposition from the Obama Administration. The 115th Congress enacted or considered Iran sanctions legislation, including bills S. 722 and H.R. 3203, with additional sanctions provisions related to North Korea in H.R. 3364. The Obama Administration opposed these measures as JCPOA violations. H.R. 3364, with additional sanctions provisions related to North Korea, was passed by Congress and signed into law by President Trump on August 2, 2017. The law, known as CAATSA, includes provisions on Iran that do not conflict with the JCPOA. It does not reimpose U.S. secondary sanctions on Iran's civilian economic sectors but allows for sanctions on Iranian proliferation, human rights abuses, terrorism, or the IRGC. Section 108 of CAATSA requires an Administration review of designated entities. H.R. 1698, the Iran Ballistic Missiles and International Sanctions Enforcement Act, passed the House with a vote of 423-2. It aimed to sanction foreign entities assisting Iran's ballistic missile program and those selling banned combat systems to Iran. The House Financial Services Committee ordered reported two bills on November 14, 2017. H.R. 1638, the Iranian Leadership Asset Transparency Act, required reporting on assets held by Iranian leaders. H.R. 4324, the Strengthening Oversight of Iran's Access to Finance Act, required reports on financing of Iranian commercial aircraft purchases for potential money-laundering or terrorism risks. The bill H.R. 5132, known as The Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps Economic Exclusion Act, mandated Administration reports on entities linked to the IRGC and their transactions. It aimed to address potential money-laundering or terrorism risks associated with Iranian proliferation. Some concerns were raised about its impact on aircraft sales to Iran and the U.S. JCPOA commitment. Additionally, a proposed legislation outlined by Senators Corker and Cotton aimed to reimpose sanctions on Iran if it breached JCPOA restrictions, including those related to missile developments. The bill H.R. 5132, The Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps Economic Exclusion Act, required Administration reports on entities linked to the IRGC and their transactions. It aimed to address money-laundering or terrorism risks associated with Iranian proliferation. The bill defined entities owned or controlled by the IRGC, even if ownership is less than 50%. It did not mandate sanctions but established a process for naming entities in Iran's civilian economic sectors as SDNs. The Banking Transparency for Sanctioned Persons Act of 2018, H.R. 4591, S. 3431, and H.R. 4238 aimed to block U.S.-based property and prevent U.S. visas for individuals threatening Iraq's stability, particularly targeting Iran's Shiite militia allies. H.R. 4591 passed the House on November 27, 2018, and with the U.S. exiting the JCPOA, there is potential for the 116th Congress to consider sanctions on Iranian economic sectors not covered by the JCPOA. Several Senators and at least one House Member planned to introduce legislation to greatly expand U.S. secondary sanctions on Iran's financial sector, including mandatory sanctions on the SWIFT electronic payments system and sanctioning foreign persons aiding Iran's digital currency efforts. Several bills have been introduced imposing sanctions on Iranian proxies in Iraq and elsewhere, including the Iranian Proxies Terrorist Sanctions Act of 2019 and the Preventing Destabilization of Iraq Act of 2019. The Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps Exclusion Act and the Iran Ballistic Missiles and International Sanctions Enforcement Act have also been introduced. Other possible sanctions are being considered in a global or multilateral framework. Kenneth Katzman's report on Iran includes comparisons of sanctions imposed by the U.S., U.N., and EU, as well as details on major investments in Iran's energy sector and entities sanctioned under various resolutions and decisions."
