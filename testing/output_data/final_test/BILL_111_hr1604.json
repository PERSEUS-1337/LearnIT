    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Universal Right to Vote by Mail Act of 2009\". Congress finds an inequity in voting rights due to some states allowing universal mail-in voting while others do not. Many voters face difficulties getting to polls on election day and are not permitted to vote by mail. 28 states allow universal absentee voting without requiring a reason, and voting by mail gives voters more time to consider their choices. Allowing all voters the option to vote by mail can increase voter participation and reduce waiting times at polling stations. Voting by mail is preferred by many as an alternative to in-person voting, and there is no evidence suggesting higher fraud potential compared to other voting methods. Many state laws requiring voters to provide personal information for mail-in voting violate privacy and do not prevent fraud. Notary signature requirements for mail-in voting only add cost and inconvenience without increasing security. Promoting ability of voters to vote by mail in federal elections through new section 303A in Help America Vote Act of 2002. The new section 303A in the Help America Vote Act of 2002 prohibits states from imposing additional conditions on mail-in voting eligibility for federal elections, except for signature verification requirements. States must ensure that absentee ballots are only provided to individuals whose signatures are on the official list of registered voters. The new section 303A of the Help America Vote Act of 2002 prohibits states from adding conditions to mail-in voting eligibility for federal elections, except for signature verification. States must verify the signature on absentee ballots with the official list of registered voters before accepting and processing them. This does not affect the use of polling places for federal elections. States must comply with these requirements for federal elections.

Additionally, Section 401 of the Act has been amended to include enforcement provisions. The Help America Vote Act of 2002 has been amended to include a new section 303A, which promotes the ability of voters to vote by mail."
