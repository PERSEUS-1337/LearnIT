    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Pulmonary Fibrosis Research Enhancement Act\". Congress finds that pulmonary fibrosis (PF) is a fatal lung disease affecting over 200,000 individuals in the US, with 48,000 new cases and 40,000 deaths annually. PF prevalence has increased by 150% since 2001, with a median survival rate of 2.8 years. The cause of PF is often unknown, but environmental or occupational exposure to pollutants may play a role. Public awareness of pulmonary fibrosis (PF) is low despite its increasing prevalence. There is no FDA-approved treatment or cure for PF. Federal efforts to improve understanding of PF are lacking, but nonprofit groups are working to increase awareness. Congressional support for PF research was shown in 2007. SEC. 3. Establishes a Pulmonary Fibrosis Advisory Board and Registry under the Public Health Service Act to address the lack of federal efforts in understanding and treating pulmonary fibrosis. The National Pulmonary Fibrosis Advisory Board is established under the Public Health Service Act, composed of members from various organizations including the National Institutes of Health and the Department of Veterans Affairs. The National Pulmonary Fibrosis Advisory Board includes members from organizations such as the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, patient advocates, clinicians, epidemiologists, and geneticists with expertise in pulmonary fibrosis and related diseases. Their duties include developing and maintaining the National PF Registry. The National Pulmonary Fibrosis Advisory Board reviews and makes recommendations to the Secretary on the development and maintenance of the National PF Registry, including the type of information to be collected, data collection methods, data use guidelines, and information on lung diseases essential for the registry. The National Pulmonary Fibrosis Advisory Board will consult with the CDC Director to prepare the National Pulmonary Fibrosis Education and Awareness Plan. A report on the review conducted by the Advisory Board must be submitted within one year. Additionally, a registry will be established. The Secretary will establish a National PF Registry to collect data on pulmonary fibrosis and related lung diseases in consultation with experts and patients. The National PF Registry is established to collect data on pulmonary fibrosis and related lung diseases in the United States, including incidence, prevalence, environmental factors, and demographics of diagnosed individuals. The National PF Registry will collect data on pulmonary fibrosis, including disease history, pathogenesis, and coordination with existing data systems and registries. The National PF Registry will collect data on pulmonary fibrosis from various databases and ensure research access to the data in compliance with privacy laws. Coordination with NIH and Department of Veterans Affairs will be done to share epidemiological information. The National PF Registry will share epidemiological information with the National Institutes of Health and the Department of Veterans Affairs. The National Pulmonary Fibrosis Education and Awareness Plan is outlined in Section 4. The Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in consultation with the National Pulmonary Fibrosis Advisory Board, shall prepare the National Pulmonary Fibrosis Education and Awareness Plan and submit it to Congress within one year of the enactment of the Act. The National Pulmonary Fibrosis Education and Awareness Plan, prepared by the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, aims to increase public education, accelerate patient education, improve physician education, assess costs, and develop strategies in partnership with patients and experts. The National Pulmonary Fibrosis Education and Awareness Plan involves patient advocates and experts in research and care of pulmonary fibrosis. SEC. 424D of the Public Health Service Act encourages the Director of the Institute to expand research activities on pulmonary fibrosis."
