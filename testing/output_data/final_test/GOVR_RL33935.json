    "content": "The annual pay packages for CEOs of the nation's largest firms have been criticized as excessive, with total median CEO pay growing significantly from 1995 to 2005. This increase has outpaced inflation and non-managerial pay growth, leading to scrutiny from public officials, academics, shareholders, and some Members of Congress. Critics argue that current executive compensation levels are unjustified, with prominent figures like William J. McDonough and Warren Buffett expressing concerns. Former SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt, Jr. believes that extravagant CEO pay undermines corporate governance and shareholder interests. Institutional investors and Congress have also expressed concerns about executive overpayment, with recent legislative actions addressing tax provisions related to executive compensation. Under the Senate version of H.R. 2, there was a proposed cap of $1,000,000 annually for deferring taxable income in compensation plans, which was not present in the House version. Chairman Max Baucus argued for the cap, highlighting the disparity between rank-and-file workers and management in terms of deferred compensation limits. Chairman Barney Frank expressed concerns about the effectiveness of boards of directors in overseeing CEO pay. The Shareholder Vote on Executive Compensation Act (H.R. 1257) and its companion bill, S. 1181, aim to require publicly held companies to hold annual non-binding shareholder votes on executive compensation plans. Critics argue that excessive executive pay is linked to boards not being independent enough from managerial influence. The growing pay inequality and worker productivity concerns are exacerbated by executive pay packages that allow for hefty compensation deals, often disconnected from executives' actual contributions to the firms. Between 1994 and 2005, the ratio of CEO pay to production worker pay nearly doubled, contributing to a sense of workers not sharing in economic growth gains. The impact of executive pay packages on worker morale and productivity is difficult to quantify, but concerns exist about potential negative effects. High executive compensation while laying off employees could harm shareholder returns. One study showed a doubling ratio of executive pay to corporate earnings between 1993-1995 and 2001-2003, raising questions about value contribution. The ratio of executive pay to corporate earnings doubled between 1993-1995 and 2001-2003, indicating potential board performance issues in monitoring executives. Critics suggest a link between excessive executive pay and recent corporate scandals, citing misaligned incentives. However, some argue that CEO pay increases are driven by market demand rather than flawed governance. In a speech, President Bush emphasized that CEO compensation should be tied to company success and shareholder value, urging corporate boards to ensure transparency and good governance. Treasury Secretary John Snow also supported market-driven CEO pay, trusting market forces over government intervention. The report examines the issue of executive pay, considering whether policy intervention is needed. It analyzes evidence on overpaid executives and the history of pay regulation. CEO pay began rising rapidly in 1993, peaking in 2001. Despite economic expansion, CEO pay doesn't always increase. Since 1993, CEO pay has fluctuated, with a 13% decline in 2002 followed by a rebound to 2001 levels by 2005. The composition of CEO pay has shifted, with cash salary increasing slowly while performance-based pay, including stock grants, grew significantly. Stock and stock options played a key role in the rapid rise of CEO pay in the 1990s and its subsequent fall in 2002. The pay gap between U.S. executives and CEOs in other countries is also highlighted. The pay given to U.S. executives compared to CEOs in other nations is often cited as evidence of overpayment. A study in 2003 found that U.S. CEO pay was 1.3 times higher than in the UK, attributed to more equity-based pay. Japanese executives earned about a third of their U.S. counterparts' pay in 2004. CEO pay levels in other developed nations have been slowly converging with the U.S. over time. High and rising executive pay could be a cause for policy concern on efficiency or equity grounds. Current pay levels may be economically inefficient due to market failure or result in an inequitable distribution of wealth. The appropriate policy response depends on whether pay levels are economically efficient or not. The trend in executive pay raises concerns about efficiency and equity. Policy responses should focus on government redistribution rather than targeting executive pay directly. Economic theory cannot provide definitive answers to equity concerns, as they involve competing societal values and tradeoffs. Some argue that market imperfections allow executives to manipulate pay levels, causing resource misallocation. The trend in executive pay raises concerns about efficiency and equity. Some argue that market imperfections allow executives to manipulate pay levels, causing resource misallocation. Executive compensation under perfect competition is discussed, with real-world deviations considered. In a competitive market, executive compensation is tied to their marginal product, ensuring they are paid based on their contribution to the firm. Paying below this level will result in the executive seeking other opportunities, while paying above will make the firm unprofitable. Economists and experts support this view, emphasizing the demand for skilled CEOs and the high turnover rate in large corporations. The rate of CEO turnover at large corporations has increased significantly in recent years, with 50 percent of departures due to mergers or performance issues. CEOs negotiate the best contracts they can to secure their position. Most corporate directors believe that public companies have become better managed over the past 20 years, leading to increased profit margins and productivity. High executive pay is seen as a reflection of their strong skills, hard work, and successful business strategies. Critics must prove that high pay is not justified by executive performance. The increase in executive pay compared to worker pay is not necessarily excessive, as it may be driven by a higher demand for executive skills due to increased market competition and complexity. This could be supported by the superior performance of U.S. firms in recent years. Economists have noted a \"superstar effect\" where pay rises for individuals with high market draw, reflecting the need to attract top talent in a competitive environment. Some economists suggest that the increase in executive pay is due to firms operating in a global market, leading to higher value executives can add. One study attributes the rise in CEO pay to market capitalization growth. Executive pay is controlled by competition in labor, capital, and product markets, with overpayment only possible if the firm generates excess profits. In a world of perfect competition, executives must be generating excess profits to skim off, as there are no excess profits in such a market. For executives to be overpaid without harming their firms, there must be a common disadvantage in compensation arrangements. Excessive pay is unsustainable in perfect competition, leading to potential capital raising issues or vulnerability to takeovers. Executives are often considered overpaid due to market forces being impeded, leading to the principal-agent problem where the CEO's incentives may diverge from the owner's interests. This can result in various private interests being pursued, such as minimizing effort or maximizing reputation, ultimately causing executives to be widely overpaid. The principal-agent problem arises when executives prioritize their own interests over the company's profits, leading to overpayment and a divergence from the owner's goals. Shareholders struggle to monitor executives due to high costs, exacerbating the issue in publicly listed corporations. The free-rider problem arises when shareholders choose not to monitor executives, as the benefits of monitoring flow to all shareholders. The board of directors is meant to represent shareholders but faces its own principal-agent problem. The board members may have incentives to pursue private interests, leading to potential overpayment of executives. This could result in executives being paid more than their actual contribution, impacting the firm's performance compared to competitors. The \"managerial power\" critique questions the real-world outcomes compared to the neo-classical ideal. The \"managerial power\" critique by law professors Bebchuk and Fried argues that executive pay in the United States is influenced by the principal-agent problem, leading to excessive pay and a focus on maximizing pay over shareholder value. This critique highlights the differences between executive pay structures and the neo-classical ideal. The typical board structure may not align with the neo-classical model of executive pay determination, as CEOs often hold multiple roles within the company, potentially leading to board capture by executives. Regulations like those from the NYSE aim to mitigate these concerns by requiring outside directors to make up the majority of boards and serve on key committees. The CEO's influence on board member selection can lead to potential conflicts of interest, as directors may feel the need to maintain a good relationship with the CEO to secure renomination. Shareholders have limited direct input in selecting board members, with alternative director proposals being costly and rare. Board members, often executives at other corporations, may prioritize the CEO's interests to ensure their own re-nomination. Boards may be influenced by executives, leading to potential conflicts of interest. Board members, who are often executives at other corporations, may be hesitant to criticize executive compensation requests to maintain good relationships. Less independent boards are linked to higher executive pay, with CEO pay being 20%-40% higher when the CEO is also the chairman of the board. Studies have shown that CEO pay is 20%-40% higher when the CEO is also the chairman of the board. Executive compensation is influenced by the CEO's selection of outside directors. Shareholder influence over the board can lead to lower executive pay. Companies hire compensation consultants, but there are concerns about their independence as they may be influenced by management. Institutional barriers limit shareholder influence over board decisions on executive pay. Executives may be overpaid, but institutional barriers limit shareholder influence over compensation packages. Shareholders can vote on general terms like stock options plans, but cannot modify details or offer alternatives. Only a small percentage of options plans were rejected by shareholders. Shareholders can introduce resolutions on executive pay, but even if they attract a majority of voters, the resolutions may not be binding. \"Outrage costs\" constrain executive compensation levels by fear of negative publicity and shareholder hostility. Executives may receive lower compensation levels due to outrage costs and may resort to stealth compensation methods to avoid public scrutiny. This includes forms of compensation like golden parachutes, golden hellos, life insurance, deferred compensation, personal loans, bonuses unrelated to company performance, and company-provided perks. The increase in executive stock options is attributed to the desire for stealth compensation. BF argues that the rise in executive stock options is driven by the need for hidden compensation. While stock options may not always align with shareholder interests and lose their influence after being exercised, they are favored due to the complexity of accurately pricing them at grant time. Stock options are complex to price accurately at grant time and were not expensed on balance sheets, making their impact on shareholder value less transparent. They can increase executive compensation without as much shareholder backlash, as they are more valuable when stock prices are high. Executive pay is often set above industry averages to justify performance, leading to a \"ratcheting up\" effect on pay. In the 1980s and early 1990s, academics criticized executive compensation, arguing that pay levels were often disconnected from firm performance. Critics compared the situation to \"Lake Wobegon,\" where all executives were above average, leading to inflated pay levels. Jensen and Murphy highlighted that the focus on CEO pay distracts from the real issue. The focus on CEO pay diverts attention from how they are paid. Executive compensation is often not tied to performance, leading to CEOs acting more like bureaucrats than value-maximizing entrepreneurs. Aligning executive incentives with profit maximization through performance-based bonuses or stock options can help solve this issue. The authors argued that aligning executive incentives with firm profitability through performance-based pay could lead to better performance, higher average pay, and the removal of bad executives. They also mentioned that pay would need to be higher if it were riskier, but overall society would benefit from this approach. The literature is divided on the relation of total pay to performance, with some arguing that pay for performance increased due to stock and stock options. CEO wealth rose about sixty cents for every $100 increase in firm value in 1994. Executive pay is more sensitive to performance than previously thought, as even small changes in firm value result in large dollar changes in wealth. The shift to \"performance-based\" pay significantly increased CEO wealth, with estimates showing a $4 million increase in stock holdings for improving company performance. Non-cash executive compensation, such as options, saw a nine-fold increase from 1992 to 2000, driving the rise in executive pay during the 1990s and 2000s. Non-cash executive compensation has not necessarily led to pay being closely tied to performance. The managerial power critique highlights how components like severance packages can reward executives regardless of success or failure. Bonuses, meant for performance-based pay, are often given for reasons unrelated to profit maximization. Stock options are typically designed to reward absolute performance rather than performance-based pay. Stock options are usually granted \"at the money\" and reward absolute performance rather than relative performance. Executives can benefit from a rising stock price even if the company is outperformed by competitors. Once exercised, stock options no longer provide incentives for executives. In instances where firms offered incentive-based pay, it typically supplemented rather than substituted for cash salary. The pay for performance argument aimed to pay executives differently, but in reality, they were paid more, benefiting everyone. Executives also have job security that contradicts the pay for performance idea, with low correlation between firm performance and CEO turnover. CEOs have more contractual job protection than regular employees, with only a small percentage serving \"at will.\" The corporate scandals have increased scrutiny on executive pay practices, especially stock-based compensation. The assumption that stock price reflects firm value is challenged due to its volatility, leading to misalignment of interests between executives and shareholders. The agent's compensation may not align with the principal's interests, leading to actions that boost short-term stock prices at the expense of long-term performance. Executive stock holdings incentivize actions to boost stock prices temporarily. Performance-based pay exacerbates the principal-agent problem, as seen in corporate scandals post-2001 recession involving manipulation of earnings for personal gain. The scandals involving executives manipulating earnings and stock options to increase their pay suggest that the principal-agent problem persists despite the shift to performance-based pay. This trend is evident in the correlation between the growth of performance-based pay and accounting problems. Firms with executives receiving a higher share of option-based compensation are more likely to restate their earnings, indicating a potential for manipulation. The board's failure to prevent this manipulation may be due to factors such as board capture or a shared short-term time horizon with executives. Lack of close monitoring and human tendency to overlook issues when results are positive could also contribute to the problem. The scandals in recent years, while not definitive proof of the managerial power theory, align with it. Executives boost pay through accounting fraud and earnings manipulation, consistent with their desire for stealth pay. Executives at firms with managed earnings tend to exercise options and sell stock more frequently, with a higher share of performance-based pay. The failure of boards to prevent such activities suggests board capture. Allowing executives to choose when to exercise options, especially backdated ones, serves to conceal the true extent of their compensation. Firms may use backdated options to hide true executive compensation levels. Independent directors can reduce the likelihood of favorably dated option grants. Critics of the managerial power theory disagree with findings and offer alternative explanations. Executives hired from outside still receive generous pay packages. BF argues that executives hired from outside receive generous pay packages, despite not having the same influence as insiders. They claim that executive pay is not well linked to performance, but studies show that executives with large stock holdings have strong incentives to maximize profitability. BF's theory on executive pay changes over time relies on the CEO's ability to control the board, but boards have become more independent in recent years. The majority of a company's directors must be independent to be listed on exchanges. SEC rules required more disclosure of options granted to executives in 1992. Outrage costs were higher in the early 1990s due to legislation and regulations on pay. Executive pay is higher in the US than abroad, possibly due to efficient markets. This challenges the claim that excessive pay undermines firm profitability. Alternative explanations exist for phenomena described by the managerial power theory. The managerial power theory offers explanations for executive compensation phenomena, including incentives from accounting rules like the cap on deductible pay. Hall and Murphy argue that the theory struggles to explain the rise in stock option compensation for non-executives. The rise in stock option compensation for non-executives (90% in 2002) is attributed to the perceived cost theory, which suggests that options appeared costless to issue due to not requiring cash outlay. However, options do have a cost as they dilute existing shareholders' ownership. The explanation raises questions about the financial sophistication of directors and the managerial power view. The perceived cost argument suggests that stock options are seen as stealth compensation, but this view could be challenged based on market efficiency. Options may not be expensed, but information about them is disclosed in financial statements. If market actors use all available information, stock prices would already reflect option costs. Alternative explanations exist for executive compensation exceeding marginal product. According to Lazear and Rosen's managerial power theory, executive compensation can exceed marginal product if the firm's pay structure is like a tournament, motivating workers to strive for promotions. The CEO's high pay incentivizes subordinates to work harder, making it profitable for the firm regardless of his marginal product. Anabtawi argues that executive pay is not closely linked to performance due to the tournament model, which motivates subordinates to compete. Executive stock options in the 1990s were based on absolute performance, impacting pay during the stock market boom. Board decisions on stock option compensation are based on expected value, but actual pay depends on post-stock price changes. For instance, if an executive was granted an option with a $40 strike price and the stock price rose to $60, their actual pay gain would exceed the expected $10. The sharp appreciation in stock prices in the 1990s led to unexpected windfalls in executive pay tied to stock price or firm performance metrics. Historical data shows a significant increase in stock value from 1995 to 1999, resulting in actual pay gains exceeding expected values for stock options issued during that period. The stock price rose significantly from 1995 to 1999, leading to unexpected windfalls in executive pay tied to stock options. Executives profited from the market rise, regardless of talent or effort, raising questions about the justification for high executive pay during market declines in the 2000s. Executives received windfall stock options in the 1990s due to rising stock prices. Despite expectations of reduced pay, overall executive pay only fell by 11% from 2001 to 2003 and returned to previous levels by 2004. This contradicts the neo-classical model but aligns with the managerial power theory. The large stock market returns in the 1990s reduced outrage costs for executives with stock options. They maintained pay increases in the 2000s by using past pay levels as benchmarks. Excessive pay is defined from an equity perspective, but economists focus on whether pay exceeds marginal product, which is hard to measure directly. Executives' pay is difficult to measure in absolute terms, as it is based on their performance relative to others. Studies show that executives with above-average compensation may have \"earned it\" if their firm outperformed rivals. However, this does not address the question of whether executives are overpaid on average or if firms could achieve the same results with lower executive pay. Some economists define excessive executive pay as capturing economic rents, where pay exceeds the worker's reservation wage. This broader definition is subjective and problematic to measure, as it assumes executives could be overpaid even if their pay is less than their value to the firm. The reservation wage may not converge with the marginal product in the market for executives due to limited candidates and openings. However, any executive paid less than their marginal product could be hired by another firm willing to pay more, leading to the existence of economic rent. Defining excessive pay as pay above marginal product is less controversial. Arguments about efficiency in executive compensation mostly revolve around incentive effects and the fear of reducing productivity. The wide gap between executive pay and other professions raises skepticism about the need for high compensation to attract suitable candidates. For example, one CEO with a net worth of $16 billion would need to spend $30 million per week just to maintain their wealth. Recent empirical evidence on compensation and welfare suggests that after a certain point, people are not made happier by further increases in absolute income. This is because individuals quickly adapt to their new circumstances, and any temporary rise in happiness caused by greater income dissipates. Policymakers looking to curb executive pay may need to consider the loss of welfare it would cause as a cost of such a proposal. The research suggests that people are made permanently happier by increases in relative income, known as \"keeping up with the Joneses.\" Ratcheting up executive pay has not made anyone better off, as all executives' pay rises simultaneously. Reducing executive pay across the board may not make anyone worse off if a sufficient superiority in relative income is maintained. Executives may derive utility from non-material aspects of their job, unaffected by an absolute decline in income. A corporation's bylaws outline corporate governance rules, including executive pay determination. State corporate law, like Delaware's, influences governance practices. Delaware's Chancery Court is a key forum for corporate disputes. The federal government and regulatory entities, such as the SEC, have policies on CEO pay. Regulations involve disclosure, not setting compensation levels. Legislative and regulatory developments have impacted CEO pay, starting with OBRA in 1993. Companies can deduct executive pay from corporate income for taxation purposes. Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code imposes a $1 million cap on the deductibility of executive compensation, excluding performance-based pay. Performance goals for such pay must be determined by a compensation committee of outside directors, disclosed to shareholders, and approved by a majority vote. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (P.L. 107-204) introduced reforms in corporate governance and executive pay, including the prohibition of personal loans to executives. This legislation aimed to address issues highlighted by accounting scandals at companies like Enron and WorldCom. Section 402 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act prohibits public companies from providing personal loans to directors or executive officers. Section 403 requires insiders to report their stock trades to the SEC within two business days. Shareholder approval is now required for equity-based compensation plans. Firms must disclose material terms of stock option plans before shareholder vote, including grant terms and exercise price. Shareholder approval is required for overall compensation plans, but not for specific executive compensation amounts. SEC approved changes to NYSE listing standards in 2003, mandating a compensation committee of outside directors and use of a consultant for executive compensation evaluation. In 2004, FASB released accounting directive FAS 123R, requiring companies to expense the value of employee stock option grants in their income statements. This may reduce reported earnings and constrain executive pay, even though it was not the primary intent. The compensation committee must have sole authority to retain and approve consultant fees for director and CEO compensation. The SEC has modified disclosure rules for executive pay since the 1930s, including requiring detailed tables in proxy statements. By 2006, the SEC found the rules outdated and not reflective of current compensation practices. They aim to provide investors with clearer information on executive pay. The SEC adopted major changes to executive disclosure rules in 2006, requiring public companies to disclose total annual compensation for top executives, stock option grants, post-employment benefits, and director pay. This includes a Compensation Discussion and Analysis (CD&A) to explain executive pay programs. The SEC adopted changes to executive disclosure rules in 2006, requiring detailed information on option grant practices and directors' compensation. The new disclosure requirements aim to enhance transparency and potentially improve shareholders' ability to influence executive pay and corporate performance. The new executive compensation rule aims to protect shareholders' interests by increasing management's incentives to improve corporate performance. A survey found that most firms planned minimal changes to their executive compensation programs in response to the new SEC rules, with only a small percentage expecting a substantial impact. In the theoretical neo-classical world, executive pay would be determined by marginal product, and any policy creating a wedge between pay and marginal product would reduce economic efficiency. In the debate over executive pay, proponents argue that market forces should regulate excessive pay, not government intervention. The managerial power critique suggests reforms to align executive pay with arm's length contracting. These reforms focus on transparency, board independence, and shareholder control. Shareholders, board members, or government intervention can promote these changes. Proponents argue for reforms to enhance shareholder control and board independence in corporate governance, aiming to lower executive pay or make it more performance-sensitive. Some proposals directly impact executive pay, while others focus on strengthening shareholders' rights. Critics suggest maintaining the status quo and deferring to specialized regulatory bodies like the SEC for corporate governance expertise and occasional policy adjustments. In 1993, OBRA added Section 162(m) to limit a company's tax deduction for top executives' pay to $1 million, exempting performance-based pay like stock options. Critics argue that this limit led to the rapid growth of executive stock options, contributing to corporate scandals. Some argue that tax policy encouraging behavior that circumvents its intent, like the deduction limit failing to curb executive pay growth. Suggestions include eliminating or expanding the limit to cover all pay forms. Research shows mixed results on the impact of the deduction limit on executive pay growth. The growth of stock options in executive pay was influenced by factors like the 1990s bull market and pressure to align executive interests with shareholders. Critics suggest changing tax laws to limit deductions for executive pay exceeding a certain ratio to employee salaries. Some firms have voluntarily limited CEO pay to a certain ratio compared to average employee pay. Using tax laws to enforce this could address pay equity concerns. Critics argue that CEO pay ratios are influenced by stagnant worker pay and could affect CEO performance-based compensation. The proposal to cap executive pay through tax laws could lead to businesses finding ways to avoid the cap, raising questions about its effectiveness in constraining executive pay. Research suggests that tax deductibility of executive compensation has minimal impact on a firm's profitability, casting doubt on the policy's ability to address excessive executive pay. The proposal to cap executive pay through tax laws may not effectively constrain executive pay, as outside compensation consultants hired by firms may face conflicts of interest when offering multiple consultancy services. Possible solutions include requiring firms to disclose all services received from compensation consulting companies or banning these companies from offering other consultancy services to the same firm. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 prohibits auditors from providing certain ancillary services to the firms they audit. Reforms to regulate compensation consulting services may not change behavior due to the inherent incentive to recommend high pay. Shareholders can nominate directors, but the process is difficult and costly. The SEC proposed a rule in 2003 to allow shareholders with over 5% of voting securities to nominate board members under certain conditions. The SEC proposed a rule in 2003 allowing shareholders with over 5% of voting securities to nominate board members in company proxy materials. This reform aimed to enhance corporate board integrity by increasing the number of independent outside directors for better oversight of executive practices. Critics have questioned the independence of outside directors recommended by management. The SEC proposed a rule in 2003 to allow shareholders with over 5% of voting securities to nominate board members in company proxy materials. However, large numbers of outside directors were found to benefit from options manipulation. The SEC did not adopt the proposed 2003 shareholder proxy reform rule due to business opposition. The issue resurfaced in 2006 with a court ruling in American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees Pension Plan v. American International Group, Inc. The SEC's proposal in 2003 to allow shareholders with over 5% of voting securities to nominate board members in company proxy materials was not adopted due to business opposition. In 2006, the issue resurfaced with a court ruling in American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees Pension Plan v. American International Group, Inc. The Second Circuit found the SEC's policy on shareholder proposals relating to elections to be inconsistent and asked for clarification. The SEC chose not to rule on proxy access petitions after the decision, injecting uncertainty into the proxy process for 2007. In July 2007, the SEC proposed two divergent policy proposals regarding shareholder-proposed candidates for board director positions. The SEC adopted a proposal for proxy access in response to uncertainty after the AIG decision. The long proposal, allowing shareholders with over 5% of shares to nominate directors, was not adopted. Business interests supported the short proposal, while shareholder interests criticized it. Chairman Christopher Cox stated that the vote would create legal certainty for the upcoming proxy season in 2008. Advocacy groups and others are disappointed as the SEC denies shareholders the right to offer proxy-access proposals. Senate Banking Chairman Dodd may offer legislation to reverse the decision, while Chairman Frank expresses disappointment and emphasizes that the SEC should have waited until it was at full strength. Shareholders do not vote on individual executive pay packages, sparking interest in giving them a non-binding vote on such matters. Advocacy groups and others are disappointed as the SEC denies shareholders the right to offer proxy-access proposals. In response, Representative Frank's Shareholder Vote on Executive Compensation Act (H.R. 1257) and Obama's companion bill (S. 1181) aim to give shareholders a non-binding vote on individual executive pay packages. Activist investors have submitted proposals at 60 companies for the right to vote on executive pay, believing it could prompt directors to be more conscientious in linking pay to performance. Several countries have already granted shareholders this non-binding vote. Several countries, including the United Kingdom, Australia, and Sweden, have granted shareholders the right to a non-binding vote on executive pay. While some firms, like Aflac, have agreed to provide this vote, many others are opposed. Arguments against the mandatory vote include concerns about potential distortions in pay setting and the complexity of CEO compensation packages. Progressive taxation is seen as a cost-effective way to reduce income inequality, but it may not effectively address the principal-agent problem in executive compensation. To increase tax progressivity, policymakers could consider reducing tax preferences for capital income over labor income, which could impact executive pay heavily tied to stocks and options. Tax preferences for capital income, such as capital gains and dividends, are taxed at lower rates than labor income. Stock options, taxed at regular income rates, receive favorable treatment with deferred tax liability until gains are realized. Economists debate the efficiency of taxing labor and capital at the same rate, but equalizing rates would increase tax code progressivity due to unequal financial asset distribution in the US. A stock option grants the right to buy a company's stock at a fixed price, regardless of the stock's current price. If a stock option is granted, the value can either rise above or fall below the strike price. If the market price falls below the strike price, the option has no value. If the market price rises above the strike price, the option's value is the difference between the two prices. For example, if an option to buy stock at $100 is worth $125 in a year, the holder earns $25 by exercising it. If the stock is worth $75, the option is not exercised. The value of a stock option can never fall below zero, and its value is determined by complex formulas that consider its expected value at issuance. Stock options can be bought and sold on the open market, with employee stock options being a subset that cannot be sold to others. Holder of employee stock options must wait for a vesting period before exercising them. Employee stock options have a vesting period before they can be exercised, typically set at the firm's current price. They are popular with start-up firms due to limited cash flow. When exercised, new stock is created, diluting existing stockholders' ownership. The firm can offset this by buying back stock from the market, requiring a cash outlay. The prevalence of employee stock options is puzzling to economists as employees, firms, and shareholders would have reasons not to prefer them. Employees should prefer cash wages over options due to the risks involved, as people are generally risk averse. Options have tax advantages for executives but can be seen as a loan from employees that must be repaid when exercised. For firms, it may be cheaper to borrow from the open market than through employees. Shareholders find options undesirable as they dilute ownership. The popularity of options is attributed to managerial power theory or the perceived lower cost of options due to no cash outlay. Options were popular due to perceived lower cost, as they did not require cash outlay and were not expensed on the firm's balance sheet until recently."
