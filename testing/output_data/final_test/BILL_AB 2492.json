    "title": "AB 2492",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 62001 of the Government Code is amended to establish a community revitalization and investment authority with the power to carry out a revitalization plan in a designated area. The authority is considered the \"agency\" for receiving tax increment revenues and is limited to the powers outlined in Section 62002. An authority can be created by a city, county, or city and county through a resolution with a specified governing board composition. A city, county, city and county, or special district can create an authority through a joint powers agreement. School entities and successor agencies are not allowed to participate in this authority and cannot receive property tax revenues or other moneys distributed under specific codes. The authority formed by a city or county after the dissolution of a redevelopment agency must wait for the successor agency to adopt findings of fact, including receiving a completion finding from the Department of Finance and ensuring that assets subject to litigation against the state are not used until the litigation is resolved. The governing board of an authority created after the dissolution of a redevelopment agency must comply with orders from the Controller. It consists of three members from the legislative body and two public members living or working within the community revitalization area. The governing body of the authority created after the dissolution of a redevelopment agency must have a majority of members from the legislative bodies of the public agencies that created the authority and at least two public members from the community revitalization area. The majority of the board appoints the public members, and the authority can implement a community revitalization plan in the designated area with specific land conditions. The curr_chunk discusses the criteria for a community revitalization plan, including a household income below 80% of the median income and specific unemployment conditions. This is distinct from the prev_chunk, which focuses on the composition of the governing body of the authority and their ability to implement a revitalization plan in designated areas. The curr_chunk outlines the criteria for crime rates in a proposed plan area, requiring rates to be at least 5 percent higher than the statewide average for violent or property crimes. The rate is calculated based on local crime incidents divided by the total population, multiplied by 100,000. If the local crime rate exceeds the statewide average by more than 5 percent, then the condition is met. If local crime rates exceed the statewide average by more than 5 percent, the condition outlined in the plan area will be met. The curr_chunk discusses deteriorated infrastructure and structures in a community revitalization plan, including streets, sidewalks, water supply, sewer treatment, and parks. It also mentions the option for carrying out the plan in a former military base or disadvantaged community. An authority created under this part must comply with the Ralph M. Brown Act, California Public Records Act, and Political Reform Act of 1974. The legislative body of the local government can allocate funds for the authority's administrative expenses. The authority created under this part can receive money as a grant or loan for expenses and overhead. If given as a loan, property owners and residents in the plan area are third-party beneficiaries. Administrative expenses include planning and information dissemination. The authority can fund infrastructure projects and provide low- and moderate-income housing. The authority created under this part can receive money as a grant or loan for expenses and overhead, including planning and information dissemination. It can fund infrastructure projects, provide low- and moderate-income housing, and issue bonds in conformity with applicable laws. Additionally, it can remedy hazardous substance releases, provide seismic retrofits for existing buildings, acquire and transfer real property, and establish controls and restrictions for land use. The authority can borrow money, receive grants, or accept financial assistance for projects within its area of operation. It can also coordinate investments with a qualified community development entity to improve conditions within its jurisdiction. The authority can receive funds allocated by a city, county, or special district for community revitalization and investment plans. It can make loans or grants for building improvements, construct necessary structures for air rights sites, and provide assistance to businesses within the plan area for industrial or manufacturing uses. The authority must hold three public hearings at least 30 days apart to consider adoption of the plan. The first hearing is for comments only, the second hearing allows for modifications or rejection of the plan, and the third hearing includes a protest proceeding to address any objections from property owners and residents within the plan area. The draft plan must be presented to the public and property owners at a meeting held 30 days before the first public hearing. The meeting aims to introduce the plan, address questions, and receive feedback. Notice of the meeting and public hearings must be provided, describing the proposed area boundaries, plan purpose, and details for submitting comments. Notice of the second public hearing will include a summary of changes made to the plan based on feedback received. The third public hearing will consider any protests, with property owners and residents informed of their right to submit objections. The authority will consider protests at the third public hearing and will terminate proceedings if there is a majority protest. An election will be called if between 25% and 50% of property owners and residents file a protest. The election must be held within 90 days and may be done by mail-in ballot. If a majority of property owners and residents vote against the plan, the authority will not proceed with implementation. A new plan cannot be proposed for at least one year after a rejected election. The authority will consider all comments at the specified time. If less than 25% of property owners and residents file a protest, the plan may be adopted by ordinance. The adopted plan will be subject to referendum. The authority must adopt a plan in accordance with the provisions of this section and provide notice of meetings and public hearings on their website and by mail to landowners and residents. Public hearings must also be published in a local newspaper for four weeks prior to the meeting.
