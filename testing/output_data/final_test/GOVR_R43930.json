    "content": "Early childhood home visiting is a strategy for delivering services to improve health, well-being, and education outcomes for vulnerable families with young children. The Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting (MIECHV) program, implemented in March 2010, is the primary federal program that focuses exclusively on home visiting. Congress considered proposals to establish home visiting programs as part of health care reform in 2010 and in prior years. HHS provides MIECHV funding to states and territories. The MIECHV program provides funding for home visiting services to at-risk communities, prioritizing low-income families, young mothers, and individuals with substance abuse history. In FY2017, the program served 156,297 parents and children through 942,676 home visits. Jurisdictions must adhere to specific requirements, including implementing effective home visiting models. HHS also provides training, technical assistance, and conducts research to evaluate program impacts on participants' outcomes. The report provides an overview of the MIECHV program, including its administration, coordination, and funding. It outlines requirements for states and jurisdictions, discusses home visiting models implemented, and efforts to research and evaluate the program. Appendices include federal legislative history, funding levels by state, relevant timeline dates, and information on home visiting models adopted. Home visiting models involve social, health, and educational services for parents and children from birth to kindergarten entry. Visits are conducted regularly by trained professionals like nurses or social workers, offering parenting education and referrals to community services. Parents play a significant role in shaping their children's early experiences, and home visiting programs aim to support them in this process. Home visiting programs aim to help parents understand child development and provide support in facilitating learning opportunities through activities like playing games and reading. They also offer information on child health, referrals for outside support, and can lead to positive benefits for children, parents, and communities. This focus on early childhood home visitation has increased in recent years due to research on brain development. Since the 1960s, various early childhood home visiting models have been evaluated for their effectiveness in benefiting children and parents. Research shows that home visiting can prevent child abuse, enhance cognitive development, improve parenting attitudes and behaviors, and increase maternal education. While these programs can lead to improvements, the difference in outcomes between families that receive home visits and those who do not is small. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act established the MIECHV program to strengthen and improve home visiting for early childhood development. Researchers have found some models to be effective, although it is not a cure-all. The MIECHV program, established under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, aims to enhance home visiting services for families in at-risk communities. States, territories, and tribes identify at-risk communities through needs assessments. The program requires jurisdictions to use evidence-based home visiting models, allocate at least 75% of funds for effective models, ensure fidelity to these models, and show improvements in outcomes. MIECHV funding is mandatory, with annual levels ranging from $100 million to $400 million. The MIECHV program, funded between $100 million and $400 million, was reauthorized by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 through FY2022. Eligible families receive home visiting services, including pregnant women, parents or caregivers of young children, and noncustodial parents with an ongoing relationship with the child. The MIECHV program, funded between $100 million and $400 million, was reauthorized by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 through FY2022. Eligible families receive home visiting services, including pregnant women, parents or caregivers of young children, and noncustodial parents with an ongoing relationship with the child. Priority is given to serving families residing in communities in need of home visiting services, low-income families, pregnant women under 21, those with a history of child abuse or neglect, substance abuse issues, tobacco use, children with low achievement or developmental delays, and individuals who have served in the past. The MIECHV program, funded between $100 million and $400 million annually, prioritizes serving families in need of home visiting services, including pregnant women, parents of young children, and individuals who have served in the Armed Forces. Funding includes reservations for Indian tribal entities and technical assistance. Funding can be used by jurisdictions for up to two fiscal years after the award. The law does not specify how funds are awarded, but recent reauthorization directs HHS to use accurate data for eligible jurisdictions. The MIECHV program distributes funds through formula and competitive grants based on population or poverty considerations. Funds are allocated annually to states and territories, with factors like children in poverty influencing the distribution. The program aims to address service needs and reward improved outcomes. Funding for FY2018 is used as an example of how funds are awarded. HHS allocates funds based on a \"base funding\" factor and adjusts awards using \"guard rails\" to limit variations. Competitive funding is awarded for innovation grants to strengthen home visiting programs. In the past, development grants focused on workforce capacity, data infrastructure, and expanding services to more families and communities. The MIECHV program receives funding through expansion grants, with specific amounts allocated by authorizing laws. The ACA initially provided funding for five years, with subsequent acts extending funding through FY2015. The MIECHV program's funding levels remained consistent for FY2015, with $400 million allocated for FY2016 and FY2017. BBA 2018 extended funding at $400 million annually through FY2022. Despite sequestration affecting funding in FY2013, FY2014, and FY2017, the program aimed to provide holistic services to families and promote coordination between agencies. Grants were intended to improve family outcomes in health, well-being, and education domains. Jurisdictions implementing MIECHV programs must conduct initial needs assessments coordinated with other federal programs by October 1, 2020. They are also required to improve coordination with community resources. Federal level coordination between HRSA and ACF is necessary for reviewing assessments, awarding funds, evaluating the program, and establishing advisory panels. HRSA administers funding for states and territories, while ACF administers funds for tribes. ACF, in collaboration with HRSA, oversees the random assignment evaluation of the \"MIHOPE\" program. HRSA and ACF must coordinate and collaborate on research with other federal agencies responsible for programs for eligible MIECHV families. These agencies include OPRE, CDC, NIH, OJJDP, and Institute of Education Sciences. The Department of Education's Institute of Education Sciences requires HRSA and ACF to designate data exchange standards for home visiting programs. Funding for states and territories is allocated to lead agencies for the MIECHV program. States must implement home visiting models in at-risk communities identified through needs assessments. States and territories determine lead agencies for the MIECHV program, with most states, the District of Columbia, and five territories having the public health department as the lead agency. Some states also involve the state social service agency in administering home visiting funds. Other states administer the program through departments with a social service focus or through nonprofit organizations authorized by state law. Nonprofit organizations in Florida, North Dakota, and Wyoming have operated home visiting programs under MIECHV, receiving funding that would have gone to the states. To qualify, nonprofits must have experience in early childhood home visiting programs. Jurisdictions receiving MIECHV funds must conduct a needs assessment to target communities with high poverty rates. Under the MIECHV law, states, tribes, and nonprofit organizations must conduct a needs assessment to identify communities with poor infant health, poverty, and other negative outcomes. They must submit the results to HHS and explain how they plan to address the identified needs. Additionally, jurisdictions must establish measurable benchmarks for improving indicators for eligible families and meet requirements for serving families. The statewide needs assessments under the MIECHV law aim to identify communities with poor infant health, poverty, and other negative outcomes. They also assess the quality and capacity of existing early childhood home visitation programs, as well as the state's capacity for providing substance abuse treatment services. The statewide needs assessments under the MIECHV law aim to identify communities with poor infant health, poverty, and other negative outcomes. Jurisdictions must coordinate with other appropriate needs assessments conducted by the state, including assessments for Maternal and Child Health Services Block Grant, Head Start program, and Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act. Coordination with the state advisory council established under the Head Start Act is also required. The guidance for statewide needs assessments under the MIECHV law requires coordination with various state agencies, including the state advisory council, child care agency, education agency, agencies for domestic violence prevention, and child welfare agency. Additionally, coordination with the Individuals with Disabilities Act agency is encouraged. Jurisdictions had to submit the needs assessment by September 20, 2010 to receive funds under the Maternal and Child Health Services Block Grant for FY2011. Jurisdictions had to submit a needs assessment by September 20, 2010 to receive funds under the Maternal and Child Health Services Block Grant for FY2011. States and territories that applied for MIECHV grants had to submit an updated state plan in 2011, including a final designation of at-risk communities and a tailored plan for home visiting services. HHS directed them to define \"community\" based on their unique structure. HHS defined \"at-risk community\" as a community with indicators showing greater risk compared to the state as a whole. States could target all at-risk communities or specific neighborhoods. Tribal grantees must assess tribal community needs and develop a plan to address them. The MIECHV program requires jurisdictions, including tribal grantees, to assess and address the needs of their communities. The assessments must be updated by October 1, 2020, following guidance from HHS. The MIECHV program mandates jurisdictions to demonstrate improvements in six benchmark areas within three years of the law's enactment. Each benchmark area has between one and six constructs used to measure performance. The MIECHV program requires jurisdictions to show progress in six benchmark areas, each with one to six constructs for performance measurement. Previously, HHS used 37 constructs for performance measurement, allowing flexibility for jurisdictions. The revised system now requires grantees to measure performance consistently across all constructs to facilitate national data aggregation. The focus is on grantee performance over time rather than program impacts. The MIECHV program requires jurisdictions to show progress in six benchmark areas, with a focus on grantee performance over time. HHS is assessing program effects separately. States and territories submitted reports on their performance against benchmarks by October 30, 2014, while tribal entities submitted reports by December 31, 2014. Jurisdictions operating programs in Florida, North Dakota, and Wyoming had to submit reports on three-year benchmarks by October 30, 2016. If improvements are not shown in at least half of the constructs in four benchmark areas, a plan must be developed and implemented with HHS approval. HHS provides technical assistance for this. Failure to demonstrate improvements may result in termination of MIECHV funding. Jurisdictions must track improvements in benchmark areas and report to HHS. Failure to show improvements may lead to termination of funding. One grantee was not awarded funds due to performance concerns. Reporting on benchmark areas must be done every three years. Jurisdictions must demonstrate program improvements for eligible families in at least four applicable benchmark areas. Jurisdictions must track improvements in benchmark areas and report to HHS. Failure to show improvements may lead to termination of funding. Improvement plans must be developed if progress is not demonstrated within each subsequent three-year period. Technical assistance will be provided by HHS for implementing the improvement plan. The law specifies requirements for jurisdictions carrying out MIECHV programs, including conducting individualized assessments of families and improving outcomes relevant to each family. Desired outcomes include improvements in parenting skills and developmental indicators. Jurisdictions must adhere to a research-based home visiting model to receive funding. To receive MIECHV funding, jurisdictions must implement a research-based home visiting model linked to benchmark areas for families. Staff must be well-trained, supervision must be high-quality, and organizational capacity strong. Linkages to community resources and monitoring fidelity to the model are also required. Funding should supplement, not supplant, other sources for home visitation programs. Jurisdictions must spend most of their MIECHV funds on evidence-based home visiting models that meet certain standards of effectiveness. At least 75% of total funding must be used within a fiscal year for these models, which must have been in existence for at least three years, be associated with a national organization or institution of higher education, and demonstrate positive outcomes. The MIECHV program requires jurisdictions to allocate funds to evidence-based home visiting models that meet specific effectiveness criteria, as established by HHS. These criteria include having at least one high- or moderate-quality impact study showing favorable outcomes in multiple domains, or multiple studies with positive impacts in the same outcome. The MIECHV program mandates funding for evidence-based home visiting models with proven positive impacts in various outcome domains such as maternal and child health, development, parenting practices, economic self-sufficiency, and reducing maltreatment and delinquency. Jurisdictions can allocate funds for promising new approaches to achieve improved outcomes under these areas. The MIECHV program mandates funding for evidence-based home visiting models with proven positive impacts in various outcome domains such as maternal and child health, development, parenting practices, economic self-sufficiency, and reducing maltreatment and delinquency. Jurisdictions can allocate funds for promising new approaches to achieve improved outcomes under these areas. HHS has further explained that a promising approach is one that meets the standards outlined in the statute but for which there is little to no evidence of effectiveness; one with evidence that does not meet the criteria for an evidence-based model; or a modified version of an evidence-based model that includes significant alterations to core components. The MIECHV program reviews research literature on home visiting models for pregnant women and families with young children. Models are prioritized based on points assigned for impact study design and sample size. HomVEE examines applicable impact studies with RCTs and quasi-experimental designs for further review. HomVEE evaluates impact studies with RCTs and quasi-experimental designs, rating each study as high, moderate, or low quality. They review studies for a model, assess evidence across high or moderate-rated studies in at least one of eight domains, and report on other aspects of evidence. As of June 2017, 45 home visiting models were reviewed, with 18 meeting criteria as evidence-based programs. Family Spirit, a model for American Indian and Alaska Native populations, is one of the 18 models deemed effective in at least two of the eight areas. HHS found 18 home visiting models effective in at least two of eight areas. Most target at-risk pregnant women and parents with young children. Models serve families with children under age one and across multiple age ranges. Implemented by various entities, most require home visitors to meet educational requirements. Home visitors for home visiting models must meet educational requirements and undergo preplacement training. Caseloads range from 10 to 30 cases per worker, with some models adjusting based on family needs. Weekly visits are common initially, with frequency decreasing over time. Some models specify a set number of visits, while others tailor visits to family needs. Additional interventions like motherhood classes are offered in some models. The MIECHV program includes interventions such as motherhood classes and meetings with other participants. Table 4 shows the number of jurisdictions implementing evidence-based models in FY2017. Some states used a portion of their funds for a promising home visiting model. The BBA 2018 law allows jurisdictions to use up to 25% of their grants for a \"pay-for-outcome\" initiative for evidence-based home visiting services. The BBA 2018 law allows jurisdictions to use funding for pay-for-outcomes initiatives for up to 10 years. A \"pay-for-outcome\" initiative involves a commitment to pay for improved outcomes that result in social benefit and cost savings. It includes a feasibility study, rigorous evaluation, annual progress reports, and payment requirements. The BBA 2018 law allows jurisdictions to use funding for pay-for-outcomes initiatives for up to 10 years, involving a commitment to pay for improved outcomes. HHS has provided preliminary guidance on the use of FY2018 formula funds for pay-for-outcome initiatives, requiring a letter of intent for future funding use. Technical assistance is to be provided to grantees for administering MIECHV-funded programs. The MIECHV program funds programs and activities, providing technical assistance to jurisdictions that need to implement improvement plans. Assistance is given by federal staff, home visiting model developers, and HHS-contracted providers. HRSA operates the HV-ImpACT center, offering training on high-quality programs and improving outcomes. ACF provides similar assistance to Tribal MIECHV programs. ACF provides technical assistance to Tribal MIECHV grantees through Programmatic Assistance for Tribal Home Visiting (PATH) and the Design Options for Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting Evaluation (DOHVE) Technical Assistance Team. DOHVE assists jurisdictions with evaluating home visiting programs, analyzing returns on investments, integrating data, and coordinating efforts. Tribal entities also receive assistance through the Tribal Evaluation Institute. The law mandates HHS to conduct research and evaluation activities to enhance knowledge about home visiting programs. HHS requires evaluations for jurisdictions implementing promising models or receiving competitive awards. An independent advisory committee reviews and makes recommendations for a national evaluation of the MIECHV program. The HHS appointed a panel in 2013 to design and plan a national evaluation of the MIECHV program. The evaluation must analyze statewide needs assessments, state actions in response, and the impact of early childhood home visitation programs on child and parent outcomes. It will also assess the effectiveness of home visiting programs on different populations and their potential to improve health care practices, quality, and reduce costs. The Mother and Infant Home Visiting Program Evaluation (MIHOPE) is assessing the effectiveness of four evidence-based home visiting models on 4,229 families in 88 local programs across 12 states. The evaluation includes an analysis of state needs assessments, implementation study of program services, impact analysis on child and family outcomes, and economic analysis of program costs. MIHOPE researchers collected information from families during pregnancy or when the child was under six months old, and again at 15 months and between 2 \u00bd and 3 \u00bd years. Families participated in home visiting programs for an average of eight months, with about half still participating at the child's first birthday. Families facing more challenges participated for shorter periods, while those in EHS or NFP programs stayed longer. In the MIHOPE study, families in EHS or NFP programs stayed longer. Half of the families received referrals for public assistance or health insurance. Home visitors discussed various topics with families, including mental health and child development. Challenges were reported in addressing issues like poor mental health and substance abuse. HHS awarded a contract for a follow-up study known as MIHOPE-LT to track outcomes of families in the program. The MIHOPE evaluation tracks outcomes of families in different stages of child development and includes a cost-benefit analysis. MIHOPE-Strong Start evaluates birth and health outcomes for mothers and infants through nonmedical prenatal interventions like home visiting to improve health outcomes and reduce medical costs. The MIHOPE-Strong Start evaluation aims to determine the impact of home visiting services on health outcomes for disadvantaged pregnant women. Approximately 3,000 families from Healthy Families America and Nurse-Family Partnership sites in 17 states were enrolled in 66 local home visiting programs. Pregnant women with Medicaid or CHIP and their children were randomly assigned to a home visiting group or a non-home visiting control group. The evaluation includes an implementation study and impact analysis on birth outcomes, maternal prenatal health, and infant health. It also provides information on how participation in such programs might affect Medicaid. The MIHOPE evaluation, funded by CMS and implemented in partnership with HRSA, aims to assess the impact of home visiting programs on prenatal and birth outcomes. A report by HHS outlines the efforts of 17 states to support positive outcomes through funding, program administration, system-building, and training. States use various funding sources for home visiting programs. Additional reports for MIHOPE-Strong Start are forthcoming. Between 2011 and 2015, 48 jurisdictions developed grantee-led evaluations for promising approaches and evidence-based models in home visiting programs. These evaluations have helped identify key aspects such as participant recruitment, workforce development, collaboration with community partners, program enhancements, and the effectiveness of promising approaches. HHS supports efforts to learn more about home visiting, including mapping career trajectories. HRSA and ACF support research on home visiting, including mapping career trajectories and investigating how programs can aid families in substance abuse prevention. HRSA collaborates with Johns Hopkins University for research and funds the Education Development Center for improving home visiting interventions. HV-CoIIN 2.0 aims to enhance home visiting interventions by addressing issues like maternal depression screenings, access to treatment, early detection, and linkages to services for at-risk children. The Tribal Early Childhood Research Center (TRC) receives funding from ACF's MIECHV program, Head Start, and Child Care programs to advance research on early childhood development for American Indian and Alaska Native communities. The TRC collaborates with various stakeholders to improve early childhood programs. The MIECHV program has been reauthorized through FY2022 under the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018. Congress has held oversight hearings on the program and considered legislation to extend funding for it. President Obama signed the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014, which extended funding for the MIECHV program through March 31, 2015. The House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Human Resources held hearings on the MIECHV program in 2014 and 2017, discussing its implementation and benefits. The Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014 provided $400 million in funding for the program. The Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 extended funding for the MIECHV program through FY2017. The Increasing Opportunity through Evidence-Based Home Visiting Act sought to reauthorize and make changes to the program, passing the House with amendments in 2017. The House passed H.R. 2824 with amendments, and the Strong Families Act of 2017 (S. 1829) included similar provisions. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (H.R. 1892) incorporated S. 1829 and a provision from H.R. 2824 regarding accurate data for awarding funds. Congressional interest in home visiting programs dates back to 2004, with efforts to establish a program predating the Affordable Care Act. The Education Begins at Home Act (S. 2412; 108th Congress) aimed to establish a home visiting program and set standards for staff, but was not passed. Congressional interest in home visiting programs dates back to 2004, with efforts predating the Affordable Care Act. The Education Begins at Home Act aimed to establish a home visiting program and set standards for staff. In subsequent years, similar bills were introduced, including the Education Begins At Home Act, which focused on delivering parent education and family support services through home visiting programs. Witnesses testified about the positive impact of home visiting on child and family outcomes in education, health, and other domains. The Violence Against Women and Department of Justice Reauthorization Act of 2005 authorized funding for the Department of Justice to address domestic violence's impact on pregnant women, children, and parents. Congress did not appropriate funds for the program, and it was later repealed. A home visiting pilot program focusing on child maltreatment was funded by Congress in response to a proposal by the Bush Administration. The Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act funded a home visiting program to prevent child maltreatment, with $10 million in FY2008 and $13.5 million in FY2009. The initiative, Supporting Evidence-Based Home Visiting (EBHV), awarded grants to 17 grantees in 15 states to implement and scale up home visiting models. The Supporting Evidence-Based Home Visiting (EBHV) initiative funded grants to implement and scale up home visiting models in various states. Grantees were expected to adopt evidence-based home visiting programs such as Healthy Families America, Nurse-Family Partnership, Parents as Teachers, SafeCare, and Triple P. The funding did not cover the full cost of direct home visiting services, and grantees used other funding sources for this purpose. The evaluation of the EBHV initiative found that grantees struggled with maintaining caseloads and delivering services as intended. Grantees also engaged in activities to strengthen infrastructure and partnerships, which helped them achieve the initiative's goals. The Obama Administration proposed a new capped entitlement program in its FY2010 budget for evidence-based home visitation programs for low-income mothers and pregnant women. The program aimed to create long-term positive impacts for children and families, with priority given to funding models that have shown positive effects. Funding would also be allocated for technical assistance and program assessment. The Administration requested $124 million for the initial year of the program. The Obama Administration proposed a $124 million initial year budget for an evidence-based home visitation program for low-income mothers and pregnant women. Congress considered funding the initiative alongside other home visiting proposals. In November 2009, the House passed the Affordable Health Care for America Act (H.R. 3962) which included provisions for home visiting programs. The Senate later passed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (H.R. 3590) which also included the MIECHV program. The MIECHV program, signed into law as P.L. 111-148 on March 23, 2010, received funding from HHS in FY2010. EBHV grantees in states entered subcontracts with MIECHV lead agencies, with additional funds allocated from FY2010 to FY2012. Some grantees used MIECHV funds to sustain or expand services, but those with ineffective models were ineligible for funding. Appendices provide details on funding, timeline, and home visiting models under the MIECHV program."
