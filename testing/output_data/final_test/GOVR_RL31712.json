    "content": "The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria was established in Geneva, Switzerland in January 2002. It provides grants to developing countries to reduce HIV, TB, and malaria infections and related illnesses. The Fund is governed by a board of directors representing donor countries, developing countries, NGOs, the private sector, and affected communities. Dr. Richard Feachem, a British physician, serves as the Executive Director. Dr. Feachem will leave his position as Executive Director of the Global Fund in July 2006. Dr. Carol Jacobs succeeded Tommy Thompson as Chair of the Board of Directors. The Global Fund's efforts aim to reduce the impact of infectious diseases. The Global Fund aims to mitigate the impact of infectious diseases by providing treatment to HIV-positive individuals and those infected with TB. They also offer voluntary counseling and testing services for HIV prevention, support for orphans, and malaria patients receive new drug treatments. The Global Fund finances the purchase and distribution of insecticide-treated bed nets to prevent malaria spread. It is a fiduciary agent directing new resources to countries in need, working closely with UN agencies and other aid organizations. The World Bank serves as its trustee for receiving and disbursing funds. France has roots in the concept of an independent funding mechanism for fighting infectious diseases. France proposed an international fund for AIDS treatment at the 1998 G-8 summit. In 1999, Representative Barbara Lee introduced the AIDS Marshall Plan Fund for Africa Act, and in 2000, Representative James Leach introduced the Global AIDS and Tuberculosis Relief Act, which included provisions for a World Bank AIDS Trust Fund. The World Bank AIDS Trust Fund was proposed in H.R. 3519 to provide grants for AIDS prevention and treatment. In FY2001, $20 million was allocated for a U.S. contribution to an international HIV/AIDS fund. UN Secretary General Kofi Annan called for a \"Global Fund\" with $7-10 billion annually to fight AIDS, gaining significant attention. On May 11, 2001, President George W. Bush pledged $200 million to a global fund proposed by UN Secretary General Kofi Annan. The fund, endorsed by the United Nations and G-8 summit, aimed to be a public-private partnership for HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment. The Global Fund was established in 2001 with the goal of being operational by the end of the year. A Transitional Working Group was formed in October 2001, leading to agreements on governance and accountability. The first board meeting was held in January 2002. By September 2005, the Global Fund approved $382 million for grants in 20 countries. Due to insufficient pledges, grants were approved based on available funds, with the remaining grants approved in 2006. The Global Fund approved Round 5 grants in December 2005, lasting five years with a review after two years. Grants are performance-based and disbursed in increments based on achieved goals. The Comprehensive Funding Policy ensures funds cover the first two years to prevent project disruptions. The Global Fund's funding for projects is dependent on new contributions, with a performance-based system that allows adjustments. Funding is committed for the first two years, with assessments done to determine renewal. Phase 2 funding of $1.1 billion has been approved for 107 projects, with some projects not approved due to poor performance or accounting inconsistencies. The Global Fund has cancelled one grant in Myanmar due to accounting inconsistencies. This decision sparked debate among policy analysts on serving humanitarian needs in politically unstable climates. The Global Fund has directed majority of its funding to sub-Saharan Africa, with smaller percentages allocated to other regions. HIV/AIDS receives the highest funding allocation followed by malaria. The Global Fund allocates funding to African regions for fighting HIV/AIDS, malaria, and TB. Funding is directed through government-run projects, NGOs, and other entities. Grant proposals are accepted from national Country Coordinating Mechanisms (CCMs) representing various stakeholders. CCMs are essential for true partnerships in developing grants. Country Coordinating Mechanisms (CCMs) are crucial for developing grant proposals and coordinating national efforts on AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria. They serve as forums for collaboration and communication among stakeholders. However, a 2003 report by the U.S. Government Accountability Office highlighted challenges such as communication issues between CCMs and the Global Fund headquarters, misperceptions about roles and responsibilities, and a lack of information in some CCMs. The Global Fund is addressing challenges in Country Coordinating Mechanisms (CCMs) through enhanced communication and workshops. However, issues such as government dominance in CCM membership, under-representation of those affected by diseases, and lack of gender balance persist. Some advocate for NGO representation in all CCMs, but recipient governments oppose such requirements. The Global Fund board imposed requirements on Country Coordinating Mechanisms (CCMs) in June 2005 for Phase 2 renewals and new grants from Round 5 onwards. These requirements include demonstrating membership of people affected by diseases, transparent selection processes for NGO sector representatives, and establishing transparent processes for proposal integration, principal recipient nomination, project oversight, and stakeholder involvement. The CCM must have a plan to mitigate conflicts of interest if the principal recipient and the Chair or Vice Chairs are from the same entity. The CCM submits a single Country Coordinated Proposal to the Global Fund, which is reviewed by the 22-member Technical Review Panel. The TRP identifies proposals with a clear impact on AIDS, TB, and malaria for final approval by the Board. Projects in recipient countries are implemented by Principal Recipients who manage finances and must have an independent auditor. The Global Fund requires each Principal Recipient to have an independent auditor and is also monitored by Local Fund Agents (LFAs) in recipient countries. LFAs assess PR capabilities and evaluate financial and program reports. LFAs are selected in collaboration with Country Coordinating Mechanisms (CCMs) and are paid centrally by the Global Fund. There are some misunderstandings and resentments towards LFAs in certain countries, which the Global Fund is working to address. The Global Fund is addressing resentments towards LFAs in some countries by promoting local participation. Concerns exist about maintaining LFA independence in poor countries with limited expert resources. Recruiting skilled personnel for LFAs in such situations may be challenging."
