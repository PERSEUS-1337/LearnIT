    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"World War I American Veterans Centennial Commemorative Coin Act\". Congress finds that the year 2018 marks the 100th anniversary of the armistice ending World War I, with over 2 million American soldiers serving overseas and more than 4 million men and women from the United States in uniform. The events of 1914-1918 had a lasting impact on the world, with over 9 million soldiers worldwide losing their lives. The centennial of US involvement in World War I provides an opportunity for Americans to honor their predecessors' commitment. The last American veteran from World War I, Frank Buckles, died on February 27, 2011, leaving no direct American link to the war. Despite other conflicts being memorialized on US coins, there is currently no coin honoring World War I veterans. The 112th Congress established the World War I Centennial Commission to plan programs to commemorate the centennial of the war. The 112th Congress established the World War I Centennial Commission to commemorate the centennial of the war and honor the over 4,000,000 men and women from the United States who served in World War I. The 112th Congress established the World War I Centennial Commission to honor those who served in the war. The Secretary of the Treasury will mint $1 silver coins to commemorate the centennial, each weighing 26.73 grams, with a diameter of 1.500 inches, and containing 90% silver and 10% copper. The coins will be legal tender and considered numismatic items. The design of the coins minted under this Act shall symbolize the centennial of the U.S. involvement in World War I, with specific inscriptions and designations. The Secretary will select the design based on a competition, with compensation for the winner. The contest winner designing the coins under this Act will receive compensation. The competition will be judged by an expert jury chaired by the Secretary, with members from the Citizens Coinage Advisory Committee and the Commission of Fine Arts. The Secretary will determine compensation for the winning design, which must be at least $5,000 and accompanied by a plaster model. SEC. 5. ISSUANCE OF COINS. Coins minted under this Act shall be issued in uncirculated and proof qualities at a single mint facility from January 1, 2018, to December 31, 2018. SEC. 6. SALE OF COINS. The coins issued under this Act will be sold by the Secretary at a price including the face value, surcharge, and cost of designing. Bulk sales will be offered at a discount, and prepaid orders will be accepted with a reasonable discount. All sales of coins under this Act include a $10 surcharge per coin, with surcharges paid to the World War I Centennial Commission. Unused funds upon Commission termination will be transferred to the Treasury's general fund. The Commission is subject to audit requirements for received amounts. No surcharges are allowed beyond the specified amount. No surcharge can be added to any coin issued under this Act if it would exceed the annual limit of 2 commemorative coin programs. The Secretary can provide guidance on this limitation. SEC. 8. FINANCIAL ASSURANCES. The Secretary will ensure that minting and issuing coins under this Act will not cost the US Government. No funds will be disbursed until the total cost of designing and issuing all authorized coins is recovered by the US Treasury."
