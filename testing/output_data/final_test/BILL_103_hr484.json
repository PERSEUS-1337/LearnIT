    "content": "The \"Capital Budgeting Act of 1993\" is the short title of this legislation. It includes a statement of findings and purpose. The Congress finds that enhancing long-term economic growth requires a focus on stable social, political, and economic environments, national savings, public infrastructure, education, research, and innovation in the workplace. The current Federal Budget presentation obscures distinctions between long-term investments and operational spending, hindering the public interest. The purpose of this Act is to require the unified budget to present an operating budget and an investment budget divided into federally-owned capital and developmental investments for each major component of the budget. This aims to provide better information for fiscal policy and program priorities within the Federal Budget, serving the public interest by showing the long-term effects of expenditures. SEC. 1105A of Title 31, US Code, introduces Capital and Operating Budgets. The budget of the United States, as submitted by the President, consists of a unified budget with operating and investment budgets. These budgets are further divided into federally-owned capital and developmental investments. Actual, estimated, and proposed amounts are presented for various funds, including operating revenues, expenses, surplus/deficit, and interfund transfers. The budget of the United States includes operating and investment budgets. The investment budget covers federally-owned capital and developmental investments, including grants and loans for infrastructure, research, and education. The investment budget includes details on investment funds, revenues, financing requirements, interfund transfers, and projected effects on economic growth. It focuses on activities supporting acquisition, construction, research, education, and job training. The operating budget must include activities, projects, and programs. A clerical amendment is made to the table of sections for chapter 11 of title 31, United States Code. \"1105A. Capital and operating budgets.\""
