    "content": "The Act titled \"Healthcare Enhancement for Local Public Servants Act of 2008\" allows distributions from governmental plans for health and long-term care insurance for other public employees. The Act allows distributions from governmental plans for health and long-term care insurance for retired public employees, amending the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The Act defines an 'eligible retired public employee' to include public school personnel and other public employees. The Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 defines a 'public employee' as an employee of a State, political subdivision, or agency. This definition is important for understanding the eligibility of retired public employees. The amendments made by this section update the definition of \"retired public safety officer\" to \"retired public employee\" and redesignate a subparagraph in the tax code. These changes apply to distributions starting after December 31, 2008. SEC. 3. Distribution allowed as deduction rather than excluded from gross income. The amendment allows for a deduction from gross income for distributions from an eligible retirement plan to cover qualified health premiums. The amendment allows a surviving spouse to be treated as the employee for deduction purposes in a deceased individual's retirement plan. Additionally, a new deduction is allowed for distributions from governmental retirement plans for health and long-term care insurance for public employees. Amendments to section 402(l) of the Code include changes to exclude certain language, clarify deductions for taxable years, specify that distributions must be included in gross income, and make adjustments to paragraphs 7 and 8 regarding excluded amounts. The amendments made by this section modify sections 403 and 457 of the Code by removing specific paragraphs. These changes apply to distributions starting after December 31, 2008. SEC. 4.

The term 'eligible retirement plan' refers to specific types of plans described in subsections (c)(8)(B)(iii), (iv), (v), and (vi), which are maintained by governmental entities or employers affiliated with states or political subdivisions.
