There are approximately 16.4 million naturalized citizens and an estimated 10.8-11.1 million unauthorized aliens. Observers believe this highlights flaws in the immigration system and control policies. The U.S. immigration system is considered broken, with debates on reform options. Efforts to reform immigration law have failed, especially regarding unauthorized aliens. Economic indicators show recovery, but high unemployment persists. Migration trends may slow due to the current economic climate, impacting immigration to the United States. The current economic climate will impact immigration to the United States. The debate revolves around potential changes in immigration policies by Congress, balancing employer needs for foreign workers, family reunification desires, and alien rights and responsibilities. This report synthesizes key components of the reform debate and offers a roadmap to further analysis by the Congressional Research Service. The current debate on immigration in the United States focuses on the desire for families to reunite and improve policies for legal immigration. The Immigration and Nationality Act outlines principles for permanent immigration, including family reunification, skilled immigrants, refugee protection, and diversity in admissions. Legal permanent residents are foreign nationals living permanently in the US, with an annual worldwide admission limit of 675,000 under the INA. The Immigration and Nationality Act sets annual limits for permanent admission, with family-based and employment-based levels. Immediate relatives of U.S. citizens can enter beyond the caps. Diversity visas are allocated to underrepresented countries. Per-country levels are set at 7% of the worldwide level. In FY2009, 1.1 million aliens became LPRs, with 66.1% entering based on family ties. In FY2009, U.S. citizens were the largest group of immigrants, with 535,554 individuals. Advocates are pushing for a shift towards employment-based visas to meet the demand from families and employers. Despite rising unemployment, employers argue for the need to attract skilled workers globally for economic growth. Proponents of family-based migration argue for reducing backlogs in family-based immigration due to high demand. Some suggest scaling back immigration levels by limiting family-based and employment-based LPRs. Legislation to eliminate the diversity visa lottery is also being considered. The curr_chunk discusses the temporary admission of nonimmigrants for various purposes, including tourism, education, and work. It mentions different visa categories like H-1B, H-2A, H-2B, B-1, E, J, and L-1 visas. Concerns about labor shortages impacting economic growth are raised, with legislative responses proposed to address skills mismatches. Encouraging economic growth is crucial. Legislative responses aim to address skills mismatches by increasing temporary foreign workers. There is pressure to boost unskilled guest workers, despite opposition citing lack of evidence for labor shortages and concerns about negative effects on U.S. workers during economic downturns. Suggestions have been made to scale back or halt temporary foreign worker visas during economic challenges. The debate over legal immigration reform includes proposals for unauthorized aliens to become LPRs through earned legalization. Options include meeting specified conditions, paying penalty fees, and using a point system to credit equities in the US. Other avenues for legalization could be guest worker visas tailored to individual circumstances. Advocates for legalization options such as guest worker visas, the DREAM Act, and a legalization program argue that unauthorized residents contribute to the community and provide employers with a legal workforce. Opponents believe that legalization rewards illegal actions and could attract more unauthorized migrants in the future. Immigration reform involves reassessing policies and agencies for more effective enforcement of immigration laws. This includes visa policy, border security, apprehension, detention, and removal of unauthorized migrants. Issues in the 111th Congress may include border security, worksite enforcement, document fraud, criminal aliens, and grounds for inadmissibility. Border security involves controlling official ports of entry and patrolling land and maritime borders to prevent illegal entries. Congress has passed provisions to strengthen immigration-related border security, with Border Patrol apprehensions at a low in 2008. Debate surrounds the construction of a \"virtual fence\" and physical barriers along the border. P.L. 111-230 provides $600 million for emergency border security funding in FY2010. Additional changes may be needed to further control the border. The FY2010 appropriations for border security raised questions about the effectiveness of current worksite enforcement measures. Critics argue that ICE worksite raids target low-wage foreign workers instead of the employers who hire them. Former DHS Secretary Michael Chertoff noted the difficulty in proving knowledge and intent in cases against supervisors and employers. Supervisors and employers rely on proving knowledge and intent, making it challenging to build a criminal case against them. Efforts to strengthen worksite enforcement face concerns of potential discrimination against legal workers with foreign appearances. DHS Secretary Janet Napolitano called for a review, urging ICE agents to scrutinize worksite raids more closely, possibly indicating a policy shift. Employers must participate in an employment eligibility verification system, including the option of using E-Verify to check new hires' work authorization. Employer organizations have raised concerns about the cost and practical issues of the E-Verify system, which verifies new hires' work authorization. Critics fear that expanding E-Verify could create obstacles for U.S. citizens seeking jobs and prevent some law-abiding individuals from working. However, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) states that E-Verify quickly confirms the majority of authorized workers, with only a small percentage needing to correct their records. The legislation authorizing the optional E-Verify program was extended in 2009 and is set to expire in 2012. The issue of electronic employment eligibility verification for new hires remains a concern in the 111th Congress due to immigration-related document fraud, including counterfeiting and sale of identity documents. The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) has civil enforcement provisions for individuals and entities involved in immigration document fraud, while the U.S. Criminal Code criminalizes the production and use of fraudulent immigration documents. ICE has started charging aliens in worksite raids with criminal offenses like identity theft and false use of Social Security numbers. Advocates for unauthorized aliens argue that criminal charges in worksite raids, such as identity theft and false use of Social Security numbers, are excessive. They believe that using fake documents to work does not constitute identity theft and that civil penalties for document fraud should suffice. Supporters of increased enforcement by ICE stress the importance of prosecuting offenders to the fullest extent of the law. The integrity of immigration documents, the fight against immigration fraud, and the distinction between identity theft and immigration fraud are key aspects of the document fraud issue. A criminal alien is simply a foreign national convicted of a criminal offense under immigration law, which can include violations of federal, state, or foreign criminal laws. In immigration law, crimes affecting status fall under categories like moral turpitude or aggravated felonies. Bipartisan agreement exists to prioritize removal of criminal aliens. There is debate over whether the definition of criminal alien should include non-dangerous individuals. Critics argue against deporting individuals like past shoplifters or elderly lawful permanent residents. Legislation may reconsider grounds for excluding foreign nationals based on past criminal history or other factors. All foreign nationals seeking visas undergo admissibility reviews by U.S. Department of State consular officers to ensure they meet criteria for entry. These criteria include health, criminal history, security concerns, public charge, and immigration law compliance. The 110th Congress revised grounds for inadmissibility, focusing on exclusion of aliens due to terrorist organization membership and health-related grounds like HIV/AIDS. The \"H1N1 swine flu\" outbreak highlighted inadmissibility screenings at the border. Questions arose about public charge grounds in the context of Medicaid and CHIP in the 111th Congress. Advocacy for comprehensive immigration reform may seek to ease some provisions. Comprehensive immigration reform may include easing provisions such as inadmissibility for aliens unlawfully present for over 180 days, while also tightening grounds for inadmissibility. Legislation may impact refugee, asylee, and humanitarian concerns, with past reforms including asylum changes in the 1990s and 1996. Foreign nationals denied asylum or with temporary protected status may be covered by legalization or status provisions. Some express concern that potential terrorists could use refugee status or asylum as an avenue for entry into the United States, especially aliens from trouble spots in the Mideast, northern Africa, and south Asia. Others argue that it is becoming more difficult to differentiate the persecuted from the persecutors due to religious, ethnic, and political violence in various countries. Current law may not offer adequate protections for people fleeing human rights violations and gender-based abuses worldwide. The United States agrees not to return individuals to countries where their life or freedom would be threatened, as per the UN Protocol on Refugees. Refugees flee persecution based on race, religion, nationality, social group, or political opinion. Asylum-seekers apply for protection after arriving in the US. Those granted asylum or refugee status can become LPRs after a year. Not all humanitarian migrants qualify for asylum. The US may offer assistance during civil unrest, violence, or natural disasters globally. The United States may offer Temporary Protected Status (TPS) or relief from removal in response to civil unrest, violence, or natural disasters globally. The balance between protecting vulnerable people, homeland security, and preventing abuse of humanitarian policies is crucial. Specific topics include refugee resettlement, asylum policy, unaccompanied alien children, and victims of trafficking and torture. The 111th Congress addressed issues such as war, violence, economic destabilization, and food crises triggering urgent responses. The 2010 Haiti earthquake led to TPS for Haitians in the US, raising policy concerns on Haitian migration and the rights of foreign nationals. The debate over the rights and privileges of foreign nationals in the United States sparks discussions on immigration legislation and its impacts on alien rights and responsibilities. While all persons in the US have certain rights under the Constitution, foreign nationals have fewer constitutional protections than US citizens. Legal aliens in the US have greater constitutional protections than illegal aliens, with federal laws placing restrictions on noncitizens' access to public assistance. Aliens in the United States without authorization are ineligible for federal public benefits, except for specified emergency services. Controversies arise regarding the eligibility of families with mixed immigration and citizenship status. Foreign nationals with temporary employment authorizations and social security numbers, but who are not LPRs, pose a dilemma. The Internal Revenue Code taxes \"resident aliens\" similarly to U.S. citizens. Temporary legal residents or \"quasi-legal\" migrants who have paid into the system raise questions about their status. In the context of immigration legislation, debates arise over the eligibility of non-citizens for federal benefits, leading to unintended consequences for U.S. citizens. The 110th Congress faced challenges in passing comprehensive immigration reform, while the House Judiciary Subcommittee held hearings on various immigration issues. During hearings in April, May, and June of 2007, Law discussed immigration reform. The House did not act on comprehensive legislation in the 110th Congress. President Obama and Secretary Napolitano supported reform with increased enforcement and a pathway to legal residence for unauthorized residents. The Obama Administration's principles for reform include securing borders and improving the immigration system. The Obama Administration prioritizes comprehensive immigration reform, aiming to fix the dysfunctional immigration system, increase legal immigrants, crack down on employers hiring undocumented immigrants, bring undocumented immigrants out of the shadows through a fine and English learning program, and work with Mexico to reduce illegal immigration. President Obama emphasized convening leadership to push for legislation on this issue. President Obama and his Administration are working on comprehensive immigration reform, with plans to draft legislation in the coming months. A meeting with Members of Congress from both parties took place at the White House in June 2009. Senator Schumer has outlined principles for reform, including cracking down on illegal immigration and increasing infrastructure. Congress is expected to take the lead on immigration legislation, with potential for reform to be addressed later in 2009. The curr_chunk discusses measures to curtail illegal immigration, including increased infrastructure, technology, and border personnel. Illegal aliens must register and undergo a process to earn legal status or face deportation. There is a proposal for a biometric-based employer verification system and a focus on family and employment-based immigration. Senator John Cornyn is willing to work on comprehensive immigration reform. Senator Cornyn emphasizes the importance of comprehensive immigration reform, focusing on border security, interior security, tamper-proof identification, employer verification, temporary worker programs, visas for highly-skilled workers, and a solution for undocumented individuals. Despite challenges, achieving consensus on these principles will be difficult. Representative Lamar Smith proposes 'attrition through enforcement' as a strategy to reduce illegal immigrants over time, emphasizing it as an alternative to amnesty or mass deportation. Vice President Biden highlights the need for comprehensive immigration reform to address temporary migrant protection programs. Observers speculate on bipartisan support for specific measures like the DREAM Act as the 111th Congress nears its end. Legislation such as the DREAM Act, H-1B visa revisions, and provisions for trafficking victims may be addressed separately from comprehensive immigration reform."
