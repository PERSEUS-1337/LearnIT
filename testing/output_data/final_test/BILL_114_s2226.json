    "content": "The Act titled \"Improving Treatment for Pregnant and Postpartum Women Act of 2015\" aims to enhance healthcare services for pregnant and postpartum women. Section 508 of the Public Health Service Act is amended to include provisions for the Director of the Center for Substance Abuse Treatment and pilot program grants for State Substance Abuse Agencies. The amendments specify funding for fiscal years 2016 through 2020. The Director will carry out a pilot program providing competitive grants to State substance abuse agencies to enhance flexibility in funds for family-based services for pregnant and postpartum women with substance use disorders, address service gaps, and promote coordinated care. The Director will implement a pilot program offering grants to State substance abuse agencies to improve service delivery models and promote evidence-based approaches. State agencies must submit applications to be eligible for grants, and services proposed must meet specified requirements. The pilot program offering grants to State substance abuse agencies requires services to support family-based treatment for pregnant and postpartum women with substance use disorders, including opioid use disorders. Services provided through the grant are not restricted to women residing in facilities, and grant recipients are not obligated to offer all services described in subsection (d). The Director may waive certain requirements depending on the circumstances of the grantee. The Director will specify minimum services for eligible women under the pilot program, including requirements from subsection (c) and optional services from subsection (d). Stakeholders, including State substance abuse agencies, will provide recommendations for additional services. The pilot program under this subsection, involving State substance abuse agencies, health care providers, and individuals in recovery, will last a maximum of 5 years. An evaluation will be conducted by the Director of the Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality, in collaboration with grant recipients, starting one year after the first grant is awarded. The pilot program involving State substance abuse agencies, health care providers, and individuals in recovery will last a maximum of 5 years. The Director of the Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality will conduct an evaluation in collaboration with grant recipients, submitting a report to Congress on outcomes information, including reductions in alcohol and drug use, engagement in treatment services, and increased access to approved drugs. Increased access to FDA-approved drugs for substance use disorders in combination with counseling is facilitated by State substance abuse agencies. Funding for this initiative is allocated under the Public Health Service Act. Funding under the Public Health Service Act for State substance abuse agencies is limited to 25 percent for subsection (r) activities."
