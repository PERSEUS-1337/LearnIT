    "content": "The Energy Efficient Manufactured Housing Act of 2009 aims to address the poor energy efficiency of manufactured homes constructed before 1976 by replacing them with new Energy Star qualified homes, benefiting low-income households. The Energy Efficient Manufactured Housing Act of 2009 aims to assist low-income households in replacing old manufactured homes with new Energy Star qualified homes through grants provided by the Secretary of Energy. The Secretary of Energy may provide grants to State agencies for rebates towards new Energy Star qualified manufactured homes for owners of pre-1976 manufactured homes. Grants will be allocated based on the proportion of pre-1976 manufactured homes in each state. The Secretary of Energy may provide rebates for owners of pre-1976 manufactured homes to replace them with Energy Star qualified homes used as primary residences. Rebates are contingent on the destruction and replacement of the old home in the same location. To be eligible for a rebate under this section, an owner of a manufactured home built before 1976 must show that their household income does not exceed 200 percent of the Federal poverty level. Rebates from State agencies cannot exceed $7,500 per manufactured home. State agencies can provide rebates up to $7,500 per manufactured home using funds from this section. They can also supplement rebates with State funds or other sources. State agencies running programs to replace older manufactured homes with Energy Star qualified ones can use funding from this section as long as it doesn't exceed the rebate limit. The Secretary of Energy aims to achieve the purpose of the section through Federal programs like the Weatherization Assistance Program and the program under the Energy Policy and Conservation Act. State agencies receiving funding must establish controls and procedures to ensure fiscal accountability. State agencies receiving funding under this section must establish procedures for accounting and conform to Government accounting principles. They can coordinate with other state agencies for low-income housing programs and use up to 10% of funds for administrative expenses. Authorization of appropriations is provided. The Secretary of Energy is authorized $1 billion annually from 2010 to 2012 for this section, with up to 5% for administrative expenses."
