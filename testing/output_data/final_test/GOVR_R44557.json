It also prohibits retaliation against those exercising their rights. This report focuses on HUD and FHEO's activities related to the Fair Housing Act. HUD and FHEO enforce the Fair Housing Act by investigating complaints and overseeing federal funding for fair housing initiatives. Affirmatively furthering fair housing requires more than just avoiding discrimination, but actively working to end discrimination and segregation. HUD released new regulations in July 2015 to govern certain recipients of HUD funding. HUD released new regulations governing how certain recipients of HUD funding must affirmatively further fair housing, including protections against discrimination based on sexual orientation, gender identity, criminal background checks, nuisance ordinances, and language barriers. This report discusses these Fair Housing activities and initiatives administered by FHEO. The Fair Housing Act protects specified groups from discrimination in obtaining and maintaining housing, with exceptions for certain types of dwellings. Discrimination based on race, color, religion, national origin, sex, and other characteristics is prohibited under the act. Religious organizations have exemptions for renting or selling property to members of the same religion. HUD regulations establish standards for addressing discrimination based on sex, including sexual harassment. The Fair Housing Act prohibits discrimination based on specified characteristics such as race, color, religion, national origin, and sex. HUD regulations address sexual harassment and establish standards for quid pro quo and hostile environment harassment. Discrimination based on nonconformity with gender stereotypes may also be covered under the Act. Familial status is defined as parents or others with custody of children under 18, while handicap is defined as a physical or mental impairment that limits major life activities. The Fair Housing Act protects individuals from discrimination based on specified characteristics such as race, color, religion, national origin, sex, age, sexual orientation, or source of income. It prohibits activities like refusing to rent or sell based on protected class and discrimination in housing terms. States and localities may have broader fair housing laws than the federal Act. The Fair Housing Act prohibits discrimination in housing based on protected class, including refusing to rent or sell, discriminatory terms, and services. It also covers actions like blockbusting, refusal of reasonable accommodations for disabilities, and discriminatory advertising. Changes in rules, policies, practices, or services to accommodate disabilities, discriminating in residential real estate transactions, and retaliating against those exercising rights under the Fair Housing Act are investigated by HUD and other fair housing agencies. HUD receives complaints of discrimination and refers them to state or local Fair Housing Assistance Program agencies if applicable. HUD investigates complaints of discrimination, referring them to state or local agencies if necessary. Complaints challenging zoning laws are referred to the Department of Justice. Parties alleged to have discriminated are served notices and can file responses. HUD determines if there is reasonable cause for discrimination and may engage in conciliation. Relief can be sought for the aggrieved party and the public. If HUD finds reasonable cause to believe discrimination occurred, it issues a charge based on facts. The case can be heard in court or before an administrative law judge. Aggrieved parties may seek monetary damages. In FY2016, HUD received 1,366 complaints, with 2.5% resulting in charges, 35.8% settled through conciliation, and 37.7% found no reasonable cause. Complaints not pursued were administratively closed, withdrawn with resolution, or referred to DOJ. HUD oversees fair housing programs. HUD oversees two programs promoting fair housing: FHAP and FHIP. FHAP funds state and local agencies with equivalent laws to enforce fair housing. FHIP funds eligible entities to supplement HUD's efforts in detecting discrimination and enforcing fair housing laws. Funding levels for these programs are provided in the following subsections. At the time of the Fair Housing Act enactment, states and local jurisdictions had their own laws and agencies for enforcement. Funding for state and local agencies to enforce fair housing laws was first provided in the FY1980 Appropriations Act for HUD. The budget proposed financial and technical assistance to help states handle fair housing complaints, with funding based on the number of complaints processed by each agency. Funding for Fair Housing Assistance Program (FHAP) agencies is based on the number of complaints processed. In FY2016, there were 85 state and local agencies funded, a decrease from 113 in FY2009. FHAP agencies handle activities such as capacity building, complaint processing, training, and enforcement efforts. In FY2016, 7,019 complaints were filed with FHAP agencies, with 5.3% resulting in FHAP actions. The Fair Housing Initiatives Program (FHIP) was established in 1987 and made permanent in 1992. It allows HUD to provide funding to eligible entities for enforcing fair housing laws. In FY2016, 7,019 complaints were filed with FHAP agencies, leading to various outcomes such as reasonable cause findings, conciliation settlements, or no reasonable cause findings. The Fair Housing Initiatives Program (FHIP) provides funding for enforcement of fair housing laws by private nonprofit organizations. FHIP allows organizations to conduct testing to detect violations of the law. HUD funds three activities under FHIP, including the Private Enforcement Initiative for investigating and enforcing fair housing laws. The Fair Housing Initiatives Program (FHIP) provides funding for private nonprofit organizations to investigate and enforce fair housing laws, as well as conduct education and outreach programs. Organizations must have experience in fair housing activities to receive funding. Funding is also available for building capacity in fair housing enforcement organizations. In FY2018, FHIP and FHAP received approximately $24 million and $39 million in appropriations, respectively, marking a decrease from peak funding levels in FY2010 and FY2012. FHIP funding saw a significant increase in FY2010, jumping from almost $28 million to $42 million, with a focus on a mortgage fraud prevention initiative. Funding for FHAP increased by nearly $4 million in a year, while funding for FHIP has remained between $39 million and $42 million since FY2009. The number of fair housing complaints filed with both HUD and FHAP agencies has decreased from 10,552 in FY2008 to 8,385 in FY2016. The number of FHAP agencies also decreased from 108 to 85 during the same time period. Complaints filed with HUD and FHAP agencies decreased from 10,552 in FY2008 to 8,385 in FY2016. Charges against housing providers are rare, with only 3% of complaints to HUD resulting in charges in FY2016. In FY2016, complaints to HUD and FHAP agencies decreased. Complaint dispositions included administrative closures or withdrawals after resolution. Complaint percentages based on race and disability shifted over the years, with disability complaints increasing to 59% and race declining to 26% by FY2016. HUD considers multiple bases for discrimination in calculating complaint percentages. In FY2016, complaints to HUD and FHAP agencies decreased. Complaint dispositions included administrative closures or withdrawals after resolution. Complaint percentages based on race and disability shifted over the years, with disability complaints increasing to 59% and race declining to 26% by FY2016. HUD considers multiple bases for discrimination in calculating complaint percentages. Complaints based on other protected categories like familial status, national origin, sex, religion, and color have remained stable. Retaliation complaints have increased from approximately 5% in FY2005 to 9% in FY2016. The high percentage of complaints based on disability may be due to additional protections for people with disabilities under the Fair Housing Act, which imposes affirmative duties on housing providers to make reasonable accommodations for individuals with disabilities. In FY2016, the Fair Housing Act gives residents with disabilities the right to request \"reasonable accommodations\" in housing rules and services to ensure equal opportunity. Examples include widening doorways, installing ramps, or allowing assistance animals. Refusing reasonable accommodations is considered discrimination. Accommodations must not impose undue burden or alter housing provider operations fundamentally. In FY2016, HUD addressed discrimination issues, including failure to provide reasonable accommodations, representing 40% of complaints. HUD issued regulations to protect against discrimination not explicitly covered by the Fair Housing Act, such as based on sexual orientation and gender identity. Guidance was also released to prevent policies with discriminatory effects, like criminal background checks and local nuisance ordinances. HUD regulations ensure equal access to housing regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity. Discrimination based on nonconformity with gender stereotypes may be covered by the Fair Housing Act. HUD released guidance in 2016 to prevent discriminatory policies like criminal background checks and local nuisance ordinances. The HUD regulations ensure equal access to housing regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity. Property owners, program administrators, and lenders are prohibited from inquiring about sexual orientation or gender identity in HUD housing programs. Concerns were raised about transgender individuals' access to single-sex shelters according to their gender identity. HUD regulations ensure equal access to housing regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity. In February 2015, HUD issued a notice clarifying that placement in single-sex shelters should align with an individual's gender identity. This was followed by a proposed rule in November 2015 and a final rule in September 2016, requiring placement in facilities to be based on gender identity. The final rule by HUD in September 2016 requires placement in facilities to align with a person's gender identity. Providers can now ask questions to ensure compliance with the rule, but intrusive questions or requests for anatomical information are prohibited. The rule also updated the definition of gender identity and defined \"perceived\" gender identity. HUD released guidance in 2016 on policies that may violate the Fair Housing Act, including criminal background checks and nuisance ordinances. The guidance released by HUD in 2016 addresses potential discrimination in housing based on criminal background checks, nuisance ordinances, and treatment of individuals with limited English proficiency. It discusses situations where discrimination could occur and the balancing test used to determine discriminatory effects. Unlike regulations on sexual orientation and gender identity, this guidance applies to all housing providers under the Fair Housing Act. While individuals with criminal records are not protected, the guidance notes disproportionate representation of African American and Hispanic individuals in this context. The HUD guidance released in 2016 addresses discrimination in housing based on criminal background checks, noting disproportionate representation of African American and Hispanic individuals. Screening for criminal records could have a discriminatory effect based on race or national origin, which may be prohibited under the Fair Housing Act. HUD's guidance states that policies should be tailored to serve a legitimate interest and consider individual circumstances such as type of crime and time passed since the offense. In September 2016, HUD released guidance on the application of the Fair Housing Act to nuisance ordinances that could lead to victims of crime, especially domestic violence, losing their housing. Nuisance ordinances at the local level require property owners to address issues like disruptive behavior or criminal activity on their property, which could result in eviction for tenants, including victims of domestic violence. The HUD guidance warns that enforcing nuisance ordinances for excessive calls to law enforcement, especially against victims of domestic violence, could be discriminatory and violate the Fair Housing Act. The government would need to prove the necessity of the ordinance and show there is no less-discriminatory alternative. HUD also released guidance on discrimination based on limited English proficiency in 2016. The Fair Housing Act does not prohibit language-based discrimination, but it could have a discriminatory effect based on race or national origin. Language-related restrictions, such as requiring tenants to speak English, may be challenged using a balancing test. If shown to be discriminatory, the burden shifts to the housing provider to prove necessity and lack of discriminatory alternatives. HUD and other federal agencies administering housing programs must comply with the Act. HUD and other federal agencies must administer their programs in a way that affirmatively furthers fair housing, which means more than just refraining from discrimination. Courts have interpreted this to require actions to promote integrated housing patterns and prevent segregation. The court's broader goal is to have HUD use its grant programs to assist in ending discrimination and segregation, increasing the supply of genuinely open housing. The AFFH requirement applies to recipients of HUD funding, including communities, states, insular areas, and Public Housing Authorities. HUD requires recipients of its funding, including communities, states, insular areas, and Public Housing Authorities, to affirmatively further fair housing. Grantees must undergo an Assessment of Fair Housing instead of the previous Analysis of Impediments process. The AFFH final rule, published two years after a proposed rule, has sparked controversy. Some support it for increasing housing opportunity, while others argue it infringes on local authority and constitutes social engineering. Concerns include the cost of preparing AFHs, prioritizing investment in impoverished areas, inability to change fair housing conditions, and uncertainty about HUD enforcement. Amendments were proposed in Congress for FY2016 and FY2017 appropriations. In May 2018, HUD indefinitely delayed implementation of the AFFH rule and directed communities to resume the AI process, the previous method of affirmatively furthering fair housing. Prior to the final AFFH rule, recipient communities were required to conduct an analysis of impediments to affirmatively further fair housing. The grantee must conduct an analysis to identify impediments to fair housing choice, take actions to address them, and maintain records. HUD's Fair Housing Planning Guide in 1996 defined affirmatively furthering fair housing and provided guidance on addressing impediments for CDBG, HOME, HOPWA, and ESG recipients. Program participants were required to identify and suggest steps to address impediments to fair housing within their communities. The guide defined impediments to fair housing choice as actions or decisions based on protected characteristics that restrict housing options. Communities were to identify and address these impediments using local data, with recipients keeping records of their analysis and actions. HUD encouraged communication of findings but did not require a public process or disclosure of results. HUD did not require a public process or disclosure of results for AIs, which were to be submitted every three to five years. Weaknesses in the AI process were found by both HUD and the Government Accountability Office, with outdated AIs and uneven quality noted. GAO recommended that HUD issue a new regulation governing AFFH. The HUD guidance suggested by GAO recommends issuing a new regulation for affirmatively furthering fair housing (AFFH). The new regulation would include standards and a format for grantees to follow, require time frames for implementing changes, and mandate submission of plans to HUD. The AFFH rule establishes detailed regulations for state and local governments, insular areas, and PHAs receiving certain grants. It defines affirmatively furthering fair housing more specifically and introduces an Assessment of Fair Housing (AFH) process in place of the AI. HUD will provide data and tools to assist program participants in preparing their AFHs. The AFFH rule requires program participants to submit AFHs for approval by HUD, with different enforcement and submission timelines based on grant amounts. Local governments with CDBG grants over $500,000 must submit AFHs as early as 2016, while smaller PHAs and governments with grants under $500,000 start after January 1, 2019. Submissions may be delayed based on data availability. The AFFH rule requires program participants to submit AFHs for approval by HUD, with different enforcement and submission timelines based on grant amounts. Submissions may be delayed based on data availability, with only local governments currently required to submit AFHs. The rule defines \"affirmatively furthering fair housing\" as taking actions to overcome segregation and promote inclusive communities. The duty to affirmatively further fair housing involves addressing disparities in housing needs and access to opportunity, promoting integrated living patterns, transforming areas of poverty into areas of opportunity, and ensuring compliance with civil rights and fair housing laws. Program participants must complete an AFH to demonstrate compliance with the AFFH requirement, which includes summarizing fair housing actions, assessing compliance with laws, and conducting fair housing outreach and enforcement. Identifying fair housing issues involves segregation, racially concentrated areas of poverty, disparities in access to opportunity, and disproportionate housing needs for protected classes. The curr_chunk discusses identifying factors contributing to fair housing issues, prioritizing them, setting goals to overcome these factors, and including strategies in Consolidated and PHA Plans. The rule requires program participants to analyze fair housing issues, involve the community in the process, use HUD data, and collaborate with other participants. Joint participants can work together on an Assessment of Fair Housing (AFH). The rule allows joint participants to collaborate on a single AFH, but at least two participants must be part of the consolidated plan. HUD will not approve an AFH that does not comply with fair housing requirements or is incomplete. If an AFH is not approved, HUD will notify the participants, explain the reasons for rejection, and offer guidance on compliance. Failure to have an accepted AFH will result in disapproval of the consolidated or PHA plan. Participants must certify their commitment to fair housing in their plans, and HUD can challenge the certification if fair housing goals are not met. HUD will review each AFH to ensure it meets fair housing requirements, but the rule does not specify how HUD will evaluate goals and progress. The process encourages local accountability by making AFH available to the public. HUD issued final assessment tools for entitlement communities and PHAs, with tools for states and insular areas in the comment period. Program participants must use these assessment tools to complete their AFH. The assessment tools provided by HUD must be used by program participants to complete the AFH, guiding them on accessing HUD data and prompting for information on fair housing issues. The tools include lists of contributing factors to fair housing issues. Legislation has been introduced in Congress regarding the proposed AFFH rule. Legislation introduced in Congress aims to prevent HUD from implementing the AFFH rule, with versions of the Local Zoning Decisions Protection Act in the 114th and 115th Congresses proposing similar prohibitions and requirements for HUD to consult with officials on furthering Fair Housing Act policies. The House amended the FY2016 appropriations act to prohibit funds for the AFFH rule, but it was not included in the final law. In the FY2017 bill, an amendment to block funds for the AFFH rule was tabled, but another amendment preventing HUD from directing zoning law changes was adopted and included in the FY2017 and FY2018 appropriations acts. HUD extended the deadline for local governments receiving over $500,000 in CDBG funding to submit their AFHs until after October 31, 2020. This was due to the need for additional time and technical assistance for program participants to adjust to the new AFFH process. As a result, many local governments would not be required to submit AFHs until 2024 based on their consolidated plan submission schedules. HUD extended the deadline for local governments receiving over $500,000 in CDBG funding to submit their AFHs until after October 31, 2020. A group of organizations filed a complaint alleging HUD violated the Administrative Procedures Act by delaying the AFFH rule implementation. The case is pending in court, and HUD issued notices suspending the AFFH rule indefinitely, reverting to the AI process. HUD delayed the implementation of the AFFH rule for local governments until after October 31, 2020, withdrew the final assessment tool, and directed program participants to comply with the previous requirements, the Analysis of Impediments (AI). The assessment tool was withdrawn due to \"significant deficiencies\" making it burdensome for participants to use, and HUD lacks personnel for technical assistance. AFH submission dates were delayed to allow nine months between the tool's publication and the due date. HUD will produce a more effective and less burdensome tool for jurisdictions to complete an AFH. Program participants are currently not required to submit AFHs, instead, they are directed to submit AIs. Plaintiffs in a court case amended their complaint in response to HUD's notices. HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity oversees fair housing programs, the Section 3 requirement, and compliance with limited English proficiency requirements. Section 3 mandates recipients of HUD funds to hire and train low-income individuals for projects. Section 3 of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968 mandates recipients of HUD funds to hire and train low-income individuals for projects, particularly those residing in assisted housing. The law applies to Public and Indian Housing Authorities and grant recipients of HUD housing and community development funds exceeding certain thresholds. Housing Authorities and their contractors prioritize employment opportunities for low-income individuals in HUD-funded projects, with a focus on residents in the housing, HUD-assisted housing, YouthBuild participants, and those in the local area. Businesses contracted by housing authorities are also encouraged to provide economic opportunities for low-income individuals. The HUD Secretary ensures that fund recipients of projects prioritize training and employment opportunities for low-income residents in the metropolitan area, with a focus on those in the project's service area or neighborhood. Recipients are encouraged to contract with businesses that provide economic opportunities for low-income individuals. Compliance with these requirements is demonstrated through numerical goals in regulations. HUD released proposed Section 3 regulations in 2015 to clarify providing employment and training opportunities. Covered entities must meet numerical goals or provide justifications for not meeting them. FHEO oversees access to HUD programs for persons with limited English proficiency. Title VI prohibits discrimination in federally assisted programs based on race, color, or national origin. In 2000, President Clinton signed an executive order requiring federal agencies to provide guidance for LEP individuals accessing federally funded programs. HUD issued final guidance in 2007 for recipients of HUD funding to ensure meaningful access for LEP clients. This guidance applies to all recipients of funding, including state and local governments, PHAs, and housing providers. The guidance issued by HUD in 2007 requires recipients of funding to ensure meaningful access for LEP clients by considering factors such as the number of LEP clients served, frequency of encounters, program importance, and available resources. Recipients can provide translation services as needed, hire translators or bilingual staff, and decide which documents to translate. Enforcement of LEP requirements includes compliance reviews and investigations. Enforcement of LEP requirements is done through compliance reviews and investigating complaints. Congress allocated funding for HUD to translate materials under the FY2008 Consolidated Appropriations Act. Funding has been used for translating documents, providing translation services at events, phone translations, and acquiring technology. The \"HUD Speaks\" campaign launched in 2015 aims to inform LEP individuals about HUD services through posters, desk guides, and language cards. Funding for FHAP and FHIP has been consistent since FY1996."
