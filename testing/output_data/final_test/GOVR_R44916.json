    "content": "The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has designated 8 of its 11 operating divisions as components of the U.S. Public Health Service (PHS), which include agencies like CDC, FDA, and NIH. These PHS agencies provide essential public health services with varying missions, with NIH and AHRQ primarily focused on research. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has designated 8 of its 11 operating divisions as components of the U.S. Public Health Service (PHS), including agencies like CDC, FDA, and NIH. AHRQ conducts research on the quality and effectiveness of health care services, while IHS, HRSA, and SAMHSA provide health care services and support systems for various populations. The CDC, ATSDR, and FDA are key agencies under the Department of Health and Human Services, focusing on public health, hazardous substances, and regulatory oversight of health products. These agencies work to promote quality of life, prevent diseases, and ensure the safety of foods, drugs, and medical devices. The PHS agencies, including NIH, FDA, HRSA, IHS, ATSDR, and SAMHSA, derive their statutory authority from various acts such as the PHSA, FFDCA, SSA, and CERCLA. They receive funding through the annual appropriations process from different departments. Funding for ATSDR, IHS, and FDA is provided through specific appropriations acts. The HHS Secretary has limited authority to transfer funds within the department, with restrictions on the amount that can be transferred. This authority was used in FY2013 and FY2014 to provide additional funding to CMS for implementing the ACA. In FY2013 and FY2014, NIH transferred funds to CMS for ACA implementation and to CDC and SAMHSA to offset funding losses from the ACA's Prevention and Public Health Fund. The HHS Secretary has authority to use a portion of funds for program evaluation under the Public Health Service Evaluation Set-Aside. The Health Service Evaluation Set-Aside (set-aside) allows for an assessment of HHS program appropriations, capped at 2.5% in recent years. The HHS Budget Office calculates and transfers these funds to recipient agencies for evaluation and other purposes. Table 1 shows the total assessments and transfers for FY2013 by HHS agency and office. In FY2013, NIH and HRSA were net donors of set-aside funds, while AHRQ, CDC, and SAMHSA were net recipients. The distribution of set-aside funds changed in FY2015. In FY2013, NIH and HRSA were net donors of set-aside funds, while AHRQ, CDC, and SAMHSA were net recipients. The distribution of set-aside funds changed in FY2015. Table 1 shows set-aside assessments and transfers for FY2016, reflecting significant changes in funding allocations. NIH has transitioned from being a major net donor to a net recipient of set-aside funds, while AHRQ and CDC are now net donors. AHRQ, in particular, has shifted from relying on set-aside funds to receiving a discretionary appropriation since FY2015. The 21st Century Cures Act established new accounts with annual transfers to support PHS agency programs. These funds are controlled through the appropriations process and are not counted against spending limits. The NIH Innovation Account will receive transfers totaling $4.796 billion over a 10-year period. The 21st Century Cures Act authorizes annual transfers totaling $4.796 billion over 10 years to the NIH Innovation Account for initiatives like Precision Medicine, BRAIN, cancer research, and adult stem cells. Additionally, $500 million is allocated annually over 9 years to the FDA Innovation Account for regulatory support. $500 million is also transferred each for FY2017 and FY2018 to the Account for the State Response to the Opioid Abuse Crisis for state grants. The funds allocated for state grants to address the opioid abuse crisis are not included in the agency budget tables but are summarized in Appendix A. PHS agencies receive one-time supplemental appropriations to address specific circumstances, in addition to annual discretionary appropriations, mandatory funding, user fees, and third-party collections. The ACA provided billions of dollars in mandatory spending to support specified grant programs. The ACA provided billions of dollars in mandatory spending to support specified grant programs and activities within HHS, including the Community Health Center Fund (CHCF) and the Prevention and Public Health Fund (PPHF). The CHCF received $11 billion in annual appropriations over FY2011-FY2015, with additional funding from the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015. The PPHF was also established to support PHS agency programs and activities. The ACA established funds like the Prevention and Public Health Fund (PPHF) to support public health programs. CDC has received the majority of PPHF funds, while other agencies have received smaller amounts. The Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Trust Fund (PCORTF) supports research with a mix of appropriations and transfers from Medicare trust funds. The PCORTF funding is allocated to AHRQ, along with other mandatory funds for HRSA, CDC, and IHS from various sources. Mandatory funding, including ACA funds, plays a significant role in PHS agency budgeting, not subject to annual appropriations process or discretionary spending caps. Several PHS agencies assess user fees on third parties to help fund their programs and activities. User fees collected by CDC, HRSA, and SAMHSA represent a small portion of each agency's budget. In comparison, industry user fees collected by FDA finance a broad range of regulatory activities and account for a growing share of the agency's budget. FDA's user fee programs, established since 1992, provide additional resources for hiring personnel, expediting product reviews, and supporting postmarket surveillance of approved products. FDA's user fee programs support the regulation of various products by the FDA, including prescription drugs, medical devices, and tobacco. User fees collected by the FDA have increased steadily since the enactment of the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) in 1992, accounting for 41% of the agency's funding in FY2017. Additionally, the Indian Health Service (IHS) supplements its funding with third-party collections from Medicare, Medicaid, and private insurers for services provided to American Indians and Alaska Natives. The Indian Health Service (IHS) supplements its funding with third-party collections from private health insurers. Congress has taken steps to reduce federal spending, impacting discretionary funding for PHS agencies. AHRQ has seen a reduction in discretionary funding, offset by mandatory funding. CDC, HRSA, NIH, and SAMHSA have experienced fluctuations in discretionary funding, with CDC and HRSA receiving increasing mandatory funding. Since FY2010, CDC and HRSA have received increasing mandatory funding, raising their overall funding levels. FDA and IHS have also seen their appropriations rise since FY2010, with additional funding from user fees at FDA and third-party collections at IHS. In 2011, cuts in discretionary spending were agreed upon to avert a government shutdown, followed by the enactment of the Budget Control Act of 2011, which established enforceable spending limits for FY2012 through FY2021. The Budget Control Act of 2011 established spending limits for defense and nondefense categories from FY2012 to FY2021, with annual reductions equally divided between the two categories starting in FY2013. The reductions are achieved through sequestration and lowering discretionary spending caps, with the Office of Management and Budget responsible for calculating and applying the reductions. The Budget Control Act of 2011 mandates annual spending reductions through sequestration until FY2021. Certain exemptions exist, such as Medicaid funding for the Vaccines for Children program and CDC funding for specific programs. Special rules limit cuts for community health centers and migrant health centers, as well as mandatory diabetes funding for IHS. The OMB calculation for mandatory spending sequestration orders is announced annually along with the President's budget. Some PHS programs avoided sequestration in certain fiscal years due to delayed enactment of budgetary resources. An example is the Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting program, which received funding extensions through FY2017. The BCA mandated reductions in discretionary spending through sequestration for FY2013, but for FY2014 through FY2021, the cuts are to be achieved by lowering spending caps. This allows for more flexibility in how the reductions are implemented through annual appropriations decisions. The BCA mandated reductions in discretionary spending through sequestration for FY2013. OMB determined FDA user fees for FY2013 were sequestrable, while IHS's third-party collections were exempt. The BCA set original NDD spending caps for FY2014-FY2018, later amended by the BBA13 and BBA15 to adjust the caps. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 (BBA15) amended the Budget Control Act (BCA) by setting new NDD spending caps for FY2016 and FY2017, allowing for additional funding in FY2016 but minimal increase in FY2017. The revised caps for FY2018 will be lower, with OMB projecting a decrease in NDD spending by $37.251 billion. The FY2018 budget is nearly $3 billion below the FY2017 cap level. The report includes sections for each PHS agency, detailing their statutory authority, activities, funding trends, and requested amounts. Funding tables show FY2016, FY2017, and FY2018 budget amounts, with FY2017 figures possibly differing due to transfers or adjustments. The funding tables display post-sequestration amounts for accounts subject to sequestration, following a similar format to congressional budget documents. Each table shows funding for agency budget accounts, selected programs, and activities, with non-add entries indicating funding contributions from sources other than the agency. User fees, set-aside funds, ACA funds, and other nondiscretionary amounts are subtracted from the program level to determine the agency's discretionary budget authority. The funding tables show contributions from sources other than discretionary appropriations for CDC accounts. A dash indicates \"not applicable,\" while zero means no discretionary funds were appropriated. The tables only display evaluation set-aside funds received, not the total funding assessed on agency accounts. The funding tables for PHS agencies may not accurately reflect available budget resources due to not subtracting assessment amounts. This is significant for CDC, HRSA, and NIH. AHRQ supports research to improve healthcare quality, efficiency, and access. They disseminate research findings and collect data on healthcare expenditures through MEPS. The Agency for Health Care Research and Quality (AHRQ) conducts research on healthcare expenditures and utilization through MEPS and HCUP. It was established in 1989 and reauthorized in 1992 and 1999. Despite expired funding authorization, AHRQ continues to receive annual funding. Despite the expired authorization of appropriations, AHRQ continues to receive annual funding. The AHRQ budget is organized into three program areas: Healthcare Costs, Quality, and Outcomes (HCQO) Research, MEPS, and program support. HCQO research focuses on four priority areas. AHRQ did not receive its own annual discretionary appropriation from FY2003 to FY2014, relying on PHS evaluation set-aside funds instead. In recent years, AHRQ has received mandatory funds from PPHF and PCORTF. From FY2015 to FY2017, AHRQ received its own discretionary appropriation without set-aside funds. President Trump's FY2018 budget proposes to consolidate AHRQ under NIH. President Trump's FY2018 budget proposes to consolidate AHRQ under NIH by creating the National Institute for Research on Safety and Quality (NIRSQ) with a budget of $272 million. This would result in a total funding of $379 million for AHRQ-related activities, a decrease of $38 million from FY2017. The budget request eliminates funding for Health Information Technology (HIT) research, keeps funding level for Patient Safety research and Prevention/Care Management, and increases funding for MEPS. Funding details for Health Services Research, Data, and Dissemination, and Program Support are not specified in the request. Since FY2010, AHRQ's budget has increased from $403 million to $417 million, with transfers from PCORTF growing from $8 million in FY2011 to an estimated $93 million in FY2017. Discretionary funding shifted from set-aside transfers to the agency's own appropriation starting in FY2015. ACA mandatory funds have been a prominent source of funding since FY2010. AHRQ's program level increased steadily from FY2011 to FY2015, but decreased in FY2016 and FY2017. The total program level decreased for the first time since FY2011 in FY2016, with a further decline in FY2017. In Table 4, funding in the 2018 request column would go to NIH/NIRSQ for AHRQ functions. CDC's mission is to protect America from health threats. CDC is organized into centers and offices focusing on public health challenges and capabilities. ATSDR, under CDC, is headed by the CDC Director. Many CDC activities are based on broad statutory authorities in the PHSA. Four CDC operating divisions are explicitly authorized. The CDC is authorized by the PHSA and has four operating divisions: NIOSH, NCBDDD, NCHS, and ATSDR. NCBDDD, NCHS, and ATSDR have expired authorizations but still receive annual appropriations. CDC provided $6.6 billion in grants for public health programs in FY2016. The CDC receives $6.6 billion in grants for public health programs and research globally. Funding levels for CDC programs from FY2016 to FY2018 are detailed in Table 5, including mandatory appropriations for programs like the Vaccines for Children program and the World Trade Center Health Program. CDC also receives funds from user fees, supplemental appropriations, and transfers. It is important to analyze mandatory and discretionary funds separately when looking at funding trends for CDC/ATSDR. The CDC/ATSDR total operating budget for FY2017 is $12.1 billion, with funding from discretionary and mandatory sources. The program level has increased since FY2010, primarily due to growth in mandatory spending. The President's FY2018 request proposes a cut in CDC budget authority to $5.1 billion. The budget proposes to cut CDC budget authority by almost $1.2 billion to $5.1 billion, including a $326 million reduction in chronic disease prevention programs. The proposal includes consolidating various chronic disease programs into a new $500 million \"America's Health Block Grant\" for states to customize spending. FDA regulates the safety of human foods, drugs, medical devices, and radiation-emitting products. The FDA has the authority to regulate tobacco products and various other products to protect public health. It consists of seven centers responsible for different program areas, with the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act being its main source of authority. The FDA's budget is determined by Congress through annual appropriations and industry user fees. The agency's funding streams are overseen by the Senate and House appropriations subcommittees on Agriculture, Rural Development, FDA, and Related Agencies. The FDA's budget is determined by Congress through annual appropriations and industry user fees. Appropriated funds are largely for the Salaries and Expenses account, with user fees contributing only to this account. The Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) was the first FDA user fee authorized in 1992, with additional laws enacted for medical devices, animal drugs, tobacco products, and more. User fees are sorted by dollar amount they contribute to the agency's budget. The 21st Century Cures Act modified FDA pathways for drug and device development, creating an FDA Innovation Account funded with $500 million over nine years. The FDA's Innovation Account is funded with $500 million over nine years. FDA revenue from user fees has increased, accounting for 41% of the agency's total funding in FY2017. The Trump Administration's FY2018 request includes a 65% increase in user fees. This proposed increase in user fee revenue is accompanied by a decrease in the agency's direct appropriation, resulting in a total program level of $5.112 billion. The FDA received $367 million more in funding for FY2018, totaling $5.112 billion. Additionally, $20 million was received from the FDA Innovation Account. HRSA awards funding to various organizations to improve healthcare access for the uninsured and vulnerable populations. HRSA administers the centers program, providing grants to nonprofit entities for primary care services to underserved populations. The agency is organized into five bureaus and 10 offices, focusing on specific populations or health care issues. HRSA funding increased from $8.1 billion in FY2010 to $10.7 billion in FY2017. HRSA funding increased from $8.1 billion in FY2010 to $10.7 billion in FY2017, despite a 17% decline in discretionary appropriations. The growth in funding was driven by increasing amounts from the CHCF, which replaced discretionary health center funding and became the sole source of funding for the NHSC program. The President's FY2018 budget would reduce the agency's discretionary appropriation but continue funding for the CHCF and other mandatory HRSA programs, including the Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting Program and the Teaching Health Center Program. IHS provides healthcare for approximately 2.2 million eligible American Indians/Alaska Natives through programs and facilities on or near reservations. The Indian Health Service (IHS) provides healthcare for 2.2 million eligible American Indians/Alaska Natives through programs operated by Indian Tribes or Tribal Organizations. IHS is authorized by the Snyder Act of 1921, Indian Sanitation Facilities Act of 1959, and Indian Health Care Improvement Act (IHCIA) for various health programs and services. IHCIA allows IHS to receive reimbursements from Medicare, Medicaid, CHIP, VA, and third-party insurers. The Indian Health Service (IHS) receives funding through the Interior/Environment appropriations act, not subject to the PHS set-aside. Between FY2010 and FY2017, IHS funding increased from $5.1 billion to $6.3 billion, driven by increased discretionary appropriations and collections from third-party payers. The funding increase primarily supported clinical services, with discretionary appropriations boosting purchased/referred care for patients referred to outside providers when IHS cannot provide a service. Funding for contract support costs has increased since FY2014, with Indian Tribes and Tribal Organizations receiving additional funds for operating facilities or programs under ISDEAA contracts. The U.S. Supreme Court mandates full funding for these costs, even if Congress does not appropriate enough funds. Starting in FY2016, the allocated amount for contract support costs is deemed sufficient by IHS. These costs were previously included in the Indian Health Service account but are now delineated separately in budget documents, with a separate discretionary indefinite appropriation in FY2018. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is the primary agency for biomedical and behavioral research, with 27 research institutes and centers. The Office of the Director (OD) sets policy and coordinates activities, while each institute focuses on specific areas of research. Over 80% of NIH's budget funds extramural research through grants and contracts. NIH's budget primarily funds extramural research through grants, contracts, and awards, supporting research at numerous institutions. About 10% of the budget goes to intramural research programs, mainly conducted by NIH scientists. The agency's authority is derived from the Public Health Service Act, granting the HHS Secretary broad authority for research activities. The NIH's budget primarily funds extramural research through grants, contracts, and awards, supporting research at numerous institutions. About 10% of the budget goes to intramural research programs, mainly conducted by NIH scientists. The agency's authority is derived from the Public Health Service Act, granting the HHS Secretary broad authority for research activities. All of the ICs are covered by specific provisions in the PHSA, but they vary considerably in the amount of detail included in the statutory language. Congress mandated a significant reorganization of IC responsibilities in the FY2012 Consolidated Appropriations Act by creating a new National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) and eliminating the National Center for Research Resources (NCRR). Almost all NIH funding is from annual discretionary appropriations.

Congress mandated a significant reorganization of IC responsibilities in the FY2012 Consolidated Appropriations Act by creating a new National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) and eliminating the National Center for Research Resources (NCRR). NIH funding grew from $11.0 billion in FY1994 to $32.311 billion in FY2016, with temporary increases in subsequent years. The Obama Administration requested an FY2017 NIH program level total of $33.136 billion, an increase of $825 million (2.6%) over FY2016. In FY2017, NIH received a total budget of $33.136 billion, an increase of $825 million (2.6%) from the previous year. Temporary funding was provided through three continuing resolutions until May 5, 2017. One of the resolutions allocated $352 million to an NIH Innovation account for specific projects outlined in the 21st Century Cures Act. The FY2017 NIH budget received a $2 billion increase, totaling $34.311 billion. This includes funding for projects like the Precision Medicine Initiative, the BRAIN Initiative, cancer research, and regenerative medicine using adult stem cells. The NIH Operating Plan for FY2017 provides details on agency spending. President Trump's FY2018 budget proposes a $7.391 billion decrease (-21.5%) in the NIH program level total to $26.92 billion. The budget request includes the elimination of the Fogarty International Center, the consolidation of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality with NIH to form the National Institute for Research on Safety and Quality (NIRSQ), and $272 million in budget authority for NIRSQ. NIRSQ is set to receive $107 million in funding from the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Trust Fund for disseminating study results. SAMHSA leads in increasing access to behavioral health services through grants and programs authorized under PHSA Title V. SAMHSA administers various grant programs under Programs of Regional and National Significance (PRNS) authority. The agency's budget is divided into categories corresponding to different centers, including CSAT, CSAP, and CMHS. The Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment block grant, under CSAT, requires at least 20% of funds to be used for prevention efforts. In the 114th Congress, legislative acts made changes to SAMHSA's programs and activities, including reauthorizing existing programs, authorizing new ones, and repealing unfunded authorities. The Helping Families in Mental Health Crisis Reform Act and the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act included authorizations for SAMHSA-administered grant programs. SAMHSA's program-level funding increased by 13% from FY2016 to FY2017, with the largest increase going to CSAT for grants to support state responses to opioid abuse. Funding for CMHS and CSAP also saw smaller increases. However, funding for health surveillance and program support decreased by 28%. The FY2018 request would decrease program-level funding by 9%, with a 23% decrease for CMHS. Funding for CSAT would remain relatively stable. Funding for CMHS would decrease by 23%, including a 26% decrease in the mental health block grant and a 31% decrease in mental health PRNS. Funding for CSAP would decrease by 33%. Funding would decrease by 11% for health surveillance and program support. Several one-time appropriations for HHS, and PHS agencies in particular, are discussed below, including funds for Ebola and Zika response. In May 2017, Congress provided $10 million to FDA for emerging health threats, including Ebola and Zika viruses. Funds were reprogrammed from Ebola response to Zika response during the outbreaks. Lead Poisoning Prevention was also addressed in December 2016. In December 2016, Congress allocated $55 million to HHS for lead poisoning prevention in response to water exposures. The Community Health Center Fund (CHCF) was established by the Affordable Care Act to provide funding for health centers and the National Health Service Corps, with $11 billion allocated over five years. Additional funding was provided by the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 for FY2016 and FY2017. The CHCF received $3.6 billion for health center operations and $310 million for the NHSC in FY2016 and FY2017. The President's FY2018 budget proposes extending CHCF funding for two more years, partially supplanting discretionary funding for health centers and entirely replacing discretionary funding for the NHSC. CHCF funds support various types of health centers, including community health centers, migrant health centers, and facilities serving the homeless and public housing residents. The Prevention and Public Health Fund (PPHF) was established under the Affordable Care Act to be administered by the HHS Secretary with a permanent annual appropriation. The fund's annual appropriation was set to increase from $500 million in FY2010 to $2 billion in FY2015 and beyond, but Congress has rescinded portions of the funds for other activities. The Prevention and Public Health Fund (PPHF) was established under the Affordable Care Act with a permanent annual appropriation. The Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 and the 21st Century Cures Act reduced PPHF appropriations for certain fiscal years. The HHS Secretary is directed to transfer PPHF funds for prevention, wellness, and public health activities. The Administration's annual budget outlines the distribution and use of PPHF funds for each fiscal year. The Prevention and Public Health Fund (PPHF) was established under the Affordable Care Act with a permanent annual appropriation. The distribution of PPHF funds to HHS agencies for FY2010 through FY2017, and proposed in the FY2018 budget, is presented in Table C-1. The Secretary transferred almost half of available PPHF funds to CMS for ACA implementation in FY2013, reducing funds initially allocated to CDC and other PHS agencies. The loss of Prevention and Public Health Fund (PPHF) funds in FY2013 significantly impacted CDC's budget. The distribution of PPHF funds for FY2010 through FY2017 mainly supported preexisting programs and activities. Some programs, such as CDC immunization grants and tobacco prevention activities, relied heavily on PPHF funding in FY2016. The Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Trust Fund (PCORTF) was established under the Affordable Care Act to support comparative clinical effectiveness research. It received annual funding from FY2010 to FY2019 from various sources, including annual appropriations, fees on health insurance plans, and transfers from Medicare trust funds. The ACA allocated specific amounts to the PCORTF each year, with additional funding from new fees on health insurance policies and self-insured plans. The Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Trust Fund (PCORTF) receives funding from various sources, including fees on health insurance plans and transfers from Medicare trust funds. The fee amount is based on the number of covered lives and increases annually. ACA mandates 80% of PCORTF funds to be available to PCORI, with the remaining 20% transferred to the HHS Secretary for PHSA Section 937. A portion of the funds transferred to HHS is distributed to AHRQ. The President proposes to merge AHRQ under NIH to create the National Institute for Research on Safety and Quality (NIRSQ), reallocating funds from AHRQ to NIRSQ for FY2018. Table D-1 displays the allocation of PCORTF funds through FY2018."
