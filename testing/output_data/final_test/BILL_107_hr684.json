FINDINGS.\" Congress finds that 10% of individuals infected with HIV/AIDS worldwide are children, with mother-to-child transmission being the largest source of infection. In 1999, 570,000 children under 14 were infected, mostly born to HIV-positive women in sub-Saharan Africa. Approximately 1,800 infants are infected with HIV daily, doubling infant mortality in heavily impacted countries. The risk of a baby acquiring HIV from an infected mother ranges between 25-35 percent in developing countries. SEC. 2. STATEMENTS OF POLICY. Congress emphasizes the importance of primary prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV through education and prophylaxis. Counseling and voluntary testing are crucial for infected women to make informed decisions about their health and unborn child. Privacy in these services is essential to protect women from discrimination and violence. Based on a study in Uganda in 1999, nevirapine reduced mother-to-child transmission of HIV/AIDS by 50% when given to the mother during labor and delivery and to the infant within 72 hours of birth. The cost of the combined dose is approximately $4, making it a practical solution. Replacement feeding is important for lowering transmission rates but should not undermine breastfeeding promotion. Breastfeeding is considered the best nutrition for infants, effectively reducing infant mortality in developing countries. The affordability and cost-effectiveness of this strategy depend on local health infrastructure and cooperation with policy decisionmakers and health professionals. Pilot programs in Sub-Saharan Africa and India aim to prevent mother-to-child HIV/AIDS transmission. The Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will establish pilot programs in sub-Saharan Africa and India through the LIFE Initiative to prevent mother-to-child HIV/AIDS transmission. The programs will focus on prenatal counseling, testing, and the use of nevarapine and replacement feeding as best practices. Activities will address the issue of providers not recommending HIV testing to pregnant women and provide voluntary testing and counseling services. The provision of treatment services for pregnant women with HIV/AIDS includes counseling on mother-to-child transmission, recommendations for prophylactic treatment, assistance with treatment adherence, replacement feeding formula, and non-discriminatory treatment services. In addition to amounts available for this section, $5,000,000 is authorized to be appropriated annually for fiscal years 2002 through 2004. Appropriated amounts remain available until expended."
