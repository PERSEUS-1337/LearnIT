    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"CJ's Home Protection Act of 2008\". Congressional findings are also included in the Act. The Congress finds that nearly 20,000,000 Americans live in manufactured homes, providing accessible and affordable housing for low- and moderate-income families. NOAA Weather Radio (NWR) broadcasts weather information and warnings 24/7. Operators of manufactured housing communities should ensure safe shelter or evacuation plans for residents. Manufactured housing communities should have safe shelter plans for severe weather, including tornados and high winds. Operators should remind residents to replace weather radio batteries twice a year. Weather radio manufacturers should include battery replacement instructions in packaging. SEC. 3. FEDERAL MANUFACTURED HOME INSTALLATION STANDARDS. The National Manufactured Housing Construction and Safety Standards Act of 1974 is amended to include a new subsection requiring manufacturers to provide installation instructions for weather radios in manufactured homes. Federal standards will mandate the installation of a weather radio inside each manufactured home. Manufactured home installers must ensure that weather radios are installed in manufactured homes, excluding those affixed to a permanent foundation. The radios must meet specific requirements for broadcasting emergency weather information. Manufacturers of manufactured homes are immune from civil liability for the installation, function, and operation of weather radios mandated by Federal standards. Manufactured home installers and retailers are immune from civil liability for any aspect of the installation, function, operation, performance, or utilization of weather radios mandated by Federal standards. Manufactured home operators are immune from liability for providing reminders, assistance, or instructions related to the function of weather radios in manufactured homes, as mandated by Federal standards. The installation standards do not apply to modular homes as defined by the state law where they are located. The consensus committee must develop and submit proposed Federal manufactured home installation standards to the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development within 90 days of the enactment of the Act. The Secretary must issue a final order for the standard within 90 days of receiving the proposed standard. The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development will conduct a study on the requirement for weather radios in new manufactured homes and site-built homes based on geographic location. The study will consider severe weather conditions and data from the National Weather Service. The Secretary must complete the study within 18 months and submit a report to the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs. The study on weather radios in new homes will be conducted by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development and a report will be submitted to the Senate and House committees."
