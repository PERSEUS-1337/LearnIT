    "content": "Increasing dependence on foreign crude oil, climate change concerns, and the desire to support domestic rural economies have led to a growing interest in renewable biofuels as an alternative to petroleum in the U.S. transportation sector. To promote biofuels production and use, U.S. policymakers have implemented various policies such as tax credits, research grants, and loan guarantees. The Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) mandates a minimum usage of biofuels in transportation fuel, ensuring a market for biofuels regardless of cost. The Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) requires an increasing amount of biofuels in transportation fuel, with a target of 36 billion gallons of renewable fuel by 2022. There are sub-mandates for advanced biofuels with lower greenhouse gas emissions, including cellulosic biofuels and biomass-based diesel substitutes. The majority of the advanced biofuel quota is expected to be met by biodiesel from soybean oil, but other feedstocks like algae could play a larger role in the future. The $1.00-per-gallon tax incentive for biodiesel production expired in 2009 but was extended for 2010-2011. High soybean oil prices and the absence of the incentive led to a drop in biodiesel production in 2010. Fuel suppliers comply with the Renewable Fuel Standard by submitting Renewable Identification Numbers (RINs) to the EPA. BBD RINs have become scarce, leading to a significant price increase. The financial market for RINs has seen a significant increase in value, potentially incentivizing the production of BBD fuels. The use of RINs may help meet the 2010 BBD shortfall, but could also drive up prices for 2011 RINs. The report discusses the current market for BBD fuels and their corresponding RINs, highlighting the role of the RIN market as an economic incentive for biodiesel production. Lessons from the BBD quota and RIN market could provide insights for future RIN markets for advanced biofuels. The RFS mandates the use of biomass-based diesel (BBD) substitutes, which include biodiesel, renewable diesel, synthetic diesel, algae-based diesel, and cellulosic diesel. The RFS does not differentiate between BBD fuels as long as they meet greenhouse gas emissions requirements. In the U.S., BBD production is mainly dominated by various advanced biofuels. In the United States, biodiesel production, mainly from virgin soybean oil, has significantly increased in recent years due to tax credits and RFS mandates. Data on biodiesel production are limited, but the growth trend is evident. Biodiesel production in the United States has seen a significant increase, with production and consumption levels remaining high even after a peak in 2008. Production plants are mainly located in the Midwest and Texas, with six states accounting for 60% of production capacity in 2009. The U.S. Department of Energy estimated a 2 billion gallon annual production capacity in 2009, but actual production tends to be lower due to plants producing other products as well. In 2009, biodiesel capacity utilization was low at around 33%, even below potential capacity. Tax credits and the RFS mandate have driven expansion of domestic production and consumption of BBD. The RFS mandate for BBD fuels increases to 1.0 billion gallons by 2012, leading to production levels nearly 50% higher than the 2008 peak. Total production capacity, capacity utilization at biodiesel plants, and/or imports would need to expand dramatically. Capacity utilization at biodiesel plants and imports would need to expand dramatically in the next few years to meet the RFS mandate for BBD fuels. Biodiesel prices have generally followed the trend of conventional diesel prices but have remained consistently higher despite the tax credit. The price spread between biodiesel and conventional diesel ranged from $0.26 to $1.11 per gallon. Biodiesel has slightly lower energy content per gallon than diesel fuel, resulting in a higher per-mile cost difference. Despite the higher costs, users may benefit from lower pollutant emissions and the use of domestically produced fuel. The high price of biodiesel is mainly due to the expensive soybean oil feedstock, which closely tracks petroleum prices. It takes one gallon of soybean oil to produce a gallon of biodiesel, and their prices have a strong correlation with diesel prices. Production, transportation, and distribution costs further increase the price of soy biodiesel compared to conventional diesel, despite the biodiesel tax credit. Soybean oil prices, along with other agricultural commodities, have risen significantly in recent years. The high price of biodiesel, mainly due to expensive soybean oil feedstock closely tracking petroleum prices, has led to a significant rise in agricultural commodity prices. Research is ongoing to develop biodiesel fuels from cellulose and algae to reduce dependency on traditional feedstocks like soy. However, these alternative fuels are currently more costly to produce. The Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) mandates fuel suppliers to meet volumes through Renewable Identification Numbers (RINs), which are like barcodes for biofuels. RINs can be used to meet obligations, saved for the next year, or traded. Fuel suppliers must submit enough RINs to cover the mandate each year. Under the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), fuel suppliers must meet volume requirements using Renewable Identification Numbers (RINs). RINs have a one-year \"shelf life\" and can be used to meet obligations, saved for the next year, or traded. Fuel suppliers face four distinct RIN requirements for different fuel types: cellulosic biofuel, biomass-based diesel fuel, advanced biofuel, and overall renewable fuel. Some fuels can be used to meet multiple obligations simultaneously. The Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) requires fuel suppliers to meet volume requirements using Renewable Identification Numbers (RINs) for different fuel types. RIN markets will likely develop separately for various classes of fuels, with cellulosic biofuel and biomass-based diesel RINs expected to be more expensive due to their specialized nature. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 expanded the RFS, including the establishment of the biomass-based diesel mandate, but EPA did not finalize rules for the expanded RFS until February 2010. The EPA combined the 2009 and 2010 mandates for a total of 1.15 billion gallons. An additional 345 million gallons of biodiesel will be needed in 2010 to meet the requirement. Demand for 2010 biodiesel RINs is expected to exceed supply. The EISA mandates 800 million gallons of biomass-based diesel for 2011. The demand for biodiesel RINs is expected to exceed supply in 2010, with a significant increase in prices from $0.10 to $0.90 per gallon. RIN prices are expected to continue rising in 2011 unless there is a waiver from the EPA. The biodiesel industry's production potential can more than satisfy the volume specified for 2011. In July 2010, over 1.8 billion gallons of production capacity were registered under the RFS2 program, with an estimated 2.6 billion gallons per year across 170 facilities in the U.S. Idled facilities can be brought back into production quickly, and imports from foreign countries can increase available volume. To avoid a shortfall in 2011 RIN supply, new capacity needs to come online, existing plants need to increase utilization, or imports need to rise. The 2011 biodiesel mandate exceeds U.S. production capacity, potentially doubling soybean oil demand. Increasing biodiesel production could significantly impact soybean oil prices. The tax credit has driven biodiesel growth, but RFS mandates could provide a larger incentive. The expiration of the tax incentives in 2009 led to a drop in biodiesel production despite a growing RFS mandate. The extension of the tax credit in 2010 was seen as a boost for the domestic biofuel industry, making biodiesel competitive with conventional diesel. Some stakeholders question the need for tax incentives with a binding mandate in place. The tax credit extension in 2010 boosted biodiesel production, making it competitive with conventional diesel. However, there are concerns that the incentives may create a perverse incentive if the mandate is binding and credible. Producers may be gambling on EPA waivers or hedging their bets based on production uncertainties. EPA has waived mandates in the past due to low production, leading to rising BBD RIN prices. The biodiesel tax credit extension in 2010 boosted production, but concerns arise if the mandate is binding. EPA waivers due to low production have led to rising BBD RIN prices, potentially reducing the need for the tax credit. EPA's firm stance on the 2011 RFS2 BBD mandate is crucial for the market to function effectively. EPA has waived most of the 2010 and 2011 cellulosic biofuel mandates due to production shortfalls. In 2012, the scheduled mandate for cellulosic biofuel is 500 million gallons, with uncertainty about production capacity meeting the level. If production catches up, cellulosic RIN prices could provide a financial incentive. However, EPA waivers and credibility issues may keep production and prices low. Policy options include maintaining existing incentives or eliminating them. The tax incentives for biofuels, including biodiesel and renewable diesel, were extended through 2011 with the possibility of further extension. Congress is debating whether to maintain, modify, or eliminate these incentives, with proponents arguing they support domestic non-fossil fuel production and critics pointing out redundancy and unintended consequences. Some stakeholders are concerned about the redundancy and unintended incentives of the tax incentives for biofuels. There are proposals to modify or phase out these incentives, possibly basing their value on performance measures like petroleum displacement or environmental impact. The goal is to make biofuels more competitive with petroleum. Tax incentives for biofuels aim to increase competitiveness with petroleum by potentially tying them to oil prices. Concerns exist about supply meeting RFS mandates, leading stakeholders to consider additional incentives or lowering mandates to facilitate compliance. This could either boost production or hinder new investments."
