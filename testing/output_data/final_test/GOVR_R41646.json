    "content": "Several events in the past decade, such as the airline and anthrax attacks in 2001, Hurricane Katrina in 2005, the H1N1 influenza pandemic in 2009, the earthquake in Haiti in 2010, and the Gulf of Mexico oil spill, have highlighted the nation's ability to track and respond to health threats. These incidents challenged existing response mechanisms and emphasized the importance of preparedness and response functions in public health and medical emergency management. During incidents, jurisdictions must meet certain conditions to implement response activities or access funds. States and localities hold most authority for health care and emergency management oversight. The federal government does not typically dictate conduct but can attach conditions to federal grant funds. In 2006, the 109th Congress established or reauthorized programs in the Departments of Health and Human Services and Homeland Security in response to identified problems during prior incidents. Appropriations authority for many of these programs has expired or will expire. The 112th Congress may consider reauthorization of programs with expired appropriations authority. Given budget constraints, Congress may seek to improve incident response efficiency, integrate the private sector, leverage routine capabilities, and enhance program accountability. This report summarizes key issues in preparedness for domestic public health incidents. Two laws, PAHPA and PKEMRA, were passed in 2006 to address public health and medical preparedness. PAHPA established programs for emergency preparedness and response, including BARDA for medical countermeasures. PKEMRA reorganized DHS and FEMA, and created the position of DHS Chief Medical Officer. Appropriations for activities under PAHPA are set to expire, prompting potential reauthorization by the 112th Congress. The 112th Congress may consider reauthorization of activities with expired or expiring appropriations authority, including state grants for public health, the Strategic National Stockpile, the National Disaster Medical System, and the Emergency System for Advance Registration of Volunteer Health Professionals. Permanent authorities that may be examined include the HHS Secretary's authority to declare a public health emergency, ensure food and medical product safety, and the President's authority to declare emergencies or disasters. The 112th Congress may consider reauthorization of activities with expired or expiring appropriations authority, including state grants for public health, the Strategic National Stockpile, the National Disaster Medical System, and the Emergency System for Advance Registration of Volunteer Health Professionals. DHS has not operated under an authorization bill since it was established in 2003. Representative Peter King intends to introduce a homeland security authorization bill in the 112th Congress. Roles and responsibilities in public health and medical preparedness have shifted in past years, with clarity provided by the 109th Congress but refinement ongoing. Activities in DHS are led by the DHS Chief Medical Officer, and in HHS by the HHS. The DHS Chief Medical Officer (CMO) leads activities in DHS, while the HHS Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR) leads activities in HHS. The Secretary of Homeland Security coordinates all federal emergency and disaster response activities, the DHS CMO coordinates preparedness and response within DHS, and the Secretary of HHS, through the ASPR, leads federal public health and medical response activities. The Government Accountability Office recommended that DHS and HHS conduct training to define federal leadership roles clearly. Federal incident response follows the National Response Framework, with public health and medical response activities led by HHS under ESF-8. The NRF replaced the National Response Plan after Hurricane Katrina, addressing leadership gaps. Some leadership gaps and conflicts remain in ESF-8, including concerns about leadership clarity for responder health and safety, emergency sheltering, mass fatality management, and mental health services. PAHPA requires the HHS Secretary to publish a comprehensive national health security strategy, with the first plan released in 2009 and updated quadrennially. The strategy aims to achieve specific preparedness goals and is crucial for broader national security objectives. The NHSS is designed to achieve two goals: build community resilience and strengthen health and emergency response systems. The 112th Congress may review the NHSS implementation and consider the HHS Secretary's authorities for responding to public health threats. The HHS Secretary has a \"no-year\" Public Health Emergency Fund, but it has not been funded since FY1999. It is uncertain if a flu pandemic or bioterrorism incident would qualify as a major disaster under the Stafford Act. President Obama did not issue a Stafford Act declaration for the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic, and response costs were covered by supplemental appropriations. Response costs for infectious disease incidents could potentially be supported by substantial FEMA funds if major disaster assistance were applicable. Congress has shown interest in the DHS Office of Health Affairs (OHA) and its Chief Medical Officer (CMO) responsibilities, established in 2005. The CMO is tasked with advising the DHS Secretary and FEMA Administrator on medical and public health issues, coordinating biodefense activities, ensuring preparedness and response coordination, and serving as the primary liaison for medical and public health matters. Several Members of Congress have been engaged in these activities. The Chief Medical Officer (CMO) of the DHS Office of Health Affairs (OHA) has limited operational responsibility for public health and medical matters, mainly serving as an advisor. The CMO coordinates with HHS for federal response efforts and relies on other agencies for direct medical care during emergencies. Dr. Alexander Garza, the current CMO, highlighted OHA's role as a young entity during his confirmation hearing. During his confirmation hearing, Dr. Alexander Garza, the current CMO of OHA, emphasized the agency's evolving roles and relationships with federal and non-federal partners. Congress has raised concerns about OHA's management of the BioWatch program, withholding funding over sensor upgrade evaluations. Congress has allocated $7.6 billion from FY2002 to FY2010 for public health preparedness through the Cooperative Agreement for Public Health Emergency Preparedness (PHEP) administered by CDC. The Cooperative Agreement for Public Health Emergency Preparedness (PHEP) is administered by the HHS CDC. It provides funding for academic Centers for Public Health Preparedness and Advanced Practice Centers to develop and disseminate evidence-based public health preparedness practices. PAHPA extended authority for the program, adding requirements such as withholding funds for non-compliance and a state matching requirement. The program's appropriations authority expires in FY2011, and reauthorization may be considered by the 112th Congress. The PHEP program has been beneficial in expanding technical capacity but has faced challenges for federal managers and state awardees. The PHEP cooperative agreement program supports preparedness activities but struggles with workforce shortages and developing performance goals. PHEP funding is not for response efforts, and there is no dedicated federal funding for emergency response assistance to state health departments. Federal funds may be available from various sources depending on the circumstances. Federal funds may be available from various sources for response to incidents that do not involve a major disaster declaration under the Stafford Act. The HHS Secretary has authority for a Public Health Emergency Fund, but it is currently empty. Costs for HHS's response to non-Stafford public health incidents are sometimes covered through emergency supplemental appropriations. Medical surge capacity is a concern for policymakers, requiring coordination between federal, state, local authorities, and the private sector. The need for medical surge capacity involves various elements such as patients, healthcare facilities, workforce, equipment, supplies, records, and financing mechanisms. The private healthcare sector has faced cost constraints and has struggled to maintain unused reserve capacity. The federal government has tried to establish this capacity in the private sector since 2001, with some success through programs like the Hospital Preparedness Program. The Hospital Preparedness Program, funded by HHS ASPR, has provided $3.8 billion to states and territories from FY2002 to FY2010 for regional surge capacity in mass casualty incidents. Evaluations show mixed reviews on medical surge capacity efforts. PAHPA extended authority for the program with similar accountability provisions. Appropriations authority expires in FY2011. Federal government historically aids states in disaster response through guidance and funding for preparedness activities. Since Hurricane Katrina, the federal government has expanded its role in disaster response by directly procuring and deploying medical response assets like Field Medical Stations (FMS). This includes the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) of medical supplies and drugs, the National Disaster Medical System (NDMS), and other programs to provide emergency health workers. These efforts provide a stronger backstop for state, local, and private-sector response efforts. The federal government has expanded its role in disaster response by procuring and deploying medical assets since 2005. Costs for FMS and SNS assets are covered by discretionary appropriations, while deployment costs may be reimbursed by FEMA. The 112th Congress may review the Crisis Counseling Assistance and Training Program to address mental health issues among disaster victims. Hurricane Katrina prompted a reexamination of federal assistance programs for disaster mental health, highlighting concerns about service effectiveness, timeliness, scope, and duration. The roles and responsibilities of HHS, FEMA, and states in providing mental health services during disasters are not always clear. Funding for interventions similar to the Crisis Counseling Program may not be available for incidents not covered by the Stafford Act. Additional healthcare workers are needed for mass casualty incidents, while public health workers are required to track illnesses in general health incidents. The challenge of achieving and sustaining surge capacity in the health care and public health workforces during emergencies is a persistent issue. Federal programs aim to increase the number of health care workers for emergency response, including providing liability protection for volunteer health professionals and establishing a national system for verifying licenses. However, there is still a lack of uniform systems for protecting and verifying volunteer health professionals. NDMS and the Medical Reserve Corps are two programs administered by HHS ASPR that address these issues. The NDMS and Medical Reserve Corps provide surge capacity for emergency response, but may be overwhelmed during mass casualty incidents. Appropriations for these programs expire in FY2011, and reauthorization may be considered by the 112th Congress. PAHPA authorized a loan repayment project for public health workers, but it has not been implemented. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act also addresses ways to bolster the public health workforce. In 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act authorized the Ready Reserve Corps to bolster public health workforce capacity. The CDC PHEP cooperative agreements provide funds for recruitment and training, but grantees struggle to retain qualified personnel. Hiring freezes and funding limitations hinder the program's effectiveness at the local level. The recent recession has caused staff reductions in local health departments, with no federal program specifically covering uninsured health care costs after a disaster. While there is debate on whether this should be a federal responsibility, hospitals and providers may face challenges in delivering care without clear reimbursement sources during mass casualty incidents. Limited federal assistance programs exist, including aid under the Stafford Act for cash assistance, deployment of medical teams, and equipment. Federal assistance under the Stafford Act includes medical teams, equipment, and supplies for emergency healthcare services during declared incidents. Assistance is also provided for mental health crisis counseling in affected communities. Examples of past incidents include the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic, the 2010 Haiti earthquake, and the 2010 Gulf oil spill. Assistance may be limited in scope, amount, and duration, and may not cover all uncompensated medical care costs. Special assistance has been provided by Congress and the George W. Bush Administration in response to certain incidents. Following the 2001 terrorist attacks and Hurricane Katrina in 2005, Congress provided funding for healthcare services to victims and responders. This included funding for health services at the World Trade Center site and state shares for disaster relief efforts. After Hurricane Katrina in 2005, Congress allocated $2 billion for Medicaid costs for evacuees and to restore access to care. In response to the 2009 H1N1 flu pandemic, Congress provided funds for vaccines and medical supplies. Following the Haiti earthquake in 2010, Congress reimbursed U.S. hospitals for care costs and assisted states with Medicaid services for evacuees. Legislative proposals in the 111th Congress aimed to authorize the HHS Secretary to use a special fund for temporary emergency health care coverage for the uninsured. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) may help mitigate concerns about disaster-related uncompensated care by reducing the number of uninsured individuals. However, PPACA does not change the current system where work-related injuries are covered by workers' compensation, not health insurance. The ongoing debate about workers' compensation covering costs of chronic health conditions arising from work-related exposures, such as during disasters, remains unresolved. After the 2001 terrorist attack on the World Trade Center, responders developed chronic health problems from hazardous exposures during rescue operations. Efforts to track and address these issues were hindered by the lack of a central registry. The SAFE Port Act authorized medical monitoring programs for individuals exposed to hazards after Hurricane Katrina. The health status of individuals exposed to hazards after disasters is a concern. Implementation of authority involving HHS components like ASPR, ATSDR, and NIOSH is pending. Confusion over OSHA's role in ensuring responder health and safety was noted during the response to Hurricane Katrina. Disagreements between FEMA and OSHA delayed authorization of mission assignments. In 2007, OSHA clarified its role in emergency response operations, noting that existing health and safety standards were not comprehensive for emergency responders. OSHA's Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response (HAZWOPER) standard was highlighted in a revised directive. The Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response (HAZWOPER) standard applies to emergency response operations for hazardous substances, including terrorist incidents involving chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear materials. OSHA may choose to use its regulatory authorities during incident response or provide technical assistance. In 2008, GAO recommended HHS develop plans to register all responders during disasters for their health. In 2011, CDC's NIOSH published draft guidance for monitoring responder health and safety during the entire response cycle. President Obama signed the James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act of 2010, establishing the World Trade Center Health Program (WTCHP) to provide medical monitoring and treatment benefits to eligible World Trade Center responders and survivors. The WTCHP will replace the WTC Medical Monitoring and Treatment Program (MMTP) administered by CDC, starting on July 1, 2011, and funded through FY2015 or FY2016. The WTCHP will replace the WTC Medical Monitoring and Treatment Program currently administered by CDC. Challenges may include ensuring access to services for individuals outside NYC and not authorizing treatment for eligible individuals with cancer. The Secretary may find it difficult to determine coverage for common cancers that may have occurred regardless of WTC site exposures. Determining the cause of cancer in a specific individual is generally not possible, and withholding services for cancer treatment could burden some victims. The WTCHP may face challenges in providing treatment for common cancers due to limited funds and potential burden on the program. The law prohibits payment for monitoring and treatment services for participants without health insurance coverage. PPACA could help individuals with WTC-related health issues access insurance, but work-related illnesses are typically covered by workers' compensation, not health insurance. Insurers could deny coverage for work-related conditions. The WTCHP provides payment for chronic conditions in eligible responders that may not be covered by workers' compensation or insurance. PAHPA and PKEMRA require consideration of at-risk individuals in emergency planning. The 110th Congress authorized funds for a National Commission on Children and Disasters in HHS. In 2008, HHS published a report on the status of provisions for at-risk individuals in emergency planning. GAO noted lack of coordination between FEMA Disability Coordinator and National Council on Disability. In 2010, the National Commission on Children and Disasters highlighted readiness gaps in disaster preparedness for pediatric populations, calling for a comprehensive national strategy to address concerns. The 108th Congress launched Project BioShield to develop medical countermeasures for various threats, managed by DHS and HHS. The 109th Congress established BARDA in HHS to oversee procurement decisions. Funding has been diverted for other purposes in recent years. The Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) in HHS oversees countermeasures development and procurement in PAHPA. Key issues include clarity of agency roles, contract terms for developers, and diversion of BioShield funds. The Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) program, administered by CDC, stockpiles medical products for emergencies. Challenges include replacing items with short shelf lives, limiting procurement amounts, and relying on states for distribution after federal delivery. The Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) program, managed by CDC, stockpiles medical products for emergencies. State and local officials are responsible for distributing SNS assets to those in need, facing management challenges in ensuring timely delivery. CDC conducts annual reviews of state capability to distribute SNS assets, showing improvement in recent years. The Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act (PREP Act) eliminates liability for manufacturers and others involved in the production, distribution, and use of covered countermeasures during emergencies. In October 2008, HHS Secretary Michael Leavitt declared emergency countermeasures for smallpox, anthrax, botulism, and acute radiation sickness. In June 2009, HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius issued a declaration for H1N1 pandemic influenza vaccines and antiviral drugs under the PREP Act. The PREP Act limits liability but also establishes a fund to compensate those harmed by covered countermeasures. The Countermeasures Injury Compensation Program (CCPF) was established in response to the H1N1 influenza pandemic with $2 million in funding. It aims to compensate individuals harmed by intentional contamination of food, whether due to terrorism or economic motives. The focus on food safety shifted after the 2001 terrorist attacks to include preventing intentional contamination, as large foodborne outbreaks can have serious economic consequences. The FDA Food Safety Modernization Act (P.L. 111-353) was passed by the 111th Congress to address intentional and unintentional food contamination. It expands FDA's authority to ensure food safety by developing standards and requiring safety plans from producers and processors. The act aims to prevent the serious economic consequences of intentional foodborne outbreaks, especially those related to terrorism. The FDA Food Safety Modernization Act requires food producers and processors to develop safety plans. It also mandates the development of a National Agriculture and Food Defense Strategy by the Secretaries of HHS and Agriculture. The law provides for limited fees and revenue sources, with FDA's regulatory authorities effective upon enactment. Implementation, including increased inspection activities, may depend on discretionary appropriations. Congress allocated $6.1 billion in emergency funding in response to the H5N1 avian influenza outbreak in Asia and Europe. In response to the H5N1 avian influenza outbreak in Asia and Europe, Congress provided $6.1 billion in emergency funding. A new flu strain, H1N1 \"swine flu,\" emerged in March 2009, causing the first flu pandemic in over 40 years. Congress allocated up to $7.7 billion in emergency funding for the pandemic response in FY2009. The H1N1 pandemic, while not as deadly as previous pandemics, presented significant public health challenges. The Administration is reportedly preparing a comprehensive after-action report on the incident, with potential issues of interest to the 112th Congress including financing options for infectious disease incidents. The response to communicable disease threats may involve movement restrictions, business and school closures, compulsory treatments, and other constraints. Managing employers' and workers' concerns during outbreaks of communicable disease, such as a flu pandemic, may be especially difficult if workers fear losing their employment or wages. Compliance with public health measures like isolation or quarantine may suffer as a result. Public health officials recommend that isolation or quarantine measures be voluntary whenever possible. Recent incidents have raised concerns about communicable diseases among travelers, expanding Congress's interest in U.S. border security. Questions have been raised about the coordination and effectiveness of federal agencies responsible for disease control, border security, and transportation infrastructure. Policymakers emphasize the need for systems that can respond to infectious disease threats like tuberculosis to also be prepared for more serious threats such as pandemic flu or bioterrorism. Effective solutions are challenging to find but should ideally address scientific and technical aspects. In August 2008, the FBI identified a Defense Department scientist as responsible for the 2001 anthrax attacks, raising concerns about security risk assessments for individuals in the Select Agent program. Legislation in the 111th Congress aimed to reauthorize the Select Agent program. The 111th Congress aimed to reauthorize the Select Agent program managed by the CDC and USDA to regulate biological pathogens for bioterrorism. The bills included program review, surge planning, and inventory improvements. They also allowed for the release of sensitive information to state officials. Some academic institutions are expanding laboratory capacity to study dangerous biological pathogens and toxins for biodefense efforts. However, these labs could also pose a risk by potentially being a source of materials or training for biological attacks. The 112th Congress may address issues related to oversight of domestic biodefense labs, balancing security with scientific transparency, and the impact of regulatory approaches on international collaboration. Legislation introduced in the 111th Congress aimed to enhance laboratory capacity and information sharing in the biodefense and infectious disease communities. It also proposed developing training standards for personnel and establishing a voluntary reporting system for incidents. However, the bills did not progress in Congress."
