    "content": "Key issues facing U.S. policy makers and members of Congress when considering U.S. security assistance in the context of U.S. policy toward Lebanon include assessing the effectiveness of assistance programs, identifying urgent capabilities lacking in the LAF and ISF, understanding obstacles to expanding Lebanon's security forces, prioritizing policy objectives in Lebanon, and managing relations with external actors to prevent destabilizing actions. The United States increased assistance to Lebanon after the Cedar Revolution in 2005 and focused on building state institutions, including the Lebanese Armed Forces and Internal Security Forces, after the 2006 war between Israel and Hezbollah. The U.S. aims to influence regional actors in support of its objectives in Lebanon and the Levant, while managing relations with external actors to prevent destabilizing actions. The Bush Administration and Congress provided increased security assistance to the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) and Internal Security Forces (ISF) to secure Lebanon's borders against smuggling and weapons flow to Hezbollah. The Obama Administration and some members of Congress support this program to improve internal stability and public confidence in the LAF and ISF, allowing the Lebanese government to address political reform and national defense strategy. In the early 1980s, the United States provided military aid to the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) during the civil war. This aid included grants and loans for training and equipment. In the early 1990s, after the civil war ended, the US provided non-lethal military equipment through the sale of Excess Defense Articles. President Bush requested Foreign Military Financing grants in 2006 to modernize the LAF. The 2006 war between Israel and Hezbollah prompted Western donors to increase support. In 2005, the Bush Administration reprogrammed $42 million for spare parts, training, and equipment for the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) after the 2006 war between Israel and Hezbollah. The FY2007 Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act included over $220 million in Foreign Military Financing (FMF) for Lebanon, along with $60 million for training and equipping Lebanon's Internal Security Forces (ISF). Additionally, Section 1206 assistance to Lebanon increased to $30.6 million in FY2007. The U.S. government supports Lebanon's control over southern Lebanon and Palestinian refugee camps to prevent attacks on Israel. Military programs enhance the professionalism of the Lebanese Armed Forces, promoting civilian control. The U.S. aims to help Lebanon control weapons influx for peace and security. Assistance to the LAF and ISF continues in various appropriations acts. The LAF's mandate includes defending Lebanon, maintaining internal stability, and engaging in social development. The U.S. government provides assistance to the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) to modernize and equip them, with a focus on professionalization through training programs. The Foreign Military Financing (FMF) program supports LAF implementation of U.N. Security Council Resolution 1701 and helps in the fight against terrorist groups. The Foreign Military Financing (FMF) program supports the Lebanese government in fighting terrorist groups by providing equipment such as tactical vehicles, spare parts for helicopters, small arms, and ammunition. In FY2009, more advanced equipment like Cessna Caravans armed with Hellfire missiles and Raven tactical UAVs were delivered to enhance the Lebanese Armed Forces' capabilities. Additionally, M60 tanks were transferred from Jordan to improve the LAF's fire support capabilities, with plans for further tank upgrades and transfers with donor support. The Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) are upgrading their communications capabilities with new tactical equipment to address shortfalls in their current systems. The LAF is planning to transfer an additional 56 tanks with donor support and is launching a comprehensive training program in FY2009 to provide basic and advanced skills. The Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) are implementing a training program to enhance skills and streamline hierarchy, funded by supplemental resources. The FY2010 FMF spending plan includes allocations for sustainment, equipment acquisition, personal gear, and close air support, including light attack/armed reconnaissance aircraft (LAAR) for border security surveillance and target acquisition. The International Military and Education Training (IMET) program funds military education and training activities for foreign military and civilian officials from allied nations. IMET training in Lebanon aims to reduce sectarianism in the LAF and develop the force as a national institution. U.S. Professional Military Education (PME) courses help improve interoperability and mutual understanding with U.S. counterparts. Congress provided funds for a DOD-run train and equip program in 2005 under Section 1206 of the National Defense Authorization Act. Section 1206, a pilot program adopted in 2006, allows DOD to transfer funds for training and equipping foreign militaries quickly in response to urgent threats. In Lebanon, Section 1206 funds have been used to provide vehicle spare parts, ammunition, and basic supplies to the LAF, including restocking ammunition after the 2007 siege at Nahr al Bared Palestinian refugee camp. The ISF, Lebanon's primary police agency, is responsible for law enforcement and investigations. The ISF, neglected under Syrian occupation, received assistance from the Department of State's INL in 2007 to increase operational capacity for crime prevention and counterterrorism efforts. The program includes training, equipment, community policing assistance, and communications support. Over 4,300 ISF police have been trained by INL as of August 2010. INL has provided extensive training and equipment to the ISF, including specialized courses in narcotics investigation and IPR protection. They have also refurbished training facilities and provided non-lethal equipment such as police cars, motorcycles, and radios. Additionally, INL has initiated a community policing program to prepare the ISF for a new security role in the Nahr al Bared refugee camp. The US has provided training and equipment to the ISF, including specialized courses in narcotics investigation and IPR protection. They are also developing a program for a nationwide command, control, and communications system for the ISF. However, Lebanese leaders question the appropriateness of external security assistance and perceive Israel as the primary threat to Lebanon's security. Lebanese leaders question the appropriateness of external security assistance and perceive Israel as the primary threat to Lebanon's security. Hezbollah's weapons and support from Syria and Iran are seen as significant transnational threats. Lebanese leaders are willing to seek security assistance and weapons from non-U.S. sources. In August 2010, the Lebanese Armed Forces fired on an Israeli Defense Force unit, resulting in casualties on both sides. In August 2010, a journalist and an Israeli officer were killed in a confrontation along the Israeli-Lebanese border. UNIFIL confirmed that the IDF had not entered Lebanese territory, calling it the \"most serious\" incident since 2006. In response, Representative Nita Lowey placed a hold on a $100 million FMF appropriation for Lebanon to investigate if U.S. equipment was used against Israel. Representative Howard Berman also placed a hold on assistance pending clarification on U.S. strategy and LAF's responsibility. In November 2010, a hold on $100 million FMF appropriation for Lebanon was lifted after congressional consultations with the State Department. Concerns remain about the effectiveness of U.S. assistance in meeting policy objectives. LAF and ISF praised for their performance and End-Use Monitoring record. Questions linger about long-term strategy. LAF forces secured downtown Beirut during a commemoration event and responded to a plane crash in early 2010. In response to various security incidents, the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) have been proactive in arresting suspects and preventing potential attacks. They have recovered victims from a plane crash, arrested individuals involved in attacks against the LAF, and thwarted attempts to carry out terrorist activities. Additionally, the LAF has conducted operations to apprehend wanted individuals and destroy illicit crops in the Bekaa Valley. The Lebanese government is committed to complying with end-use, security, and retransfer obligations regarding military equipment and training. The Lebanese government has agreed to extensive end-use monitoring procedures for sensitive equipment and training provided by the U.S. Embassy's Office of Defense Cooperation. The government is praised for its cooperation in monitoring and vetting candidates for U.S.-sponsored training. The Internal Security Forces (ISF) have gained public confidence as a non-sectarian institution in Lebanon. The ISF, historically not seen as cross-sectarian, has expanded its operations in Hezbollah-controlled areas. During the 2009 elections, ISF ensured security and a safe election environment. End-use monitoring by the U.S. Embassy shows proper use of equipment provided to ISF. Monitoring reports include location, use, condition, and impact of equipment, as well as any encountered problems and program changes. INL secures binding commitments from Lebanon through Letters of Agreement for assistance. ISF candidates are vetted for human rights abuses and connections to FTOs. U.S. policy towards Lebanon is based on UNSCR 1701, which bans weapons delivery to anyone in Lebanon except the Lebanese Army. The U.S. provides assistance to Lebanon, focusing on building the security apparatus of the Lebanese state to improve internal stability. This includes efforts to root out Sunni extremism and enhance counterterrorism measures. The assistance is seen as symbolic of U.S. commitment to Lebanon and countering external influences. The U.S. provides assistance to Lebanon to build state institutions and enhance security, demonstrating commitment to countering external influences like Iran and Syria. The skirmish between the LAF and IDF raised questions about U.S. strategy in Lebanon, as the LAF aims to take up national defense responsibilities from Hezbollah. Critics highlight tension in U.S. policy as the LAF engages with the IDF along the shared border with Israel. The LAF is seen positively by many Lebanese citizens as the only national institution defending the country against foreign threats, particularly Israel. The Lebanese government, with support from the international community, has been working to define the role of the LAF through discussions on national defense policy. Hezbollah gained popular support through relief and reconstruction efforts after claiming victory over Israel. US policy towards Lebanon is complicated by the focus on Hezbollah's role in the country's political system and security sector. Hezbollah's growing influence in Lebanon's government, including control of ministries and parliamentary seats, raises concerns about its impact on government institutions like the LAF. Critics, such as AIPAC, claim that the LAF has allowed Hezbollah to rearm since 2006, suggesting a potential alliance between the two against common threats. Israeli media reports indicate a campaign to end U.S. support for the LAF. Israel is launching a campaign to end U.S. support for the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) due to concerns about Hezbollah gaining access to equipment. U.S. officials emphasize their commitment to Israel's military edge and state that assistance to the LAF is not meant for confronting Hezbollah, but to strengthen the Lebanese government. Solutions to Hezbollah's challenges remain unclear for Lebanon, Israel, and the United States. Hezbollah's threat to Lebanon, Israel, and the United States is evident as they have rearmed and expanded their arsenal in defiance of UN resolutions. Iran continues to support Hezbollah with weapons, training, and financing, complicating international efforts to engage with Lebanon on security issues. Lebanon's cabinet complicates international efforts to engage on security and reform due to political rivalries and an impasse on security needs and Hezbollah's weapons."
