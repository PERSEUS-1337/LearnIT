    "content": "Methane capture projects are crucial in mitigating greenhouse gas emissions by preventing the release of methane into the atmosphere. The U.S. EPA has identified key sources for methane capture, including landfills, coal mines, agriculture, and oil and gas systems. Legislative developments, regulations, economics, technology, and outreach will determine the amount of methane captured. Methane constituted 8% of U.S. GHG emissions in 2008, with anthropogenic sources including enteric fermentation, landfills, natural gas systems, coal mines, and manure management. Reducing methane emissions is essential as it is the second-most important GHG after carbon dioxide. Efforts to reduce methane emissions are crucial for climate change mitigation. Policy options for methane capture, legislative proposals, domestic and international sources of methane, opportunities, challenges, and federal programs supporting methane capture are discussed. Strategies like market-based approaches, emission performance standards, and existing programs can encourage or require methane capture. Different strategies may be needed for various methane emission sources. One option for policymakers is to include methane emission sources in a market-based GHG emission control program. Market-based mechanisms can focus on quantity control (e.g., cap-and-trade) or price control (e.g., carbon tax). Covered entities would likely pass the emissions price through to consumers, such as landfill operators raising waste disposal prices based on methane emissions. The price of waste disposal may increase to cover new emissions costs, incentivizing consumers to reduce waste and lower landfill methane emissions. Methane emissions from various sources were not included in some emissions programs due to administrative costs. Despite the large number of methane sources, their overall contribution to U.S. GHG emissions is relatively small, especially in the agriculture sector. Addressing CO2 emissions can be done by imposing an emissions cap on a small number of entities, covering 82% of U.S. GHG emissions. This approach may not work for methane sources, especially in the agriculture sector. Monitoring methane emissions from natural gas systems, particularly field production, may be challenging. The remaining 75% of emissions involve accidental releases, known as fugitive emissions. Landfill methane emissions are being reduced under Clean Air Act requirements. Policymakers could incentivize methane mitigation through carbon offset projects or tax credits within a cap-and-trade system.Offsets could make emissions programs more cost-effective by encouraging non-regulated sources to reduce emissions. Offsets can make emissions programs more cost-effective by incentivizing non-regulated sources to reduce emissions. The main concern is ensuring that offset projects represent real emission reductions, with some methane capture projects considered of higher quality. These projects are easier to measure and verify, and likely would not occur without the financing provided by an offset market. The challenge lies in proving the \"additionality\" of these projects. The advantage of some methane capture projects over other GHG mitigation activities may lead policymakers to directly control methane releases instead of relying on offset markets. Questions of fairness arise when certain emission sources are capped while others can generate financial gain through offsets. Policymakers could also consider requiring emission performance standards for specific methane sources, following the core of U.S. federal air pollution policy. The core of U.S. federal air pollution policy can be pursued without new legislation by setting emission performance standards for methane sources under existing Clean Air Act authorities. The EPA has started taking actions towards implementing GHG emission standards for specific sources, aiming to reduce emissions through technology requirements like the \"best available control technology.\" Source-by-source regulation, although effective, may not achieve emission reductions on its own. Performance standards can be a practical option for reducing methane emissions from specific sources, especially where costs are high. The federal government supports programs to stimulate methane capture, and the Clean Air Act imposes emission standards on large landfills. However, most landfills are not covered by these standards, leaving room for increased methane capture. The primary objective of emission standards is to reduce hazardous air pollutants and organic compounds in landfill gas, not specifically methane emissions for climate reasons. Existing Clean Air Act authorities could address a wider range of methane sources for greenhouse gas control. Implementing a GHG emission control program would increase incentives to capture methane as an energy source. The 111th Congress introduced bills related to methane emissions, including promoting biogas production and landfill gas recovery projects. H.R. 2454, passed in 2009, included a cap-and-trade system allowing methane capture activities to generate offsets. Some methane sources might have been subject to emission performance standards. One enacted legislation (P.L. 111-5) extended incentives for biomass and landfill gas electricity production, creating new incentives. Methane, a flammable gas, is produced by bacteria decomposing organic matter. It is a primary component of natural gas fuel, with 27% of U.S. energy consumed in 2009 being natural gas. Global warming potential (GWP) estimates the impact of greenhouse gases. Global warming potential (GWP) is a measure of how much a greenhouse gas (GHG) affects climate change relative to CO2. Methane, a potent GHG, has a GWP of 21, making it 21 times more effective than CO2 at trapping heat in the atmosphere over a 100-year timeframe. Efforts to capture methane provide more near-term climate change abatement compared to reducing CO2 emissions. GHGs can be expressed in a common unit of measurement called carbon dioxide-equivalent (CO2e), which considers the potency of each gas. Carbon dioxide-equivalent (CO2e) is a unit of measurement that considers the potency of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and expresses their quantity in terms of the equivalent effect of CO2 on climate change. In 2008, the top three anthropogenic sources of methane emissions were enteric fermentation, landfills, and natural gas systems, accounting for 64% of total U.S. methane emissions. Natural sources like wetlands and geologic formations also contribute to methane emissions. Methane emissions account for 30% of annual methane inventory, with Asia being the top emitter. The top five emitting countries are China, India, the United States, the European Union, and Brazil. The agriculture sector is the leading source of methane emissions globally. Methane concentrations have started to increase again since 2007, possibly due to warmer temperatures in the Arctic and increased precipitation in the tropics. Global methane emissions from natural sources are estimated at 208 million metric tons per year. Methane, with an annual emission of 208 million metric tons, can be captured as pure methane or as part of biogas. Captured methane can be flared or used for heat/electricity generation. Flaring methane produces CO2 and water, which is less harmful than releasing methane directly. Captured methane is stored underground in natural gas formations or as liquefied natural gas for transport. Methane can be captured from various sectors of the U.S. economy using different strategies. Policy proposals may provide incentives for methane capture. The top four sources of methane are agriculture, landfills, oil and natural gas systems, and coalbed methane. Agriculture sector emissions come mainly from enteric fermentation and manure management. Ruminant animals are major emitters of methane through enteric fermentation. Options to reduce methane emissions from enteric fermentation and manure management systems include improved animal productivity, feed management, and anaerobic digestion systems. Barriers to methane capture from manure management include limited technology and high upfront costs. Landfills are a significant source of methane emissions in the U.S. due to the release of landfill gas, which is a mixture of methane and carbon dioxide. The amount of gas produced depends on the organic waste, landfill design, climate, and operating practices. Landfill gas is captured at large landfills to reduce emissions. The \"Landfill Gas Rule\" requires landfills with a 2.5 million metric ton design capacity to capture and burn gas, reducing methane emissions by 37% at new landfills and 39% at existing facilities. Flaring the gas is less damaging to the atmosphere than releasing methane. There are currently 541 operational projects at landfills, representing roughly 30% of municipal solid waste landfills in operation. A significant amount of methane continues to be emitted at landfills, even those subject to the Landfill Gas Rule. There are challenges in implementing methane capture projects at smaller landfills and those that ceased operation before November 1987. Barriers include the lack of responsible parties and funding for necessary equipment, as well as high capital costs. Barriers to landfill gas capture include high capital costs, low gas capture rates, permitting requirements, and liability concerns. Methane emissions from natural gas and oil systems can be reduced through various technologies and strategies, such as flaring, direct use, and reinjection of methane. Offshore oil operations typically use captured methane directly, while onshore operations usually inject it into a pipeline. Methane emissions from oil and natural gas systems can be reduced through flaring, direct use, and reinjection of methane. One analysis estimated reduction efficiencies for these methods to be 98%, 90%, and 95% respectively. Barriers to methane capture include economic regulations, financial constraints, technology costs, and availability. The coal mining sector is a significant source of methane emissions, with most emissions occurring during underground mining operations. The amount of methane released depends on the type of coal mine. The capture of methane emissions from coal mines depends on the mine type and operation. Two techniques, degasification and ventilation air methane systems, are used. Degasification removes methane through wells or boreholes, with some methane being used for energy. Enhanced degasification extracts lower-quality methane for cleaning. Ventilation air methane systems maintain methane levels in underground mines. Methane capture from coal mines is essential for maintaining safe working conditions for miners. Methane is flushed out of underground mines to prevent explosive concentrations. The captured methane can be used for electricity generation or sold to utility companies. Legal and economic barriers, such as high capital costs and low electricity prices, hinder widespread methane capture in coal mines. The primary barriers to methane recovery from coal mines include uncertainty regarding ownership, especially on federal lands, and restricted pipeline capacity for transporting coalbed methane to natural gas markets. Ownership of coalbed methane may lie with the owner(s) of coal rights, oil and gas rights, or surface rights. Impediments to methane capture include limited pipeline capacity and pricing issues. The Methane-to-Markets Partnership is an international initiative for methane capture and reuse from four sources: oil and gas. Congress and the executive branch have supported methane capture projects through voluntary programs, energy management programs, and research and development programs. The Methane-to-Markets Partnership is an international initiative for methane capture and reuse from various sources, administered by the U.S. EPA with support from 38 country partners. It receives funding from the Clean Air Act and NEPA, with additional support from the U.S. Department of State and other government partners. The EPA facilitates voluntary programs related to the Methane-to-Markets initiative, receiving financial support from government partners. Programs like AgSTAR, CMOP, Natural Gas STAR, and LMOP focus on reducing methane emissions from various sectors through methane capture and reuse. The Landfill Methane Outreach Program (LMOP) under EPA and the Department of Energy's (DOE) Federal Energy Management Program (FEMP) promote landfill gas energy projects, reducing methane emissions. DOE has implemented three landfill gas recovery projects funded by FEMP. The federal government appropriated $32 million for FY2010 to subsidize methane capture from landfill and agriculture sources through various tax incentives. These incentives are categorized into producing electricity, building facilities, and producing alternative fuels from captured methane gas. Production tax credits are available for electricity production from qualified energy resources like open-loop biomass and municipal solid waste facilities. Open-loop biomass and municipal solid waste facilities placed in service after August 8, 2005, and before December 31, 2013, may claim a tax credit of 1 cent per kilowatt-hour of electricity generated during the first 10 years of production. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 allowed a grant in lieu of tax credits for property placed in service in 2009 and 2010. Three tax-preferred bond finance options exist to help finance methane capture facilities used to produce electricity: Qualified Energy Conservation Bonds (QECBs), Clean Renewable Energy Bonds (CREBs), and New Clean Renewable Energy Bonds (New CREBs). These bonds offer the holder a federal tax credit instead of interest. The bonds QECBs, CREBs, and New CREBs are available to finance energy production projects like biomass and landfill gas facilities. They have national limits of $2.4 billion, $1.2 billion, and $2.4 billion respectively. QECBs are allocated based on state population, while CREBs and New CREBs are allocated by project size. QECBs have no expiration, while CREBs and New CREBs expired in 2009. Tax incentives are available for facilities using methane gas for alternative fuels. Facilities with construction contracts before December 31, 2010, can expense half the cost of qualified property in the first year and depreciate the remaining 50% over five years. Biomass-derived gas and liquid fuel qualify for a $1.00 per gallon tax credit until December 31, 2011. Methane from gas hydrates is not currently captured but is being researched for potential energy production by 2015. The DOE program aims to extract methane from gas hydrates by 2015, with projects in the Gulf of Mexico and Alaska. Funding was authorized by the Methane Hydrate Research and Development Act of 2000 and extended through FY2010 by the Energy Policy Act of 2005. Congress appropriated $15 million for gas hydrates R&D in FY2009. The Obama Administration requested $25 million for the natural gas technologies program for FY2010, which includes gas hydrate R&D. Congress appropriated $17.8 million for the program in FY2010, funding research into unconventional gas production from basins containing tight gas sands, shale gas, and coal bed methane, as well as for gas hydrates."
