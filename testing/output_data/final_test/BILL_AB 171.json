    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 972.1 of the Military and Veterans Code, as amended in 2012, is repealed, and $500,000 is appropriated from the General Fund to the Department of Veterans Affairs for county veterans service officers' activities in the 1989-90 fiscal year. Funds are disbursed annually to counties with county veterans service officers based on staffing levels and workload, using a formula developed by the Department of Veterans Affairs. County funds must not be less than the amount allocated in the 1988-89 fiscal year. The department annually determines new or increased monetary benefits for eligible veterans from federal government assistance through county veterans service officers. This determination is submitted to the Department of Finance and Legislature by October 1 each year for review in the annual Budget Act. The Legislature intends to increase the annual budget for county veterans service officers by up to $11 million if justified by benefits to veterans. Additionally, they may consider a further increase of up to $5 million based on the assistance provided to veterans. This section will be effective from January 1, 2016. The Department of Veterans Affairs will develop an allocation formula based on performance standards to reward outstanding service by county veterans service officers. Counties must comply with requirements such as maintaining a county veterans service officer and meeting training standards to receive allocated funds. This section becomes effective on January 1, 2016. The Department of Veterans Affairs will require county veterans service officers to become accredited within 18 months of employment to provide representation services to claimants before the United States Department of Veterans Affairs. The department will report annually to the Legislature on the efficacy and impact of subvention funds on each county, including the amount of new benefits paid to eligible veterans. The Department of Veterans Affairs requires county veterans service officers to become accredited within 18 months of employment to provide representation services. The department will report annually to the Legislature on the impact of subvention funds on each county, including the amount of benefits paid to eligible veterans and recommendations for improvement. The department will transmit its determination for the preceding fiscal year to the Department of Finance and the Legislature by October 1 each year. The Legislature intends for the department to regularly update the allocation formula to accommodate changes in veteran demographics and needs. The recent conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan have produced a new generation of veterans eligible for federal benefits, with Californians comprising up to 10% of military forces involved. Many returning California veterans are unaware of available federal and state benefits. In California, there may be over two million veterans and their widows/widowers unaware of eligibility for federal pensions based on military service. County veterans service officers are the initial point of contact for accessing VA benefits. The costs of maintaining county veterans service officers are shared between county general funds and state reimbursement. Legislation in 1997 and 2009 required reporting on federal benefits paid to veterans with potential budget increases for county veterans service officers. By the end of 2013, the state had budgeted $41.4 million for county veterans service officers, resulting in $4.1 billion in new federal benefits for local veterans. This represents a return of $98 for every $1 allocated. Additionally, Medi-Cal cost savings are not included in the reporting. County veterans service officers shifted veterans from Medi-Cal to federal veterans program, resulting in cost savings. The county veterans service officers have not reached the full state budget allocation of $11 million, receiving only $5.6 million per year. It is crucial for them to receive consistent funding to help underserved veterans access federal benefits, leading to economic benefits in the local community. Section 972.1 of the Military and Veterans Code is amended to disburse funds to counties with county veterans service officers based on performance and workload. \"Workload unit\" refers to specific claim activities approved by the Department of Veterans Affairs. The department will develop a formula to incentivize county veterans service officers to assist veterans in accessing federal benefits, aiming to increase the amount of federal money received by California veterans. The department will annually report the monetary benefits obtained for eligible veterans due to the officers' assistance to the Department of Finance and the Legislature. The department will review county veterans service officers' performance and create a best-practices manual by June 30, 2013. The Legislature may increase the budget for officers up to $11 million if justified by benefits to veterans. This section is effective until January 1, 2016. The budget for county veterans service officers is disbursed annually based on performance levels, with a minimum allocation of $5,600,000. The department annually determines new or increased benefits for eligible veterans from federal government assistance through county veterans service officers. The Legislature may increase the budget for these officers up to $11,000,000 if justified by benefits to veterans. This section becomes effective on January 1, 2016. Section 972.3 of the Military and Veterans Code appropriates $5,600,000 annually from the General Fund starting July 1, 2015, for county veterans service officers' activities. This funding is available for one year after becoming encumbered. The Department of Veterans Affairs must develop an allocation formula by July 1, 2016, based on performance standards to reward outstanding service by county veterans service officers. Funding will be allocated annually among counties with established officers. This act is an urgency statute for immediate effect. Approximately 50 percent of the General Fund appropriation for county veteran service offices expires on June 30, 2015. This act is necessary for the continuity of services for California's veterans and to ensure timely processing of benefits claims."
