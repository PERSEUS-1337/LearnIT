    "content": "The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) allows government agencies to conduct electronic surveillance and physical searches for foreign intelligence with authorization from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC). The USA PATRIOT Act, enacted after 9/11, expanded FISA to enhance investigative tools for preventing terrorist activities. The expanded authorities under FISA raised concerns about the balance between national security and civil liberties. Congress established sunset provisions for controversial FISA amendments, including the \"lone wolf\" provision and roving wiretaps authorized by the USA PATRIOT Act. The USA PATRIOT Act authorized wiretaps and Section 215 orders for foreign intelligence investigations. Controversy arose over NSA's bulk collection of phone metadata, leading to the expiration of these provisions in 2015. The USA FREEDOM Act was enacted the following day to address these concerns. The USA FREEDOM Act, enacted after the expiration of the USA PATRIOT Act provisions in 2015, placed new limitations on government's foreign intelligence activities while extending the expired provisions through December 15, 2019. FISA, enacted in 1978, governs governmental authority for foreign intelligence surveillance. The three amendments covered in this report are the \"lone wolf,\" \"roving wiretap,\" and Section 215 provisions. Section 215 of the USA PATRIOT Act, implicated by Edward Snowden's leaks, is the most controversial provision with extensive legislative and litigation history. It broadened federal officials' access to materials for foreign intelligence information and lowered the standard for court orders. Prior to this, FISA only authorized the production of four types of business records in foreign intelligence or terrorism investigations. The USA PATRIOT Act expanded the scope of records for foreign intelligence or terrorism investigations to include \"any tangible things.\" Section 215 also modified the evidentiary standard for issuing orders to obtain documents. Prior to this, specific facts were required to believe the person was linked to foreign power, but under Section 215, only specifying the records for foreign intelligence purposes was needed. In 2005, Congress amended FISA procedures for obtaining business records for foreign intelligence, terrorism, or espionage investigations. The standard was changed to require a statement of facts showing reasonable grounds to believe the tangible things sought are relevant. Beginning in 2006, the government used FISC orders under Section 215 to collect domestic telephone metadata in bulk. The USA FREEDOM Act amended Section 215 to limit the collection of domestic telephone metadata in bulk by requiring the use of a \"specific selection term\" to identify individuals. This change aimed to restrict the broad collection of data under Section 215 to only target specific identifiers. The amended Section 215 allows for orders limited by geographic terms or named communication providers. A relaxed standard can be used for ongoing telephone metadata collection for international terrorism investigations. This can produce a second set of telephone records connected to the original records obtained. The government can request records of calls between individuals with a \"reasonable articulable suspicion\" of terrorism involvement. Orders under Section 215 come with nondisclosure requirements, but recipients can discuss the order with necessary parties. The USA PATRIOT Improvement and Reauthorization Act of 2005 allows recipients of Section 215 orders to challenge the production of business records. A FISC judge must determine the validity of a petition within 72 hours. Orders can be modified or set aside if they do not meet FISA requirements. Nondisclosure orders can be reviewed after one year. Appeals can be made to the Foreign Intelligence Court of Review and the Supreme Court. Section 6001(a) of IRTPA, known as the \"lone wolf\" provision, simplifies the evidentiary standard for setting aside a nondisclosure order. The order may be challenged if it does not endanger national security, interfere with investigations, diplomatic relations, or endanger lives. A certification by the government can defeat a petition, and if denied, the petitioner cannot challenge the order for a year. Appeals can be made to the Foreign Intelligence Court of Review and the Supreme Court. Section 6001(a) of IRTPA, known as the \"lone wolf\" provision, simplifies the evidentiary standard for determining if an individual engaged in international terrorism can be targeted by a FISA court order. This provision was inspired by the case of Zacarias Moussaoui, a suspect in the 9/11 attacks, where limitations in FISA authorities hindered investigations into his involvement. The FBI detained Moussaoui in August 2001 for planning a terrorist attack involving commercial airliners. They sought a FISA court order to examine his laptop but lacked sufficient information to prove he was an agent of a foreign power. FISA allowed physical searches of a laptop if probable cause existed to believe it was owned by a foreign power or its agent. The definition of a \"foreign power\" included groups engaged in international terrorism. In response to the FBI's lack of evidence linking Moussaoui to international terrorism, legislative proposals were made to amend FISA. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 included the \"lone wolf\" provision, which presumes individuals engaged in international terrorism to be agents of a foreign power without needing specific evidence. The \"lone wolf\" provision in the USA PATRIOT Act allows for surveillance of individuals without the need for evidence linking them to a foreign government or terrorist group. Critics argue that existing laws could have been used for surveillance in cases like Moussaoui's, while proponents believe the provision is necessary to combat modern terror networks. Section 206 of the Act also permits roving wiretaps to enhance surveillance flexibility. Section 206 of the USA PATRIOT Act expanded the scope of electronic surveillance under FISA by allowing wiretaps to target persons rather than just locations or facilities. This provision enables the government to conduct surveillance on individuals without the need to identify a specific location or facility beforehand. Telecom providers are restricted from assisting in electronic surveillance for foreign intelligence purposes unless authorized by FISA. Section 206 of the USA PATRIOT Act amended FISA to allow orders directing \"other persons\" to assist with electronic surveillance if the target's actions may hinder identifying a specified person. The requirement to specify surveillance locations only applies if known, expanding the reach of FISA orders to involve unspecified individuals in assisting the government. Section 206 of the USA PATRIOT Act expanded FISA orders to involve unspecified individuals in assisting with electronic surveillance, allowing surveillance of unknown locations. The USA PATRIOT Improvement and Reauthorization Act of 2005 further amended this section to require notification to the FISC within 10 days of surveillance beginning at any new facility or place, providing details on the nature, location, justification, minimization procedures, and total number of facilities under surveillance. Under the USA PATRIOT Act, Section 206 expanded FISA orders to allow surveillance of unspecified individuals and locations. The Fourth Amendment's particularity requirement may be challenged by roving wiretaps that do not specify the place to be searched. Legal precedent from challenges to similar provisions in Title III may guide potential challenges to Section 206 regarding violations of the Fourth Amendment's particularity requirement. Roving wiretaps under Title III and FISA have similarities and differences. Title III requires definitively identifying the target, while FISA allows for a specific description. Title III also mandates notifying surveilled individuals, unlike FISA. In United States v. Petti, the Ninth Circuit addressed these issues. In United States v. Petti, the Ninth Circuit upheld the use of roving wiretaps under Title III, stating that they met the particularity requirement of the Fourth Amendment by requiring targets to be identified and used only when there was evidence of intent to evade surveillance. Critics argue that Section 206 of FISA increases the risk of innocent conversations being surveilled without proper identification of the target. The three FISA amendments have been extended until December 15, 2019, and if not extended, the authorities would revert to pre-USA PATRIOT Act text. Section 105(c)(2) of FISA would revert to pre-October 25, 2001 language for roving wiretaps, eliminating the authority for FISA court orders to direct unspecified persons to assist with electronic surveillance. Sections 501 and 502 would also revert to pre-October 25, 2001 language for FISA orders for document production, restricting the types of business records subject to FISA and reinstating the requirement for specific facts to believe the person is a foreign power or agent. Grandfather clauses allow continued effect for investigations or offenses before the provisions' sunset date. If a non-U.S. person engaged in international terrorism before the sunset date, they would still be considered a \"lone wolf\" for FISA court orders post-expiration. Similarly, an individual involved in international terrorism before that date may be targeted for a roving wiretap under FISA even if new roving wiretap authority has expired."
