    "content": "Debate over the federal budget process stems from the shared power between Congress and the President as outlined in the Constitution. The Budget and Accounting Act of 1921 established formal procedures for the President to submit a consolidated budget recommendation to Congress, creating the Bureau of the Budget to assist in this task. In 1970, the budget agency became the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), which plays a key role in the budget process. Presidential impoundment of funds and the debate over granting the President item veto authority have been controversial issues. Impoundment involves withholding or delaying appropriated funds, with distinctions recognized in the 1974 Impoundment Control Act. The Impoundment Control Act of 1974 recognizes presidential actions to withhold or delay funds, focusing on whether the intent is permanent cancellation (rescission) or temporary delay (deferral). Impoundments for routine administrative reasons are common, while impoundments for policy reasons, such as opposition to a program or desire to reduce spending, have a formal structure dating back to 1921. Instances of presidential impoundment have a long history, with disputes arising over funding certain weapons systems and broader use of power during the Vietnam war to restrain inflation. President Johnson deferred billions of dollars in spending, sparking confrontations with Congress over the constitutional role of commander-in-chief. During the Nixon Administration, conflict over impoundments increased, leading to confrontations with Congress and the courts. President Nixon used impoundments to reorder national priorities and cut approved programs, such as subsidized housing, community development, and disaster assistance. Farm programs were also affected by the impoundment actions. During the Nixon Administration, impoundments were used to cut approved programs like subsidized housing and disaster assistance. The most controversial impoundment involved Clean Water Act funds, leading to court challenges. Congress responded with the Impoundment Control Act of 1974, which differentiated deferrals from rescissions and established procedures for congressional review. The Impoundment Control Act of 1974 established procedures for congressional review and control of impoundments, requiring the President to inform Congress of proposed rescissions and deferrals. The Comptroller General oversaw executive compliance and notified Congress of any failures to report impoundments. A federal court ruled in 1986 on the President's deferral authority under the Act. In May 1986, a federal court ruled that the President's deferral authority under the Impoundment Control Act was null. The Act required Congress to approve rescission requests within 45 days of continuous session. If not approved, funds must be made available for obligation after about 60 calendar days. Congress can approve all or part of the request and may also rescind funds not proposed by the President. In 1987, Congress enacted budget process reforms, including prohibiting Presidents from submitting new rescission proposals for the same funds if Congress failed to act within the allotted period. This aimed to prevent tying up funds indefinitely. The 1987 law prohibits Presidents from submitting multiple rescission proposals for the same funds if Congress does not act, preventing indefinite tying up of funds. Section 206 of P.L. 100-119 codified the New Haven case decision, allowing deferrals for contingencies or savings. The ICA no longer allows policy deferrals, and the U.S. Constitution only allows the President to sign a bill into law or veto it entirely. The item veto allows the governor to eliminate provisions in legislation. President Grant endorsed the idea in 1876 to combat the practice of attaching \"riders\" to bills. Congress has had limited action on item veto proposals, with only occasional hearings. In the 101st and 102nd Congress, proposals for an item veto were discussed, allowing the President to veto selected items in appropriations bills. The Senate Judiciary Subcommittee and House debated constitutional amendments for item veto authority. During debate on H.J.Res. 290 in 1992, the House rejected an amendment by Representative Kyl proposing an item veto authority for the President, limiting total outlays to 19% of the gross national product, and requiring a three-fifths vote of Congress for additional funds. Some argued the President already had item veto authority, with notable supporters like Stephen Glazier. The Senate Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on the Constitution held a hearing in 1994 on the subject. Some believe a statutory framework could give the President item veto authority without a constitutional amendment. Separate enrollment measures have been introduced in the Senate since 1985. The Dole amendment in the 104th Congress and H.R. 4889 in the 109th Congress reflect this approach. Impoundment reform and the idea of an item veto became increasingly linked. During the Reagan and Bush administrations, there was a push for expanded rescission authority and an item veto for the President. Clinton and George W. Bush also supported these ideas. The concept of granting item veto authority to the President via a constitutional amendment has been a topic of discussion. Efforts focused on modifying congressional review of rescissions by the President, granting expanded rescission authority. Statutory alternatives, sometimes called a \"line item veto,\" aimed to create a presumption favoring the President with enhanced rescission proposals. The intent is to permanently cancel budget authority unless Congress acts to disapprove. The President's message to cancel funding would require Congress to disapprove within a set time. An expedited rescission approach focuses on procedural changes in Congress for a prompt vote on rescission requests. Some bills combine item veto and rescission language, with features of both expedited and enhanced approaches to rescission reform. H.R. 2 in the 104th Congress (P.L. 104-130) and H.R. 2164 in the 102nd Congress aimed to reform rescission procedures. H.R. 2164 gained House approval on October 3, 1992, establishing expedited congressional consideration for rescission proposals. The measure set limits on reducing program budgets and required a congressional vote to reject proposed rescissions. Rescission reform efforts continued in the 103rd Congress. In the 103rd and 104th Congresses, there were discussions and actions taken regarding expanded rescission measures, including granting the President line-item veto authority over appropriations and tax expenditures. The House and Senate passed expedited rescission measures, and there were sense-of-the-Senate and sense-of-the-House provisions related to budget process legislation and rescission authority. These efforts were influenced by the Republican majority in the 104th Congress following the midterm elections. In the 104th Congress, discussions and actions were taken regarding expanded rescission measures, including granting the President line-item veto authority. House and Senate passed expedited rescission measures influenced by the Republican majority. In November midterm elections, Republicans gained majority in both House and Senate. Hearings began in January 1995 on legislative line item veto authority. In the 104th Congress, discussions and actions were taken regarding expanded rescission measures, including granting the President line-item veto authority. House and Senate passed expedited rescission measures influenced by the Republican majority. House floor consideration of H.R. 2 commenced on February 2, 1995, with multiple amendments pending. The House passed H.R. 2 on February 6, 1995, by a vote of 294-134. On February 14, 1995, the Senate Budget Committee ordered S. 4 reported without recommendation. On February 23, 1995, the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee held a hearing on S. 4 and S. 14, with an additional hearing day requested by some Senators who were unable to attend the previous joint hearing. On March 2, 1995, the Governmental Affairs Committee held markup, ordering both bills reported without recommendation. During markup, S. 4 and S. 14 were ordered reported without recommendation. The Pryor amendment to exempt budget authority for the operations of the Social Security Administration from expedited rescission was adopted. Senate leaders delayed consideration of legislative line item veto bills to develop a compromise measure. The \"Republican compromise\" substitute appeared as Dole Amendment No. 347 on March 20. The Dole Amendment No. 347, a compromise substitute, incorporated the separate enrollment approach for item veto authority by statutory means. Senate passed S. 4 with the Dole Amendment on March 23, 1995, by a vote of 69-29. On March 23, 1995, the Senate passed S. 4 with the Dole Amendment by a vote of 69-29. The differences between the House-passed H.R. 2 and Senate-passed S. 4 needed resolution in conference. The House later passed S. 4 on May 17, 1995, after replacing the language with that of H.R. 2. The Senate approved a Dorgan Amendment on August 1 to urge the House Speaker to appoint conferees on S. 4. The Speaker appointed House conferees on September 7, 1995. The conference committee on appropriation measures met on September 27, 1995, with Representative Clinger chosen as chairman. On October 25, 1995, the House instructed conferees to include provisions for targeted tax benefits in S. 4. House Republicans offered a compromise package on November 8, 1996, including enhanced rescission and compromise language for defining \"targeted tax.\" President Clinton urged Congress to pass the line item veto measure, negotiations stalled but picked up after the congressional recess in February. Republican negotiators reached agreement on a compromise version of S. 4 on March 14, 1996, and the conference report was filed on March 21, 1996. The Line Item Veto Act of 1996 was signed into law by President Clinton on April 9, 1996. The conference substitute, reflecting compromise between the House and Senate versions, was approved by the Senate on March 27, 1996, and by the House on March 28, 1996. The Act granted the President authority to rescind new direct spending, targeted tax benefits, and discretionary spending in appropriation laws. It was set to take effect on January 1, 1997, and expire on January 1, 2005. The Line Item Veto Act of 1996, signed by President Clinton on April 9, 1996, granted the President enhanced rescission authority to cancel certain items in appropriations, entitlement measures, and tax breaks. The act allowed the President to cancel discretionary budget authority, new direct spending, and limited tax benefits in a bill, with the cancellation taking effect upon special notification to Congress. Congress could reverse the cancellation by enacting a disapproval bill. The Line Item Veto Act of 1996 granted the President the authority to cancel certain items in appropriations, entitlement measures, and tax breaks. The President could exercise this cancellation authority if it reduced the federal budget deficit and did not harm essential government functions or the national interest. Congress had 30 days to consider disapproval bills to reverse the cancellations. The act also included a \"lockbox\" procedure to ensure that savings from cancellations went towards deficit reduction. The Line Item Veto Act of 1996 granted the President the authority to cancel certain items in appropriations, entitlement measures, and tax breaks. The act included provisions for expedited judicial review and became effective on January 1, 1997. In 1997, there were judicial challenges and the first use of the new authority by President Clinton, leading to disapproval bills in Congress to overturn cancellations. In 1998, court challenges arose against the Line Item Veto Act, leading to the Supreme Court declaring it unconstitutional. A complaint was filed challenging the law's constitutionality, but it was dismissed by a federal judge in 1996. Only those directly affected by the presidential authority or Members of Congress could bring legal action under the law. On January 2, 1997, a lawsuit was filed challenging the constitutionality of the Line Item Veto Act. Senator Robert Byrd and five other Members of Congress were plaintiffs, arguing that the act violated constitutional requirements. The defendants were Office of Management and Budget Director Franklin Raines and Secretary of the Treasury Robert Rubin. On January 22, 1997, the Senate agreed to S.Res. 21 to have the Senate Legal Counsel appear in the Byrd v. Raines case. U.S. District Court Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson ruled on April 10 that the Line Item Veto Act was unconstitutional. The Line Item Veto Act granted the President authority over legislative choices, leading to a legal challenge. The Supreme Court ruled in Raines v. Byrd that Congress lacked standing to challenge the law, allowing the Act to remain in force. The Court focused on jurisdiction, not the merits of the case. President Clinton used his new veto power for the first time by canceling provisions in two tax laws and one direct spending item. Congress had 30 days to consider disapproval bills, leading to the introduction of four bills seeking to overturn the cancellations. President Clinton vetoed provisions in tax laws and direct spending items, leading to the introduction of four bills seeking to overturn the cancellations. A compromise was reached on the tax benefit provisions, with the disapproval bill (H.R. 2444) being tabled in the House. President Clinton later vetoed items in appropriations bills on October 6, 1997. President Clinton vetoed 38 projects in the FY1998 Military Construction Appropriations Act, leading to a disapproval bill being passed by the Senate and House. The disapproval bill was cleared for the President, who vetoed it on November 13, 1997. President Clinton vetoed multiple projects in various appropriations bills, with disapproval bills being passed by Congress and enacted over his veto. President Clinton exercised his line-item veto authority multiple times in 1997, canceling a total of 82 projects across different appropriations acts. This led to the expectation of more cases being brought by parties directly affected by the cancellations. Several cases were initiated in October 1997 challenging the Line Item Veto Act, including complaints filed by the City of New York and the National Treasury Employees Union seeking to overturn cancellations affecting Medicaid funding and federal pension provision. Another case was filed by Snake River Potato Growers, Inc. to overturn the cancellation of a limited tax benefit for farm cooperatives. The case challenging the Line Item Veto Act, involving farm cooperatives, was filed by Snake River Potato Growers, Inc. The cases were combined and reassigned to Judge Thomas Hogan. NTEU filed an amended complaint challenging the cancellation authority. The Clinton Administration conceded that the cancellation of the federal pension provision exceeded the Act's authority. Judge Hogan approved a settlement in the suit between the Justice Department and NTEU. The Line Item Veto Act was found unconstitutional by Judge Hogan on February 12, 1998, due to violating procedural requirements in the United States Constitution. The President's cancellation of a pension provision was deemed invalid, leading to a three-hour hearing on January 14, 1998, with arguments presented by various parties. The Line Item Veto Act was found unconstitutional by Judge Hogan on February 12, 1998, for violating procedural requirements in the United States Constitution. The Justice Department appealed to the Supreme Court on February 20, 1998, and the case was accepted for review on February 27, 1998. Oral arguments were heard on April 27, 1998, in the case of Clinton v. New York City, where both sides agreed that a true item veto would be unconstitutional. The issue of delegation of authority to the President and violation of separation of powers were key arguments discussed. The Supreme Court decision on June 25, 1998, declared the Line Item Veto Act unconstitutional due to violations of the Constitution's presentment clause. There was uncertainty on how funding for canceled projects could be restored, with suggestions that affected parties might need to sue individually. After the Supreme Court declared the Line Item Veto Act unconstitutional, there was uncertainty on restoring funding for canceled projects. Three weeks later, the Justice Department and OMB officially announced the release of funds for remaining cancellations. Bills were introduced to repeal the Act, including H.R. 2650 and S. 1319 in the 105th Congress. Shortly after the district court decision in April 1997, expanded rescission measures were reintroduced in the 105th Congress with bills like H.R. 1321 and S. 592. Joint resolutions proposing an item veto constitutional amendment were also introduced. In the fall of 1997, H.R. 2649 combined features of repealing the line-item veto and establishing a framework for expedited rescission. Hearings on the Line Item Veto Act were held in March 1998 to consider possible alternatives. During the 105th Congress, new bills were introduced as alternatives to the Line Item Veto Act, including expedited rescission measures and separate enrollment modifications. In the 106th Congress, proposals for constitutional amendments granting line-item veto authority to the President were introduced, along with alternative statutory means. During the 105th and 106th Congress, various bills and proposals were introduced to grant expanded impoundment authority to the President, including expedited rescission measures and constitutional amendments for an item veto. Hearings were held to address the rescissions process and consider alternative statutory means for controlling spending. During the 105th and 106th Congress, bills were introduced for expanded impoundment authority for the President. In 2000, both presidential candidates supported expanded rescission authority. President George W. Bush endorsed budget process reforms in 2001, including restoring the line-item veto. The proposal was linked to retiring the national debt but was not mentioned in the detailed budget for FY2002. In 2002, Bush again endorsed budget process reforms in his FY2003 submission to Congress. The President endorsed proposals for budget process reform, including a line-item veto to decline spending on non-essential government functions. Two measures in the 107th Congress proposed an item veto constitutional amendment. The Blue Dog Coalition proposed a modified line-item veto authority during House consideration of the FY2002 budget resolution, but it was rejected. The Congressional Budget Office estimated a $157 billion federal budget deficit for FY2002 due to a drop in revenues and increased spending. This deficit situation raised interest in spending control mechanisms like the line-item veto. President Bush requested a \"constitutional line-item veto\" for spending control in his FY2004 budget submission. H.R. 180, an omnibus budget reform bill, included provisions for expedited procedures for rescinding \"wasteful spending.\" The ranking member of the Appropriations Committee discussed the demise of the Line-Item Veto. The ranking member of the Appropriations Committee discussed the introduction of constitutional amendments for a line-item veto in 2003. President Bush called for a \"constitutional line-item veto\" in his FY2005 budget submission to control spending. The proposed line-item veto would allow the President to reject specific spending or tax provisions. In the second session of the 108th Congress, budget reform measures were introduced to grant expedited rescission authority to the President, allowing him to reject new appropriations or tax benefits deemed non-essential. The budget resolution for FY2005 included provisions for government spending restraint and potential line-item veto authority for the President. A bill in the 108th Congress, H.R. 3800, included expedited rescission provisions endorsed by the Wall Street Journal. The provisions allowed Presidents to propose eliminating wasteful spending, preserving Congress's power of the purse. Amendments from H.R. 3800 were offered during House consideration of the Spending Control Act of 2004. The Kerry-Edwards plan proposed to keep spending in check, invest in priorities, and cut wasteful spending. President Bush supported restoring presidential line item veto authority, allowing the President to send back specific spending items for an expedited vote. This proposal was part of the President's efforts to reduce the deficit and maintain budget control. President Bush reiterated his request for line-item veto authority to tackle the problem of special-interest \"earmark\" projects and linked it to deficit reduction in his budget submission for FY2006. President Bush proposed a line-item veto linked to deficit reduction in 2006. He sent a draft bill to Congress titled the Legislative Line Item Veto Act of 2006, seeking to amend the Impoundment Control Act of 1974. The bill aimed to allow expedited rescission of spending or tax provisions, requiring congressional approval for permanency. The proposed bills also included provisions for the President to withhold funds or suspend spending for up to 180 days. President Bush proposed a line-item veto linked to deficit reduction in 2006, seeking to amend the Impoundment Control Act of 1974. The bill aimed to allow expedited rescission of spending or tax provisions, requiring congressional approval for permanency, including provisions for the President to withhold funds or suspend spending for up to 180 days. Hearings were held in March and April 2006 with testimonies from various representatives and officials. The Senate and House Budget Committees held hearings and markups on bills related to the line-item veto in 2006. Witnesses included Senator Robert Byrd, officials from OMB and CBO, and legal experts. The House hearings focused on perspectives on applications and effects, as well as constitutional issues. Representative Paul Ryan offered a substitute amendment during the markup of H.R. 4890. During the markup of H.R. 4890, Representative Cuellar's amendment to add a sunset provision was approved, along with an amendment by Representative Neal expressing Congress's stance on potential abuse of cancellation authority. The Ryan substitute, as amended, was adopted by voice vote, and the Committee voted 24-10 to report the bill favorably. Minority Members' amendments were mostly rejected along party lines, with Democrats seeking exemptions for Social Security, Medicare, and veterans' entitlement programs from possible cancellations under the LLIVA. On June 15, the House Rules Committee approved a substitute amendment for H.R. 4890, addressing concerns with the bill. The substitute version limits the President's ability to withhold funds to 90 calendar days, with special rescission messages required within 45 days of enactment. Democrats tried unsuccessfully to restore budget rules and strengthen earmark disclosures. The substitute version of H.R. 4890 limits the President's ability to cancel funds to 90 days, with special rescission messages required within 45 days of enactment. The definition of a targeted tax benefit was narrowed to a revenue-losing measure affecting a single beneficiary. The substitute version of H.R. 4890 limits the President's ability to cancel funds to 90 days, with special rescission messages required within 45 days of enactment. The House Rules Committee voted to report H.Res. 886 favorably for the consideration of H.R. 4890, as amended, by a nonrecord vote. A manager's amendment by Representative Paul Ryan was adopted, clarifying that cancelled amounts from trust funds would be returned to the original funds. The House passed H.R. 4890 with a vote of 247-172 after approving the rule by a vote of 228-196. A motion to recommit the bill was rejected. The Senate Budget Committee marked up S. 3521, the Stop Over Spending Act of 2006, with provisions for expedited rescission. Minority amendments to exclude certain programs from rescissions were rejected. A manager's amendment was adopted to prohibit resubmission of rejected items. The Senate Budget Committee voted 12-10 to report S. 3521 favorably, with provisions for expedited rescission. Despite White House lobbying efforts, the likelihood of further Senate action on the Legislative Line Item Veto bill in the 109th Congress was questioned. Senate Budget Chairman Judd Gregg pronounced the White House's item veto proposal dead for the year. Senate Budget Chairman Judd Gregg, R-NH, conceded that his budget overhaul package (S. 3521) has little chance of passage due to Democratic opposition and Republican reluctance in an election year. The Senate could have considered a stand-alone item veto measure, but Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, R-TN, has not made any decisions yet. H.R. 4890 (Paul Ryan)/ S. 2381 (Frist) Legislative Line Item Veto Act of 2006 allows for expedited consideration of budget rescissions and targeted tax benefit cancellations proposed by the President. The bills grant the President authority to withhold funds for rescission or suspend execution of spending and tax benefits. Reported favorably by House Budget Committee on June 16 (H.Rept. 109-505 Part 1) and by Rules Committee on June 19. S. 3521 (Gregg) Stop Over Spending Act of 2006 is an omnibus budget reform bill that includes the Legislative Line Item Veto Act amending the ICA of 1974. Introduced on June 15, 2006, the bill was reported favorably by the Budget Committee on June 20, 2006. Senator Judd Gregg later introduced \"The Second Look at Wasteful Spending Act of 2007\" as an amendment to the Legislative Transparency and Accountability Act of the 110th Congress. S.Amdt. 17 to S.Amdt. 3 to S. 1, part of the Legislative Transparency and Accountability Act of 2007, proposed a legislative line item veto amendment supported by the Bush Administration. It allowed for expedited consideration of certain spending rescissions or tax benefit cancellations by the President. Up to four rescission packages could be submitted annually. The Legislative Transparency and Accountability Act of 2007 included a line item veto amendment allowing the President to withhold funding for up to 45 days. Despite initial concerns, S. 1 passed by a vote of 96-2, with further debate on the amendment to follow. Senator Gregg highlighted a key change in S.Amdt. 101, which now includes the right to strike items from a rescission package proposed by the President. This aligns the amendment more closely with the Daschle substitute in 1995. Senator Conrad pointed out differences between the Gregg and Daschle amendments, particularly regarding the inclusion of new direct spending items like Medicare in the Gregg proposal. The Gregg amendment allowed the President to propose rescissions from multiple bills in one package, while the Daschle amendment required one bill per package. A vote on the line item veto amendment failed to reach the necessary 60 votes, leading to its withdrawal. President Bush called for a line item veto mechanism in his FY2008 budget submission. Expedited rescission bills were introduced in the House in the 110th Congress. Representative Paul Ryan introduced H.R. 689, the Legislative Line Item Veto Act of 2007, with 83 cosponsors. Companion bills were introduced by Senator Russell Feingold. Senator Feingold highlighted the uniqueness of the measure targeting specific items. Ryan and I propose a unique bill targeting congressional earmarks for expedited rescission authority, different from previous bills in the 109th Congress. The focus is on cancelling \"congressional earmarks\" defined in the bill, rather than allowing rescission of discretionary spending in appropriations acts. The bill also includes provisions for the cancellation of limited tax benefits. The cancellation of limited tax benefits in H.R. 1998 / S. 1186 included provisions similar to bills from the 109th Congress, such as expedited rescission authority and language regarding the relationship with the ICA. The bills also addressed seriatim rescissions and abuse of the proposed cancellation authority. The expedited congressional procedures in the 109th and 110th Congress bills regarding seriatim rescissions and abuse of cancellation authority were similar. H.R. 1998 / S. 1186 set a 30-day deadline for special rescission messages, compared to 45 days in the 109th Congress. S. 1186 limited special messages to one per act, except for certain cases. The President's ability to defer spending in S. 1186 was less restrictive compared to previous versions in the 109th Congress. S. 1186 allowed withholding for 45 calendar days and permitted the extension of withholding for another 45-day period with a supplemental message. The President can also withhold funds in a rescission request for 45 calendar days, which often equals 60 or more calendar days. The President's ability to defer spending in H.R. 1998 / S. 1186 was less restrictive compared to previous versions. The original bill allowed withholding funds for 180 calendar days, but the current bill extends this period to over 100 days. This extension could be seen as a return to policy deferrals, with two constitutional amendment proposals introduced in the 110th Congress. Two constitutional amendment proposals were introduced in the 110th Congress. H.J.Res. 38 would have allowed the President to decline approval of certain budget items, similar to the Line Item Veto Act of 1996. S.J.Res. 27 would have allowed the President to modify appropriations in legislation before signing it into law. H.R. 595 and H.R. 689 were also introduced to amend the ICA for expedited consideration of presidential proposals for rescission of budget authority. H.R. 689 (Paul Ryan et al.) Legislative Line Item Veto Act of 2007 amends the ICA of 1974 for expedited consideration of certain rescissions of discretionary budget authority or cancellation of targeted tax benefits proposed by the President. Savings are dedicated to deficit reduction or surplus increase. Introduced on January 24, 2007; jointly referred to Committees on Budget and on Rules. H.R. 1375 (Buchanan) Earmark Accountability and Reform Act of 2007 also amends the ICA for expedited consideration of certain rescissions of discretionary budget authority or cancellation of targeted tax benefits proposed by the President. Savings are dedicated to deficit reduction or surplus increase. Amends House Rules to address earmarks not contained in passed versions. The Congressional Accountability and Line-Item Veto Act introduced by Paul Ryan allows the President to propose the repeal of congressional earmarks or targeted tax benefits. Savings from these actions are dedicated to deficit reduction or surplus increase. The Family Budget Protection Act introduced by Hensarling establishes expedited procedures for congressional consideration of rescission proposals from the President. The Congressional Accountability and Line-Item Veto Act introduced by Paul Ryan and the Family Budget Protection Act introduced by Hensarling aim to give the President the power to propose the repeal of congressional earmarks or targeted tax benefits and establish expedited procedures for congressional consideration of rescission proposals. S.J.Res. 27 (Dole) is a constitutional amendment that allows the President to reduce or disapprove any appropriation in a bill. It was introduced on December 11, 2007, and referred to the Judiciary Committee. The Congressional Accountability and Line-Item Veto Act was reintroduced in the 111th Congress on March 4, 2009. Senator Gregg and Senator Lieberman introduced S. 640, the Second Look at Wasteful Spending Act of 2009, on March 19, 2009. S. 640, introduced by Senator Gregg and Senator Lieberman, includes provisions not found in S. 3521 from the 109th Congress. Senator Carper introduced S. 907, similar to a bill he introduced in the 102nd Congress, which received favorable floor action in the House. The Senate Subcommittee held hearings on expedited rescission authority bills, with witnesses including Senator Feingold and staff from various organizations. President Obama supported an expedited process for rescission requests in his budget submissions for FY2010 and FY2011. President Obama endorsed an expedited process for considering rescission requests in FY2010 and FY2011. This process would allow for a rapid, up-or-down vote on a package of rescission proposals to reduce or eliminate funding for budget accounts, programs, projects, or activities. The Reduce Unnecessary Spending Act of 2010 proposed expedited rescission procedures for certain requests from the President, allowing for the submission of a package of rescissions within 45 days after signing a bill into law. The Reduce Unnecessary Spending Act of 2010 proposed expedited rescission procedures for certain requests from the President, allowing for a rapid, up-or-down vote on a package of rescission proposals to reduce or eliminate funding for budget accounts, programs, projects, or activities. The proposed rescissions would be subject to expedited procedures in Congress to ensure a vote on the package. The Administration's Proposal for Expedited Rescission was discussed in a hearing where Dr. Liebman from OMB called for prompt action by Congress to pass the Reducing Unnecessary Spending Act. Chairman Spratt indicated that the bill would receive careful scrutiny by the committee, with H.R. 1294 proposing expedited procedures for congressional consideration of the President's rescission proposals. The Earmark Accountability and Reform Act of 2009, introduced on March 4, 2009, aims to expedite the consideration of rescissions of discretionary budget authority or cancellations of spending proposed by the President. It dedicates any savings to deficit reduction or surplus increase. The Earmark Transparency and Accountability Reform Act, introduced on March 9, 2009, authorizes the President to propose earmark rescissions. The Spending, Deficit, and Debt Control Act of 2009, introduced on July 20, 2009, amends the ICA of 1974 to authorize the President to propose the repeal of congressional earmarks or cancellation of limited tariff or targeted tax benefits. It provides expedited procedures for congressional consideration of these proposals and dedicates any savings to deficit reduction or surplus increase. Temporary presidential authority is granted to withhold earmarks and suspend tariff or tax benefits, with the Comptroller General tasked with auditing and reporting on funded programs annually. The Legislative Line-Item Veto Act of 2009, part of the Spending, Deficit, and Debt Control Act of 2009, allows the President to propose canceling discretionary spending, direct spending, or targeted tax benefits. It includes expedited procedures for Congress to consider these proposals and mandates that any savings be used for deficit reduction or surplus increase. The President is also authorized to temporarily withhold budget authority or suspend spending, tariffs, or tax benefits.
