Economic disparity fuels illegal immigration, despite federal laws prohibiting it. Illegal immigrants often find work in the US, undermining lawful immigration and impacting American job opportunities. Employers in the US struggle to verify identity documents of potential employees for work eligibility. Pilot programs show a nationwide verification system is feasible. Social Security cards are commonly used but are susceptible to fraud. Improved Social Security cards could best determine employment eligibility without becoming a national ID card. Amendments to the Social Security Act aim to improve identification of individuals for employment eligibility without creating a national ID card. Amendments to the Social Security Act include adding an encrypted electronic identification strip to Social Security cards for improved employment eligibility verification. The strip will be unique to each individual and developed in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security. The Commissioner will issue Social Security cards with a recent photograph to individuals who meet certain criteria, including having a Social Security number and reaching the minimum age for employment. Ongoing efforts will be made to enhance the security of the cards. The Commissioner of Social Security will share information with the Secretary of Homeland Security upon issuing a Social Security account number or card to individuals, as required by the Illegal Immigration Enforcement and Social Security Protection Act of 2004. This information will be used for the Employment Eligibility Database.
