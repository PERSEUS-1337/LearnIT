    "content": "The Government Accountability Office (GAO) has identified 15 federal agencies overseeing 30 food safety laws. The FDA and FSIS have the majority of funding and staffing for food regulation. FDA is responsible for most human and animal foods, while FSIS handles meat, poultry, catfish, and some egg products. FDA-regulated foods make up 80% of U.S. at-home food spending. States also play a significant role in food safety activities. The 111th Congress is considering legislation to revise the U.S. food safety system, focusing on laws administered by the FDA. Both the House and Senate have introduced bills addressing issues with the current system. The House passed H.R. 2749, the Food Safety Enhancement Act of 2009, while the Senate Committee reported S. 510, the FDA Food Safety Modernization Act. Both bills aim to expand registration requirements for food facilities, implement food safety plans based on risk assessments, and conduct periodic safety inspections. The House and Senate food safety bills aim to enhance FDA regulations by conducting safety inspections, accessing industry records, and mandating recalls of unsafe products. They also set new standards for produce safety and scrutinize imported foods to reduce foodborne illness in the United States. The complexity of the food distribution system poses challenges in ensuring food safety, with processed foods potentially containing contaminated ingredients that can affect multiple products for humans and animals. The report discusses monitoring foodborne illnesses, serious FDA-regulated food recalls, and recent nationwide outbreaks like Salmonella in peanut products, melamine in pet foods and dairy products, and E. coli in spinach. It also addresses associated policy issues and pending food safety legislation before the 111th Congress. Selected authorities in the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) are provided. The report focuses on FDA's authorities and approaches to ensure food safety, with a discussion on monitoring and investigating foodborne illnesses. Surveillance tracks trends in bacterial and parasitic illnesses, while genetic \"fingerprinting\" identifies common sources of infections, aiding in outbreak investigations. These tools help understand the burden of foodborne illness in the United States. The tools discussed shed light on the burden of foodborne illness in the United States and ways to decrease it. However, they have significant shortcomings as they monitor a limited number of known food safety threats and often detect the contaminant rather than the contaminated food type. Key federal foodborne illness monitoring systems are FoodNet, surveillance of outbreaks, and PulseNet genetic \"fingerprinting\" of pathogens. In 1999, the CDC estimated that 76 million people in the US get sick from foodborne illnesses annually, with 325,000 hospitalized and 5,000 deaths. Many cases go unreported, and some pathogens can also be transmitted through water or person-to-person contact. The CDC estimated in 1999 that 76 million people in the US get sick from foodborne illnesses annually, with 325,000 hospitalized and 5,000 deaths. Some foodborne illnesses are caused by unidentified pathogens. Surveillance systems track cases by their etiology, but identifying the specific food source of contamination is more challenging. Foodborne illness surveillance systems track cases of human Salmonella infection, attributing infections to various possible vehicles like poultry, eggs, produce, and dairy products. Identifying the specific practice causing contamination remains a challenge, making it difficult to implicate a food vehicle or practice. Regulators focus on food safety rather than etiologies, creating a gap in reducing foodborne illness burden in the US. Important monitoring systems include FoodNet active surveillance and passive surveillance of certain pathogens. FoodNet active surveillance system, in partnership with CDC, FDA, USDA, and 10 states, monitors laboratory-confirmed infections caused by bacteria and parasites in 10 states. It does not capture non-laboratory-confirmed foodborne illnesses. The FoodNet system monitors laboratory-confirmed infections caused by bacteria and parasites in 10 states, but it does not provide information on the overall burden of foodborne illness in the United States or the specific food vehicles that caused reported illnesses. However, it can track trends in the incidence of foodborne illness and indicate whether the problem is improving or worsening over time. The FoodNet system tracks trends in foodborne illnesses caused by bacteria and parasites in 10 states. CDC reported that some illnesses reached a plateau in 2008, not meeting national health targets. Salmonella infections are farthest from the target, requiring new prevention approaches. CDC also mentioned efforts to reduce Salmonella contamination in poultry. The CDC partners with FDA, USDA, and state officials to track foodborne disease outbreaks, which can affect a small group or thousands of people. Unlike FoodNet, outbreak reporting may not always identify the cause of illness. Salmonella contamination in poultry is a focus for prevention efforts. Outbreak data may not always identify the cause of illness, as many outbreaks go unreported. This limits the information on the overall burden of foodborne illness. However, investigating outbreaks can provide attribution information not captured by FoodNet. The food safety advocacy group maintains a database of foodborne outbreaks in the United States, identifying 5,778 outbreaks linked to specific foods between 1990 and 2006. Outbreak investigations help attribute them to specific foods and handling practices, highlighting challenges with multi-ingredient foods. The food safety advocacy group's database captures passive reports of foodborne outbreaks based on symptoms, with outbreaks varying in size from small social gatherings to large commercial products consumed by thousands. FBDO data may be most useful qualitatively, but may not support quantitative conclusions. Technologies have revolutionized the ability to identify large outbreaks with a common bacterial etiology. The PulseNet program, coordinated by CDC, links state and local health departments and federal agencies to identify bacterial outbreaks quickly. While PulseNet can speed up outbreak detection, attributing the responsible food vehicle(s) remains challenging. Epidemiologists often rely on time-consuming patient interviews, which may be imperfect due to long incubation periods and unavailable foods for testing. The FDA faces challenges in attributing illnesses to specific food sources due to limited information on common contaminants and the lack of authority to order recalls. The agency relies on voluntary recalls by food companies, with some instances of non-cooperation identified by the U.S. Government Accountability Office. FDA states that company recalls are generally the most effective measure. The FDA has legal enforcement tools to address non-cooperation in recalls, including the power to seize products. Recalls are categorized into three classes based on the severity of health consequences. Class I recalls are the most serious, involving a high risk of serious health issues or death. Class II recalls involve situations where a violative product may cause temporary or reversible adverse health consequences. Class III recalls involve situations where a violative product is unlikely to cause adverse health consequences. The FDA compiles recall information through a listing of major recalls in reverse chronological order, primarily consisting of Class I recalls. Each item on the list is linked to a press release with details on the product, reason for the recall, and geographical extent. The FDA provides online archives for recalls dating back to 2004, including weekly enforcement reports with information on Class I, II, and III recalls. Recalls can raise concerns about food safety and the effectiveness of federal food safety programs, but the usefulness of FDA recall data in measuring foodborne illness burden is unclear. The FDA provides online archives for recalls dating back to 2004, including weekly enforcement reports with information on Class I, II, and III recalls. Recalls can raise concerns about food safety and the effectiveness of federal food safety programs. Care should be taken when using recall data to evaluate food safety efforts. The total number of Class I and Class II recalls of FDA-regulated foods for FY2005 through FY2009 is presented in Table 1. The FDA and FSIS do not have mandatory recall authority and rely on voluntary recalls by private firms. In FY2009, there was a spike in recalls due to major food safety incidents, including a Salmonella outbreak linked to contaminated peanut ingredients from Peanut Corporation of America. In FY2009, a Salmonella outbreak linked to contaminated peanut ingredients from Peanut Corporation of America led to numerous recalls across various product categories like bakery products, nuts, snack foods, chocolate, ice cream, and candy. Another incident involving Salmonella contamination of pistachio nuts from a single supplier also resulted in over 100 recalls. Multiple recalls from a common problem source were not uncommon during this time. During FY2005-2009, recalls in the U.S. food system were often linked to a single source due to suppliers providing products to multiple processors and distributors. Nine food product types accounted for 75% of all recalls, with bakery products being the leading category at 13.4%, followed by multiple food dinners at 10.3%. Other leading categories included snack foods, chocolate products, fishery, and seafood products. The top nine categories of food recalls in the U.S. included bakery products, multiple food dinners, snack foods, chocolate products, fishery and seafood products, nuts and edible seeds, fruit and fruit products, vitamins, minerals, proteins, and unconventional dietary items, and vegetables and vegetable products. Three recalls involving FDA-regulated foods are discussed in relation to pending food safety legislation. The report provides descriptions of selected current authorities in the FFDCA. One of the largest food recalls in U.S. history began on January 11, 2009, when King Nut Companies announced a recall of peanut butter due to Salmonella contamination. The recall extended to all PCA peanuts and peanut products, involving over 200 companies and approximately 475 recalls. The PCA-related recalls grew to about 475, affecting over 200 companies and 3,900 food products. The recalls were linked to a Salmonella outbreak with 714 confirmed cases in 46 states, leading to nine deaths. The outbreak began in September 2008 and continued for months due to consumers unknowingly consuming recalled products. The CDC identified the outbreak in November 2008 after noticing a cluster of Salmonella infections. In late 2008, a multistate Salmonella outbreak was identified, leading to 714 confirmed cases in 46 states and nine deaths. The outbreak was linked to peanut butter produced by PCA in Georgia. Initial suspicions pointed to chicken, but a national study in January 2009 found the outbreak strain in King Nut peanut butter. In mid-January 2009, a link was found between Salmonella infections and Austin and Keebler brand peanut butter crackers made with peanut paste from PCA. FDA investigated the PCA facility in Blakely, GA from January 9 to 27, 2009, discovering multiple instances of distributing products despite positive Salmonella tests in 2007 and 2008. The FDA found positive Salmonella tests in products from the PCA facility. The company resubmitted samples to obtain negative results. Issues in food safety legislation include registration requirements for food facilities and FDA's authority to deem food adulterated or misbranded. Both H.R. 2749 and S. 510 aim to expand federal facility registration requirements, with H.R. 2749 proposing annual registration renewal and registration fees, while S. 510 suggests biennial registration renewal without fees. The FDA discovered additional unregistered facilities producing peanut products during its investigation of PCA, highlighting the need for stricter registration regulations. Both H.R. 2749 and S. 510 propose expanding federal facility registration requirements, with H.R. 2749 suggesting annual registration renewal with fees and S. 510 proposing biennial renewal without fees. The FDA can suspend a facility's registration under both bills, with consequences for unregistered facilities producing food products. The PulseNet system quickly identified a Salmonella outbreak, but it took two months of investigation to identify the food source. FDA previously did not consider peanut products at high risk of bacterial contamination. Food safety officials lack good information about hazards in FDA-regulated foods, leading to delays in outbreak investigations and false attributions. Misidentified commodities can have substantial economic consequences for producers, and the public may unnecessarily implicate a product type. (In the case of the peanut products recall, makers) The FDA lacks good information about hazards in FDA-regulated foods, leading to delays in outbreak investigations and false attributions. The public may unnecessarily implicate a product type, causing economic consequences for producers. H.R. 2749 and S. 510 aim to improve foodborne illness surveillance and outbreak investigation. The FDA Amendments Act of 2007 added reporting requirements for food safety problems. The FDA Amendments Act of 2007 added reporting requirements for food safety problems, including the provision for reporting \"reportable food\" within 24 hours to the FDA. The Reportable Food Registry was implemented in September 2009, after the PCA outbreak, raising questions about legal requirements for reporting food safety issues. The FDA Amendments Act of 2007 introduced reporting requirements for food safety issues, including reporting \"reportable food\" to the FDA within 24 hours. H.R. 2749 proposes amendments to the Reportable Food Registry, mandating companies to report test results on food products and facilities to the HHS Secretary. It also expands reporting requirements to include high-risk facilities and farms producing food for interstate commerce, restaurants, retailers, and others. S. 510 would not amend current law regarding reporting requirements for food facilities under the FFDCA. FDA can require records from food facilities to trace sources and recipients, enabling inspections if there is a belief of adulterated food. Some argue this limited authority allowed PCA to hide issues from regulators. The ability to access records quickly during investigations is crucial for determining the cause of food safety issues. H.R. 2749 and S. 510 aim to expand the HHS Secretary's access to facility records and trace products during foodborne illness outbreaks. Balancing access to records with industry costs and privacy concerns is important. S. 510 would allow the Secretary routine access to records without needing a food safety problem trigger. The threshold for access would be lowered, and similar products linked to outbreaks could also be inspected. FDA is not required to inspect food facilities under the FFDCA. The Blakely, GA, PCA plant had never been inspected by FDA. The HHS Inspector General reported that FDA inspects less than a quarter of food facilities each year, with 56% going five or more years without inspection. The effectiveness of inspections in deterring unsafe conditions, which facilities need greater scrutiny, and the funding needed for inspection frequency are key issues addressed in H.R. 2749 and S. 510 to amend FDA's authority on food facility inspections. The bills H.R. 2749 and S. 510 propose different frequencies for FDA inspections of food facilities. H.R. 2749 suggests inspections every 6 to 12 months for high-risk facilities, while S. 510 recommends annual inspections. FDA relies on states for inspections due to resource limitations. Inspections by FDA might have prevented the unsafe peanut products outbreak at PCA. The CEO of the Kellogg Company mentioned in 2009 that food companies use third-party auditors for safety inspections. Kellogg received a high safety rating from AIB International and certificates from private labs stating their products were Salmonella-free. H.R. 2749 and S. 510 aim to set standards for accrediting auditors and require third-party certification for certain entities. The FDA-regulated facilities are not required to have hazard prevention plans like USDA-inspected meat and poultry establishments. Proponents argue that having records documenting adherence to a hazard prevention plan would provide a better understanding of routine conditions during inspections. Both H.R. 2749 and S. 510 would mandate facilities to develop hazard prevention plans, with FDA setting safety standards and allowing modifications for small businesses. In 2007, Menu Foods alerted FDA about pet deaths from tainted food, leading to a widespread recall of over 150 pet food brands due to contamination with melamine and cyanuric acid. In an investigation, FDA found melamine and cyanuric acid in pet food samples. Cornell University scientists found melamine in deceased cats' urine and kidneys from Menu Foods taste trials. Melamine-tainted ingredients were also found in hog, chicken, and fish feed. Some animals fed contaminated feed were processed into human food, posing a low health risk. Melamine is not approved for use in animal or human food in the US and can cause kidney stones and failure if ingested. The FDA traced melamine in pet food to products from China, leading to kidney failure in many animals. Two Chinese nationals and a U.S. company were indicted for importing contaminated products. In 2008, melamine was found in Chinese-sourced human foods, prompting an import alert for milk products from China due to contamination concerns. In 2008, thousands were sickened and hospitalized, with four deaths linked to tainted infant formula containing melamine in China. The melamine was added to bulk milk to boost protein content, leading to contamination in pet foods and animal feed. Import alerts were issued for Chinese milk products, requiring third-party testing for melamine or cyanuric acid. Exemptions could be granted with proof of safety controls. In 2008, contaminated milk components were used in various foods in China, leading to global contamination of milk-derived products with melamine or cyanuric acid. Several countries detected contamination, including the United States. The FDA confirmed no threat to infant formulas meeting safety standards. The FDA confirmed no known threat of contamination in infant formulas meeting safety standards in the United States, despite China exporting dairy proteins at low levels. The melamine contamination incidents raised food safety legislative issues. The melamine incident highlighted the presence of contaminated ingredients in both animal and human foods. Melamine in animal feed transferred to human foods, such as eggs in China, and was even added directly to milk for infant formula. The FDA is responsible for regulating both human and animal foods under the FFDCA. The FDA's authority over animal food and feeds would not be reduced under pending food safety bills. The contaminated pet food incident revealed delays in reporting foodborne illnesses in animals, leading to the establishment of reporting requirements in the FDA Amendments Act of 2007. The FDA Amendments Act of 2007 established reporting requirements for food safety incidents, which were not in effect during the pet food incident. The requirements define a reportable food as one that poses a reasonable probability of causing serious health consequences or death to humans or animals. This would have obligated companies like Menu Foods to report the issue, regardless of it involving pet food. The FDA's reporting requirement for food safety aligns with the definition of \"food\" in the FFDCA and addresses the need for recalls, as highlighted by the melamine incidents. The FDA's lack of authority to order recalls led to challenges in removing contaminated pet food from the market, with recommendations made to establish mandatory industry recall requirements. The OIG recommended establishing mandatory industry recall requirements, including a written strategy, effectiveness checks, and status reports. H.R. 2749 and S. 510 would grant the FDA authority to mandate recalls for food safety issues, with different approaches outlined in the bills. The challenges of ensuring the safety of imported foods, like wheat gluten with melamine, highlight the need for stricter regulations. The United States imports almost all of its food supply, with FDA inspecting only about 1% of all food imports. H.R. 2749 and S. 510 aim to enhance FDA's authority on imported foods by implementing good importer practices, third party certification for high-risk imports, and agreements with foreign countries to meet U.S. safety standards. In September 2006, CDC identified a foodborne illness outbreak linked to E. coli O157:H7 infection, with over 200 confirmed cases, 3 deaths, and more than 100 hospitalizations. Fresh spinach was identified as a possible source of infection. In September 2006, FDA issued a nationwide alert advising consumers to avoid eating packaged fresh spinach due to an E. coli outbreak. The illnesses were linked to Dole brand baby spinach processed by Natural Selection Foods in California. A national recall was initiated for all products containing spinach with specific \"best if used by\" dates. The outbreak E. coli strain was identified in a bag of Dole baby spinach a week later. Investigators found E. coli O157:H7 in four farm fields in Monterey and San Benito Counties, CA, with the outbreak strain only present in one field. The outbreak strain was found in river water, cattle feces, and wild pig feces near the spinach field, which was part of a ranch primarily used for cattle grazing. The E. coli O157:H7 outbreak linked to contaminated fresh spinach raised concerns about food safety legislation. The outbreak highlighted the challenges of identifying and containing widespread outbreaks, emphasizing the importance of public health networks and collaboration among different agencies. The investigation into the E. coli O157:H7 outbreak linked to contaminated fresh spinach showcased the importance of collaboration among local, state, and federal officials in responding to outbreaks. It emphasized the need for a robust public health system for rapid and accurate analysis to prevent further illness and death. Legislation like H.R. 2749 and S. 510 aim to improve foodborne illness surveillance, outbreak investigation, information sharing, and coordination among public health officials. Almost all food safety experts agree on the need to focus resources on high-risk products and operations based on authoritative information and sound science. Outbreaks associated with fresh produce consumption have become more common in recent years, with spinach being a source of E. coli O157:H7 outbreaks in 2006. Before the 2006 incident, E. coli O157:H7 outbreaks were not linked to spinach, but other leafy greens, particularly from California, were implicated in several outbreaks. Consumers are now buying more pre-washed and packaged fresh produce, which is often mass-produced in centralized locations and distributed nationally, increasing the risk of contamination spreading across the country. Assessments of food safety hazards must continually evolve, as seen in provisions of H.R. 2749 and S. 510 that require the review of health and epidemiologic data every two years. The HHS Secretary would review health and epidemiologic data every two years to identify significant foodborne contaminants and use this information to issue standards, guidance, and regulations. Bills like H.R. 2749 emphasize the need to assess relative risks before setting standards for safe produce, certifications for imported foods, and inspection frequencies for food facilities. Produce-related outbreaks are a growing concern, prompting calls for improved food safety measures. Produce-related outbreaks are a growing challenge, leading to calls for more stringent FDA standards for on-farm production. Some oppose mandatory standards, preferring voluntary approaches like FDA guidance documents and industry self-imposed standards. The USDA's Agricultural Marketing Service has voluntary testing and process verification programs funded by industry user fees. The USDA's Agricultural Marketing Service offers voluntary testing and process verification programs funded by industry user fees. These programs use independent audits to help producers certify products, not for regulatory purposes but to facilitate commercial agreements and provide consumers with more information. AMS recently proposed a marketing agreement for leafy green vegetables. Some argue that producers should not take on new responsibilities until more is known about effective interventions, while others believe enough is known to address basic practices like worker sanitation. The contamination of spinach leading to a nationwide outbreak was never definitively determined. Research should focus on tracing pathways connecting leafy green vegetable fields with potential animal reservoirs of disease-causing microbes. H.R. 2749 and S. 510 would require the FDA to develop safety standards for raw fruits and vegetables to reduce the risk of serious illness or death. The FFDCA has various definitions of adulteration depending on the product. Adulteration in food is defined by FFDCA \u00a7 402(a) as the presence of harmful substances that may be injurious to health. This includes added poisonous or deleterious substances that are unsafe. The curr_chunk discusses the various reasons why a food product may be considered adulterated, including the presence of unsafe pesticide residues, food additives, or new animal drugs, as well as being prepared under unsanitary conditions or being the product of a diseased animal. It also mentions that containers made of poisonous substances or food intentionally subjected to radiation can render the contents injurious to health. The Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act prohibits the introduction of adulterated food into commerce, defining adulteration as including unsafe pesticide residues, food additives, unsanitary conditions, and intentional radiation. The Act also defines a food facility as any establishment involved in the manufacturing, processing, packing, or holding of food, excluding farms, restaurants, and retail food establishments. The Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act defines a food facility as any establishment involved in the manufacturing, processing, packing, or holding of food, excluding farms, restaurants, and retail food establishments. FFDCA \u00a7 415 requires registration of facilities engaged in these activities for food consumed in the United States. Food is defined as articles used for food. The Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act defines food as articles used for food or drink for man or other animals. Misbranding of food is prohibited under FFDCA, with specific conditions outlined in the law. Introducing misbranded food into commerce or misbranding food already in commerce is also prohibited. Misbranded food in commerce is prohibited under the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The Act defines \"person\" to include individuals, partnerships, corporations, and associations. Prohibited acts include introducing adulterated or misbranded food into commerce, adulterating or misbranding food already in commerce, and receiving or delivering adulterated or misbranded food. Violators may face civil or criminal penalties, including imprisonment and fines. The FFDCA imposes sanctions under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3559 and 3571, with additional penalties for drugs or devices. Exceptions may apply, such as for misbranding of foods."
