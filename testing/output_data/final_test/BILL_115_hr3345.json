The taxpayer may elect to apply special rules for the first 2 taxable years for which expenses in carrying on a trade or business are deductible. Controlled groups are treated as one entity, and no double benefit is allowed for property eligible for a credit under this section. The basis of property is reduced by the credit amount. A clerical amendment is made to the table of sections. Section 45S introduces the veteran small business start-up credit as part of the general business credit. The Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration will evaluate the program every fourth year to assess its success and accountability. The amendments made by this section apply to taxable years beginning after the enactment of this Act."
