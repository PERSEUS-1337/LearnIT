    "content": "The State of California enacts the following. The State of California enacts Article 1 on Diabetes, stating that the incidence of diabetes is rapidly increasing in the state, with one in seven adults affected. California has the highest number of new diabetes cases in the US, with a 32% increase in diabetes incidence over the past decade. Over 11.4 million Californians have prediabetes, indicating a rising trend in diabetes diagnoses. The prevalence of diagnosed gestational diabetes in California has increased significantly, reaching 5.3% of hospital deliveries in 2005. The fiscal impact of diabetes in California was over $35.9 billion in 2010. The prevalence of type 2 diabetes is higher among Black, Hispanic, and Asian Californians compared to the general population. Black and Hispanic individuals have double the incidence of diabetes compared to non-Hispanic Whites. Asians and Pacific Islanders also have higher rates of diabetes, with certain subgroups like Filipinos, South Asians, and Pacific Islanders experiencing even higher prevalence. Additionally, a study found that the rate of diagnosed diabetes in a state's Medicaid population is nearly double that of the general population. There is no cure for diabetes, but it can be prevented or delayed through lifestyle changes and medical intervention. Untreated diabetes can lead to serious complications and a reduced lifespan, but many of these can be avoided with timely diagnosis and improved self-care. The State Department of Public Health is required to provide information to the Legislature on diabetes prevention and management activities and expenditures. A report must be submitted by January 1, 2019, including recommendations from sources such as the University of California and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Starting July 1, 2017, the department must annually publish related information on its website. The State Department of Public Health must report on funding and expenditures for diabetes prevention and management programs. The reporting requirement will end on January 1, 2024, and the report must comply with Section 9795 of the Government Code."
