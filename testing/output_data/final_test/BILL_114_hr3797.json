    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Satisfying Energy Needs and Saving the Environment Act\" or the \"SENSE Act.\" Standards for coal refuse power plants are outlined. The \"SENSE Act\" defines key terms such as Administrator, boiler operating day, coal refuse, and coal refuse electric utility steam generating unit. The \"SENSE Act\" defines a coal refuse-fired facility as a unit using fluidized bed combustion technology to convert coal refuse into energy, with coal refuse making up at least 75% of the fuel consumed. The facility must be located on contiguous properties, fall under the same industrial classification, and be under the control of the same entity. The \"SENSE Act\" defines a coal refuse-fired facility as a unit using fluidized bed combustion technology to convert coal refuse into energy, with coal refuse making up at least 75% of the fuel consumed. The facility must be located on contiguous properties, fall under the same industrial classification, and be under the control of the same entity. The Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR) addresses interstate air pollution transport in parts 51, 52, and 97 of title 40, CFR, including electric utility steam generating units. The \"SENSE Act\" defines a coal refuse-fired facility as a unit using fluidized bed combustion technology to convert coal refuse into energy. CSAPR applies to coal refuse electric utility steam generating units combusting bituminous coal refuse, subject to sulfur dioxide allowance surrender provisions. Phase I refers to the initial compliance period under CSAPR for the 2015 and 2016 annual compliance periods. The Administrator shall ensure that sulfur dioxide allowances for coal refuse electric utility steam generating units are equivalent to Phase I allocations. Rules for allowance allocations will be established. For compliance periods starting on or after January 1, 2017, sulfur dioxide allowances allocated to coal refuse electric utility steam generating units cannot be transferred to other sources outside the same facility, but can be transferred within the same coal refuse-fired facility. For compliance periods starting on or after January 1, 2017, sulfur dioxide allowances allocated to coal refuse electric utility steam generating units cannot be transferred to other sources outside the same facility, but can be transferred within the same coal refuse-fired facility. The allowances may be banked for future compliance obligations under CSAPR and must be surrendered upon permanent cessation of operation of the unit. The Administrator cannot increase the total budget of sulfur dioxide allowance allocations for a State where such a unit is located. Compliance periods from 2017 to 2020 are specified. For compliance periods starting on or after January 1, 2017, the Administrator will reduce sulfur dioxide allowance allocations for units in states with specific criteria, such as ceasing operation or converting to natural gas. This applies to periods from 2017 to 2020 under CSAPR. The Administrator will reduce sulfur dioxide allowances under CSAPR for compliance periods starting on or after January 1, 2017. Operators of coal refuse electric utility steam generating units can choose to comply with either hydrogen chloride or sulfur dioxide emissions standards under the Clean Air Act. The Administrator will reduce sulfur dioxide allowances under CSAPR for compliance periods starting on or after January 1, 2017. Operators of coal refuse electric utility steam generating units can choose to comply with either hydrogen chloride or sulfur dioxide emissions standards under the Clean Air Act. The Administrator shall require compliance with one emission standard for hydrogen chloride emissions, not more stringent than 0.002 pounds per million British thermal units of heat input. The emission standards for hydrogen chloride and sulfur dioxide from coal refuse electric utility steam generating units are specified. The standards are set at 0.02 pounds per megawatt-hour for hydrogen chloride and 0.20 pounds per million British thermal units of heat input for sulfur dioxide. An emission standard for sulfur dioxide emissions from coal refuse electric utility steam generating units is set at capturing and controlling 93 percent of sulfur dioxide, comparing expected and actual emissions measured by a monitoring system. The emission standard for sulfur dioxide emissions from coal refuse electric utility steam generating units is measured as a 30 boiler operating day rolling average per unit or group of units at a single facility. The House of Representatives passed the bill on March 15, 2016. Karen L. Haas attested to it as the Clerk."
