    "content": "The President enacted H.R. 2638, the Consolidated Security, Disaster Assistance, and Continuing Appropriations Act, 2009, which included the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Act, 2009, as Division E on September 30 as P.L. 110-329. Representative David R. Obey introduced H.R. 1, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, which supplemented military construction and veterans affairs appropriations. The bill was signed on February 17 to become P.L. 111-5, providing $4.3 billion in economic stimulus funding. The FY2009 appropriations bill, inserted as an amendment to H.R. 2638, was passed without committee conferences. The authorization bill also passed without conference, using the \"ping pong\" procedure before being cleared for the White House. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) added funding to military construction and veterans affairs accounts. Representative David R. Obey introduced the bill on January 26, 2009, and it was considered on the floor on January 27. The House passed H.R. 1 on January 27 by a vote of 244-188. The Senate received the bill on January 29 and passed it on February 10 by a vote of 61-37. The House disagreed with the Senate's amendment and agreed to a conference on February 10. The Conference Committee filed its report on H.R. 1 on February 12. The House and Senate agreed to the conference report on February 13. The bill was presented to the President on February 16, 2009, and signed the next day to become P.L. 111-5. Title X of Division A of the ARRA included budget authority for military construction and veterans affairs. The House and Senate versions of H.R. 1 differed in fund allocation and specificity. The House bill allocated $920 million for construction projects, while the Senate allocated $637.9 million for troop housing and child development centers. The Senate allocated $637.9 million for construction projects, with $84.1 million for child development centers, $481 million for warrior transition complexes, and $42.4 million for medical and dental clinics. Additionally, $180 million was appropriated for projects in the United States, with $80 million for child development centers and $100 million for warrior transition complexes. Congress instructed the Secretary of Defense to submit an expenditure plan within 30 days. The Senate version allocated $990.1 million for various construction projects, including child development centers, barracks, health clinics, and energy conservation projects. The enacted version appropriated $280 million for projects in the United States, with funds dedicated to troop housing, child development centers, and energy conservation projects. The House proposed $280 million for projects not otherwise authorized, with a focus on airmen housing and child development centers. The Senate amendment allocated $871.3 million to the Air Force for construction obligations through FY2013, with funds for child development centers, barracks, and health clinics. The enacted version appropriated $180 million for projects within the United States, with $100 million designated for troop housing. The House bill proposed $3.8 billion for hospitals and ambulatory surgery centers, in addition to other authorized projects. The enacted version appropriated $1.4 billion through FY2013 for projects in the United States not otherwise authorized, with $1.33 billion for hospitals and $120 million for the Energy Conservation Investment Program. The Act directed the Secretary of Defense to consult with the Director of the Army National Guard before submitting the required expenditure plan. The enacted version appropriated $50 million through FY2013 for construction projects not otherwise authorized, with the Secretary of Defense directed to consult with the Director of the Air National Guard. The House and Senate bills had different funding amounts and time limits for construction projects not otherwise authorized. The House bill contained no specific appropriations, while the Senate amendment allocated funds to the Army and Air Force for military construction. The enacted version provided funding for military family housing construction and operation, with specific allocations to the Army and Air Force. The Homeowners Assistance Fund received increased appropriations and required quarterly expenditure reports from the Secretary of Defense. The Homeowners Assistance Program [HAP] Fund provides financial aid to military personnel and federal employee homeowners who suffer losses on the sale of their primary residence due to base closures or realignments. Program expenses cover various costs including payments for losses on private sales, foreclosure expenses, property acquisition, equity payments, debt retirement, and administrative costs. The program was established in 1966 and is governed by 42 U.S.C. The Homeowners Assistance Program [HAP] Fund provides financial aid to military personnel and federal employee homeowners who suffer losses on the sale of their primary residence due to base closures or realignments. The program was established in 1966 and is governed by 42 U.S.C. \u00a73374. Assistance has been offered during every BRAC round, with eligibility criteria being restrictive. Section 1001 of the Senate amendment aimed to temporarily expand eligibility by removing the need for the Secretary of Defense to determine forced sales for properties purchased before July 1, 2006, and sold during the 2005 BRAC round. Another clause in the bill would have permanently expanded eligibility for DOD acquisition or loss reimbursement for certain primary residences. The Senate amendment extended assistance to wounded military members and civilian employees facing foreclosure on their primary residences during a specified mortgage crisis. The ARRA allowed financial instruments to designate economically distressed areas due to base closures or realignments. The ARRA designated economically distressed areas affected by military base closures as \"recovery zones,\" making them eligible for special tax considerations. The House allocated $1 billion for VA projects, with $950 million for medical facilities and $50 million for national cemeteries. The Senate amendment to H.R. 1 provides $3.9 billion for VA projects, including $5 million for energy conservation in VA health care, $1.4 billion for maintenance projects in medical centers, and $64.7 million for monument repairs at national cemeteries. Funding is allocated for various accounts such as general operating expenses, information technology, and construction projects. The Senate amendment to H.R. 1 provides $2.9 billion above the House-passed version, including grants for construction of state extended care facilities. It also includes a provision for one-time payments to Filipino veterans from the Filipino Veterans Equity Compensation Fund, with $15,000 for U.S. citizens and $9,000 for non-U.S citizens. This provision is similar to H.R. 6897 passed by the House in 2008. The Senate amendment to H.R. 1 includes one-time economic recovery payments of $250 to certain beneficiaries of Social Security, Supplemental Security Income, Railroad Retirement, and certain VA programs. Each agency has funds appropriated for these payments, with the VA receiving additional appropriations for administrative costs. The regular FY2009 appropriations were enacted on September 30, 2008, as Division E of the Consolidated Security, Disaster Assistance, and Continuing Appropriations Act, 2009 (H.R. 2638, P.L. 110-329). The House Committee on Appropriations Subcommittee on Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies began hearings on February 14, focusing on appropriations for the Department of Veterans Affairs. The House subcommittee hearings on veterans' medical care, military construction, and DVA's use of information technology concluded on April 10. The Senate subcommittee, chaired by Senator Tim Johnson, held hearings on April 10 and April 24, 2008. The House subcommittee marked its bill on June 12 and introduced the bill (H.R. 6599) on July 24, 2008. The House Rules Committee reported H.Res. 1384, its rule on consideration of H.R. 6599, on July 29. The House passed H.Res. 1384 on July 31, allowing one hour of general debate and amendments to the bill. Debate on H.R. 6599 continued into the early morning of August 1, with the Committee of the Whole adopting several amendments. On August 1, the House passed H.R. 6599 after considering additional amendments. Representative Jerry Lewis moved to recommit the bill with instructions to insert a section enacting H.R. 6566, but a point of order was raised and sustained. The House then passed H.R. 6599 by a vote of 409-4. The Senate subcommittee approved its version of the appropriations bill by a vote of 29-0. Senator Tim Johnson introduced the measure on July 22 and it was placed on the Senate Legislative Calendar. The bill was later incorporated into the Consolidated Security, Disaster Assistance, and Continuing Appropriations Act, 2009. The House and Senate passed the Consolidated Security, Disaster Assistance, and Continuing Appropriations Act, 2009. The President signed the bill into law on September 30, 2008. The 110th Congress realigned appropriations subcommittees, resulting in new jurisdictions and subcommittee names. During the 109th Congress, appropriations for various defense programs were transferred to the House Committee on Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense. The Subcommittee on Military Quality of Life was renamed to focus on Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies. The Military Construction, Veterans Affairs and Related Agencies Appropriations Act (H.R. 2642) was introduced in the House on May 22, 2007, passed on June 15, and later amended by the Senate. A conference in November led to the bill being included in the Labor-HHS-Education appropriations bill (H.R. 3043) before being removed on November 7, 2007. The appropriations bill H.R. 3043 was amended and bundled with others to become Division I of the Consolidated Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2008. This bill, enacted as P.L. 110-161 on December 26, 2007, included supplemental funding requests for military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan totaling $189.3 billion. The supplemental funding requests for military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan totaled $189.3 billion, with some funds allocated for construction projects in various locations including Kyrgyzstan, Afghanistan, Iraq, Kuwait, Qatar, Djibouti, Africa, and the United States. This included building new facilities, a new headquarters in Djibouti, realignment of Walter Reed Army Medical Center, and an addition to the Burn Rehabilitation Unit at Ft. Sam Houston, Texas. H.R. 2642, the Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, was reintroduced in mid-May 2008 as a second supplemental appropriation for FY2008. The supplemental appropriation for FY2008, signed into law as P.L. 110-252, provides additional funds for military construction and veterans' affairs. Congress typically funds this act by appropriating directly to broadly defined appropriations accounts. The President submits detailed justifications for individual construction projects in the budget documentation to Congress each year. President George W. Bush issued Executive Order (E.O.) 13457 on January 29, 2008, titled \"Protecting American Taxpayers From Government Spending on Wasteful Earmarks.\" The order stated that executive agencies should not fund appropriations laws and other legislation enacted after the date of the order with wasteful earmarks. The legal standing of statements in explanatory reports by committees is less clear compared to statutory language. Executive Order (E.O.) 13457, issued by President George W. Bush on January 29, 2008, prohibits executive agencies from using funds based on earmarks from non-statutory sources, unless required by law or deemed meritorious under statutory criteria. The impact of the order on appropriation practices is uncertain due to the non-binding nature of the term \"should\" in the directive. The Executive Order 13457 issued by President George W. Bush on January 29, 2008, prohibits executive agencies from using funds based on earmarks from non-statutory sources. The order directs agencies to take necessary steps to implement the policy, using the term \"shall\" which is a stronger directive. It applies only to appropriations enacted after January 29, 2008, and does not affect existing or prior-year appropriations. The order does not bar congressionally directed funding if required by law or deemed meritorious. The President's order prohibits executive agencies from using funds based on earmarks from non-statutory sources. Agency heads are allowed to consider the views of Congress regarding earmarks. The definition of an \"earmark\" in the E.O. may create confusion about what spending to avoid. This could potentially prevent agencies from following statutory text. The E.O. prohibits executive agencies from using funds based on earmarks from non-statutory sources. Agency heads can consider Congress's views on earmarks, but the definition of an \"earmark\" in the E.O. may cause confusion and prevent agencies from following statutory text. This raises questions about future expenditure of appropriated funds, such as whether construction projects can proceed without a clear statutory link. In drafting the FY2009 appropriations bill, the House committee clarified the status of congressionally directed spending within the context of the Executive Order by referencing specific construction projects in the statute. Military construction accounts provide funds for new construction projects. The bill includes funds for military construction projects, NATO Security Investment Program, family housing accounts, DOD Housing Improvement Fund, and Homeowners Assistance Fund. The Homeowners Assistance Fund provides relief to federal personnel unable to sell their homes near installations scheduled for closure. The Chemical Demilitarization Construction account funds disposal facilities for chemical weapons. Base Realignment and Closure Account 1990 covers environmental remediation from past BRAC rounds. Base Realignment and Closure Account 2005 funds military construction and relocation for BRAC and global defense strategy implementation. The FY2009 military construction funding includes various accounts under Title I (Department of Defense). Legislation allows budget authority obligations for up to five years. The House committee raised concerns about inflation affecting cost estimates and directed DOD to improve accuracy in inflation estimates. The Department of Defense estimated a $17.9 billion cost for the implementation of the 2005 BRAC round and the Integrated Global Presence and Basing Strategy between 2006 and 2011. DOD advanced its planning for military construction and relocation of personnel following the submission of the FY2007 appropriations request. The estimated cost for implementing the 2005 BRAC Commission recommendations increased to over $30.7 billion, with the FY2009 appropriations request totaling $32.0 billion. Military construction is the main driver of implementation cost estimates, with a wavelike cost profile characteristic of BRAC rounds. The 2005 BRAC Commission recommendations required funds for construction contracts years in advance. Congress usually fully funded BRAC 2005 appropriations requests, but the Senate committee recommended a $73.7 million reduction in FY2009 to allocate more funds for a missile defense radar site in Poland. The Continuing Appropriations bill allocated $8.7 billion to the BRAC 2005 account, a $300 million reduction from the President's request. The Secretary of Defense must report annually to Congress on closures and realignments from the 2005 BRAC round. The 2005 BRAC round closures and realignments must be completed by September 15, 2011. The main campus of Walter Reed Army Medical Center in DC will close, with functions transferred elsewhere. A panel in the NDAA would oversee healthcare and facility changes. Section 2721 of the amended NDAA (S. 3001) establishes a panel of healthcare and facility experts to review plans for the new National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland. The panel advises the Secretary of Defense on adequacy and recommends changes for world-class facilities. The Secretary reports recommendations to congressional defense committees, prepares cost estimates, and creates a milestone schedule for execution. Planned construction activities continue without impediment. Implementation costs for President's redeployments to new garrisons are included in the BRAC 2005 cost estimate. DOD costs during the six-year BRAC implementation total $495.3 million out of $9.1 billion. The FY2009 BRAC 2005 appropriation request includes $495.3 million for the IGPBS/GDPR redeployment. The original House version of the Duncan Hunter National Defense Authorization Act for FY2009 aimed to repeal the President's authority to appoint a commission for military base closures. The BRAC Commission reviews recommendations for base closures and can accept, reject, or amend them before gaining approval from the President. Congress can stop these actions by passing a joint resolution. The FY2009 BRAC 2005 appropriation request includes funding for base closure redeployment. The original House version of the Duncan Hunter National Defense Authorization Act aimed to eliminate the independent commission from the base closure process. The Secretary of Defense would submit closure recommendations directly to the President for approval, subject to congressional disapproval. DOD plans to increase Army and Marine Corps end strength by 2012. The Department of Defense plans to increase the Army and Marine Corps end strength by an additional 9,200 citizen-soldiers by 2012, requiring additional military construction. The estimated cost for this increase in soldiers and Marines between 2007 and 2013 is $15.7 billion, with the majority of appropriations needed from FY2008 to FY2010. DOD is also relocating troops to the United States and renegotiating overseas installations in Germany, Italy, Korea, and Japan, while creating new installations in eastern Europe and the Pacific. In eastern Europe and the Pacific, new installations are being created. U.S. forces in Germany are consolidating at existing sites in the south and expanding the installation near Vicenza, Italy. Forces in Korea are moving away from the Demilitarized Zone and Seoul to new facilities in the south. The creation of Africa Command (AFRICOM) under Gen. William E. \"Kip\" Ward may require $750 million in U.S. construction funding. The creation of Africa Command (AFRICOM) under Gen. William E. \"Kip\" Ward may soon require the construction of minimally manned or unmanned \"cooperative security locations\" across Africa. The Administration has not provided a clear plan for facilities on the continent to receive U.S. military forces. Additionally, the Department of Defense and the Government of Japan have agreed to move Marines and their families from Okinawa to Guam, with Japan covering 60% of the $10 billion construction costs. The Army, Navy, and Air Force are also increasing their presence on Guam. The military presence on Guam is expected to increase significantly, with the Air Force also increasing its personnel and family members on the island. By 2014, the military-associated population is projected to rise from 14,000 to around 39,000, potentially representing 22% of the island's total population. The Department of Defense estimates that $3 billion will be required for military construction on Guam, but final plans are still pending. The House-passed version of the Senate's NDAA includes a provision for a new Treasury account to accept Japanese contributions for the relocation of Marines from Okinawa to Guam. The section \"Support for United States Relocation to Guam Account\" accepts Japanese contributions for military realignment and relocation of U.S. personnel to Guam. The Secretary of Defense must report annually on construction projects for relocations from Japanese territory. The Government Accountability Office found shortcomings in DOD planning for overseas installations. The military departments had not finalized the forces being transferred to Guam from Japan and the United States, impacting housing, training, and operational requirements. The Senate committee has required DOD to submit an annual master plan for its overseas installations since FY2004. In the mid-1980s, the Department of the Army acquired land near Ft. Carson, CO for training purposes as part of the Global Rebasing effort. The Army is redeploying 10,000 soldiers to Ft. Carson as part of the Global Rebasing effort. They are transitioning to modular Brigade Combat Teams for faster tactics. Each BCT requires 95,000 acres for training, with plans for four BCTs at Ft. Carson. The Army is considering expanding the Pi\u00f1on Canyon Maneuver Training Area by acquiring an additional 418,000 acres, raising concerns about public condemnation for land acquisition. The Department of Defense considered using eminent domain for land acquisition at Ft. Carson, as discussed in a hearing with Senator Wayne Allard. The National Defense Authorization Act for FY2008 required an analysis of training facilities at Ft. Carson to support current and future unit needs. An amendment to the Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2008 prohibited the expansion of the Pinon Canyon Maneuver Site in Colorado. The Department of the Army reported to Congress that Ft. Carson may only need an additional 100,000 acres for training land. The Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2004 allowed the Secretary of Defense to use Operation and Maintenance funds for urgent military construction projects outside the U.S. until FY2009, with restrictions on locations and usage. The bill exempts construction in Afghanistan from the prohibition on using funds to support the long-term presence of U.S. military forces. The Department of Defense has privatized military family housing at installations through joint ventures. American Eagle Communities faced financial challenges in 2006-2007, leading to other contractors taking over projects. The Senate version of the NDAA aimed to increase support for military housing projects. The Senate version of the NDAA aimed to increase oversight of military housing projects, set contractor qualifications, and require cost-benefit analysis for project dissolution. Both House and Senate versions authorized leasing housing in the National Capital Region to the Secretary of Defense as a cost-effective alternative. The House-amended version of S. 3001 proposes setting the rent for DOD communications equipment and security devices at 105% of the basic housing allowance for a general or admiral with family. The Defense Access Road Program allows the Department of Defense to improve roads important to national defense, partnering with other agencies for construction projects. The increase in military populations due to BRAC and Global Defense Posture Realignment may strain local transportation infrastructure. The House version of the NDAA would require a transportation \"needs assessment\" at installations with significant transportation impact. The Senate version did not include this language but highlighted the program as of special interest. Section 2814 of the enacted version retained the House language, directing the Secretary of Defense to report transportation impacts from DOD activities since 2005. The Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base (NASJRB) Willow Grove in Horsham, PA is set to close as part of the 2005 BRAC round. Section 8115 of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2009 allows for the transfer of Navy property to the Air Force for use as the Horsham Joint Interagency Installation, which will then be transferred to Pennsylvania. The property must return to the Department of Defense if it ceases to be used as the Horsham Joint Interagency Installation. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) administers programs for veterans and their families, including disability compensation, pensions, medical care, insurance, home loan guarantees, burial benefits, and educational assistance. VA appropriations for benefits and services have increased over time. VA appropriations for benefits and services have increased from $52.38 billion in FY2002 to $88.11 billion in FY2008, with a proposed budget of $90.8 billion for FY2009. Additional funding has been allocated to address the backlog of disability claims and reduce processing times. In FY2009, funding for the VA increased to $93.7 billion in H.R. 6559, $94.8 billion in S. 3301, and $94.4 billion in H.R. 2638. This included funds for hiring additional claims processors, leasing office space, and additional personnel for handling appeals. In FY2009, funding for the VA increased by $6.2 billion or 7.1% over the FY2008 enacted level. The funding bills provided a significant increase for medical support, facilities, and information technology. There is an almost equal split between mandatory and discretionary funding for the VA, with discretionary funding slightly above mandatory funding in certain bills. The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) offers primary care, specialized care, and support services through a network of medical centers, nursing homes, clinics, and counseling centers. The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) provides care through medical centers, clinics, and counseling centers. VHA collaborates with the Department of Defense and offers grants for nursing homes. The Administration requested $39.2 billion for VHA in FY2009, with a potential total budget of $41.1 billion. In FY2009, the Administration requested $34.1 billion for medical services, a $5.0 billion increase from FY2008. The budget also included $4.6 billion for medical facilities and $442 million for medical and prosthetic research. Cost-sharing proposals were included, such as tiered annual enrollment fees based on veterans' family incomes. The Administration proposed increasing pharmacy copayments for Priority Group 7 and 8 veterans from $8 to $15 for nonservice-connected conditions. This would have generated $334 million in revenue in FY2009 and $1.6 billion over five years. The proposal was not approved by Congress. The Administration proposed increasing pharmacy copayments for Priority Group 7 and 8 veterans from $8 to $15 for nonservice-connected conditions, aiming to generate revenue. Additionally, the proposal included billing veterans directly for treatment associated with nonservice-connected conditions, eliminating the practice of using third-party collections. This would have increased government revenue by $44 million in FY2009 and $215 million over five years. The President's budget request for medical services did not reflect these legislative proposals. The FY2009 budget proposals aimed to deposit all collections in the U.S. Treasury instead of the Medical Care Collections Fund. The House Appropriations Committee-passed version of the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations bill for FY2009 allocated $40.7 billion for the VHA, including increases for medical services, medical support and compliance, medical facilities, and medical and prosthetic research. The House-passed version of the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations bill for FY2009 did not include fee increases as requested by the Administration. The Senate Appropriations Committee-approved version recommended $41.1 billion for VHA for FY2009, a 4.8% increase over the FY2009 request. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended merging medical services and administration accounts, with $35.6 billion for medical services, a 4.4% increase over the FY2009 request. Additionally, $5.0 billion was allocated for medical facilities, a 21% increase over FY2008. $527 million was provided for medical and prosthetic research, a 19.2% increase over FY2009. The Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Act, 2009 (H.R. 2638, P.L. 110-329) allocates approximately $41.0 billion for VHA for FY2009, with funding levels for various medical accounts remaining consistent. It includes $375 million to increase Priority Group 8 enrollment and $133 million to raise the beneficiary travel reimbursement mileage rate to 41.5 cents per mile. The American Battle Monuments Commission (ABMC) is responsible for maintaining and constructing U.S. monuments and memorials commemorating the achievements of U.S. armed forces since World War I. The American Battle Monuments Commission (ABMC) maintains cemeteries, monuments, and memorials in foreign countries and on U.S. soil. They were responsible for the construction of the World War II Memorial in Washington, DC, and an Interpretive Center at the Normandy American Cemetery in France. The ABMC also retains fiduciary responsibility for public contributions towards the Memorial's construction. The U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims, established in 1988, has exclusive jurisdiction to review decisions of the Board of Veterans' Appeals. It interprets laws and regulations, can compel action by the VA, and has the authority to set aside decisions deemed unlawful. The Court is currently located in leased facilities in Washington, DC, and is seeking a permanent location as its lease expires in 2010. The U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims, established in 1988, has exclusive jurisdiction to review decisions of the Board of Veterans' Appeals. It interprets laws and regulations, can compel action by the VA, and has the authority to set aside decisions deemed unlawful. The Court is seeking a permanent location as its lease expires in September 2010. Plans are being developed for a Veterans' Courthouse and Justice Center in collaboration with the General Services Administration. The Secretary of the Army oversees the administration of Arlington National Cemetery and the Soldiers' and Airmen's Home National Cemetery, which host numerous ceremonies and visitors annually. Additional funds were allocated in FY2008 for various projects at Arlington Cemetery. The Armed Forces Retirement Home Trust Fund supports the operation and maintenance of the Armed Forces Retirement Home. The Home Trust Fund provides funds for the Armed Forces Retirement Home in Washington, DC and Gulfport, Mississippi, which offer housing and medical care for needy veterans. The Gulfport facility was damaged by Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and is currently being rebuilt with a target completion date in 2010. The Armed Forces Retirement Home Trust Fund is funded through various sources including gifts, bequests, and a $0.50 per month assessment on active duty military personnel. The FY2008 Omnibus provided funds for a study on the trust fund's viability. The budget request for FY2009 includes funds for renovating the Scott Dormitory Building in D.C. The Gulfport facility will house D.C. residents during renovations. Accounts Appendix B.
