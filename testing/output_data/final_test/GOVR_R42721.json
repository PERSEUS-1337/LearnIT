    "content": "In recent years, interest in fuel efficiency and emissions of motor vehicles in the United States has increased due to rising oil prices and concerns over greenhouse gas emissions. Proponents argue that higher vehicle fuel efficiency standards incentivize the development of new technologies to reduce dependence on imported oil and limit greenhouse gas emissions. Critics claim that efficiency standards distort the market for new vehicles and compromise consumer choice. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA) mandated higher fuel efficiency standards for passenger vehicles, increasing to at least 35 mpg by 2020. It also changed the structure of the fuel economy program and directed the Department of Transportation to study improvements in heavy-duty vehicles. Additionally, the Supreme Court granted the Environmental Protection Agency authority to regulate vehicle greenhouse gas emissions. These federal actions have significantly impacted motor vehicle regulations. The Obama Administration issued joint rules on vehicle fuel economy and GHG emissions for model years 2012-2016 and 2017-2025, aligning with California's Clean Air Act standards. This aims to reduce emissions by reducing vehicle fuel consumption. The Obama Administration secured commitment letters from California and 13 automakers for vehicle fuel economy and greenhouse gas standards for MY2017-2025. California will align with federal GHG standards, and automakers agree not to challenge the new standards in court. Consumers' fuel savings are expected to offset the cost of new technology for vehicles. The new standards for vehicle fuel economy and greenhouse gas emissions are expected to offset the additional cost of new technology, saving 4 billion barrels of oil and 2 billion metric tons of greenhouse gases over the vehicles' lifespan. Critics challenge the assumptions, warning of higher costs and potential drops in new vehicle sales. Federal authorities regulate vehicle fuel economy and GHGs through different statutes, with the Energy Policy and Conservation Act of 1975 setting CAFE standards and the EISA tightening standards for various vehicle types. The EPA administers vehicle GHG standards under the Clean Air Act, with key differences from CAFE standards. The \"miles-per-gallon\" targets are actually a proxy for the GHG standard of 163 grams per mile of CO2 equivalent. The EPA administers vehicle GHG standards under the Clean Air Act, with key differences from CAFE standards. The 54.5 mpg \"standard\" assumes reductions in GHG emissions come from fuel savings, but cost-effective reductions can also come from other means like improvements in vehicle air conditioning systems. The expected CAFE standard for MY2025 is 49.7 mpg, significantly higher than current standards. NHTSA is limited to issuing rules for five model years or fewer, so the final GHG rule extends through MY2025 while the CAFE rule only extends through MY2021. The CAFE rule only extends through MY2021, with NHTSA needing to complete a separate rulemaking for MY2022 and later. A mid-term evaluation is planned to assess progress, revisit cost-benefit analyses, and propose new CAFE standards, as demanded by automakers. BMW Group supports the comprehensive mid-term evaluation for model years 2022-2025 standards. BMW Group supports the adoption of standards for model years 2022-2025, despite uncertainties about technology evolution and costs. EPCA preempts states from setting their own fuel economy standards, but California can establish its own vehicle emissions standards with EPA waiver approval. The Clean Air Act allows California to set its own vehicle emissions standards with an EPA waiver. The agreement between the Administration, automakers, and California includes granting California a waiver for MY2017-MY2025 and accepting vehicles meeting federal greenhouse standards. EISA requires NHTSA to increase CAFE standards to at least 35 mpg by 2020 and made changes to the CAFE program structure. The Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) program required automakers to achieve a sales-weighted average of 27.5 mpg for all cars each model year or face penalties. This incentivized automakers to downsize vehicles, but larger vehicles offer more passenger protection. Critics argued that the program favored producers of smaller, more fuel-efficient vehicles, mainly non-U.S. manufacturers. NHTSA had broader authority to set CAFE standards for other vehicle classes like light trucks. Under the CAFE program, NHTSA has broader authority to set standards for light trucks based on vehicle size. Each vehicle is assigned a fuel economy target determined by its footprint, calculated by track width and wheelbase. Manufacturers must achieve a sales-weighted average target for their fleet, varying between companies. The CAFE program under EISA requires NHTSA to set new fuel economy standards based on vehicle attributes, with size-based curves established for cars and light trucks. EPA adopted NHTSA's standards for harmonization. The new regulations may increase the average price of a new vehicle by $1,800 by MY2025, but fuel savings are expected to offset the cost, with drivers saving $5,700 in total. The Obama Administration's new fuel economy standards for MY 2025 vehicles are expected to increase the average price by $1,800. However, drivers can save $5,700 to $7,400 in fuel costs over the vehicle's lifetime, offsetting the higher vehicle cost. Consumers can save a net $3,400 to $5,000 over the vehicle's lifetime, assuming a gasoline price of $3.87 per gallon in 2025. The payback period for purchasing a 2025 vehicle with cash is 3.4 years at a 7 percent discount rate or 3.2 years at a 3 percent discount rate. Buying with a 5-year loan would result in monthly fuel savings exceeding the increased loan payment from the first month of ownership. The Obama Administration's new fuel economy standards for MY 2025 vehicles are expected to increase the average price by $1,800. EPA and NHTSA argue that the benefits of the program will far outweigh the costs, with estimated benefits of $510 billion to $639 billion over the life of the vehicles covered by the rule. Compliance costs will vary for each manufacturer based on the size-based standards. The Obama Administration's new fuel economy standards for MY 2025 vehicles are expected to increase the average price by $1,800. Compliance costs for automakers vary based on the size-based standards, with some automakers projected to fare well under car standards but poorly under light truck standards. EPA estimated total sales and per-vehicle costs for each automaker in MY2025, with larger automakers facing higher total costs due to the volume of vehicles they produce. EISA required NHTSA to study fuel efficiency gains for medium- and heavy-duty trucks. EPA and NHTSA proposed joint rules for MY2014-MY2018 based on weight class and other attributes. The standards focus on fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions per tons of payload miles. EPA and NHTSA estimate the rules will have a significant impact. The EPA and NHTSA estimate that new heavy-duty combination tractors will increase by $6,200, heavy-duty pickup trucks and vans by $1,000, and vocational vehicles by $400 for MY2018. The increased costs will be recouped in fuel savings within a few years. The rules are expected to save 530 million barrels of oil and 270 million metric tons of greenhouse gases over MY2014-MY2018 vehicles' lifespan, with total program costs of $8.1 billion offset by $50 billion in fuel savings and $7.3 billion in other benefits. The EPA and NHTSA estimate that new heavy-duty vehicles will have increased costs, but these will be offset by fuel savings and other benefits, resulting in a net benefit estimate of $49 billion over the vehicles' lifespan. Critics question the methodology used to determine costs and benefits, suggesting that the actual net benefits could be lower than projected."
