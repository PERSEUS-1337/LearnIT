    "content": "The Small Business Administration (SBA) Disaster Loan Program provides economic assistance to businesses, nonprofit organizations, homeowners, and renters affected by federally declared disasters. The program offers various types of loans, including Home and Personal Property Disaster Loans, Business Physical Disaster Loans, and Economic Injury Disaster Loans (EIDL). Most loans are awarded to individuals and households, with low-interest rates and loan maturities of up to 30 years. The SBA Disaster Loan Program offers fixed-rate loans with maturities of up to 30 years. There are five ways to activate the program, including presidential and SBA declarations. The type of declaration does not affect loan terms or caps. Loans become available when the President issues a disaster declaration authorizing Individual Assistance and Public Assistance. Homeowners, renters, businesses, and nonprofits in the disaster area can access loans, including Economic Injury Disaster Loans. Economic Injury Disaster Loans (EIDL) may be available for survivors in contiguous counties. Private nonprofit entities in the disaster area providing noncritical services may be eligible for physical disaster loans and EIDL. Home Physical Disaster Loans and Personal Property Loans are not available to renters and homeowners under certain declarations. Business Physical Disaster Loans and EIDLs may not be available to businesses unless they are private nonprofit entities. SBA disaster loans become available when the SBA Administrator issues a physical disaster declaration in response to a gubernatorial request for assistance. The SBA Administrator issues EIDL declarations for disaster loans available to eligible homeowners, renters, businesses, and nonprofit organizations in the disaster area or contiguous counties. Declarations are made based on certification from a state governor or determination of a natural disaster by the Secretary of Agriculture. Small agricultural cooperatives and private nonprofit organizations are also eligible for SBA disaster loans under EIDL declarations. Loans are available to small businesses, agricultural cooperatives, and nonprofit organizations in disaster areas. The Secretary of Agriculture issues the most declarations, followed by the SBA. Declarations can also be based on fishery disasters declared by the Secretary of Commerce. During 2000 to 2014, 72% of approved disaster loans were disbursed, totaling $15.5 billion. Loans can be used alongside other assistance, ensuring no duplication of benefits. Federal agencies must prevent recipients from double-dipping in disaster aid. FEMA and SBA regulations prevent duplication of disaster assistance benefits. Recipients cannot receive aid that duplicates benefits from insurance or other sources. SBA can approve and disburse loans for the total replacement cost up to specified lending limits. If there is a duplication of benefits after insurance settles, those funds are applied to the loan balance. SBA does not require collateral for loans under $25,000 and may not decline a loan solely based on inadequate collateral. Processing standards for disaster loans are based on tiered levels of application volumes. The Small Business Administration (SBA) processes disaster loans based on tiered levels of application volumes, with varying processing times. Performance in processing disaster loans has fluctuated over the years, with lower performance in FY2013 due to increased loan volumes following Hurricane Sandy. A 2015 study found that SBA's processing time for home disaster loans averaged 18.7 days, while application processing times for business disaster loans averaged 43.3 days. Funding for the SBA Disaster Loan Program is typically appropriated by Congress annually. Funding for the SBA Disaster Loan Program is typically provided through annual appropriations by Congress, with additional funds allocated after major disasters. From FY2005 to FY2015, Congress appropriated an average of $408 million per year to the program, totaling $4.1 billion.

SBA requires collateral for EIDL loans over $25,000, with real estate accepted when available. Loans under $200,000 may use other collateral to cover the loan value. Applicants must pledge available collateral but will not be declined for lack of it."
