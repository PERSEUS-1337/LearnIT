Private long-term care insurance (LTCI) can provide financial protection, but only a small percentage of older individuals have a policy. This report explores the role of LTCI in financing long-term care, factors influencing demand, and legislative options to improve affordability and consumer protections. Long-term care insurance (LTCI) offers services to help individuals with limited self-care capacity due to physical, cognitive, or mental disabilities. Unlike health care, LTCI focuses on assisting with daily activities like bathing and eating to maximize independence. Long-term care insurance (LTCI) covers activities of daily living (ADLs) such as bathing, dressing, eating, toileting, and transferring. Policyholders can receive benefits with at least two ADL limitations. LTCI can be sold individually or as part of an employer-sponsored policy, with premiums varying by age. A study estimates that over two-thirds of individuals turning 65 will need long-term services and supports (LTSS) before they die. Private LTCI only covers about 6% of LTSS costs, with nearly half financed by Medicaid. Medicaid provides a safety net for individuals who meet specific criteria and income thresholds. Medicare funds a portion of long-term services and supports (LTSS) for older Americans and certain disabled individuals. Those who do not qualify for public funding or have private long-term care insurance (LTCI) must pay for LTSS out-of-pocket, with about 16% of spending in 2010 being paid this way. The costs depend on the care setting, intensity, and duration of services. The cost of long-term care services varies depending on the setting, intensity, and duration of care. In 2012, the average cost of personal unskilled care at home was $19 an hour, totaling about $18,179 annually for 18.4 hours of care per week. Assisted living facilities cost around $39,600 annually, while nursing home care is generally more expensive. The cost of nursing home care in 2012 was $73,000 for a semi-private room and $81,030 for a private room, with 24-hour LTSS assistance. The private LTCI market has evolved over the past three decades, with employer-sponsored plans growing in popularity. Between 7 to 9 million Americans currently have an active LTCI policy. The LTCI market has seen growth in both individual and group policies, with employer-sponsored plans increasing significantly. Employer-sponsored LTCI now represents about one-third of all active policies, offering larger risk pools and lower premiums. The number of companies selling LTCI has declined over the past decade. The LTCI market has become more concentrated, with the top 10 companies producing the majority of new sales. Several well-known companies have exited the market, such as MetLife, Unum Group, and Prudential. This consolidation is due to high administrative expenses. The LTCI industry faces challenges such as high administrative expenses, lower than expected terminations, low interest rates, and new government regulations. Legislative changes have allowed insurers to develop hybrid products combining LTCI with annuities or life insurance. The Pension Protection Act of 2006 simplified tax rules for combination products and specified tax-free use of annuity proceeds for LTCI. LTCI policies can also be combined with life insurance through accelerated death benefit riders triggered by terminal illness or medical conditions. The newer hybrid LTCI policies offer accelerated benefits for terminal illness, LTSS needs, or nursing home confinement. These policies are impacting the demand for LTCI in the future. Additionally, there are LTCI products linked to Medicaid eligibility through the Medicaid Partnership Program, allowing purchasers to qualify for Medicaid without the same means-testing requirements. Medicaid would provide extended coverage of LTSS after LTCI benefits are exhausted. The Medicaid Partnership Program allows individuals to qualify for Medicaid without strict means-testing requirements, providing extended coverage of LTSS after LTCI benefits are used up. Originally established in four states in the 1990s, the program expanded to 40 states by 2011. 641,000 Partnership Program policies are currently in force, representing 9% of all policies. Ten states have yet to adopt the LTCI Partnership Program. Demand for private LTCI has slowed despite tax incentives and consumer protections. Comparing age cohorts, those under 65 face lower premiums but competing financial demands. Many in this group lack understanding of future risks and coverage options. Many individuals do not fully understand their future risks or coverage options for long-term services and supports (LTSS). Medicare does not cover longer stays in a nursing home or personal home care, leading to barriers in purchasing LTCI policies. Concerns have also arisen about consumer protections for LTCI due to inconsistencies in laws and regulations across states, as well as issues with premium stability and claims denials by LTCI companies. The high cost of LTCI is a major deterrent for potential buyers, with premiums increasing significantly above the inflation rate over the past decade. This has led to 87% of individuals citing cost as a key reason for not purchasing a policy. Increased demand for more comprehensive LTCI benefit packages and higher daily benefit amounts has led insurers to raise premiums for both current and new policyholders due to low rates of return on investments and underestimates of lapse rates. The complexity of purchase decisions has increased with more comprehensive policies, with 49% of potential buyers finding policy options too confusing. Potential policyholders must evaluate various product features such as coverage type, dollar amount, inflation adjustments, coverage duration, and waiting period. Individuals must choose the type of services to be covered by a LTCI policy, which may include care in various settings like nursing homes, assisted living facilities, or home health services. Policies purchased in 2010 are more likely to cover both nursing home and home care services compared to those purchased in 1995. Factors affecting policy cost and complexity include the daily benefit amount and inflation protection. Inflation protection is crucial when purchasing a LTCI policy as it ensures coverage for future long-term care services. Policies bought in 2010 are more likely to include inflation protection compared to those bought in 1995. Companies offer both simple and compound inflation protection options. In 1995, companies offer simple and compound inflation adjustments for LTCI policies. Simple adjustments increase the daily benefit annually by a fixed percentage from the first year, while compound adjustments increase the daily benefit based on each previous year's amount. Policyholders must also decide how much inflation protection to purchase annually, which can be based on historical data. The duration of a LTCI policy, known as the length of coverage in years, complicates the decision-making process. Policyholders must choose between covering two to five years of services or opting for lifetime benefits. The variability of future risks across the older population makes it challenging to determine the appropriate coverage. Researchers have estimated that one-third of those who turned 65 in 2005 will not need long-term services and supports (LTSS), while one in five will require LTSS for over five years. LTCI policies have an elimination period chosen by the policyholder, similar to a deductible in health care plans. Policies purchased in 2010 have longer elimination periods compared to 15 years earlier. A longer elimination period in LTCI policies can reduce premiums, but there are concerns about consumer protections. State governments regulate the LTCI market with varying laws and regulations to address issues of future benefits, premium affordability, and insurer stability. State governments regulate the LTCI market through laws and regulations, with the NAIC providing Model provisions for guidance. However, there is variability in the adoption of these provisions among states, leading to gaps in consumer protections. Since 1996, the federal government has aimed to standardize regulations for certain LTCI products at a national level. Federal law includes provisions for tax benefits and consumer protection standards for purchasers of \"tax-qualified\" LTCI policies under HIPAA. These products must adhere to most provisions in the 1993 NAIC Model Law and Regulations, including offering inflation protection. The Medicaid Partnership Program, established under DRA, sets minimum consumer protection requirements for LTCI plans sold under the program based on the 2000 NAIC Model Provisions. The DRA provisions mandate inflation protection for certain age groups in the Partnership Program, with states deciding the specific requirements. Federal laws lack updated regulations for LTCI, such as rate stability provisions from the NAIC 2000 Model. Issues include misrepresentation by unqualified agents and claim denials. Premiums for LTCI are generally lower when policies are bought early. Premiums for LTCI are lower when policies are purchased at younger ages, but long-term stability is crucial for future affordability. Insurers can request permission to increase premiums for a class of insured individuals, with reports of increases between 10% and 40% in some states. Data on premium increases across all LTCI companies are limited. The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) announced a 25% increase in premium rates for federal workers enrolled in the LTCI program with automatic compound inflation protection. The increase was due to a new LTCI contract offering higher benefits, but policyholders could maintain current premiums by adjusting their benefit package. Premium stability depends on insurers accurately predicting future claims and managing reserves. The NAIC revised its model provisions in 2000 to ensure companies provide actuarial information certifying rate adequacy and premium increases are mainly for claims. Policyholders have the option to switch to lower premium policies to avoid rate increases, and companies filing inadequate rates can be banned for five years. The NAIC is re-evaluating its rate stability model language to address concerns about companies filing inadequate initial premiums. Actuarial certification is required for premium increases, but there are potential problems with the \"moderately adverse\" language as it lacks a clear definition. This reliance on the pricing actuary's judgment makes it difficult to regulate. The NAIC is exploring options to strengthen rate stability standards by defining \"moderately adverse events.\" Concerns were raised about insurers selling unsuitable LTCI policies to low-income individuals eligible for Medicaid. The 2000 NAIC Model required insurers to develop suitability standards to address these issues. The 2000 NAIC Model mandated insurers to establish suitability standards and train agents accordingly. Insurers and agents must assess applicants' financial ability and needs using a personal worksheet. Disclosure requirements include distributing a brochure on \"Things to Know Before You Buy.\" The 2006 NAIC Model added provisions for agent training and a new section on producer training. As of November 2008, 27 states have agent licensing requirements, not all fully compliant with the 2006 NAIC Model. Recent data from the NAIC shows an increase in complaints regarding LTCI policies, particularly in the denial of claims. The percentage of claims denied for all policies rose from 3.2% in 2004 to 3.9% in 2006, with comprehensive policies seeing an increase from 4.1% to 4.9% over the same period. This data covers the years 2004 to 2006 and does not include more recent information. Denial of claims in LTCI policies can occur for various reasons, such as issues with reimbursement processes and eligibility requirements. Policyholders must provide documentation to prove eligibility for payments, like needing assistance with daily activities. Claims can be denied if supporting documentation is not submitted promptly. Between 2004 and 2006, denied claims for long-term care insurance policies increased due to the policyholder not meeting the elimination period. Anecdotal evidence raised concerns about insurers purposely delaying claims, but national data from the NAIC did not support this. According to a Lifeplans Survey, 96% of claims were approved, indicating relatively few denials in the industry. The survey reported a 4% denial rate for initial claims in the industry. Most denied claims were processed within two months, with evidence of delays in claims processing isolated to policies issued by one large insurer. A regulatory settlement against Conseco, Inc. in May 2008 highlighted mishandling of LTCI claims, including delays in payment and lack of documentation. The NAIC found that delays in payment, rather than denials, were the primary issue with LTCI claims. In response, they adopted language for external independent review of benefit trigger denials and revised reporting forms for clarity. Economic concerns may impact the demand for LTCI, with potential policyholders waiting for better economic conditions. There are also worries about guaranteeing benefits for current policyholders, but the insurance industry offers safeguards for LTCI policyholders. The insurance industry provides safeguards for LTCI policyholders through insurance guaranty funds, a system funded by assessments on insurers. When an insurer faces financial trouble, it may be placed into receivership, and the insurance commissioner may establish a plan to ensure policyholders receive coverage. If the company is liquidated, a state guaranty fund may come into play. State guaranty associations may need to assume or reinsure policies of troubled insurers if they are liquidated. Insurers are required by law to be members of guaranty associations in each state they operate in. Concerns arise about coverage adequacy per policy in case of insolvency, potentially leading to premium rate increases and benefit reductions for policyholders. Actuaries suggest that increased participation in the private LTCI market could lower policy costs by expanding the risk pool. Adverse selection in insurance occurs when individuals with higher risk factors are more likely to purchase a policy, leading to higher premiums. Greater participation in insurance programs helps mitigate adverse selection effects. Concerns about adverse selection were raised with the voluntary CLASS Program under the ACA. The CLASS program, a voluntary LTCI program, faced challenges due to adverse selection concerns. Design features like guaranteed issue and voluntary enrollment could lead to higher premiums and reduced demand among healthy individuals. HHS concluded that the program was not financially viable, leading to its repeal in 2013. The CLASS program (P.L. 112-240) was repealed due to financial concerns. Proposals to boost private LTCI participation include increasing tax incentives, improving consumer protections, and expanding education. Current tax incentives for LTCI are not as generous as for health insurance, but AHIP survey suggests that increased incentives could drive demand. Tax incentives can boost demand for LTCI, with 87% of respondents showing interest in deducting premiums from taxable income. Current tax treatment allows some advantages for LTCI, such as excluding benefits from gross income and deducting premiums as itemized deductions. However, deductions are subject to age-adjusted limits. Tax-qualified LTCI policies have age-adjusted limits ranging from $360 for those aged 40 or younger to $4,550 for those over 70. Employer contributions are excluded from gross income, and self-employed individuals can deduct LTCI premiums. The Medicare Prescription Drug Act of 2003 allows for Health Savings Accounts to pay for LTCI premiums on a tax-advantaged basis. The Pension Protection Act of 2006 simplified tax rules for combination products that include LTCI with annuities or life insurance. It allows tax-free use of annuity proceeds to purchase LTCI, using cash surrender value of life insurance for LTCI premiums, and tax-free exchanges of certain insurance contracts. Expanding tax incentives for long-term care insurance can reduce after-tax costs and increase demand. LTCI premiums could be included in employer-sponsored cafeteria plans, as an above-the-line tax deduction, or as a tax credit. Table 4 outlines the pros and cons of each option. Including LTCI in employer-sponsored cafeteria plans or FSAs can provide tax benefits by reducing income and employment taxes for employees. This option would also lower adjusted gross income for tax purposes, benefiting individuals in certain tax brackets. Under this option, LTCI premiums would be deducted from a taxpayer's gross income, reducing the effective cost by 32.65%. This provision is available to everyone, unlike cafeteria plans, and can lower after-tax LTCI premiums by 25% for individuals in the 25% tax bracket. Tax credits can directly reduce a taxpayer's tax liability, with the key distinction being whether they are refundable or nonrefundable. Tax credits can reduce a taxpayer's tax liability, with the key distinction being whether they are refundable or nonrefundable. Refundable credits are paid to the taxpayer even if they exceed the tax liability, while nonrefundable credits may not benefit the taxpayer fully. Actual tax savings depend on specific proposal details, and many proposals would phase-in deductions or credits to minimize costs to the federal government. Legislative proposals aim to expand tax incentives for Long-Term Care Insurance (LTCI) by phasing in deductions or credits over time, basing them on policy duration, and limiting income eligibility. Concerns about consumer protection and rate stability may lead to requirements for tax-qualified LTCI policies to adhere to specific NAIC Model Regulations. The Long-Term Care Awareness Campaign seeks to boost awareness through a federal-state partnership. The Own Your Future Campaign is a joint federal-state initiative to increase awareness about planning for long-term care needs. Started in January 2005, the campaign targets households with members aged 45 to 70 through state-based direct mail campaigns. Materials include a Long-Term Care Planning Kit and state-specific resources. As of January 2010, 25 states have participated in the campaign. The Own Your Future Campaign, launched in January 2005, aims to raise awareness about long-term care planning. 25 states have joined the campaign. Consumers responded positively to the campaign, leading to increased interest and action in long-term care planning. Congress supported the initiative by establishing the National Clearinghouse for Long-Term Care Information under the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005, allocating $15 million in funding over five years. The American Taxpayers Relief Act of 2012 repealed the CLASS program and rescinded unobligated funds for the National Clearinghouse, which had funding extended to 2015 by the ACA. Legislative proposals in the 113th Congress may further expand or extend funding for the National Clearinghouse."
