The \"Cut, Cap, and Balance Act of 2011\" imposes discretionary spending limits for fiscal year 2012, with adjustments allowed for the global war on terrorism. Congressional budget aggregates and allocations can be revised accordingly. In fiscal year 2012, funding for the global war on terrorism is limited to $126,544,000,000 in budget authority and outlays. SEC. 317 of the bill sets limits on direct spending in the House of Representatives and the Senate, with exemptions for Social Security, Medicare, Veterans Benefits, and Net Interest. The total combined outlays for non-exempt direct spending in fiscal year 2012 should not exceed $680,730,000,000. Additionally, SEC. 102 enforces spending caps through sequestration. SEC. 102 enforces spending caps through sequestration with a new section added to the Congressional Budget Act of 1974. Implementation of sequesters will be done separately for discretionary and direct spending, following specific sections of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985. Military personnel accounts, TRICARE for Life, and Medicare are exempt from certain provisions. The Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 exempts certain programs like TRICARE for Life, Medicare, military retirement, Social Security, veterans, net interest, and discretionary appropriations from sequestration. The Act also allows for the application of section 258A to override the order if a bill achieves the same level of reductions in new budget authority and outlays. The Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 exempts certain programs from sequestration. In the House or Senate, a bill altering a sequestration order must achieve the same reductions in budget authority and outlays as specified in the order. SEC. 201 of TITLE II--CAP limits total spending by defining GDP and inserting enforcement measures in the Congressional Budget Act of 1974. The section enforces GDP outlay limits based on projected GDP estimates by OMB, with specific percentages for each fiscal year until 2021. The Office of Management and Budget determines the GDP outlay limit in the President's budget, including all federal outlays in the calculation. Federal outlays, both on-budget and off-budget, are subject to sequestration enforcement as per the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985. Certain programs such as military personnel accounts, TRICARE for Life, Medicare, military retirement, Social Security, veterans, and net interest are exempt from this section. SEC. 320 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 prohibits exceeding current GDP outlay limits in the House of Representatives or the Senate. TITLE III--BALANCE\n\nSec. 301 requires a balanced budget amendment to be submitted to states. The Secretary of the Treasury cannot borrow more until the Archivist of the United States transmits a balanced budget amendment to the States, with specific requirements for spending limitations and tax increases. A balanced budget amendment to the Constitution is proposed, with spending limitations as a percentage of GDP and a requirement for tax increases to be approved by a two-thirds vote in Congress. The current dollar limitation in section 3101(b) of title 31, United States Code, is replaced with $16,700,000,000,000. The House of Representatives passed the balanced budget amendment on July 19, 2011. Karen L. Haas attested to it as the Clerk."
