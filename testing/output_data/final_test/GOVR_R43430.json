    "content": "Established as part of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, the Sustainable Growth Rate (SGR) determines annual updates to the Medicare physician fee schedule. If actual expenditures exceed the target, future updates are reduced to align spending. Actual expenditures began exceeding targets in 2002, leading to a growing discrepancy. Congress has enacted laws to address this issue, with exceptions like a 4.8% decrease in 2002. Since 2002, Congress has passed 17 laws to override reductions in the Medicare physician fee schedule, with short-term \"patches\" lasting from one month to two years. These laws either maintained current payment levels or increased them by 0.2% to 2.2%. When actual spending exceeds target spending, the excess must be recouped to align with targets under the Sustainable Growth Rate system. Under the Sustainable Growth Rate (SGR) system, Congress has passed multiple laws to override reductions in the Medicare physician fee schedule to align actual spending with target spending. The SGR system includes a limit on payment level changes to prevent disruptive impacts. However, overrides have led to cumulative overages, necessitating a different approach to control Medicare physician expenditures. Medicare physician expenditures have consistently exceeded the target level set by law, leading to the need for overrides to control spending. The overrides have resulted in a growing period required to recoup the overage, with recent estimates showing significant rate reductions following short-term adjustments. In recent years, CMS actuaries have estimated \"cliff\" reductions of 27.4% (for January 1, 2012), 26.5% (for January 1, 2013), and 20.1% (for January 1, 2014), each averted by congressional action through various legislative acts. Medicare is restricted from paying claims before specific timeframes, requiring overrides to control spending due to consistent physician expenditure exceeding target levels. The SGR payment override required retroactive action by Congress in the third instance. The problem persists due to lack of consensus on long-term alternatives and the daunting cost of permanent changes. Any increase in spending would result in higher Part B beneficiary premiums. The lack of a viable alternative payment model has hindered efforts to repeal the SGR system, which was created to replace a failed system that couldn't control Medicare physician expenditure growth. Repealing the SGR would require a new method for adjusting Medicare physician payments annually, but so far, no successful update methodology has been found. The current fee-for-service payment system could potentially be replaced with an \"SGR-type\" methodology for payments under alternate systems. An \"SGR-type\" methodology could be used for payments under alternate payment systems, such as bundled payments, capitation payments, or incentive-based payments. Efforts to repeal the SGR system have been closely tied to Medicare physician payment reform due to the shortcomings of fee-for-service payment. The lack of successful alternative payment models has hindered progress in repealing the SGR system. The CBO estimates the potential impact of repealing or fixing the SGR system on federal spending, with projections ranging from $177.4 billion to $330.5 billion over 10 years. Recent estimates show fluctuations in costs, with 2015 projections increasing. Efforts to replace the SGR system have faced challenges due to the lack of successful alternative payment models. The CBO released a report in 2013 stating that the cost of overriding the SGR with a 10-year freeze in payments had fallen to $138.0 billion from $273.3 billion in 2012 estimates. Holding payment rates through 2023 at 2013 levels would increase Medicare outlays by $14 billion in 2014 and $138 billion between 2014 and 2023. This reduced cost is attributed to lower spending for physicians' services in recent years. The CBO estimates that payment rates will increase in 2015 due to lower spending than projected. The cost of a 10-year freeze in payment levels has been estimated at $139.1 billion in May 2013, $116.5 billion in December 2013, $118.9 billion in November 2014, and the latest estimate is yet to be released in February 2015. The CBO released estimates on the cost of freezing MPFS payment levels for 11 years, ranging from $137.4 billion to $191.8 billion. Committees passed bills in 2013 to repeal the SGR system for Medicare physician payment updates. The Ways and Means Committee passed H.R. 2810, the Medicare Patient Access and Quality Improvement Act of 2013, by unanimous voice vote. The bill aims to provide payment stability, develop new payment systems, and create incentives for physicians to transition to the new payment systems over time. The bills aim to establish criteria for new payment systems, with a focus on provider participation, beneficiary attraction, and spending reduction while maintaining quality of care. S. 1871 includes health care program extenders, while H.R. 2810 includes provisions on medical malpractice claims. None of the bills have budgetary offsets. H.R. 4015 and S. 2000 propose payment increases for Medicare physicians before freezing payments for five years. Changes in payment levels would be based on factors like participation in alternative payment models and provider performance in the Merit-Based Incentive Payment System. The Medicare SGR Repeal and Beneficiary Access Improvement Act of 2014 introduced payment rate increases for providers in alternate payment models, with higher increases for APMs compared to the FFS/MIPS system. Various bills like S. 2110 and H.R. 4015 were passed to address Medicare payment issues, with different cost estimates provided by the CBO. The CBO scored various bills like H.R. 2810, S. 2000, H.R. 4015, and S. 2110, estimating increases in direct federal spending over an 11-year period. The estimates ranged from $121 billion to $180.2 billion, with updates reflecting changes in legislation and rules. The House bill H.R. 4015, passed on March 14, 2014, proposed delaying the penalty for the individual mandate under the ACA for five years. The CBO estimated a reduction in direct federal spending by $31.1 billion over 11 years, with the delay of the mandate offsetting the cost of the SGR repeal provisions. The offsetting of doc fix bills has varied over the years, with some bills including provisions to extend expiring health care programs. The doc fix bills have included provisions to extend expiring health care programs. S. 2110 and S. 1871 contain health care program extenders, while S. 2000, H.R. 2810, and H.R. 4015 do not include any provisions for extending expiring health care programs. The Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014 included some health program extenders. The Pathway for SGR Reform Act of 2013 provided for a 0.5% increase in MPFS payments. The Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014 extended this override through March 31, 2015. The Energy and Commerce Committee held a hearing on finding a permanent solution to the SGR. There was no consensus on how to offset the cost. Bipartisan discussions are ongoing to resolve the SGR issue and strengthen Medicare. To address the SGR issue and strengthen Medicare, bipartisan discussions are ongoing in Congress. If an agreement is not reached on a bill signed by the President, a temporary patch may be needed to prevent a reduction in the MPFS on April 1, 2015."
