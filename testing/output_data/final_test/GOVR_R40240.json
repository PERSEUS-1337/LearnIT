    "content": "The U.S. Constitution mandates that money can only be withdrawn from the Treasury through Appropriations made by Law. Congress has established separate committees for authorization and appropriation processes, including for intelligence spending. This report discusses the effects of the absence of intelligence authorization legislation since FY2005 and the impact of recent intelligence authorization acts. Despite the lack of specific authorization legislation, statutory requirements have been met through catchall provisions in appropriations acts. The absence of intelligence authorization legislation since FY2005 has led to the use of catchall provisions in appropriations acts. Congress did not compromise on important issues, impacting oversight of intelligence activities and the nation's intelligence effort. Congress typically authorizes agencies or programs before appropriating funds, but the process has been altered without authorization legislation. The separation of authorization and appropriations legislation allows different committees to focus on program needs and overall finances. Authorizing committees specialize in agency programs, while appropriations committees allocate funds within a budget total. Authorization committees have staff for detailed evaluations and monitoring, while appropriations committees are more limited in staff and do not delve into detailed activities of government departments. In the 1960s, defense programs led to annual authorization of the nation's defense effort, expanding to include policy directions for military activities. Defense authorization bills ensure continuous congressional oversight of the Defense Department. In the 1970s, intelligence agencies also established similar procedures for oversight. The National Security Act of 1947 provided a standing authorization for the CIA, which was deemed sufficient for over a quarter century. However, in the mid-1970s, Congress created the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence to address concerns about secretive and questionable activities of intelligence agencies. These committees were tasked with providing oversight and ensuring that no funds would be expended by national intelligence agencies without proper authorization. In 1985, Section 504 of the National Security Act tightened the requirement for intelligence agencies to use appropriated funds only if specifically authorized by Congress. The appropriations committees began deferring more to the intelligence committees for oversight. The intelligence committees have extensive staffs and conduct classified and unclassified hearings on intelligence activities. Most intelligence spending is appropriated by defense appropriations legislation. The first intelligence authorization bill that became law was for FY1979. The intelligence authorization bill for FY1979 (P.L. 95-370) became law, marking the first time such a bill was enacted. Subsequent annual intelligence authorization bills were passed from FY1979 to FY2005, often signed well into the fiscal year. In cases where appropriations legislation passed before intelligence authorization bills, Congress used a \"catchall\" provision in defense appropriations acts to meet the requirement for specific authorization of intelligence activities. For example, Section 8080 of the Consolidated Security, Disaster, and Continuing Appropriations Act, 2009 (P.L. 110-329) allowed for funds for intelligence activities. The provision in the Act authorizes intelligence activities for fiscal year 2009 until the Intelligence Authorization Act is enacted. Similar provisions have been used in previous defense appropriation acts to meet the requirement for specific authorization of intelligence activities. This practice allows for a concise substitute for lengthy authorization bills. The Intelligence Authorization Act for FY2005 provided extensive guidance for intelligence agencies and addressed important issues, including Senate confirmation requirements for key positions. The executive branch considers congressional concerns, but report language in intelligence bills does not have the same effect as enacted legislation. The Intelligence Authorization Act for FY2005 provided guidance for intelligence agencies, including Senate confirmation requirements. The Senate bill for FY2009 aimed to give the DNI more flexibility in coordinating the intelligence community's response to emerging threats. It included provisions for an Inspector General for the entire intelligence community and a Space Intelligence Center, but these bills did not become law. The Intelligence Authorization Act for FY2005 provided guidance for intelligence agencies, including Senate confirmation requirements. In 2009, bills were introduced in both the House and Senate for intelligence authorization for FY2010, with provisions for Senate confirmation of intelligence leaders and a statutory inspector general for the intelligence community. However, disagreements over notifications of covert actions led to the House bill not being considered. The FY2010 intelligence authorization legislation eventually became law without specific authorization of intelligence programs. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 established the position of DNI with broad authorities over all intelligence agencies to improve coordination and acquisition of intelligence. The DNI is responsible for preparing and executing the National Intelligence Program. The Intelligence Reform Act of 2004 created the position of DNI with broader responsibilities over all intelligence agencies, separate from the CIA Director. The NIP includes funding for major intelligence agencies like the CIA, NSA, NRO, and NGA, while the MIP supports the Department of Defense. Most intelligence agencies serve both national and military consumers, with the largest agencies, except the CIA, being part of the DOD. The DNI prepares a consolidated NIP approved by the White House and forwarded to Congress as part of the annual budget submission. The intelligence committees review the NIP, hold hearings, and prepare authorization legislation. The armed services committees also review national intelligence programs undertaken by DOD agencies. Rules allow some Members to serve on both armed services and intelligence committees to encourage cooperation. Intelligence authorization bills provide Congress with a means to oversee the entire intelligence effort from a broader perspective than the Defense Department. The challenge in overseeing intelligence activities lies in outdated budgeting and acquisition procedures designed during the Cold War era. Today, intelligence agencies serve a diverse range of government consumers, with systems like reconnaissance satellites producing information of direct interest to various agencies. Military intelligence systems produce information for military commanders, federal offices, and state/local officials, especially regarding terrorist threats. Tactical military intelligence is used by a single military service but may also be relevant to national-level policymakers in crisis situations. The cost of intelligence activities for national-level consumers was $53.9 billion in FY2012, with military intelligence adding billions more. The House and Senate intelligence committees review the National Intelligence Program (NIP), with differing oversight responsibilities. The House committee authorizes intelligence activities for all government departments, including the Department of Defense, while the Senate committee does not oversee tactical intelligence, which falls under the Senate Armed Services Committee. Post-9/11 reforms aim to shift from agency-centric practices to a unified Intelligence enterprise. The intelligence community is transitioning from agency-centric practices to a collaborative foundation of shared services and integrated mission management. It must now address a wider range of national security concerns, including infectious diseases, science and technology surprises, financial contagions, and cyber attacks. This evolution will require capabilities beyond the Department of Defense. The focus of intelligence collection efforts has expanded beyond military concerns, with significant budget implications for overhead collection systems. The cost of technical collection and processing systems, such as satellites, is very high, with some programs facing major disputes over budgets. For example, a classified satellite program saw its cost nearly double from $5 billion to $9.5 billion, despite opposition from the Senate Intelligence Committee. The Senate Intelligence Committee criticized a classified satellite program for nearly doubling in cost from $5 billion to $9.5 billion. The program was eventually terminated in March 2008. A report from the House Intelligence Committee in October 2008 highlighted the lack of a comprehensive space architecture or strategic plan for national security priorities. There was also a noted disagreement between the intelligence community and the Department of Defense over satellite program requirements. The House Intelligence Committee's report criticizes satellite programs funded by both the NIP and the Military Intelligence Program, highlighting disagreements within the DOD over surveillance programs. The Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics has authority over DOD acquisitions, not the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence. This lack of control can lead to decisions on jointly funded programs that may not equally benefit national and military interests. Congressional oversight committees have proposed different organizational structures to address these challenges, such as establishing a separate space program office for combatant commanders. The intelligence committees ensure coherence in intelligence acquisition efforts through annual authorization bills. Proposals for responsive space systems may overlap with existing intelligence programs. Differences in approaches within DOD between the USD(I) and the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics have been noted. The Senate-passed version of S. 3001 addresses these issues. The Senate-passed version of S. 3001, the FY2009 Defense Authorization Act, removed a provision that restricted the USD(I) from establishing technology or systems development capabilities. Instead, the act requires the Secretary of Defense to establish a policy and acquisition strategy for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance systems for manned and unmanned aerial vehicles. The DOD report on integrated research, development, and procurement commonality is to be provided to the armed services and intelligence committees. A comprehensive review of the nation's space policy, including current and planned space acquisition programs, was required by P.L. 110-417. The executive branch's preparation of a comprehensive space architecture would involve the intelligence committees in reviewing and authorizing necessary programs and personnel. Other committees, such as armed services and appropriations, would also play a role in assessing and modifying recommendations. Congress returned to the issue in FY2011 Defense Authorization legislation, requiring the Secretary of Defense and the DNI to develop an integrated process for national security space architecture planning. Concerns about congressional intelligence oversight effectiveness have been raised, with the 9/11 Commission emphasizing the need for a strong and capable committee structure for oversight and support of national intelligence agencies. The 9/11 Commission recommended creating a joint intelligence committee or separate House and Senate committees with combined powers. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 established the position of DNI with broad authorities over intelligence agencies, but Congress has not implemented all recommendations. The Senate Intelligence Committee held a hearing in November 2007 to address concerns about oversight of U.S. intelligence activities. Former Members of Congress Lee Hamilton and Timothy Roemer, who served on the 9/11 Commission, expressed worries about the current oversight process. Hamilton emphasized the importance of robust oversight for national security. The 9/11 Commission's oversight proposals have not been adopted by Congress. Instead, attempts were made to strengthen oversight within the appropriations committees of the House and Senate. In response to concerns about oversight of U.S. intelligence activities, Congress has made changes to the existing oversight structure. This includes establishing subcommittees on intelligence within the appropriations committees, increasing the auditing authority of the Government Accountability Office, and adding offices of inspector general to elements of the intelligence community. However, the overall structure of intelligence oversight remains a work in progress. The current annual intelligence authorization process is a crucial opportunity for Congress to strengthen its oversight role in the intelligence community. Despite persistent interest in enacting intelligence authorization legislation during the 111th Congress, significant issues made agreement difficult. A House bill (H.R. 2701) was reported by the House Intelligence Committee in June 2009. A House bill (H.R. 2701) and a Senate version (S. 1494) were reported in 2009, with the Senate version passing in September. After discussions, a new Senate bill (S. 3611) was passed in August 2010 and incorporated into H.R. 2701, which was signed into law as P.L. 111-259 in October 2010. The legislation addressed issues related to covert actions and was not initially supported by the Administration. The legislation addressed issues related to covert actions, including appropriate notification of Members of Congress and oversight roles. Provisions provoked veto threats from the Administration, leading to extensive discussions in 2010. Difficulties arose with provisions affecting the DNI and Secretary of Defense authorities, as well as the intelligence oversight role of the GAO. Congressional efforts to oversee detention and interrogation practices after 9/11 and establish penalties for certain interrogation techniques were major points of disagreement. The Supplemental Appropriations Act of 2010, P.L. 111-212 did not include a classified annex for FY2010. It addressed covert action notification and established the Inspector General for the intelligence community. Provisions in the final FY2010 bill focused on DNI authorities, including conducting accountability reviews, vulnerability assessments, and extending details within the intelligence community. The final bill for FY2010 included provisions on DNI authorities and GAO audit authority, with the scope of GAO access left at the discretion of the DNI. In the 112th Congress, there was a push to pass intelligence authorization legislation, resulting in the passage of H.R. 754, the intelligence authorization bill for FY2011 by the House in May. The intelligence authorization bill for FY2011, H.R. 754, was passed by the House in May 2011 and signed into law as P.L. 112-18 on June 8, 2011. It included provisions related to counterintelligence concerns, recruitment of minorities, and commending the intelligence community for the mission that killed Osama Bin Laden. In December 2011, both the House and Senate passed the intelligence authorization bill for FY2012, H.R. 1892, which was signed into law as P.L. 112-87 on January 3, 2012. The FY2012 intelligence authorization bill, signed into law on January 3, 2012, included provisions for burial allowances for civilian employees of intelligence agencies and the establishment of accounts for transferring funds for Defense intelligence efforts. The 112th Congress passed its last intelligence authorization bill in 2012. The Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence passed H.R. 5743, its intelligence authorization bill for FY2013, with a unanimous vote. The bill includes $300 million for new initiatives and $400 million for intelligence enhancements, increasing funding for counterintelligence, authorizing the Defense Clandestine Service, enhancing counterterrorism efforts against Al Qaeda, and increasing oversight on domestic intelligence agency spending. The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence agreed to the text of S. 3454 on July 24, 2012. The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence passed S. 3454, the Intelligence Authorization Act for FY2013, with a vote of 14-1. The bill prohibits individuals with security clearances from entering into contracts with the media for analysis on classified intelligence activities, and restricts such contracts for one year after leaving government service. Only designated personnel can provide information to the media on intelligence activities. The Director of National Intelligence is requested to establish specific requirements for personnel with access to classified information. The Intelligence Authorization Act for FY2013 includes measures such as non-disclosure agreements, prepublication review, and disciplinary actions. The Attorney General must report on the effectiveness of investigating unauthorized disclosures and potential improvements. The intelligence community is required to develop an insider threat program management plan. Violating a non-disclosure agreement results in denial of federal pension. Security clearances cannot be retained if classified information is knowingly disclosed. The report expressed grave concerns about unauthorized disclosures of classified information. The Intelligence Authorization Act for FY2013 includes measures such as non-disclosure agreements, prepublication review, and disciplinary actions. Senator Wyden objected to Section 511, allowing the DNI and heads of the intelligence community to deny federal pensions to individuals who violate their non-disclosure agreement. Director of National Intelligence James Clapper also raised concerns about this section and asked for its removal. In December 2012, the House and Senate passed S. 3454, the Intelligence Authorization Act. The Intelligence Authorization Act for FY2013, signed into law in January 2013, focused on transforming the U.S. intelligence community to a collaborative enterprise. The final bill dropped provisions related to unauthorized disclosure of classified information. In addition to traditional threats, the intelligence community now faces new challenges like infectious diseases, science surprises, and economic competition. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention of 2004 created an \"intelligence community\" that spans multiple jurisdictions and involves various agencies collaborating on issues such as science and technology surprises, financial contagions, economic competition, environmental issues, energy interdependence and security, cyber attacks, threats to global commerce, and transnational crime. Congressional oversight and funding responsibilities are divided agency-by-agency and committee-by-committee, presenting challenges in assessing interagency efforts and making tradeoffs and adjustments to Administration plans. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 established an \"intelligence community\" that spans multiple jurisdictions. Congress has not agreed on key oversight proposals, such as creating a joint committee for intelligence. DNI James Clapper highlighted the need to adjust to new budget realities. The National Intelligence Program is being spread across various departments and agencies. DNI James Clapper seeks support to reprogram funds to mitigate budget cuts. Congress plays a crucial oversight role in the altered intelligence environment. Intelligence authorization legislation is seen as a key tool for addressing interagency efforts. The intelligence committees have comprehensive information on intelligence activities, including those independent of DOD. In the absence of intelligence authorization legislation, critics argue that Congress does not adjust funding based on a comprehensive assessment of intelligence agencies. Some believe this leads to imbalances and weakens the overall intelligence effort, while others argue that the executive branch can efficiently manage funds without congressional micromanagement. Intelligence authorization bills were passed for FY2011, FY2012, and FY2013 in the 112th Congress, indicating a continued need for such legislation."
