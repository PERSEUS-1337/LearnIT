A new method called \"Task Level Data Augmentation\" increases image classes instead of images, leading to better performance on few-shot learning benchmarks. Few-shot learning is a challenge for modern machine learning techniques, where the goal is to maximize generalization accuracy with few training examples. Tasks are generated by sampling from a classification dataset, with training and testing examples randomly selected from different classes. The machine learning community has focused on this problem, with benchmarks like CIFAR-FS and FC100. Once accepted, the paper will provide a link to the code. Meta-learning methods are used to control the learning process of a base learner for correct classification on testing examples. Data augmentation, such as adding noises and translations, is widely used to improve training of deep learning models by artificially generating training data. The aim is to increase the number of data by slightly changing it while still being recognizable by humans. In meta-learning, the minimum units are tasks rather than data. \"Task Aug\" increases data diversity for better model prediction on unseen classes. Natural images are rotated for augmentation. The method is evaluated with state-of-the-art meta-learning methods. The experimental results show that Task Aug improves performance and reduces overfitting in meta-learning compared to conventional data augmentation methods. Task Aug achieves the best accuracy among meta-learning methods and surpasses the current state-of-the-art results by a large margin. Meta-learning involves two hierarchies of learning processes: low-level for general tasks and high-level for improving performance. In meta-learning, different machine learning methods are applied for the \"inner loop\" to handle diverse tasks such as image recognition, image generation, and reinforcement learning. This study focuses on few-shot learning image recognition using meta-learning, where methods like K-nearest neighbor, Support Vector Machine, and ridge regression are applied in the \"inner loop\" to classify data. In few-shot learning from deep learning, popular regularization techniques like weight decay, dropout, label smooth, and data augmentation are used. Common data augmentation techniques for image recognition include random cropping, random horizontal flipping, and color jitter. These techniques are applied in natural color image datasets for few-shot learning tasks. Other data augmentation methods for few-shot learning involve generating additional examples through transfer learning. In few-shot learning, data augmentation techniques like transferring, extracting, and encoding are used to create new class data. Meta-learning is also applied for few-shot generation. The closest approach to the new proposed method is applied to the Omniglot dataset, rotating images to create novel classes. However, this method cannot be directly applied to natural color images. The formulation describes the N-way K-shot task, where task instances are classified data sampled from N classes split into training, validation, and test sets. Each task instance includes training and validation examples from the N classes for model selection and evaluation. The training and validation examples are sampled from N classes for the N-way K-shot task. The training set consists of K data instances from each class, while the validation set includes additional data instances from the same classes. The goal is to increase the size of the training classes set by rotating images within the set. The size of the training classes set is increased by rotating images within the set to provide useful information for novel images. However, this approach may not work well for natural images as it is difficult to identify rotated images in photos taken by humans. Novel classes are assigned smaller weights to prioritize learning the features of original classes. The training classes set is expanded by rotating images to aid in learning features of original classes. Novel classes are given smaller weights to prevent them from dominating the model's capacity. The probability of a class coming from novel classes is gradually increased over T task instances. This process is detailed in Algorithm 1 and Figure 2. Comparisons are made with ensemble methods in addition to standard training protocols. The training protocol includes an ensemble method using models with different training epochs. The approach of averaging predictions from all models without cyclic annealing or model selection methods has been proven effective for meta-learning. The proposed method evaluates few-shot learning tasks using an ensemble approach marked by \"+ens\". The experiment compares Task Augmentation with baseline results using a ResNet-12 network with four residual blocks. The network includes convolution, batch normalization, Leaky ReLU, and max-pooling layers. The study aims to improve meta-learning performance and determine the impact of converting novel data into original classes. The network channels had numbers 64, 160, 320, and 640. DropBlock regularization was used in the last two residual blocks, while conventional dropout was used in the first two blocks. Different block sizes of DropBlock were set for CIFAR and ImageNet derivatives. Global average pooling was not used for the final output. Different approaches were used for ProtoNets and M-SVM in terms of shot numbers and regularization parameters. The SVM parameter was set to 0.1, and a learnable scale was used. Label smoothing was not used as it did not improve performance. R2-D2 had the same training shot as M-SVM, with a fixed regularization parameter of 50. Each class in a task instance had 6 test examples during training and 15 during testing. SGD was used with weight decay and Nesterov momentum set to 0.0005 and 0.9. Each mini-batch contained 8 task instances. The meta-learning model was trained for 60 epochs with Nesterov momentum set to 0.0005 and 0.9. Each mini-batch contained 8 task instances. The initial learning rate was 0.1, with adjustments at epochs 20, 40, and 50. Data augmentation included random crop, horizontal flip, and color jitter. The final run used an ensemble model and augmented training classes with validation classes. In the study, the meta-learning model was trained with specific parameters and data augmentation techniques. The goal was to minimize information overlap between classes for more challenging few-shot classification tasks. Results showed improved accuracies compared to previous studies. Results on CIFAR-FS and FC100 5-way tasks show our method improves accuracy by 0.5%-3%. Task Aug outperforms Data Aug and baseline. Experiment on rotation multi 90 degrees shows accuracy peaks between 0.25 and 0.5, then declines. The proportion of novel classes in all classes reaches a maximum of 0.75. Rotation by 90 degrees for Data Augmentation does not improve performance and can even lead to worse results."
