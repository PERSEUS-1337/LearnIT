Congress increased funding for global malaria in FY2008 and created the U.S. Global Malaria Coordinator at USAID. President Obama also emphasized combating malaria in his Global Health Initiative (GHI). Malaria is transmitted through infected mosquitoes, infecting red blood cells and causing symptoms like fever and vomiting. It is preventable and curable but can be fatal if untreated. Malaria is a preventable and curable disease transmitted through infected mosquitoes, causing symptoms like fever and vomiting. The World Health Organization estimates that half of the world's population is at risk of malaria infection, with 106 countries being malaria-endemic. In 2010, there were approximately 216 million cases of malaria worldwide, with a decrease in reported cases since 2000. Malaria deaths declined from 985,000 in 2000 to 655,000 in 2010, with roughly 86% of deaths occurring among children under five. Global malaria mortality has decreased since 2000. Since 2000, global malaria mortality has decreased by 26%, with the majority of cases and deaths concentrated in the African, South-East Asian, and Eastern Mediterranean regions. In 2010, 81% of malaria cases and 91% of deaths occurred in the WHO Africa region, with 43 malaria-endemic countries. The WHO Southeast Asia region accounted for 13% of cases and 6% of deaths, with India, Myanmar, and Indonesia making up 94% of cases. The WHO Eastern Mediterranean region had 5% of cases and 3% of deaths, with Sudan, Pakistan, Yemen, and Afghanistan comprising 97% of cases. The international community uses four strategies to combat malaria: Treatment with anti-malarial drugs like chloroquine and ACT, IPTp for pregnant women, and ITNs to repel mosquitoes. ACT resistance is a concern in Asia. High community coverage of ITNs can reduce mosquitoes and their lifespan. ITNs last up to six months, while LLINs last for at least three years. IRS involves insecticide on household walls to kill mosquitoes. Resistance to insecticides is a concern. Research on malaria vaccines is ongoing, with over a dozen candidates in development. President Bill Clinton signed the Assistance for International Malaria Control Act in 2000, authorizing $50 million per year for FY2001. The Malaria Control Act (P.L. 106-570) authorized $50 million per year for FY2001 and FY2002 for anti-malaria activities in countries with high malaria prevalence. President George W. Bush signed the United States Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act of 2003 (Leadership Act, P.L. 108-25) which allocated $15 billion for global HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria programs from FY2004 through FY2008. The act recognized malaria control as a major foreign policy objective and limited U.S. contributions to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria to 33% of funds contributed from all sources. The Hyde U.S. Global Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Reauthorization Act of 2008 authorized $48 billion for global HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria programs from FY2008 through FY2013, including $5 billion for malaria programs over five years. It created the position of U.S. Global Malaria Coordinator at USAID to oversee all U.S. anti-malaria efforts and develop a strategic plan. The legislation will be up for reauthorization in FY2013, building on U.S. support for global malaria control efforts since the 1950s and the President's Malaria Initiative in 2005. The President's Malaria Initiative (PMI) was established in 2005 as a $1.2 billion effort to reduce malaria-related deaths by 50% in 15 high-burden focus countries. PMI has since expanded to four other malaria-endemic countries in Africa and is run by USAID and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). USAID coordinates malaria efforts with CDC, DOD, and NIH. Oversight is shared with an Interagency Steering Group. President Obama supports an expanded U.S. malaria program through the Global Health Initiative (GHI), with malaria as a priority area. PMI is a key component of the GHI. The Global Health Initiative (GHI) aims to integrate U.S. responses to global health issues, including malaria, maternal, and child health programs. The U.S. global health strategy is shifting towards a more comprehensive approach, focusing on health system strengthening. In April 2010, a joint U.S. Government Malaria Strategy was released to advance GHI goals, with key targets to halve the burden of malaria in at-risk populations by 2014. The U.S. Global Health Initiative aims to integrate responses to global health issues, including malaria. The joint U.S. Government Malaria Strategy aims to halve the burden of malaria in at-risk populations. U.S. agencies supporting global malaria control efforts include USAID and CDC, focusing on key areas like IRS, ITNs, IPTp, diagnosis, treatment, and pesticide management. The CDC, DOD, and NIH are key U.S. agencies supporting global malaria control efforts. CDC focuses on monitoring, evaluation, disease surveillance, and capacity development. DOD supports malaria research, including treatment and vaccine development. NIH's NIAID leads malaria research, focusing on prevention, treatment, and control tools. The United States Congress allocates funds for malaria prevention, treatment, and research through various agencies such as USAID, CDC, DOD, and NIH. Funding for malaria interventions has increased significantly since FY2007 to support PMI expansion into new countries. The U.S. also contributes to global malaria programs through the Global Fund, which supports grants for HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria. The United States is the largest donor to the Global Fund, supporting grants for HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria. WHO reports that donor assistance, national government spending, and household expenditures are the main sources of funding for malaria control. The Global Fund is a major contributor to global malaria efforts, accounting for approximately 50% of international funds in 2010. International disbursements for malaria peaked in 2011. Disbursements for global malaria peaked in 2011. The United States partners with various organizations to combat malaria, including the Global Fund and the World Bank. The Global Fund, established in 2002, provides significant financial support for HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria. The World Bank launched a program for Malaria Control in Africa in 2005. The World Bank Booster Program for Malaria Control in Africa was launched in 2005, implemented in 18 countries to scale up malaria interventions and strengthen procurement and supply-chain capacity. The World Health Organization (WHO) shapes global health research, sets norms, and provides technical support. The WHO's Global Malaria Program promotes policies and guidelines, offers technical assistance, and supports research. The Roll Back Malaria (RBM) Partnership, created in 1998, collaborates with WHO and UNICEF to combat malaria. The RBM Partnership, established in 1998 by WHO, UNICEF, UNDP, and the World Bank, coordinates malaria activities with 500 partners. UNICEF supports malaria programs by assisting in national plans, monitoring, and distributing malaria commodities. The American Red Cross, UNICEF, and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation are key players in supporting global malaria programming and commodity procurement. The Gates Foundation aims to develop a malaria vaccine by 2025. The 112th Congress will need to address issues such as funding allocation for global malaria efforts. Progress has been made in combating global malaria with international assistance. Significant progress has been made in combating global malaria with international assistance, leading to a decrease in cases and deaths worldwide. However, challenges such as drug-resistant malaria and insecticide-resistant mosquitoes threaten this progress, especially in Southeast Asia and Africa. Efforts to address these challenges include improving drug quality control, resistance monitoring, and research for new malaria drugs. Weak health systems also hinder global malaria control efforts. Weak health systems have been a major impediment to successful malaria prevention and treatment, with shortages in health care personnel and weak supply chain networks limiting essential commodities delivery. There is debate within the global health community over the degree to which the international community should commit to malaria control or elimination efforts. While the global health community debates between committing to malaria control or elimination efforts, experts argue for a shift towards disease elimination. Key issues include countries' capacity for ambitious programs, predictability of donor assistance, and avoiding negative consequences like increased resistance."
