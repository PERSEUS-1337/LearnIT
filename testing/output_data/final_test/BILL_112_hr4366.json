    "content": "The \"Project Ready STEM Act\" is the short title of this legislation. Congress finds that minorities are significantly underrepresented in the science and engineering workforce in the United States, with only 4 percent of the Black population and slightly over 4 percent of the Hispanic population participating in STEM fields. Despite stagnant numbers of STEM degrees awarded, employment projections show a 17-percent growth in STEM fields over the next decade. Additionally, while 20 percent of Black college students start with STEM majors, only 15 percent graduate with a STEM degree. Nearly a quarter of Black public school students are interested in STEM but lack proficiency in math. Since 1990, math scores on assessments by the National Assessment of Education Progress have increased for all students, but White students score 26 points higher than Black and Hispanic students. After school programs help address the achievement gap in underserved communities, with 8,400,000 students enrolled. Ethnic minority children are more likely to participate, with 15% of all students enrolled, compared to 24% of Black students and 21% of Hispanic students. The purpose of this Act is to prepare students for opportunities in STEM fields through after school, summer, and weekend programs. 24% of Black students and 21% of Hispanic students are enrolled in such programs. The Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1964 is amended to include STEM grants under Title II. A new subpart for STEM Grants is added, including the Project Ready STEM Grant Program. The Secretary is authorized to award 'Project Ready STEM Program' grants to national intermediaries for after school, summer, and weekend STEM education programs. Applicants must submit detailed proposals including funding requests and program descriptions. The Project Ready STEM Program grant applicants must provide a program description, evidence of serving underrepresented students in STEM, and plans for student recruitment, retention, and parental engagement. The Project Ready STEM Program grant applicants must provide a program description, evidence of serving underrepresented students in STEM, plans for student recruitment, retention, parental engagement, professional development for staff, collaboration with higher education institutions, and enabling student achievement of program goals. The Project Ready STEM Program aims to provide science education and tools to underrepresented students in STEM fields, increase enrollment in STEM coursework, promote grade advancement, and raise awareness of STEM career opportunities. The national intermediary receiving a grant must allocate funds for technical assistance, subgrants to effective STEM programs for underrepresented students, and expanding STEM programs. The national intermediary must allocate funds for technical assistance, subgrants to community-based affiliates for developing new STEM programs, and expanding existing STEM programs. Community-based affiliates seeking subgrants must submit applications containing required information to the national intermediary. Subgrants are intended for operating Project Ready STEM Programs focusing on STEM education during after school, summer, or weekend programs. The weekend program focuses on STEM education for underrepresented students and includes educational services, project-based learning, individualized instruction, and collaboration with community-based affiliates. The program focuses on STEM education for underrepresented students and includes collaboration with higher education institutions. Reports are required to track progress towards program goals. The community-based affiliates operating Project Ready STEM Programs must submit annual reports to the national intermediary detailing their progress towards achieving program goals. Definitions for terms like \"community-based affiliate\" are provided in this section. The term 'affiliate' refers to a community-based organization affiliated with a national intermediary. The national intermediary is a nonprofit organization with a network of affiliates in at least 50 urban communities, expertise in overseeing programs for middle and high school students, and a presence in 25 states for 20 years. 'Project-based learning' is defined as learning through a comprehensive project. The term 'project-based learning' refers to learning through a broad project that includes instruction, substantive content, and reflection, with the goal of achieving a concrete goal or completing a project. Authorization of appropriations is provided for fiscal years 2013 to 2016."
