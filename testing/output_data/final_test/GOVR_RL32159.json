    "content": "A well-prepared grant proposal is carefully planned and packaged. Grant seekers should familiarize themselves with program criteria, deadlines, and application processes. Requirements and procedures vary among funding agencies and foundations, with some having formal application packets and strict guidelines, while others may operate more informally and provide assistance to inexperienced grant seekers. Individuals without prior grant proposal writing experience may benefit from attending grantsmanship classes or workshops. They can also seek assistance from state offices, larger nonprofit organizations, or foundations in their state. Local governments can obtain grant writing help from a state's office of Council of Governments (CSG) or Regional Council. The primary mission of CSG is to promote and strengthen state government by providing staff services to organizations of state officials. The first step in proposal planning is to develop a clear description of the project that aligns with the grant-seeking organization's mission. The proposal should include the project's goals, needs, anticipated outcomes, how it will be conducted, timetable, evaluation measures, staffing needs, and a preliminary budget. When developing a proposal, it is important to consider existing programs in the locality or state to avoid duplication of effort. Checking with state legislators, local government, and relevant agencies is crucial. If a similar program exists, reevaluating the proposed project is necessary. However, if significant differences or improvements can be established, seeking federal or private foundation assistance may be worthwhile. Community support is essential for many proposals. Community support is crucial for proposals, with letters of endorsement detailing project sanction and commitments often requested. Support can be sought from various organizations and public officials, with letters from Members of Congress requested upon proposal completion. Developing letters of endorsement may take several months, as negotiations for resources may be involved. When submitting a proposal, consider nonmonetary contributions from academic institutions, corporations, and nonprofit groups in the community. Such support can reduce the amount of money needed and is viewed favorably by grant-making agencies. Affiliation agreements and building space commitments may be required before grant approval. Generating community support can be done through a citizen advisory committee or meetings with community leaders. The forum for the proposal involves meetings with community leaders to discuss merits, develop a strategy for support, and gather data. Researching appropriate funding sources is crucial, and proposals should align with the interests of grant-making agencies for better chances of funding. Casting a wide but targeted net is recommended for seeking support. An applicant seeking funding should cast a targeted net, utilizing federal, state, and local programs, as well as grants from private foundations. The best funding resources are online, including federal Assistance Listings and the Foundation Center. For a summary of federal programs, refer to CRS Report RL34012. Review program descriptions for objectives and uses. Program descriptions from government or private foundations can help identify potential funding sources for projects. Past funded projects can provide insight for grant proposals. Federal grants may be distributed through state or local agencies, so checking state government sites for funding opportunities is recommended. Grantseekers should explore state government websites for funding opportunities, as each state handles subawarding differently. Different types of foundations exist, such as national, family, community, and corporate foundations. It is advisable to seek funding sources close to home for district or community projects, as they are often more focused on solving local issues. Most foundations only provide grants to nonprofit organizations with 501(c) tax-exempt status. Grant seekers can identify potential grantor agencies or foundations through the Foundation Center. They can request grant application kits or information from the agencies. Federal agencies may direct applicants to Grants.gov for more information. Seeking feedback and advice from agency or foundation personnel can improve the chances of receiving support. Federal agencies must report funding information as projects are approved, increased, or decreased within a state. Reviewing the federal budget can help determine proposed dollar amounts for specific projects. The grant seeker should carefully study eligibility requirements for government or foundation programs. They should seek clarification from program contacts about requirements and deadlines. Modifications to the project may be necessary to ensure eligibility for funding. To be eligible for funding, modifications to the project may be required. For federal grants, funding opportunities can be found on websites like Grants.gov or FedConnect. Applicants must register, obtain a DUNS number, and register with SAM. Deadlines for applications are usually non-negotiable. Private foundation funding opportunities can be found by contacting foundations or checking the Foundation Center's website. Contact foundations or visit the Foundation Center's website for daily postings of Requests for Proposals (RFPs) with specified deadlines. Some programs have multiple application deadlines throughout the year. Grant seekers should approach potential funders to confirm interest in the project. Federal agencies and foundations may provide feedback on a preliminary concept paper before a formal proposal is submitted. Developing a concept paper is essential for grant seekers to outline what needs to be accomplished, how it will be done, the timeline, measurement of success, future plans, costs, and alignment with the funding source's mission. The concept paper should be concise, clear, and informative, reflecting the perspective of the grant-making agency. It is crucial to show how the project will continue after the grant ends, whether it will be self-sustaining or require further funding. If the funding source shows interest, the grant seeker can proceed with a formal proposal. The grant seeker can ask for feedback and guidance on the concept paper before writing the final proposal. Gathering necessary documents like articles of incorporation and tax exemption certificates should be done before writing begins. Useful websites provide sample grant proposals and federal program information. An effective grant proposal must meet all requirements of the funding source and make a compelling case. The grant proposal must meet all requirements of the funding source, have a clear title, cohesive structure, concise language, and be reviewed by multiple parties for feedback and revisions. When revising a grant proposal, it is important to maintain the original excitement of the proposal while clarifying its content. The basic sections of a standard grant proposal include a cover letter, proposal summary, introduction, problem statement, project objectives, methods, evaluation, future funding, and budget. The cover letter should be on the organization's letterhead, signed by the highest official, and address the funding source. It should briefly outline the needs addressed in the proposal. The cover letter in a grant proposal should demonstrate familiarity with the grantmaking agency's mission and how the project contributes to their goals. The grant proposal summary, a brief overview of the project, is crucial as it is the first impression seen by officials and sets the tone for the proposal. The grant proposal summary is a crucial part of the proposal package, often the only part carefully reviewed by agency officials. It should include a description of the applicant, problem statement, objectives, activities, evaluation design, budget, and potential funding sources. The summary sets the tone for the proposal and justifies the project to potential funders. The grant proposal summary is essential as it is the part most reviewed by agency officials. It should include a description of the applicant, problem statement, objectives, activities, evaluation design, budget, and potential funding sources. The summary sets the tone for the proposal and justifies the project to potential funders. In the introduction, applicants should demonstrate their organization's credibility and alignment with the funding source's goals. This section should provide a brief history, past and present operations, goals, mission, accomplishments, success stories, grants, endorsements, and press coverage. The grant proposal summary should include a description of the applicant, problem statement, objectives, activities, evaluation design, budget, and potential funding sources. It should also demonstrate the organization's credibility and alignment with the funding source's goals. Reference to grants, endorsements, and press coverage should be included, along with qualifications of staff and board of directors. Indicating if funds are being sought elsewhere will strengthen the proposal. Individual applicants should include a succinct resume related to the proposal's objectives. The proposal should make a clear, concise, and well-supported statement of the problem to be addressed from the beneficiaries' viewpoint. Conducting and documenting both formal and informal needs assessments is recommended. The grant proposal should include a formal and informal needs assessment for the program in the target area. It should address the purpose, beneficiaries, social and economic costs, nature of the problem, gaps in current solutions, remaining alternatives, project implications, and resources needed for solving the problem. The problem statement in a grant proposal should be well-defined, avoiding defining the lack of a program as the problem itself. It should be of reasonable dimensions, with clear definitions of the targeted population and geographic area. The statement should include a retrospective view, past efforts, future projections, statistics, and input from beneficiaries. The applicant's history, skills, and accomplishments should support the problem statement. The applicant's history, skills, and past accomplishments make them the right organization to solve the problem. Various assessment techniques can be found in literature from government planning offices or universities. Data collection may include historical, geographic, quantitative, and statistical information. Local colleges or universities can help determine interest in conducting a needs assessment project. Examples of findings can be included in the proposal once the needs have been described. The proposal should include outlined solutions in quantitative terms, defining the population to be served, project time frame, and anticipated outcomes. Verifiable figures should be used, and objectives should be realistic for program evaluation. Program objectives should be distinct from methods or strategies, focusing on specific goals like reducing infant mortality rates. Program design refers to how objectives will be achieved, such as through mobile clinics. The program design outlines how objectives will be achieved, including the use of mobile clinics to bring services to the community. Specific plans of action for each objective should be detailed, with a focus on realistic proposals in terms of resources and timeline. An evaluation plan should be considered at every stage of the proposal's development to ensure measurable objectives are being met. The evaluation plan for the proposal will involve deciding on methods, such as standardized tests or interviews, to measure project success. It will also include determining whether evaluation will be done internally or by outside experts, and outlining procedures for data gathering and analysis. The evaluation component will focus on both product evaluation (project results) and process evaluation. \"Product evaluation\" assesses project results and satisfaction of objectives, while \"process evaluation\" examines project conduct and activity effectiveness. Federal agencies require program evaluation for grantees, which can be done by internal staff or an evaluation firm. Evaluation time frames are specified in grants, with some programs requiring quarterly and annual reports. If no evaluation periods are specified, the applicant must outline the evaluation time needed, feedback dissemination, and staff schedule. The applicant should submit an evaluation design at the start of a project to collect baseline data and allow for potential revisions as the project progresses. A well-defined problem and cause-and-effect analysis are essential for a successful evaluation design. Sometimes a pilot study or literature search is necessary to identify relevant facts and relationships. Evaluation design for a project should include a thorough literature search to identify facts and relationships. Coordination and agreement among decisionmakers are crucial, with a focus on meeting the requirements of grantor agencies. Specific evaluation techniques and data formats may be required, and financial incentives for participation in national studies should be considered. The proposal should also outline plans for program continuation post-grant. The applicant should provide a detailed plan for program continuation beyond the grant period, including fundraising efforts and future grant applications. Projections for facility and equipment maintenance should be included in the budget, which should be well-prepared to enhance credibility and increase funding chances. The budget should align with the narrative section of the proposal and demonstrate the reasonableness of fund allocation. A well-prepared budget for a proposal should be reasonable, concrete, and specific in its estimates. It should be realistic, accurately estimate costs, and not underestimate staff time. The budget format should be clear, with a Budget Summary written after the entire budget is prepared. Budgets are typically divided into personnel costs and nonpersonnel costs, with major components subtotaled and a grand total at the end. If funding source forms are provided, elements can be filled in accordingly. When preparing a budget for a proposal, the applicant should review the proposal and list items needed for the project. The personnel section includes salaries, fringe benefits, and consultant services. Nonpersonnel items may include rental costs, utilities, equipment purchase, training, and office supplies. Budget adjustments can be made after grant awards, but it is a lengthy process. The applicant should ensure costs for implementation, continuation, and phase-down can be met. When preparing a budget for a proposal, costs associated with leases, evaluation systems, audits, and long-term financial commitments should be considered. A well-prepared budget justifies all expenses and is consistent with the proposal narrative. Areas in need of evaluation for consistency include salaries, equipment purchases, space requirements, and insurance support. Indirect cost rates outlined by the Office of Management and Budget should also be considered for federal grants. When developing a budget for a grant proposal, it is important to ensure that direct and indirect costs align with OMB Circulars A-122, A-21, and A-87. Matching funds should be accounted for unless specified otherwise. Reviewing successful grant proposals can help in creating a convincing budget. Examples of grant budgets can be found on websites like Grant Space and About.com. When preparing budgets for government grants, it is important to review past funding levels and not rely solely on grant income for larger projects. Funding levels of federal assistance programs change yearly, so it is advisable to project future funding levels based on past appropriations and average grants awarded. It is recommended to refer to the \"Financial Information\" section of the beta.SAM.gov Assistance Listing program description for fiscal year appropriations and estimates, as well as the \"Range and Average of Financial Assistance\" for prior years' awards. When applying for government grants, it is crucial to consider the overall budget requirements and anticipate inflationary pressures. Restraint is necessary in projecting costs to avoid padding budget items, but applicants can plan for potential future increases. Familiarity with grants management requirements, including OMB circulars, is essential. These documents outline cost principles, administrative and audit requirements, and compliance with government guidelines for federal domestic assistance. OMB circulars can be accessed online for reference. Guidelines for federal domestic assistance, including OMB circulars and Executive Order 12372 for coordinating federal grants to states, can be found online. States not listed on the OMB website have chosen not to participate in the intergovernmental review process. Applicants in these states can still send materials directly to federal awarding agencies. When submitting a grant proposal, include relevant documents like letters of endorsement, resumes, annual reports, and IRS 501(c)(3) Letter of Tax Exempt Status. Additional materials can be included in an appendix. Resources for writing a grant proposal can be found online at GrantSpace, Foundation Center, Environmental Protection Agency, and Minnesota Council on Foundations. To write a successful grant proposal, utilize resources from GrantSpace, Foundation Center, Environmental Protection Agency, and Minnesota Council on Foundations. Relevant documents like letters of endorsement, resumes, annual reports, and IRS 501(c)(3) Letter of Tax Exempt Status should be included. Additional materials can be added in an appendix.
