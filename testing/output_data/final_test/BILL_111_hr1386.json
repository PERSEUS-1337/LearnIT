Act of 2009\" makes permanent the program of federal reimbursement for emergency health services provided to undocumented aliens. The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 is amended to authorize appropriations for fiscal year 2015 and beyond. Unspent funds can be reallocated in a fiscal year according to specified conditions. The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 allows for the reallotment of unspent funds among eligible providers in full expenditure States for the succeeding fiscal year. The Act allows for reallotment of unspent funds among eligible providers in full expenditure States based on their allotment ratios. If funds are not fully expended in a fiscal year and there is no full expenditure State, the unexpended portion will be added to the amount available for allotment in the next fiscal year. A full expenditure State is defined as a state that has fully expended its allotment by the end of the fiscal year. The amendments made by paragraph (1) shall apply to allotments for fiscal years beginning before, during, or after fiscal 2010; except that, in applying such. The amendments apply to allotments for fiscal years before, during, or after 2010. Allotments to a State under the Medicare Prescription Drug Act of 2003 will be treated as a single allotment for the fiscal year of enactment."
