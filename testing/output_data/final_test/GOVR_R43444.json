    "content": "The Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act requires certain persons to report foreign financial assets outside the US via Form 8938 or FinCEN Form 114. Specified persons, including entities and individuals, must meet filing thresholds. There is a defined requirement for individuals but not for entities. Specified individuals (SIs) subject to reporting requirements include U.S. citizens, U.S. resident aliens, nonresident aliens electing to be treated as resident aliens for tax purposes, and nonresident aliens who are bona fide residents of specific U.S. territories. Specified foreign financial assets (SFFAs) encompass various financial accounts held at foreign financial institutions and investment assets not held in a financial account. Specified individuals (SIs) must report foreign financial assets (SFFAs) including stocks, securities, and contracts with foreign issuers. Assets like foreign real estate and currency held directly are not reportable. Filing thresholds vary based on marital status and location, with higher thresholds for those living abroad. Individuals living abroad have lower filing thresholds for reporting foreign financial assets compared to those living in the United States. Failure to file Form 8938 can result in penalties starting at $10,000 and going up to $50,000. Additionally, taxpayers who do not report income from these assets on their tax returns may face a penalty of 40% of the tax due on that income. Since 1970, U.S. persons are required to report foreign financial accounts they own or have signatory authority over. This is separate from reporting income from these accounts on tax returns. Foreign financial accounts can include bank accounts, security accounts, and mutual funds. The IRS provides a chart to determine which assets are reportable under Title 31 or Title 26. Foreign financial accounts must be reported under Title 31 if the aggregate value is over $10,000 at any time during the year on FinCen Form 114. Delinquent forms are subject to severe penalties, including criminal and civil penalties for willful failure to file an FBAR. If failure to file an FBAR is deemed willful, penalties can include fines up to $250,000 and up to five years in prison. The maximum civil penalty is $100,000 or 50% of the account balance. Courts require proof by a preponderance of evidence for willful failure. Non-willful failure incurs a maximum penalty of $10,000 per account, which may be waived with reasonable cause. Offshore tax evasion can involve foreign financial institutions or intermediaries. FATCA imposes reporting requirements on FFIs and NFFEs to curb offshore tax evasion by providing information on assets owned by entities subject to U.S. income tax. While existing legal authorities help address tax evasion, gaps in information, especially from foreign parties, can limit their effectiveness. In cases like UBS, whistleblowers have played a crucial role in aiding the IRS. The limitations of tax treaties and legal challenges in enforcing subpoenas can hinder the IRS's efforts in obtaining information from foreign entities. The Qualified Intermediary program's shortcomings, such as not reporting foreign source income, have influenced FATCA's reporting requirements for FFIs and other foreign entities to combat tax evasion. FATCA imposes reporting obligations on foreign financial institutions and entities, defined broadly to include those involved in banking, investing, or trading. IRS regulations finalized in 2013 provide important details, with subsequent modifications. Foreign Financial Institutions (FFIs) and Non-Financial Foreign Entities (NFFEs) are subject to FATCA reporting requirements. FFIs include banks, investment funds, hedge funds, and insurance companies. Failure to meet requirements results in a 30% withholding tax on payments. NFFEs may also face withholding if requirements are not met. Withholdable payments include interest, dividends, and other financial transactions. Payments subject to FATCA reporting requirements include interest, dividends, rents, salaries, wages, and other fixed or determinable annual gains from U.S. sources. Exemptions exist for certain entities like foreign governments and corporations with regularly traded stock. The rate of withholding for withholdable payments subject to FATCA reporting is 30%, regardless of tax exemptions or reduced rates. The withheld amount can be credited against U.S. income tax liability, with potential refunds. Non-U.S. entities must provide information to the IRS to determine U.S. ownership and substantial U.S. owners. Substantial U.S. owner criteria vary for corporations and partnerships. For FATCA reporting, specified U.S. persons owning more than 10% of stock, profits, or beneficial interests in entities are subject to reporting. Financial institutions investing in securities, partnership interests, or commodities are subject to reporting regardless of ownership percentage. Specified U.S. person excludes certain entities like publicly traded corporations. Non-compliant FFIs face stricter rules and may only receive refunds if exemptions apply to income tax. FFIs must provide information to the IRS to determine U.S. account holders or owners of foreign entities to avoid withholding. No interest is given on overpayments. Withholding does not occur if an agreement is in place between the FFI and IRS to obtain necessary account holder information. A U.S. account is defined as a financial account held by a specified U.S. person or U.S. owned foreign entity. The FFI must report information on U.S. accounts annually, including account holder details, account balance, and transactions. Depository accounts held by natural persons under $50,000 are excluded unless the FFI elects otherwise. Financial accounts include depository or custodial accounts and equity or debt interests in the FFI. FFIs must report information on U.S. accounts annually, including account holder details, account balance, and transactions. They are required to deduct and withhold 30% of any passthru payment made to a recalcitrant account holder or non-FATCA compliant FFI. Recalcitrant account holders are those who fail to comply with information requests or provide a waiver of foreign law. FFIs can elect to be withheld upon rather than withhold on payments to non-compliant entities, as long as they agree to provide relevant information to the withholding agent. To comply with IRS requests for additional information on U.S. accounts, certain exceptions and rules exist under FATCA. For NFFEs subject to withholding, no withholding occurs if they provide certification that they do not have substantial U.S. owners. Criticism has been raised regarding the FFI and NFFE provisions in relation to other countries since FATCA's enactment. Criticism has been raised about the FFI and NFFE provisions in relation to other countries, questioning the unilateral approach of FATCA by the United States. Concerns include potential conflicts with existing U.S. treaty obligations, issues with complying with FATCA or home country laws, and sovereignty intrusion. The success of FATCA's implementation may depend on the cooperation of other countries, leading to bilateral agreements being made with some nations by the Treasury Department and IRS. The Treasury Department and IRS have made bilateral intergovernmental agreements (IGAs) with some countries regarding FATCA compliance. These agreements exempt FFIs from withholding if they comply with the IGA, but noncompliant FFIs may face withholding as nonparticipating financial institutions. There are two model IGAs with variations depending on existing tax treaties or TIEAs with the US. The United States has entered into agreements with 24 countries for FATCA compliance, with discussions ongoing for IGAs with additional countries. Model 1 and Model 2 IGAs have variations based on reciprocal exchange provisions. The IRS has extended deadlines under FATCA due to criticisms of burdensome requirements. The law enacted in 2010 states that amendments apply to payments after December 31, 2012. Implementation timelines were provided in a notice released in July 2011, with reporting requirements starting in 2014 and withholding requirements phased in by January 1, 2015. Treasury and the IRS cited practical difficulties as reasons for the phased-in approach. Treasury and the IRS have faced challenges in implementing Chapter 4 rules due to practical difficulties and the need for significant modifications to information management systems. Coordination with foreign governments is also required for compliance. The Act's effective date of 2013 has been extended to allow time for development of necessary systems. Regulations may provide for phased implementation of Chapter 4 provisions for information management systems of FFIs, withholding agents, and the IRS. Proposed regulations were issued in February 2012, with an extension announced in October 2012 due to practical concerns. Comments highlighted issues with implementing chapter 4 rules within proposed time frames, especially regarding changes in entity account holders' status as FFIs enter into agreements with the IRS. The IRS issued regulations in 2013 to align due diligence timelines for U.S. withholding agents and FFIs, aiming to reduce administrative burden. An extension was granted for withholding on some payments until July 1, 2014, raising questions about the IRS's authority to delay FATCA. The regulations cited IRC Section 7805 and FFI/NFFE statutory provisions.

An extension was granted for withholding on some payments until July 1, 2014, raising questions about the IRS's authority to delay FATCA. The regulations cited IRC Section 7805 and FFI/NFFE statutory provisions. Section 7805 gives the Treasury Secretary authority to promulgate rules for IRC enforcement, while Section 1474(f) allows for regulations to carry out FATCA purposes. The debate lies in whether the IRS overstepped its bounds in extending deadlines for FATCA implementation.

An extension was granted for withholding on some payments until July 1, 2014, raising questions about the IRS's authority to delay FATCA. In the 113th Congress, bills have been introduced related to FATCA, including S. 887 which aims to repeal many of FATCA's provisions. The extension of the statute of limitations for significant omissions of income in connection with foreign assets, penalties for underpayments related to undisclosed foreign financial assets, reporting requirements for activities with passive foreign investment companies, reporting requirements for U.S. owners of foreign trusts, and minimum penalties for failure to report on certain foreign trusts are addressed in various bills aimed at strengthening FATCA. These bills also include provisions targeting tax sheltering and avoidance activities. The FATCA provision in the bills aims to expand reporting requirements for passive foreign investment companies and financial accounts, including transaction accounts and entities investing in derivatives and swaps. It also specifies requirements for non-financial foreign entities to prevent withholding agents from unknowingly accepting incorrect information. The FATCA provision in the bills expands reporting requirements for passive foreign investment companies and financial accounts. It clarifies withholding provisions and defines \"substantial U.S. owner\" for corporations and partnerships. It also amends confidentiality rules to allow disclosure to federal law enforcement agencies for investigating possible violations of U.S. law.

It also amends confidentiality rules to allow disclosure to federal law enforcement agencies for investigating possible violations of U.S. law. Additionally, it creates rebuttable presumptions for U.S. civil proceedings involving non-FATCA institutions. The provision establishes rebuttable presumptions for U.S. civil proceedings involving non-FATCA institutions. It states that any amount received by a U.S. person from an account in a non-FATCA institution is taxable income, and any amount paid to such an account represents previously unreported income. The presumptions can be rebutted with clear evidence. Additionally, the provision requires that foreign documents must be authenticated in court by a knowledgeable person. The Commission on Americans Living Abroad Act (H.R. 597) would establish a commission to study how federal laws and policies affect U.S. citizens living in foreign countries, including financial reporting requirements and access to financial institutions. The Commission on Americans Living Abroad Act (H.R. 597) would establish a commission to study the impact of federal laws on U.S. citizens living abroad, including financial reporting requirements and access to financial institutions. The commission would report its findings and recommendations within one year of enactment and issue a second report on any administrative actions taken based on its recommendations."
