It supports President Obama's 2010 Policy Directive on Global Development and U.S. food security pledges from the G8 Summit in 2009. FTF employs a whole-of-government approach to achieve cross-sectoral international development goals and align existing U.S. food and agriculture programs. It acts as a coordination mechanism for all U.S. international agricultural and food security development programs, targeting sustainable reductions in international hunger. FTF is a federal investment paradigm targeting sustainable reductions in international hunger, malnutrition, and food insecurity. It fosters transparency, accountability, and country ownership potential. USAID selects focus countries based on need and opportunity for progress, emphasizing sustainable and collaborative development approaches. The Feed the Future (FTF) program focuses on collaborative development approaches, recipient-country ownership, measurable indicators, whole-of-government implementation strategy, and coordination with various organizations. Key issues addressed include the program's origin, intent, inter-agency approach, implementation, monitoring, evaluation, and funding. The report raises oversight issues for Congress regarding Feed the Future (FTF) implementation, including limited availability of impact results and long-term prospects. FTF was established to support President Obama's pledge to reduce global hunger and address declining investment in developing-country agriculture. Congress is evaluating the overall merits of FTF and whether to permanently authorize the initiative. Investment in developing-country agriculture by the international donor community had declined sharply over the past two decades, with only 6% of total official development assistance devoted to agriculture by 2008, down from 17% in the late 1980s. The global financial crisis starting in 2008 worsened the situation, leading to rising unemployment and tighter budgetary resources. The Feed the Future (FTF) initiative was established by the Obama Administration to address these challenges and enhance U.S. agricultural development assistance focused on food security and poverty alleviation goals. President Obama highlighted global hunger alleviation as a priority in his first inaugural address. President Obama prioritized alleviating global hunger in his first inaugural address and later issued a directive on global development. The Global Climate Change Initiative, Global Health Initiative, and Feed the Future (FTF) are key initiatives to achieve these goals. The global food price crisis in 2007-2008 led to historic levels of hunger worldwide. In 2009, the FAO estimated over 1 billion undernourished people globally, later revised to 870 million. At the G8 Summit in L'Aquila, President Obama pledged $3.5 billion for global food security programs. The Global Partnership aimed to mobilize $20 billion over three years. The G20 Summit endorsed the L'Aquila Food Security Initiative and established the Global Agriculture and Food Security Program (GAFSP) with a total pledge of $22 billion from international donors. The U.S. commitment exceeded the initial pledge, with $4.3 billion pledged by the end of 2014. The U.S. launched the Feed the Future initiative in 2010 to address global hunger and food security, with USAID leading the implementation. A Bureau for Food Security was created within USAID to manage the initiative and other agricultural development programs. The initiative is overseen by USAID's Administrator and has two deputy coordinators. The Feed the Future initiative, launched in 2010 by the U.S. to address global hunger and food security, is overseen by USAID. It has a Security Coordinator and two deputy coordinators: one for Development at USAID and one for Diplomacy at the State Department. The goal is to reduce global hunger and poverty sustainably by implementing proven strategies and management approaches. This includes developing strategies in coordination with stakeholders, making sound investments with reliable partners, and adjusting program elements based on performance reports. The Feed the Future initiative, overseen by USAID, focuses on countries prioritizing poverty and hunger reduction through Country Investment Plans. Investments aim for lasting impacts beyond initial zones of influence, working with host governments and stakeholders to realize the Rome Principles. Investments under the Feed the Future initiative prioritize countries where the Rome Principles can be best realized. FTF \"Focus Countries\" receive primary assistance, while additional countries have \"aligned\" agricultural programs. Strategic Partner countries like Brazil, India, and South Africa collaborate on agricultural development to enhance global food security for FTF focus countries. Focus countries are selected based on assessments of need. The Feed the Future initiative prioritizes countries based on five criteria: level of need, host government commitment, governance, leadership, political will, and potential for agriculture-led growth. These criteria include factors like income levels, prevalence of stunting, poverty, Global Hunger Index, political stability, governance quality, economic policy environment, and commitment to food security and agriculture. The Feed the Future initiative prioritizes countries based on criteria such as potential for agricultural-led growth, regional synergies through trade, country resource availability, and commitment to lasting progress in food security. USAID targets Feed the Future (FTF) resources towards countries committed to achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) while considering resource constraints. FTF has prioritized investment in 19 focus countries, with Africa receiving the most investments. Each focus country must have a Country Investment Plan (CIP) in place, developed in collaboration with government officials and FTF teams. No new focus country selections were planned as of January 2016. FTF teams and country government officials assess CIP priorities and weaknesses, focusing on investment patterns, resource management, and program efficacy. A FTF-specific multi-year strategy is developed based on findings and country priorities, undergoing strategic review by FTF agencies and country representatives. The multi-year strategy (MYS) is developed based on program reviews and assessments, focusing on development challenges, investment targets, and monitoring plans for implementation. The MYS undergoes annual reviews to assess efficacy and may be modified. FTF maintains policy matrices for tracking progress. Aligned countries have a CIP or receive help to formulate one. FTF-aligned country programming supports investment plans complying with FTF requirements, including monitoring through FTFMS. The MYS planning paradigm involves a two-phase investment approach to support countries in developing or improving their CIP. Phase I countries receive foundational support to develop a robust CIP and build capacity, while Phase II countries receive core investments for CIP implementation and project expansion. Graduation to Phase II requires a technically robust CIP, stakeholder consultation, and government commitment to implementation. FTF supports CIP implementation through new projects, project-specific support, and capacity-building. The Phase I/Phase II designation was dropped in 2013. FTF partners with recipient country governments and various development stakeholders. An internal review of the MYS approach was conducted in early 2016, with plans for an external evaluation later that year. The FTF program engages with various partners for joint development ventures, including governments, NGOs, universities, and private sector entities, to leverage resources and achieve program efficiencies. Stakeholders with close ties to local communities have made commitments towards reducing poverty and hunger. Extensive partnerships aim to create targeted interventions, with shared resources leading to sustainable results. The USG collaborates with stakeholders to co-design, co-fund, and co-implement projects, sharing risks and responsibilities. This approach strengthens focus country capacity for results-based planning and stakeholder consultation. According to USAID's Feed the Future Guide, robust multilateralism improves coordination among development partners and reduces the management burden of host governments. FTF emphasizes coordination at the global level with donors and multilateral institutions for advocacy, resource mobilization, sharing information, tracking investments, and supporting country-owned processes. Multilateral institutions, such as United Nations agencies and international financial institutions, play a central role in enhancing food security by providing emergency assistance, analysis, research, sector-wide investments in agriculture, and external financing for projects in developing countries. In 2009, the G-20 leaders called for the establishment of the Global Agriculture and Food Security Program (GAFSP) to coordinate international institutions. GAFSP is the multilateral component of the United States' Feed the Future program, which supports regional coordination in Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Middle East for sharing experiences, addressing trade issues, and harmonizing standards. The Feed the Future program works with the African Union's CAADP to support agricultural development in Africa through regional economic communities like SADC, ECOWAS, and COMESA. They also collaborate with organizations like the Asian Development Bank and the Inter-American Institute for Cooperation on Agriculture in other regions of the world. The Feed the Future program, led by USAID, coordinates efforts across 11 U.S. government agencies to address international poverty, health, and food security. Six implementing agencies support field activities and report into the FTF Monitoring System, which tracks results and indicators. The Feed the Future program, led by USAID, coordinates efforts across 11 U.S. government agencies to address international poverty, health, and food security. USAID seeks to increase collaboration and complementarities between various agencies' program activities related to FTF, including focus country selection, partnering, and monitoring and evaluation. The FTF implementation strategy includes a monitoring and evaluation component to track progress and hold stakeholders accountable. USAID provides funding and technical assistance for Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) of Feed the Future (FTF) investments in focus countries. M&E tracks progress against a Results Framework, evaluates performance within a focus country zone of influence, and compares results to baseline values and targets. The M&E system facilitates feedback for planning and program improvement. Key questions addressed include the effectiveness of FTF investments and the accomplishment of program goals. FTF investments are evaluated using M&E tools like a Results Framework, performance monitoring, capacity-building, evaluations, and knowledge-sharing activities to assess impact and effectiveness. The FTF Results Framework outlines linkages between program activities and outcomes related to reducing global hunger and poverty through levels of desired results, indicators, and sub-intermediate results. The FTF Results Framework includes indicators for each level, such as farm-level incremental sales and exports of targeted agricultural commodities. Impact evaluations provide evidence on intervention effectiveness for policy decisions. USAID promotes investment in national statistical systems for data-informed policy and program design. USAID collaborates with local groups and host government agencies in FTF program design and implementation to ensure appropriate evaluation priorities and build local knowledge of data collection and analysis methodologies. They also work with USDA to assess countries' data needs and develop training programs to strengthen statistics systems for better measurement of progress. FTF shares M&E findings externally through websites like Feed the Future, USAID, and Foreign Assistance Dashboard. Research investments support food security goals, with a consultative process used to develop a research strategy. Key considerations include limited agricultural land availability and climate change. The FTF research strategy focuses on increasing agricultural productivity in an environmentally sustainable way to improve food availability. The FSIC leads projects in areas like climate-resilient cereals, pest control, and capacity development through research partnerships. Under the Feed the Future (FTF) initiative, research collaborations involve various partners such as universities, CGIAR centers, national research programs, and NGOs. Formerly known as Collaborative Research Support Programs (CRSPs), these collaborations are now called Innovation Labs. There are currently 24 FTF Innovation Labs focusing on different agricultural activities, with a focus on capacity-building for both men and women. Additionally, the Norman Borlaug Commemorative Research Initiative (NBCRI) aims to enhance international public goods research. The Norman Borlaug Commemorative Research Initiative (NBCRI) aims to strengthen international research for agricultural productivity in the US and developing countries. The Borlaug 21st Century Leadership Program trains individuals and supports developing country institutions. Gender equity, environmental stewardship, and climate change are key priorities for the Feed the Future initiative, with a focus on empowering women through gender integration. The Feed the Future initiative prioritizes gender equality in agriculture, recognizing women's crucial role in achieving global food security. It integrates gender-based analysis into investments and uses the Women's Empowerment in Agriculture Index (WEAI) to measure women's empowerment and identify barriers to their inclusion in the sector. The WEAI assesses women's involvement in agricultural decision-making, resource access, income control, community leadership, and engagement. The Feed the Future initiative prioritizes gender equality in agriculture and uses the Women's Empowerment in Agriculture Index (WEAI) to measure women's empowerment. Gender-specific data are available for performance indicators, allowing for comparisons across gender. USAID collaborates with the U.S. Global Climate Change Initiative to assess climate change vulnerabilities, develop climate-smart technologies, and promote policies for resilience and food security. Funding for Feed the Future programs is provided through the annual SFOPS appropriations bill. The SFOPS appropriations bill allocates funds for bilateral food security and agricultural development activities, multilateral food security accounts, and global health programs. Congress has allocated nearly $1 billion annually since 2010 for these activities. The Administration determines how to allocate these funds within the Feed the Future framework, making it challenging to track funding patterns. The whole-of-government approach extends FTF's operational strategy to other federal programs investing in international agricultural development. Investments in international agricultural development have increased nominally from $1.7 billion in FY2010 to $2.6 billion in FY2013 before decreasing to $2.4 billion in FY2014. These efforts are complemented by U.S. spending on nutrition-specific activities and multilateral investments in health and food security. USAID publishes annual progress reports for the Feed the Future program to track progress towards set targets and guidelines for non-emergency food aid and agricultural development activities. In 2012, USAID set targets to reduce extreme poverty and stunted children by 20% in specific areas by 2017. Progress has been made in some countries, but final data is pending for others. See Table 6 for reported progress. The most recent FTF progress report includes performance indicator data tracking the impact of investments made through FY2014 in focus countries. FTF supports efforts to increase gender equity in hunger and poverty reduction programs, aiming to enhance women's socioeconomic prospects. The Women's Empowerment in Agriculture Index (WEAI) baseline report was released in May 2014 for 13 of the 19 focus countries, with future WEAI Index measures to assess progress in women's empowerment. The WEAI Index measures progress in women's empowerment in agriculture due to FTF investments. Gender disaggregated FTF performance indicators help prioritize activities. Baseline WEAI values show significant differences in women's empowerment across focus countries. The WEAI Index measures women's empowerment in agriculture, with constraints including lack of access to credit, excessive workloads, and low membership in social groups. FTF was established as an Obama Administration initiative under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961. Legislation was introduced in the 113th Congress to ensure continued support for programs similar to those under FTF. In the 113th Congress, legislation was introduced to permanently authorize an agriculture-focused global food and nutrition security strategy and programs. This legislation, enacted as P.L. 114-195 in July 2016, requires the President to develop a whole-of-government strategy for global food security and submit it to Congress. Funding authorization for the strategy is set at just over $1 billion per year for FY2017 and FY2018, potentially requiring congressional action in the 115th Congress to extend it. The FTF initiative aims to coordinate activities and utilize expertise from various U.S. government agencies outside of USAID and MCC. Success depends on the lead agency's ability to overcome challenges, such as defining interagency roles and navigating different agency structures and decision-making processes. Congressional oversight and appropriations panels may vary in their commitment to the initiative. The FTF initiative faces challenges in coordinating activities among various U.S. government agencies. USAID leads the effort by integrating partner agencies' knowledge and expertise at different levels, including headquarters and in 19 focus countries. In a survey of U.S. FTF partner agency representatives in 19 focus countries, 93 percent reported coordinating with USAID. The FTF 2010 Guide emphasizes \"country-led planning\" as crucial for ensuring country ownership and program sustainability. Concerns have been raised by some Members of Congress and civil society about donor control, capacity of developing countries, and inclusion of civil society perspectives in country-led planning processes. The government-led strategies in FTF initiatives may not adequately include inputs from civil society, NGOs, private sector actors, or citizens. USAID has facilitated a country-led approach but has not systematically assessed associated risks. GAO reports show that USAID has provided assistance to host governments in developing country plans and coordinating with various stakeholders, including nonprofit and for-profit organizations. In its March 2010 report, GAO found that USAID's FTF approach faced risks due to insufficient host government capacity for agriculture funding commitments. While USAID has made progress in monitoring these risks, GAO's recent study revealed that FTF strategies did not systematically assess risks. This lack of assessment could lead to missed opportunities and potential cost losses. Development food aid programs, including FFP Title II and McGovern-Dole funding, receive funding primarily from non-FTF appropriations. FFP Title II food aid is a significant component of U.S. food security assistance, with a larger budget compared to FTF. The majority of FFP funds are used for emergency food supplies rather than long-term food security. The independent nature of emergency food supplies programs may not integrate well with FTF. However, there has been some coordination between these programs, with USAID playing a key role in administration. FTF guidelines closely align with FFP objectives, promoting effective joint coordination and monitoring. In some countries, FTF and FFP jointly program Community Development Funds. The FFP program's use of in-kind donations may conflict with FTF goals of improving agricultural productivity and rural incomes in focus countries. The United States primarily relies on in-kind transfers of domestically purchased commodities for international food aid, despite evidence of economic inefficiencies and market distortions compared to cash-based assistance. Monetization of in-kind food aid has been a concern. The George W. Bush and Obama Administrations, along with certain Members of Congress, have proposed changes to U.S. food aid programs, including expanding flexibility in cash-based assistance and eliminating monetization. The 2014 farm bill increased the maximum allowable cash assistance for administrative costs to limit monetization. The 2014 farm bill increased cash assistance for administrative costs to limit monetization in U.S. food aid programs. USAID's Office of Food for Peace manages funds through the International Disaster Assistance account, providing cash transfers and vouchers for emergency food security needs. Adjusting funding levels for different humanitarian accounts, like IDA, is one way Congress may address FFP program limitations. One way Congress may address FFP program limitations is by adjusting funding levels for different humanitarian accounts like IDA. Key questions regarding FFP food aid programs include whether emergency food aid activities align with FTF objectives and if there could be adverse effects on FTF activities from in-kind food aid projects. Program evaluation involves using measurable criteria to assess program efficacy, with examples including improvements in physical growth, crop area expansion, output per unit of production, and budget allocation to nutrition or agriculture. FTF utilizes 53 indicators to measure progress in the Results Framework. Focus countries prioritize investments based on their context and potential for change. The Results Framework (RF) guides countries in selecting indicators to measure progress towards achieving goals. It includes six indicators for assessing inclusive agricultural growth and three for improving nutritional status. The RF also specifies eight intermediate results (IRs) to track progress. The Results Framework (RF) includes eight intermediate results (IRs) for measuring progress towards goals. These IRs cover areas such as agricultural sector growth and nutrition objectives. Each focus country selects project-level indicators from a set of 53 indicators to track progress, set targets, and monitor performance. An M&E contractor monitors higher-level impact indicators. An M&E contractor monitors higher-level impact indicators for projects and programs to ensure consistency in reporting and reduce workload. FTF performance management plans are developed by the FTF mission for each country, with 53 indicators, including 8 required and 21 optional, to track FTF objectives. Custom indicators can be used as needed, and USAID identifies 9 whole-of-government indicators for food security programs. USAID encourages the use of 53 indicators for projects and programs funded by non-FTF sources like MCC and USDA."
