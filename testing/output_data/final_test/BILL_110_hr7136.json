    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Democracy Restoration Act of 2008\" and includes findings. The Congress finds that the right to vote is essential for citizenship, helps reintegrate offenders into society, and enhances public safety. Congress has ultimate supervisory power over Federal elections as per the Constitution. Fairness and equal protection principles mandate equal voting opportunities without discrimination based on race, color, gender, or previous servitude. The 14th and 15th Amendments empower Congress to protect the right to vote in Federal elections. Discrepancies in State laws regarding felony convictions lead to unfairness in Federal elections by creating disparities in voting standards and restoration of voting rights, disproportionately impacting racial ethnic minorities. Approximately 5.3 million Americans, or one in forty-one adults, are unable to vote due to felony convictions. Most of these individuals are not in prison but are on probation or parole. Disenfranchisement laws vary by state, with some states allowing voting rights restoration after completion of a sentence, while others impose lifetime disenfranchisement for certain convictions. Approximately 2,000,000 individuals who have completed their entire sentence, including probation and parole, remain disenfranchised. In some states, the right to vote can be regained in theory, but in practice, it is often difficult. Offenders must obtain a pardon or order from the Governor or action by the parole or pardon board to regain voting rights, with additional barriers for Federal offenders. In at least 16 states, Federal offenders cannot use the state procedure for restoring their civil rights. The Federal law provides a method for restoring voting rights to ex-offenders through a Presidential pardon, but few have the resources to succeed. State disenfranchisement laws disproportionately affect ethnic minorities, with 13% of African American men and Hispanic citizens being disenfranchised. Disenfranchising citizens convicted of a felony offense who are living and working in the community is a common practice. State disenfranchisement laws suppress electoral participation among eligible voters and damage the integrity of the electoral process. The United States is the only Western democracy that allows the permanent denial of voting rights to individuals with felony convictions. SEC. 3. RIGHTS OF CITIZENS: The right to vote for a US citizen shall not be denied due to a criminal offense, except for those serving a felony sentence. SEC. 4. ENFORCEMENT. The Attorney General can take legal action to address violations of the Act, while individuals can also file a civil action if a violation is not corrected within a specified timeframe. Individuals can file a civil action to obtain relief for violations of the Act without providing notice to the chief election official of the State. SEC. 5. NOTIFICATION OF RESTORATION OF VOTING RIGHTS. Notification of voting rights restoration: Each State must notify individuals convicted of a criminal offense of their right to vote in Federal elections under the Democracy Restoration Act upon completion of probation or release from custody. The Director of the Bureau of Prisons must notify individuals convicted of a federal criminal offense of their right to vote in Federal elections under the Democracy Restoration Act. The Democracy Restoration Act requires the Director of the Bureau of Prisons to notify individuals convicted of a federal criminal offense of their right to vote in Federal elections. The notification must be given on the date of sentencing for a felony conviction or upon release from the Bureau of Prisons for a misdemeanor conviction. The Democracy Restoration Act mandates the Director of the Bureau of Prisons to inform individuals convicted of federal crimes about their voting rights. For misdemeanors, the notification should be given on the sentencing date by a State court. The Democracy Restoration Act requires the Bureau of Prisons to inform federal crime convicts about their voting rights. For misdemeanors, State courts must provide this notification on the sentencing date. The term \"correctional institution or facility\" refers to prisons, jails, or similar facilities for convicted individuals, excluding residential treatment centers. The term \"election\" includes various types of elections and political party events. The term \"probation\" refers to court-imposed conditions on an individual's freedom of movement, payment of damages, reporting to a court officer, or supervision by a court officer. SEC. 7. RELATION TO OTHER LAWS. This Act does not prevent states from enacting less restrictive voting laws for federal elections. The rights and remedies provided by this Act do not override the Voting Rights Act of 1965 or the National Voter Registration Act. SEC. 8. FEDERAL PRISON FUNDS. No State, local government, or person can use Federal funds to build or improve prisons without a program to notify incarcerated US citizens of their voting rights upon release. This Act applies to US citizens voting in federal elections after its enactment date."
