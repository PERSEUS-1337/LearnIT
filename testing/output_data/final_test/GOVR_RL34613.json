    "content": "During and after the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991, the North Caucasus area of Russia experienced substantial disorder. Chechen separatism gained ground, leading to the breakup of the Chechen-Ingush Republic along ethnic lines. Russia's President Boris Yeltsin implemented a federal system allowing regional autonomy, but Chechnya demanded independence. A bloody campaign in 1994-1996 resulted in thousands of casualties, but ceasefire accords in 1996 led to de facto self-rule in Chechnya. Ceasefire accords in 1996 led to de facto self-rule in Chechnya. Organized crime and Islamic extremism increased, spilling into other areas of Russia. In response, Russia's Premier Putin ordered military forces to reenter Chechnya in late 1999, resulting in civilian casualties and displaced persons. Government security forces aggressively carried out counter-terrorism operations in Chechnya and the North Caucasus to suppress the insurgency. Security forces in the North Caucasus conduct operations to apprehend terrorists, facing criticism for illegal searches, pillaging, violence, and kidnappings. Despite efforts to combat terrorism, attacks like the Beslan school siege in 2004 and the Nalchik attack in 2005 resulted in numerous casualties. Insurgents outside Chechnya also collaborated with local extremists, complicating the situation. In May 2005, Chechen rebel leader Abdul-Khalim Saydullayev formed a Caucasus Front against Russia to increase support for wider hostilities. In October 2007, his successor, Doku Umarev, declared a Caucasus Emirate encompassing the North Caucasus and other Muslim areas of Russia. Terrorist attacks in the North Caucasus region surged since 2007, with high civilian and government casualties. Despite a slight decrease in incidents in 2010, the threat of terrorism remained in Chechnya and Ingushetia. Despite a slight decrease in terrorist incidents in 2010 in Chechnya and Ingushetia, civilian and government casualties continue to rise in the North Caucasus. A surge in terrorist attacks since 2007 has led to increased zachistki and reported human rights abuses. Leader Ramzan Kadyrev in Chechnya holds families responsible for terrorist actions, leading to torture and house burnings by local security forces. Human rights and aid workers are also at risk due to the escalating conflict. The increasing scope of public discontent against zachistki and economic distress are contributing to growing recruits for terrorist groups in the North Caucasus. Interethnic and religious tensions also fuel the violence, leading to migration from the region. Native ethnic groups have strengthened their majority status in all North Caucasian republics except Adygea, with ethnic Russians declining in population. Few ethnic Russians remain in Chechnya and Ingushetia, except for military personnel. The Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) reported an increase in jihadist-related violence in the North Caucasus starting in 2007, with a peak in 2008-2009. Data for 2010 showed a slightly slowing rate of terrorist incidents. The U.S. government Open Source Center recorded 1,082 violent incidents in January-November 2010, compared to 1,382 in 2009, indicating a possible peak in 2009 with a slight decrease in 2010. The Open Source Center data suggests an increase in injuries and deaths among local officials and civilians in 2010 compared to 2009, while the number of security personnel injured or killed declined. This may indicate that mujahidin are targeting civilians more. Recent statements from the Caucasus Emirate indicate a strategy of targeting civilians. Analyst Mairbek Vatchagaev notes a radicalization of the Islamist movement in the North Caucasus, with a shift towards targeting civilians. The incidence of violent incidents is broadening beyond Chechnya, with a substantial decline in violent incidents in Chechnya and Ingushetia in 2010. According to Open Source Center data, violent incidents in Chechnya and Ingushetia decreased in 2010 compared to 2009, but increased in Dagestan, Kabarda-Balkaria, and Stavropol Territory. The validity of the Russian government's data was questioned by President Medvedev in 2010 due to rising crime in the North Caucasus. Crime in the North Caucasus increased in 2010, with declining crime-solving rates. President Medvedev expressed skepticism towards the statistics, citing ongoing terrorism-related crimes and combat operations. The Director of the FSB, Aleksandr Bortnikov, disagreed with Medvedev, stating that terrorist activity had decreased in the region. Crime in the North Caucasus increased in 2010, with declining crime-solving rates. President Medvedev expressed skepticism towards the statistics, citing ongoing terrorism-related crimes and combat operations. The Director of the FSB, Aleksandr Bortnikov, disagreed with Medvedev, stating that terrorist activity had decreased in the region. Despite the formal lifting of the counter-terrorist operations regime in Chechnya in early 2009, zachistki against alleged terrorists continued in the North Caucasus, leading to civil rights curtailment in affected areas. Notable incidents included the killing of Dagestani Internal Affairs Minister Adilgerey Magomedtagirov in June 2009, prompting President Medvedev to convene a session of the Russian Security Council to discuss regional counter-measures. In the North Caucasus, there was a surge in terrorism in the first half of the year, with over 300 acts of terrorism, including bombings. Numerous casualties were reported, including the president of Ingushetia being severely wounded and prominent human rights advocates being abducted and murdered. The Caucasus Emirate's Riyadus Salikhin Battalion was implicated in a suicide truck bombing that killed 25 and wounded 136 in Ingushetia. In 2009, the Caucasus Emirate's Riyadus Salikhin Battalion was implicated in various attacks in the North Caucasus. President Medvedev took action by firing the republic's Interior Minister and implementing measures to combat corruption and inefficiency in the region. Additionally, there was a bombing on the Nevskiy Express railway train outside of Moscow, resulting in casualties among passengers, including high-ranking Russian officials. In 2009, the Nevskiy Express railway train outside of Moscow was bombed, resulting in casualties and injuring 90, including high-ranking Russian officials. The bombing was attributed to Chechen rebel leader Doku Umarov's associate, Pavel Kosolapov. Umarov later claimed responsibility for the attack, warning of more acts of sabotage until the policy of killing ordinary Muslims in the Caucasus ceased. In March 2010, the Russian FSB killed Said Buryatskiy, a leader of the Riyadus Salikhin Battalion, for his involvement in bombings. Multiple suicide bombings in Dagestan and Moscow resulted in civilian casualties. Umarev claimed responsibility for the attacks as revenge for Russian actions in Chechnya. A double suicide bombing in Kizlyar killed 12, mostly police officers. In May and July 2010, several attacks in Russia resulted in casualties and destruction. A suicide attack in Stavropol killed seven and injured 40, while an attack at a power plant in Kabarda-Balkaria killed two guards and damaged turbines. President Medvedev ordered increased security at infrastructure sites. In August, 60 Mujahidin attacked a village, killing six police officers. In September, a car bomb in Vladikavkaz killed 19 and injured over 190. In response to a terrorist attack in Vladikavkaz, President Medvedev vowed to catch the perpetrators. The Caucasus Emirate's Ingush Vilayet claimed responsibility for the attack. In a separate incident, Mujahidin raided the Chechen Republic legislative building, resulting in casualties and injuries. President Medvedev addressed the security situation in the North Caucasus, appointing Aleksandr Khloponin to coordinate socioeconomic development programs. Khloponin was given authority over economic development to combat issues like mass unemployment and economic crime. President Medvedev did not mention instability in the North Caucasus during his address to the Federal Assembly on November 30, 2010. However, Alexander Khloponin, presidential envoy in the North Caucasus Federal District, stated that many of Medvedev's proposed domestic welfare initiatives would impact the area. Ministry of the Interior official Sergey Chenchik reported over 600 terrorist crimes in the Federal District, resulting in numerous deaths, and announced a zachistka in the village of Balakhani in Dagestan. In Balakhani, Dagestan, a zachistka was launched to track down militants and illegal weapons. An official strategy for socioeconomic development in the North Caucasus was announced, focusing on investments in agriculture, tourism, health resorts, energy, and mining. It aims to encourage ethnic Russians to resettle in the area and promote interethnic harmony to eliminate job allocation based on ethnicity. The strategy envisions a 250% increase in average wages and a 70% decrease in unemployment by 2025. A strategy for socioeconomic development in the North Caucasus aims to increase average wages by 250% and decrease unemployment by 70% by 2025. Plans to establish a regional development bank and public-private investment fund have been delayed. Russian policymakers suggest the 2008 Russia-Georgia conflict contributed to instability in the region. Putin heads a commission to monitor projects in the area. In the Russian Caucasus, terrorist attacks increased following Georgia's failed aggression. Foreign terrorists activity rose in Dagestan, with a surge in violence in the North Caucasus post-Russia-Georgia conflict. Russia's recognition of South Ossetia and Abkhazia's independence while suppressing separatism in Chechnya has been criticized for potentially encouraging separatists in the North Caucasus. Prime Minister Putin denied any linkage between the conflicts. Prime Minister Putin claimed in September 2008 that Russia's defense of South Ossetia prevented destabilization in the North Caucasus. Russian analyst Aleksey Malashenko argued that Russia's use of force in Georgia served as a deterrent to separatism in the North Caucasus. He warned of the growth of Islamic terrorism due to civil rights abuses in the region. Residents fear the consequences of breaking economic ties with Moscow. The growth of Islamic terrorism in the Caucasus is fueled by Russia's economic assistance to Abkhazia and South Ossetia, while the North Caucasus remains impoverished. Analysts warn that the global economic downturn could lead to reduced Russian subsidies to the North Caucasus, potentially causing more discontent. Efforts to suppress separatist and extremist movements in Chechnya have been violent, with a decrease in conflict in the mid-2000s following the capture of leading insurgents. Russia's pacification policy in Chechnya involves setting up a pro-Moscow regional government and relying on pro-Moscow Chechen clans affiliated with regional president Ramzan Kadyrov. Human rights abuses, including holding insurgents' relatives as hostages and torching homes, have been reported. Efforts to rebuild the region are undermined by corruption, although some types of crimes against civilians have decreased. In late 2007, Umarov declared himself the amir of the Caucasus Emirate and called for establishing Sharia in the Caucasus region. The remaining rebels in Chechnya have split into three groups, led by Doku Umarev, mujahidin vying with Umarev, and Akhmed Zakayev, who emphasizes Chechnya's independence. Many displaced Chechens are reluctant to return, with some choosing to emigrate from Russia. In August 2008, the Caucasus Emirate expanded to include areas like Tatarstan. In 2007, Umarev ousted Zakayev as \"foreign minister\" and sentenced him to death in August 2009 for abandoning Islam. In August 2010, Umarev faced challenges to his leadership from other amirs, leading to the formation of a Chechen section of the Caucasus Emirate. In October 2010, a bombing at the Chechen legislative building may have been orchestrated by Gakayev's group to assert its terrorist credentials. Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov accused Akhmed Zakayev and foreign special services of involvement, despite claiming there were only 50-60 terrorists left in Chechnya. However, the attack indicated growing sociopolitical difficulties leading to more volunteers joining the underground and adopting militant ideologies. The armed underground in Chechnya is being influenced by foreign non-Islamic states, turning individuals into suicide bombers. Observers suggest re-instating the counter-terrorism regime and increasing federal security forces. Ingushetia is experiencing disorder and violence similar to Chechnya, risking becoming a \"mini-failed state\" due to border disputes and historical tensions between Chechens and Ingushes. The Prigorodny District of North Ossetia, ceded to the North Ossetian Autonomous Republic, has led to Ingush-Ossetian clashes. In 1992, hundreds of Ingush were killed and 60,000 forced from their homes. Ingushetia has seen increased rebel attacks since 2007, prompting Russia to deploy more security forces. There have been numerous killings, attacks, and abductions in Ingushetia, with a high number of security personnel casualties reported in 2008. In 2008, there were 167 police and troops injured in attacks in Ingushetia, compared to 80 in 2007. Violent incidents, including deaths, continued to rise in 2009. A \"loyal opposition\" movement in Ingushetia opposed the leadership of Murat Zyazikov, the governor since 2002. Islamic extremists aim to create a North Caucasus emirate and organized rallies against government corruption and abuses by security forces. Opposition figure Magomed Yevloyev was shot in 2008. In 2008, opposition in Ingushetia grew due to abuses by security forces. The killing of Magomed Yevloyev led to calls for independence from Russia. The opposition People's Assembly called for secession if Zyazikov was not removed. A Russian military convoy was attacked, resulting in conflicting reports of casualties. In October 2008, President Zyazikov was removed from office and Army Col. Yunus-Bek Yevkurov was appointed to suppress the local insurgency in Ingushetia. In 2009, bombings and armed attacks were frequent, with large-scale operations to eliminate terrorists. Yevkurov was injured by a car bomb, and a bomb attack on Nazran's police department resulted in numerous casualties. Human rights advocate Maksharip Aushev was killed in October 2009. In June 2010, Emir Magas, the head of the Ingush Jamaat and military amir of the Caucasus Emirate, was captured in a zachistka. President Yevkurov suggested security forces might be involved in killings. Yevkurov claimed Magas' capture led to a decrease in terrorism in Ingushetia. The number of violent incidents in Ingushetia decreased from 436 in 2009 to 248 in 2010. In 2010, the number of violent incidents in Ingushetia decreased to 248. Observers warned about Ossetian influence and Ingush conciliation. An Ingush suicide bombing in North Ossetia marked a shift in tactics. Dagestan's majority supports Russian Federation membership over separatism. Islamic fundamentalists declared an Islamic republic in western Dagestan in 1999. In recent years, there has been a growth in Islamic extremism in Dagestan. Security forces conducted a zachistka in the village of Gimry in 2007, resulting in the arrest of dozens on terrorism charges. Attacks on government offices spread in 2008, with some linked to a crackdown on practicing Muslims. The extremist group Sharia Jamaat has been blamed for much of the violence, benefiting from alleged corruption within local security forces. In 2007, Sharia Jamaat endorsed Umarov's goal of establishing a North Caucasian Emirate. Dagestani Interior Minister claimed there were only 50-70 militants left in Dagestan in 2009 due to intensified counter-terrorist efforts. Counter-terrorism operations were declared multiple times in February 2009, contradicting the Minister's assessment. In February 2009, counter-terrorism operations were declared multiple times. In March 2009, fighting between insurgent groups and security forces occurred in mountain areas of Dagestan. An Al Qaeda emissary from Turkey was killed in April 2009, and another organizer of jihad in Dagestan was killed in August 2009. By December 2009, attacks on police had increased, with 76 police officers killed and 15 civilians killed in 2009. In 2010, violent incidents, including bombings and armed attacks, were a daily occurrence in Dagestan. In 2010, violent incidents in Dagestan increased, with bombings and armed attacks on security forces. The Russian Interior Ministry planned to deploy a local police contingent of former soldiers to combat terrorism. President Medvedev ordered progress discussions with republic leaders, warning of consequences for failure. Despite this, a series of terrorist attacks occurred in Dagestan, leading to additional police deployment. In 2010, terrorist attacks in Dagestan increased, leading to heightened security measures. Interior Minister Nurgaliyev highlighted the region's high terrorist threat level, with a rise in terrorist crimes compared to the previous year. Islamic fundamentalism promoting jihad has spread in the North Caucasus. In the North Caucasus, the spread of jihad has led to the formation of terrorist groups in various regions. Testimony suggests 700 to 900 rebels are active, with a radicalized civilian population supporting them. Anzor Astemirov, a leader in Kabarda-Balkaria, was killed in 2010, further highlighting the ongoing security concerns in the region. Anzor Astemirov, a leader in Kabarda-Balkaria, was killed in 2010. He was instrumental in creating the Caucasus Emirate and carried out a large-scale attack in Nalchik in 2005. Emir Abdullah quickly became the new leader and launched new attacks in the republic. The number of violent incidents in Kabarda-Balkaria doubled in 2010 compared to the previous year. In January-November 2010, there were 117 terrorist crimes in Kabarda-Balkaria, including 57 bomb attacks and 60 shootings, a significant increase from 2009. Russian Interior Minister Rashid Nurgaliyev noted a rise in interethnic conflicts incited by bandit group leaders. Governor Arsen Kanokov described the situation as war-like, with casualties among law enforcement and civilians. Former President Putin attributed terrorism in the North Caucasus to foreign forces, while President Medvedev emphasized domestic factors. Former President Putin and President Medvedev have differing views on the causes of terrorism in the North Caucasus. Putin blames foreign forces for inciting separatism and supporting terrorists, while Medvedev emphasizes both domestic and international factors. Putin has accused countries like France, Germany, Turkey, and the United States of instigating and backing Chechen separatism. He also points to international criminal networks as supporters of Chechen terrorists. Putin has been careful to separate terrorism from religion or cultural tradition to avoid association. President Medvedev acknowledges the influence of extremism from abroad in the North Caucasus but emphasizes systemic issues like low living standards, high unemployment, and corruption. He calls for a youth policy to address the region's 20% unemployment rate and dwindling schooling and healthcare. President Medvedev's envoy Khlopinin suggested that poor governance and corruption, rather than ethnic conflict, were responsible for the expansion of gangs and crime in the North Caucasus. He emphasized the need for a new \"Russian identity\" in the region to reduce interethnic conflict and urged North Caucasian ethnic groups to be less \"touchy\" about the actions of appointed governors. Khlopinin also dismissed calls to investigate past extrajudicial killings and rejected the use of the term \"guerillas\" instead of \"terrorists.\" In 2014, special services and provocateurs from Western countries were accused of instigating interethnic and international conflicts in the North Caucasus. The region faces high rates of unemployment and poverty, with Dagestan and Ingushetia being the most affected in Russia. Economic distress has contributed to the rise of terrorism in Kabarda-Balkaria Republic. The economic situation in Kabarda-Balkaria Republic is dire, with the closure of the main industry, defense-related factories, and decline in agriculture. Infrastructure and social services are lacking, leading to worsening educational systems and increasing unemployment. This has fueled support for \"Wahhabi agendas\" and ethnic tensions, contributing to violence in the North Caucasus. The abolishment of the Dagestani State Council has also exacerbated ethnic tensions in the region. Putin appointed an ethnic Avar as the president of Dagestan after the State Council helped ease ethnic tensions. Medvedev reinstated a Dargin as president and appointed an Avar as prime minister, sparking protests from ethnic Kumyks who wanted a Kumyk in the position. Magomedsalam Magomedov supported ethnic quotas and urged an Avar speaker to step down for an ethnic Kumyk to take his place. Increasing Circassian nationalism has led to tensions and violence in Adyghea, Karachay-Cherkessia, and Kabarda-Balkaria, where clashes with other ethnic groups have occurred. Calls for unifying Circassians in a new federal republic have been made, with demonstrations for ethnic rights taking place in Karachay-Cherkessia. Some Circassians advocate for the creation of an independent Circassian state. Rights advocates appealed for an independent Circassian state, leading to clashes and arrests in Kabarda-Balkaria. In response to protests, a Circassian was appointed as prime minister in Karachay-Cherkessia, causing tensions with other ethnic groups. The Adyge Khase called for a separate Cherkess republic, eventually resulting in the appointment of a Circassian prime minister. During 2010, Circassian groups called for canceling the Winter Olympics in Sochi due to historical genocide claims. Analysts suggest a shift towards traditional Islam in the North Caucasus, warning of continued extremist violence if economic issues are ignored by officials. Analysts warn that if economic problems in the North Caucasus are ignored, Islamic extremist violence will persist. Authorities in the region target young Muslims as \"Wahabbis\" based on their mosque attendance and prayer habits, with reports of Sufi Imams assisting in identifying and apprehending them. In areas with fewer Sufis, Muslims may be labeled as \"Wahabbis\" simply for attending mosque or praying in public. In the North Caucasus, young people are being targeted for radicalization by foreign Sunni Salafi terrorists. Clans play a role in this process, as they may become radicalized due to repression by Moscow-installed authorities. The intertwining of jihadist ideology and blood feuds is a driving force behind extremist violence in the region. The resistance in the North Caucasus is more driven by local grievances than vague ideas of global jihad. The Caucasus Emirate in the North Caucasus is driven by North Caucasian Muslim solidarity and the liberation of holy ground from 'infidels'. U.S. analyst Gordon Hahn warns that it is the hub of Islamic terrorism in Russia, receiving support from the global terrorist network. The Emirate provides support for numerous combat groups in the region and may lead major terrorist operations. In April 2009, Umarov announced the revival of the 'Riyadus Salikhin' Martys' Battalion, responsible for attacks in Beslan. Major ideologists of the global jihadi movement praised the suicide bombings in Russia. Despite warlords repudiating allegiance, Umarov reassured supporters of the united rebel command of the Caucasus Emirate. Ethnic prejudice against North Caucasian migrants fuels hate. Ethnic prejudice against North Caucasian migrants in Russia has led to numerous hate crimes, with 170 xenophobic attacks in 2010 resulting in 39 deaths and 213 injuries. The creation of an extremist crimes subunit in the Interior Ministry has helped reduce these numbers. Some hate crimes have been linked to military and police veterans of the Chechnya conflict. In response, Caucasian youths formed the \"Black Hawks\" group for revenge attacks, prompting intervention efforts by the Congress of the Peoples of the Caucasus. The tension between Russians and North Caucasians remains evident, as seen in a fatal incident involving an ethnic Russian soccer fan in Moscow. On December 7, 2010, an ethnic Russian soccer fan was killed in Moscow during a clash with North Caucasians. The next day, soccer fans demonstrated, breaking shop windows and shouting ethnic slurs. Up to 5,000 soccer fans, including neo-Nazis and ultra-nationalists, protested in Moscow against the killing, shouting ethnic slurs and clashing with North Caucasians. President Kadyrov denounced the violence and called for law and order in Moscow. President Kadyrov condemned the ethnic violence in Moscow and emphasized the need to combat xenophobia and provocations that divide Russia. His harsh methods in fighting terrorism have led to vendettas and human rights violations, which have been supported by central authorities. Vladimir Vasilyev praised Chechnya as an example in counterterrorism efforts during a visit in March 2009. The fight against terrorism in the North Caucasus region has seen positive practices and experiences being employed. Russia's support for individuals from the North Caucasus to fight in Abkhazia and South Ossetia in 2008 may have influenced sentiments among Caucasian guerrillas. This led to groups of fighters from Chechnya, Adyghe, and Cherkess participating in various operations. There are concerns about surreptitious arms transfers from Georgia through Ossetia to other North Caucasian areas. The ongoing disorder in the North Caucasus has led some Russian elites to consider granting independence to the region, with suggestions that Chechnya could have a relationship with Russia similar to Abkhazia. Russian analysts believe that population pressures in North Ossetia could ease if residents move to South Ossetia, where there is more arable land. Boris Mezhuyev and Stanislav Belkovskiy advocate for independence for the North Caucasus, particularly the Muslim republics.

Boris Mezhuyev and Stanislav Belkovskiy advocate for independence for the North Caucasus, particularly the Muslim republics. The North Caucasus is not under Russia's control in terms of mentality, law, or security. Russia's re-development budget for the region is being used by local \"business interests\" to deepen their influence throughout Russia. The United States and other countries have objected to Russia's counter-terrorism methods for violating human rights. The Russian security forces have implemented a \"counter-terrorism operations regime\" in a locality, allowing them to detain suspects for up to 30 days, search homes, ban public assemblies, and restrict media activities without court approval. Human Rights Watch has criticized Russia for allowing security forces to act with impunity in counter-terrorism operations. The U.N. Human Rights Committee has urged Russia to end enforced disappearances, extrajudicial killings, torture, and other human rights violations in Chechnya and the North Caucasus. The European Court of Human Rights has ruled on cases of human rights violations in Chechnya by Russian state agents, urging prosecution of perpetrators. Despite damages paid to plaintiffs, the Russian government has not reformed the justice system in response to verdicts. Many plaintiffs have been attacked or killed before their cases are resolved. In response to human rights violations in the North Caucasus, Dick Marty, appointed by the COE, highlighted causes of violence including clan culture, corruption, and police inefficiency. He also pointed out factors such as a culture of vengeance, judicial system inefficiency, high unemployment, Islamic extremism, and ethnic prejudice between Russians and Caucasians. Marty emphasized the significant number of human rights violations in the region, as evidenced by cases heard by the European Court of Human Rights. The COE's Committee of Ministers failed to consider Russia's human rights record in assessing compliance with COE commitments. The Russian delegation, including President Yunus-bek Yevkurov and Deputy Leonid Slutskiy, agreed with Dick Marty's report on the North Caucasus but argued that the human rights situation had improved and Russia needed COE support. The COE's Committee of Ministers failed to consider Russia's human rights record in assessing compliance with COE commitments. President Yunus-bek Yevkurov and Deputy Leonid Slutskiy agreed with Dick Marty's report on the North Caucasus, stating that the region had improved and Russia needed COE support. Marty highlighted that injustice in the region led to radicalization and called for Yevkurov to denounce human rights abuses by security services. The Parliamentary Assembly of the COE recommended that Russia combat terrorism lawfully, prosecute security forces involved in human rights violations, ensure victims have access to courts, and implement decisions of the European Court for Human Rights in the North Caucasus region. The North Caucasus region, particularly Chechnya, faces serious human rights violations and a climate of fear. A resolution by the European Parliament condemned violence against civilians and called for access to the region for human rights organizations. The European Parliament resolution called for improved access to the North Caucasus for human rights organizations and media, expressing concern over ongoing human rights abuses in Russia. It urged for increased EU-Russia human rights consultations and implementation of recommendations from a previous COE resolution. The resolution also criticized the criminal charges against Russian human rights advocate Oleg Orlov as a violation of free speech. Russian human rights advocate Oleg Orlov argued that charges against him violated his free speech rights and called for them to be dropped, citing his European Parliament Sakharov Prize as a basis for special protection. The former Bush Administration emphasized the terrorism threat in Chechnya and the North Caucasus, with criticism of Russian government human rights abuses. Analyst Igor Obdayev credited U.S. anti-terrorism efforts for reducing terrorist financing in the North Caucasus. State Department reported that most terrorist attacks in Russia in 2007 occurred in the North Caucasus despite pacification in Chechnya. The pacification of Chechnya has led to an increase in terrorism in Dagestan and Ingushetia, with evidence of foreign terrorist presence in the North Caucasus. Cooperation between the U.S. and Russia on counter-terrorism included a case involving financial support for terrorist activity in Chechnya. Presidents Obama and Medvedev pledged to cooperate on countering terrorism, with human rights abuses in the North Caucasus worsening according to the State Department's reports for 2008 and 2009. The State Department expressed concerns about human rights abuses in the North Caucasus, calling for justice in several high-profile killings. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton did not emphasize these issues during her visit to Moscow in October 2009, but did mention attacks against human rights defenders in Russia. The U.S.-Russia society working group, part of the Bilateral Presidential Commission, held meetings in 2010 focusing on counterterrorism in Afghanistan and transportation security issues. The State Department's Advancing Freedom and Democracy Report in May 2010 did not address human rights abuses in the North Caucasus. In June 2010, Secretary of State Clinton designated Caucasus Emirates leader Doku Umarov as a terrorist under Presidential Executive Order 13224 to cut off financial support. In July 2010, the State Department highlighted the killing of Natalya Estemirova and pledged to protect journalists and activists. The State Department's Country Reports on Terrorism in August 2010 noted that most terrorism in Russia was linked to the North Caucasus. Most terrorism in Russia is linked to the North Caucasus. Funding for humanitarian, conflict mitigation, and reconciliation activities in the region was allocated in the Omnibus Appropriations for FY2009 and FY2010. The Consolidated Appropriations for FY2010 provided not less than $7.0 million for the North Caucasus. The Consolidated Appropriations for FY2010 allocated $7.0 million for the North Caucasus, with 60% of assistance to Russia withheld until access to Chechnya is certified. Congress raised concerns about terrorism and human rights violations in the region, with resolutions introduced to designate the Caucasus Emirate as a foreign terrorist organization. NGOs operating in Chechnya face constraints by authorities on access and operations. International staff access is controlled by the FSB, and NGOs must provide detailed monthly information on activities. NGOs may consider moving more operations to Chechnya if security improves in the region. Local authorities in Chechnya, Ingushetia, and Dagestan closely oversee the finances and programs of foreign NGOs, with the FSB being more cooperative recently. Chechen officials have rejected UNHCR's requests to open an office in Grozny. The State Department advises against travel to Chechnya and other areas of the North Caucasus due to civil and political unrest."
