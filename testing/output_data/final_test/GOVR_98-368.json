    "content": "In recent years, proposals have been made to limit the federal government's authority to raise taxes by tying total revenues to economic indicators like GDP or GNP. Some proposals would restrict tax increases to a percentage of economic growth, while others suggest requiring a super-majority for any tax-related legislation. This would allow tax increases only during economic upturns or with a super-majority vote for new laws. Proposals to limit tax increases by tying total revenues to economic indicators like GDP or GNP have been suggested. Some proposals recommend a super-majority requirement for tax-related legislation to only allow tax increases during economic upturns. In the 104th Congress, a proposal was introduced to limit congressional consideration of tax legislation, requiring a two-thirds majority for final adoption unless the increase in internal revenue is deemed de minimis. In the internal revenue section, any increase resulting from lowering an effective tax rate is excluded. Congress can waive this requirement during a declaration of war or military conflict threatening national security. Increases in revenue under a waiver are effective for up to two years. In the 106th Congress, H.J.Res. 96 and H.J.Res. 41 failed to achieve the necessary two-thirds majority for passage. In the 106th Congress, proposals for a tax limitation constitutional amendment were considered in the House of Representatives. H.J.Res. 37 and H.J.Res. 94 were introduced but failed to achieve the necessary two-thirds majority for passage. In the 105th Congress, proposals for a tax limitation constitutional amendment were considered in the House of Representatives. H.J.Res. 62 was introduced by Representative Joe Barton, referred to the House Judiciary Committee, and reported on April 10, 1997. The House considered it on April 15, 1997, under a special rule allowing 3 hours of debate. In the 105th Congress, a proposed tax limitation amendment (H.J.Res. 62) was debated for 3 hours. An amendment was added to clarify the application of the resolution, but it failed to pass with a vote of 233-190. In a subsequent session, a similar amendment (H.J.Res. 111) was introduced by Representative Joe Barton, but also failed to pass with a vote of 238-186. In the 104th Congress, H.J.Res. 159, a proposal to limit congressional consideration of tax legislation, failed to pass with a vote of 243-177. The House adopted Rule XXI, clause 5(b) to limit certain increases in federal income tax rates, which was later modified in the 105th Congress. Some advocates argue that this rule is not sufficient for permanent tax limitations. Advocates argue for a constitutional amendment to impose a permanent tax limitation, citing benefits to the economy and public support. Opponents raise concerns about anti-democratic super-majority requirements and the applicability of state tax limitations to the federal government. The term \"revenue\" in proposed tax limitation amendments raises questions about interpretation by Congress or the Courts. The Origination Clause in the Constitution defines \"revenue\" as funds to support government generally, not specific programs. Different types of receipts to the federal government are not treated equally in the budget process. In the budget process, collections from the public and government activities are treated differently. \"Internal revenue\" and \"internal revenue laws\" have been used to clarify the super-majority requirement, but their interpretation by the courts is not rigorous. The interpretation of limitations on tax increases remains unclear, as courts have not provided rigorous guidance. It is uncertain if such limitations would apply to all funds raised for the federal government or specific programs. For example, fees proposed by President Clinton for specific services may not be considered revenue under these limitations. The phrase \"increasing revenue\" could be broadly interpreted to encompass various measures. The provision to apply tax limitations broadly could impact a large portion of legislation considered by Congress, including measures that stimulate economic activity. Recent proposals have not resolved the question of rate increases versus revenue increases. Several proponents have proposed language focusing on the terms of tax measures rather than their effect on revenues. Proposals in the 104th, 105th, and 106th Congresses required a two-thirds majority for bills levying new taxes or increasing tax rates. The focus was on the form of the measure, specifying that it would apply to changes in internal revenue laws that increase revenue by more than a de minimis amount. Later proposals in the 106th and 107th Congresses specified that the super-majority requirement would not apply to certain measures. The super-majority requirement proposed in Congress focuses on tax measures, specifying that it would not apply to legislation projected to increase revenue by lowering an effective rate. Interpretation may be needed to determine if certain changes in tax laws would trigger the super-majority requirement. The proposed super-majority requirement in Congress focuses on revenue legislation, requiring a three-fifths majority in each House for bills that increase receipts. There is uncertainty on how this limitation would apply to measures that raise tax rates to deter certain activities, potentially leading to a decrease in revenue. Questions arise regarding the reliability and source of revenue estimates for tax limitation constitutional amendments, with potential involvement from various government agencies like the Joint Tax Committee, Congressional Budget Office, Treasury Department, or Office of Management and Budget. The focus is on determining the rate of revenue decrease and the time period for revenue generation, which could impact the applicability of the proposed super-majority requirement in Congress for revenue-increasing bills."
