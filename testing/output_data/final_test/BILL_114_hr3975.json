    "content": "The Act titled \"Veterans Homebuyer Accessibility Act of 2015\" provides a tax credit for first-time homebuyers who are veterans. The \"Veterans Homebuyer Accessibility Act of 2015\" amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow a tax credit for eligible veterans purchasing a principal residence in the United States. The credit is equal to 10 percent of the purchase price of the residence, with an additional limitation for adaptive housing improvements for veterans with disabilities. The tax credit for eligible veterans purchasing a principal residence in the United States is increased by $8,000 or the portion of the purchase price attributable to adaptive fixtures and facilities for disabled veterans. This amendment applies to veterans receiving specially adapted housing assistance under title 38 of the United States Code. The definition of \"eligible veteran\" is amended to include individuals who are veterans as defined in title 38 of the United States Code. Additionally, the recapture of credit provision is modified in cases where the taxpayer disposes of the principal residence for which the credit was allowed. The tax imposed by this chapter may be increased if the taxpayer disposes of their principal residence before the end of the 36-month period after purchase, with exceptions for death or involuntary conversion. The tax may increase if the taxpayer sells their principal residence within 36 months of purchase, with exceptions for death or involuntary conversion. Transfers between spouses or incident to divorce are also exempt from this rule. The tax rule does not apply to the transferee if the transfer is in connection with Government orders for qualified official extended duty service. The term 'qualified official extended duty service' refers to service in the uniformed services, Foreign Service of the United States, or intelligence community. Any term used in this definition that is also used in section 121(d)(9) has the same meaning. Joint returns for a tax credit split equally between individuals. Taxpayers must file a return if taxes increase. The credit does not apply to residences purchased after December 31, 2017. Construction credits can be assigned. The taxpayer can assign a portion of the construction credit to an eligible designee, who will then be treated as the taxpayer for the credit. The taxpayer can assign a portion of the construction credit to an eligible designee, who will be treated as the taxpayer for the credit. The eligible designee is defined as a person who provides or installs improvements, fixtures, or facilities related to the credit. Election requirements for the assignment must be met as per regulations. Conforming amendments include adding a new paragraph to Section 38(b) of the Code for veteran first-time homebuyers. The heading for section 1400C(e)(4) of the Code is amended to change \"national first-time homebuyers credit\" to \"veteran first-time homebuyers credit.\" Additionally, the heading for section 36 of the Code is amended. The amendment introduces a new Veteran First-Time Homebuyer Credit under section 36 and a Veteran Home Mobility Improvement Credit under section 36C in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The effective date for these amendments applies to residences purchased after the enactment of the Act. The veteran can receive a tax credit for qualified adaptive housing improvements up to $8,000, which are special fixtures or movable facilities necessary due to their disability. The taxpayer can assign a portion of the tax credit for adaptive housing improvements to an eligible designee, who will then receive the assigned amount as a credit for that taxable year. The term 'eligible designee' refers to a person who provides or installs qualified adaptive housing improvements and receives the tax credit. The election requirements for assigning the tax credit must be met as per regulations. Conforming amendments are made to related sections in the Internal Revenue Code. The tax credit for veteran home mobility improvement is amended to include the portion assigned to the taxpayer. A new item is added to the table of sections in the Internal Revenue Code. The amendment for the veteran home mobility improvement credit applies to taxable years starting after December 31, 2014."
