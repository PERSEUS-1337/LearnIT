    "content": "The FLSA, enacted in 1938, establishes the federal minimum wage for covered workers. It has been amended multiple times to expand coverage and raise the wage rate, with the most recent change in 2007 to $7.25 per hour. A \"tip credit\" provision was added in 1966, allowing tipped employees to have a reduced cash wage of $2.13 per hour as long as tips and wages equal the minimum wage. The tip credit provision of the FLSA allows employers to count employee tips towards the federal minimum wage, with a maximum tip credit of $5.12 per hour. This ensures that all workers covered under the provision are guaranteed the minimum wage, with the employer cash wage set at $2.13 per hour. The tip credit provision of the FLSA allows employers to count employee tips towards the federal minimum wage, with a maximum tip credit of $5.12 per hour. This means employers may take a credit of up to 71% of their required obligation to pay a minimum wage. A higher tip credit allows employers to count more in tips towards the minimum wage, while a lower tip credit means employers must provide a greater share of an employee's compensation in direct cash wages. No tip credit requires employers to pay direct cash wages equal to the minimum wage without crediting any tip income. The tip credit provision of the FLSA allows employers to count employee tips towards the federal minimum wage, with a maximum tip credit of $5.12 per hour. This means employers may take a credit of up to 71% of their required obligation to pay a minimum wage. The existence of a tip credit means there are two components of the minimum wage for tipped workers\u2014employer cash wage and tips. The combination of the employer cash wage and the tips must equal the required minimum wage. The tip credit does not create a subminimum wage for tipped workers but changes the composition of earnings to a combination of employer wages and tips. The proportions of the tip credit and cash wage have changed over time as Congress has amended the FLSA. The 1996 FLSA amendments changed the employer's minimum cash wage to $2.13 per hour and tied the tip credit to the value of the minimum wage. The employer minimum cash wage was set at 50% of the minimum wage at the time of the legislation, locking it at a fixed dollar amount rather than a percentage of the minimum wage. The tip credit, set as a percentage of the minimum wage since 1966, has increased to 71% under the current federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour. Employers must pay a minimum cash wage of $2.13 per hour (29% of the federal minimum wage) and can take up to $5.12 per hour (71% of the federal minimum wage) as a credit. The tip credit under the FLSA allows employers to pay a minimum cash wage of $2.13 per hour and take up to $5.12 per hour as a credit based on employee tips. If an employee earns less than $5.12 per hour in tips, the employer must make up the difference to meet the minimum wage requirement. The tip credit allows employers to pay a minimum cash wage of $2.13 per hour and take up to $5.12 per hour as a credit based on employee tips. Legislation in the 113th Congress aimed to amend the payment structure for tipped employees under the FLSA. The proposed changes in the 113th Congress aimed to increase the employer contribution for tipped employees from $2.13 per hour to 70% of the federal minimum wage rate. This increase would occur gradually, starting at $3.00 per hour and increasing annually to maintain the 70% threshold. The recent proposals aim to increase the minimum employer cash wage gradually to reach 70% of the federal minimum wage, while adjusting the tip credit to equal 30% of the minimum wage. This would invert the current ratio of minimum employer cash wage to tip credit from 29%-71% to 70%-30%. The proposed changes aim to invert the ratio of minimum employer cash wage to tip credit from 29%-71% to 70%-30% over six years. This adjustment would increase wages for tipped employees, assuming tips remain constant as the minimum wage rises. Determining the cost implications is challenging due to limited data on tips. The potential cost to employers of increasing the federal employer minimum cash wage for tipped workers is complex and varies across states with different minimum wage rates. The impact would depend on the distribution of employer liability under the current system, making it difficult to estimate accurately. The minimum cash wage varies across states, with higher standards prevailing in conflicting minimum wage provisions. For example, in West Virginia, the tip credit is 70% of the state minimum wage, resulting in a minimum employer cash wage of $2.40. Proposed increases in the employer minimum cash wage may not be binding in West Virginia. The diversity of policies across states makes analyzing the potential effects of changes in federal tip credit provisions challenging. In 50 states and the District of Columbia, some do not allow a tip credit, while 39 jurisdictions do. Some states have different tip credit provisions based on the occupation of the tipped worker. The minimum employer cash wage varies across states, making analysis of potential effects of federal tip credit changes difficult. In five states (Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina, and Tennessee), there is no state minimum wage. Employees in these states covered by the FLSA would be subject to federal tip credit provisions for minimum wage. For non-covered employees, there is no minimum wage requirement for tipped or non-tipped employees."
