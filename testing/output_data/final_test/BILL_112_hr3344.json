The \"Give Fans a Chance Act of 2011\" adds conditions to the Antitrust Exemption Act, stating that it does not apply to professional sports leagues with restrictions on ownership transfers to the public or non-compliance with relocation procedures. The club must provide notice of any proposed relocation or elimination at least 180 days before the start of the season. The notice must be given to all interested persons, be in writing, delivered in person or by certified mail, made available to the news media, published in newspapers, and include details of the new home community if applicable. During the 180-day notice period, a proposal can be made to purchase the club to keep it in the home community. If successful, the club must remain a member of the league. During the 180-day notice period, the club must give the opportunity for a proposal to be presented to keep the club in its home community, and the owner must respond in writing. The league must determine the relocation or elimination of a club from its home community before the 180-day notice period expires. Interested persons can present testimony at a hearing conducted by the league. The league must consider inducement proposals and criteria listed in subsection (c) when deciding on club relocation or elimination. Criteria include fan loyalty and support demonstrated in the club's home community. The league must consider criteria such as fan loyalty, good faith negotiations, ownership contributions, public financial support, and stadium adequacy when deciding on club relocation or elimination. The league considers various factors when deciding on club relocation or elimination, including fan loyalty, ownership contributions, public financial support, stadium adequacy, net operating losses, home community overlap with other clubs, opposition from stadium authority, and presence of a fair market value investor. SEC. 3. EFFECTIVE DATE. This Act and its amendment will take effect on the first day of the first month starting more than 180 days after the enactment date."
