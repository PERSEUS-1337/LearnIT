    "content": "The \"Target Practice and Marksmanship Training Support Act\" aims to facilitate the construction and expansion of public target ranges, including those on Federal land managed by the Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management. It defines a public target range as a location designated by a governmental agency for recreational shooting, open to the public, potentially supervised, and able to accommodate various types of shooting activities. The Pittman-Robertson Wildlife Restoration Act is amended to include a definition of a public target range as a location for recreational shooting open to the public and able to accommodate various shooting activities. The Pittman-Robertson Wildlife Restoration Act is amended to allow states to use up to 90 percent of the cost for managing wildlife areas and resources, with specific changes in funding allocation and regulations. The Pittman-Robertson Wildlife Restoration Act is amended to allow states to allocate up to 10 percent of funds for acquiring land for public target ranges. The Federal share of the cost for activities under this section is limited to 75 percent, except for public target range construction where it can be up to 90 percent. The Federal share for activities is limited to 75 percent, except for public target range construction, which can be up to 90 percent. Amounts for acquiring land for public target ranges remain available for expenditure for 5 fiscal years. Sense of Congress is for the Chief of the Forest Service and the Director of the Bureau of Land Management to cooperate with State and local authorities for waste removal and activities on Federal land used as a public target range to support its use for target practice or marksmanship training."
