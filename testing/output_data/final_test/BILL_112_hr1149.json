Section 211(o)(1) of the Clean Air Act is amended to include algae-based biofuel as a type of cellulosic biofuel. Algae-based biofuel is defined as liquid fuel derived from aquatic single or multi-cellular organisms classified as non-vascular plants, with lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions determined by the Administrator. The Administrator determines emissions at least 60 percent less than baseline lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions. The legislation includes algae-based biofuel in the definition of cellulosic biofuel. The legislation amends the Internal Revenue Code to include algae-based biofuel in the cellulosic biofuel producer credit. The legislation includes algae-based biofuel in the cellulosic biofuel producer credit by redesignating subparagraphs and inserting new subparagraphs for qualified algae-based biofuel production. The legislation includes algae-based biofuel in the cellulosic biofuel producer credit for qualified algae-based biofuel production, which involves selling the biofuel for various uses in trade or business. The legislation includes algae-based biofuel in the cellulosic biofuel producer credit for qualified production, involving selling the biofuel for various uses in trade or business, including retail sales and fuel tank placement. Alcohol purchased by the taxpayer and proof-increased by distillation is not considered qualified algae-based biofuel production. The legislation includes algae-based biofuel in the cellulosic biofuel producer credit for qualified production, involving selling the biofuel for various uses in trade or business. Algae-based biofuel is defined as any liquid fuel produced from algal organisms. The term 'algal organism' refers to aquatic organisms like microalgae, blue-green algae, and seaweeds, meeting EPA registration requirements under the Clean Air Act. Alcohol with a proof of less than 150 is excluded from this definition. Alcohol proof less than 150 is excluded from the definition of 'algal organism'. Amendments include adding \"and algae-based\" to certain sections of the Code. Amendments to the tax code include specifying that cellulosic and algae-based biofuels must be produced and used in the United States to qualify for a producer credit. The amendments also involve adding \"and algae-based\" to certain sections of the Code. Amendments to the tax code include adding \"and Algae-based\" to the heading of the Special Allowance for Cellulosic Biofuel Plant Property in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The tax code amendments include defining \"qualified algae-based biofuel plant property\" as property used solely in the US to produce algae-based biofuel. The tax code defines \"algae-based biofuel\" as liquid fuel produced from algal organisms, with specific criteria for eligibility including acquisition after December 31, 2008, and placement in service before January 1, 2013. The tax code defines algae-based biofuel as liquid fuel produced from algal organisms, with specific eligibility criteria including acquisition after December 31, 2008, and placement in service before January 1, 2013. Algae are primarily aquatic non-vascular plants, including microalgae, blue-green algae (cyanobacteria), and macroalgae (seaweeds). Effective dates for the amendments are specified for fuel produced after December 31, 2008, and property purchased and placed in service after the same date."
