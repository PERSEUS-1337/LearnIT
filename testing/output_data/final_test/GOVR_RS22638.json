ITS has collected 50 million Holocaust- and post-war-era documents in Bad Arolsen, Germany, pertaining to around 17.5 million civilian victims of the Nazi regime, with a quarter of the materials focusing on persecuted Jews. The International Tracing Service (ITS) was established in 1947 by allied powers to trace missing persons and preserve documents related to those interned in concentration camps or displaced by the war. The ITS operates under the neutral auspices of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and is overseen by a Swiss delegate accountable to the ICRC and an eleven-member International Commission. Germany funds ITS's operating budget, and it primarily functions as a tracing service for victims of Nazi war crimes. The International Tracing Service (ITS) was established in 1947 by allied powers to trace missing persons and preserve documents related to those interned in concentration camps or displaced by the war. Access to information in the Bad Arolsen archives was limited to civilian victims of Nazi war crimes and their descendants. ITS claims to have provided approximately 11 million written responses to individual requests for information since its inception, but before 2006, the service was criticized for leaving many requests unanswered and providing inadequate information. In 2000 and 2001, the International Tracing Service (ITS) faced criticism for mismanagement and neglect under director Charles-Claude Biedermann. Pressure from the public and International Commission led to Biedermann's replacement in 2006, with a backlog of 425,000 requests for information. This backlog was deemed unacceptable by ICRC officials. In response to pressure from Holocaust survivor organizations and the United States, the International Commission of the ITS agreed in 2006 to open the ITS archives to historical research after years of debate. This decision allowed researchers access to digital copies of archived materials while addressing concerns about individual privacy rights. The Commission member states agreed to open the archives in 2006, with France and Greece ratifying the agreement in 2007. This allowed for digitization and transfer of materials, as well as public access. Priorities include prompt digitization, efficient search systems, reducing backlog of information requests. The ITS management is focused on reducing the backlog of information requests, training staff, and considering administrative reform. Digitization and transfer of archived materials are top priorities, with millions of images and names already transferred to the Holocaust Museum. Access to these files will be available to the public with assistance from museum staff starting in January 2008. The Wartime or Forced Labor Collection is expected to be digitized and accessible by mid-2008. The Holocaust Museum aims to digitize and make accessible the Bad Arolsen records by early 2011. Concerns have been raised about the accessibility of the digitized materials, with critics questioning the decision not to make the records available online. Officials argue that trained archivists are needed to navigate the millions of documents in the collection. The Holocaust Museum is working on digitizing the Bad Arolsen records, with an index of the collections available on their website for public access. Trained archivists are required to organize the records for historical research, and additional resources are needed for this process. The German government is covering costs for file digitization, while the museum is seeking funds for file transfer and organization. The Holocaust Museum is seeking funds for file transfer, staffing, software, and hardware costs to make millions of records accessible to the public. The estimated total cost over five years is $6.5 million. The ICRC replaced the ITS director in 2006 to reduce a 425,000 request backlog, aiming to eliminate it by mid-2008. Some question the methods used to reduce the backlog, suggesting that many requests were discarded, possibly due to requesters' deaths. ITS is committed to responding to new requests within an eight-week period. The ICRC is committed to responding to new requests within an eight-week period and is complying with its policy. As ITS's mission shifts to facilitating historical research, experts may question the archives' administrative structure. Some argue that the ICRC may not be the best entity to administer a historical archive, while others believe the 11-member Commission's unanimous consent requirement hinders effective management. The ICRC and U.S. State Department support ITS's oversight structure until 2012 when archives are digitized and transferred to the Holocaust Memorial Museum. The archives are expected to be digitized and transferred to the Holocaust Memorial Museum. ICRC officials want to discuss the organization's role in managing the archives after the transfer, but ownership and location in Germany could complicate decisions. ITS's mission has evolved to provide information for various purposes, including documentation for WWII insurance claims. In 1998, the International Commission on Holocaust Era Insurance Claims (ICHEIC) was established to honor unpaid policies. The International Commission on Holocaust Era Insurance Claims (ICHEIC) facilitated the payment of $306.25 million to approximately 48,000 eligible claimants out of 90,000. It faced criticism for delays, honoring only a small portion of claims, and lack of transparency. Supporters argue that the process, which included publishing 520,000 policyholder names, was fair and comprehensive. ICHEIC's work involved extensive research and collaboration with insurance companies and Holocaust archives. ICHEIC worked closely with insurance companies and Holocaust archives but did not access materials in Bad Arolsen. The archives were found to have limited information for resolving insurance claims. A settlement with Assicurazioni Generali allowed claims with documentation from the archives until August 2008. The extension of insurance claims with documentation from the archives until August 2008 was due to the expected opening of the archives, which contained unclear information on insurance policies. Congressional action played a key role in drawing international attention to the archives' closure and opening them for historical research. Members also pushed for timely digitization and transfer of ITS collections. Opening the archives could potentially reveal documentation on World-War II era insurance policies, with bills introduced in Congress to disclose Holocaust-era policies. Improved access to the archives may uncover information on unpaid insurance policies, although ITS officials and historians suggest it is unlikely to contain definitive evidence."
