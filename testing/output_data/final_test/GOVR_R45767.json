    "content": "According to a 2014 study by the National Center for Education Statistics, 53% of public schools need funds for building repairs, renovations, and modernizations, totaling $197 billion nationwide. The lack of ongoing federal data collection makes it challenging to assess the current state of school facilities and infrastructure needs. The Rebuild America's Schools Act of 2019 (H.R. 865 / S. 266) proposes $70 billion in grants and $30 billion in school infrastructure tax credit bonds for construction and repair of public schools. Funds would be allocated based on prior-year local educational agency grant allocations. Additional funds would be authorized for Impact Aid construction payments. Public schools traditionally funded by state and local governments, with property taxes being a major revenue source. States and LEAs use various funding streams for school construction, including issuing general obligation bonds repaid with revenue like property taxes. Nationwide, public schools spent around $48 billion on facilities acquisition and construction. In the 2015-2016 school year, public schools spent $48 billion on facilities acquisition and construction. The federal government provides direct and indirect support for school infrastructure through loans, grants, and programs targeting specific student populations or needs, such as students with disabilities, Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians, American Indians, children of military parents, schools affected by natural disasters, and those in rural areas. Additionally, there are facilities financing assistance programs to promote charter school development. The federal government provides support for school infrastructure through various programs and grants. A one-time appropriation of $1.2 billion was made for emergency school renovation and repair activities. Additionally, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 authorized a $54 billion State Fiscal Stabilization Fund for states to use for renovation and construction purposes. The State Fiscal Stabilization Fund (SFSF) required states to use 81.8% of their share for restoring support to schools and 18.2% for education, public safety, and other government services. Funds could be used for modernization, renovation, or repair of school facilities. ED allowed a portion of the SFSF to be used for K-12 school construction but not higher education institutions. The Internal Revenue Code exempts interest on state and local government bonds for public projects like schools and roads from federal income tax, reducing the cost of capital for these governments. H.R. 865 aims to support elementary and secondary school construction through federal grants administered by the Department of Education and the Department of the Treasury. H.R. 865 aims to support school construction through federal grants and tax credit bonds. It authorizes grants for public school facilities, school infrastructure bonds, and a temporary increase in funding for Impact Aid construction. $7 billion in grants per fiscal year would be allocated for long-term improvements to public school facilities. The remaining funds from H.R. 865 would be allocated to states based on their share of ESEA Title I-A state grants, with competitive grants given to qualified LEAs for public school facility improvements. States must submit plans to ED outlining fund usage and eligibility criteria, match 10% of the allocation from nonfederal sources, and maintain fiscal effort. Maintenance of effort provision ensures continued support for funded activities. The bill would require states to maintain a certain level of fiscal effort for public school facilities, use funds to supplement existing funds, and reserve a small portion for state-level responsibilities. LEAs must have received an ESEA Title I-A grant to be eligible for a competitive grant. LEA eligibility for competitive grants under the bill would require having received an ESEA Title I-A grant in the previous year and being among those with the highest number or percentage of children in need. Priority would be given to improving facilities for schools serving students qualifying for free or reduced-price lunches, with additional consideration for schools with severe health or safety issues. States must ensure geographic diversity in grant recipients and may include facility improvement needs in eligibility criteria. States would prioritize applications based on these criteria. H.R. 865 aims to prioritize applications from LEAs for competitive grants based on eligibility criteria. States can also prioritize grants for broadband access or schools lacking broadband. Qualifying LEAs must submit applications with specific information, including project descriptions and safety measures. Charter schools must detail facility ownership and funding challenges. The bill aims to provide funding to schools lacking access through grants, with requirements for LEAs, states, and the Department of Education to take certain actions. LEAs must submit a 10-year facilities master plan within 180 days of receiving a grant, and provide annual information on projects and student population. States must compile and distribute this information to LEAs, the public, and tribal governments, submitting it to the Secretary of Education. The Secretary must report to relevant committees by the end of each fiscal year. H.R. 865 aims to reauthorize certain tax credit bonds and introduce School Infrastructure Bonds. These bonds provide investors with a federal tax credit or direct payment. The bill also includes wage rate requirements for school infrastructure bonds, similar to those for Qualified Zone Academy Bonds. H.R. 865 would amend the Internal Revenue Code to authorize QSCBs and QZABs for the first time since 2017. QSCBs provided bond proceeds for public school facilities, with a national limit of $11 billion in 2009 and 2010. The authority to issue QSCBs expired in 2010, but H.R. 865 would restore them as a qualified tax credit bond. Additionally, the bill would reauthorize QZABs and remove the former private business contribution requirement. H.R. 865 would reauthorize QZABs, remove the private business contribution requirement, and set the bond limitation at $1.4 billion annually. It would allow QZABs to fund school construction and renovation for public schools in empowerment zones or with a high percentage of students on free or reduced-price lunches. School Infrastructure Bonds under H.R. 865 would function as a new type of tax credit bond to support long-term improvements to public school facilities, with a national volume cap of $10 billion. The bill authorizes a national volume cap of $10 billion in School Infrastructure Bonds per year from 2020 to 2022. 0.5% of the bond limitation would be allocated to U.S. possessions and 0.5% to schools funded by the Bureau of Indian Education. The rest would go to states based on their prior-year Title I-A state grants share, with no hold harmless provision. States and U.S. possessions would allocate their share to issuers using the same eligibility criteria as the competitive grant program in Title I of H.R. 865. Bond holders would receive a tax credit equal to 100% of the interest payable. The bill H.R. 865 authorizes School Infrastructure Bonds with a national volume cap of $10 billion per year from 2020 to 2022. Bond holders would receive a tax credit equal to 100% of the interest payable by the issuer. Funds from grants or bonds can be used for new construction, renovation, major repairs, site acquisition, expansion of broadband access, and compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act for public school facilities. LEAs are prohibited from using funds for certain purposes. The bill H.R. 865 authorizes School Infrastructure Bonds with a national volume cap of $10 billion per year from 2020 to 2022. LEAs would be prohibited from using funds for routine maintenance, minor repairs, athletic facilities, vehicles, or non-educational facilities. A certain percentage of funds for new construction or renovation must be used for activities certified with \"green\" standards, increasing each year until FY2024. LEAs must ensure iron, steel, and manufactured products used in projects are made in the U.S. H.R. 865 authorizes School Infrastructure Bonds with a $10 billion national volume cap per year from 2020 to 2022. The Secretary of Education can waive the requirement for materials to be produced in the U.S. under certain conditions. Within two years, the Government Accountability Office must submit a report on projects funded by H.R. 865, including project types, geographic distribution, and impacts on health and safety. The report will also address improving accessibility of funds for schools with high numbers of students under ESEA Title I-A. The bill authorizes School Infrastructure Bonds with a $10 billion national volume cap per year from 2020 to 2022. It requires the Government Accountability Office to submit a report on projects funded by the bill, including impacts on health and safety, accessibility of funds for schools with high numbers of students under ESEA Title I-A, and a comprehensive study of the physical condition of all public schools in the United States every five years. H.R. 865 does not include an authorization of appropriations for establishing a clearinghouse to disseminate information on federal programs for energy projects. The Impact Aid program compensates LEAs for financial burdens from federal activities and enrollments of certain students. The Impact Aid program provides payments for construction and facilities upgrades to certain LEAs serving children on tribal lands or with parents in the uniformed services. H.R. 865 extends the authorization of appropriations for this program through FY2023 with increased funding levels. For FY2020, the existing authorization level is $18,756,765, which would be raised to $50,406,000 for FY2021 and FY2022, and $52,756,765 for FY2023. H.R. 865 extends the Impact Aid program's authorization of appropriations through FY2023 with increased funding levels. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that enactment of the bill would result in significant increases in direct spending, decreases in revenues, and higher outlays subject to appropriation from FY2019 to FY2029."
