Section 10(m) of the National Labor Relations Act is amended to require the Board to issue findings and orders within 365 days of filing an unfair labor practice charge, except in complex cases. The Board must take actions to cease unfair practices and may reinstate employees with or without backpay. An annual report is to be submitted to the Committee on Education. The Board must submit an annual report to the Committee on Education and the Workforce of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Labor and Human Resources of the Senate regarding cases pending for more than 1 year, explaining delays and providing recommendations for resolution. The Board may issue regulations to fulfill the purposes of this title. The Congress acknowledges the disadvantage small businesses and labor organizations face when dealing with actions from the National Labor Relations Board. The Equal Access to Justice Act has not effectively helped level the playing field. Due to the Board's greater expertise and resources, certain small entities should be awarded fees and costs when they prevail against the Board. The purpose of this title is to ensure that small businesses and labor organizations are not deterred from seeking review or defending against actions by the National Labor Relations Board due to costs. It aims to reduce the disparity in resources and expertise between these entities and the Board, making the Board more accountable by awarding fees and costs to small businesses and labor organizations when they prevail. SEC. 402 of the National Labor Relations Act is amended to include a new section on awards of attorneys' fees and costs. Sec. 20 of the National Labor Relations Act allows for the awarding of fees and expenses to employers or labor organizations who prevail in adversary adjudications conducted by the Board, regardless of the Board's justification. This applies to entities with less than 100 employees and a net worth of under $1,400,000 at the time of the adjudication. An employer or labor organization with less than 100 employees and a net worth under $1,400,000, who prevails in a civil action against the Board, is entitled to fees and expenses under section 2412(d) of title 28, United States Code, without consideration of the United States' justification. SEC. 403. APPLICABILITY. This section specifies that the provisions added to the National Labor Relations Act apply to agency and court proceedings initiated after the enactment of the Act in 1998."
