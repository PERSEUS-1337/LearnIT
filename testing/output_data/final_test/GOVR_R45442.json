    "content": "Congress's power to create agencies is well established, with the First Congress enacting measures to create departments to aid the President in executing laws. Congress sought to retain influence and control over these departments, requiring reports from officials. The delicate balance between congressional creation and control of agencies and the President's authority to supervise executive officials was acknowledged. The First Congress debated the scope of presidential and congressional control over executive agencies. There was a significant debate on the President's authority to remove officials, with the prevailing position in favor of the President's power. A proposal to structure the Department of the Treasury as a multi-member commission was rejected due to concerns about effective administration. Congress's power over administrative agencies was confirmed by later Supreme Court decisions. Congress's power over the administrative state is not unlimited due to constraints from the separation of powers doctrine. The Supreme Court has not endorsed absolute separation among the branches, emphasizing separateness but interdependence. The relationship between Congress and executive agencies is governed by well-established principles. The relationship between Congress and the administrative state is governed by well-established principles that limit Congress's power over the executive branch. Key limitations include Congress not being able to displace executive authority or appoint/remove executive officers, but it can direct, prohibit, or legislate on agency actions within certain boundaries set by constitutional provisions and implied principles related to the separation of powers. The relationship between Congress and the administrative state is guided by principles that restrict Congress's authority over the executive branch. Congress can control administrative agencies through legislative power, focusing on structural design, delegation of authority, procedural controls, and agency funding. The way an agency is structured impacts its operations and relationship with Congress and the President, influencing the level of independence and control the President can exert. Congress has various options in structuring agencies, affecting their independence and the extent of presidential control. Congress has various options in structuring agencies, affecting their independence and the extent of presidential control. This includes choices related to agency leadership, appointment and removal of officers, and presidential supervision. Structural choices can range from creating a multi-member commission or a single director, to establishing statutory qualifications for appointees and dictating the length of an official's term of office. The placement of an agency within an existing department or agency, and whether an agency official serves at the pleasure of the President, also impact the level of control exerted. An agency official may serve at the pleasure of the President or be protected from removal except for specific reasons. Congress can exempt agencies from certain presidential supervision, but must comply with constitutional requirements. The Appointments Clause limits Congress in structuring federal agencies to ensure accountability to the President and the public. The Appointments Clause imposes limitations on how executive agency officials are appointed, distinguishing between principal officers appointed by the President with Senate approval and inferior officers appointed by different entities. The classification as an officer or non-officer depends on the authority exercised by the official. The distinction between principal and inferior officers in the United States is not always clear. The Supreme Court has suggested that the key factor is whether the officer is supervised by a higher official, rather than the amount of authority they wield. Principal officers are typically supervised only by the President, while inferior officers are supervised by higher-ranking, Senate-confirmed officials. Congress has limited discretion in appointing agency heads, as those who exercise significant authority and are supervised solely by the President are considered principal officers. The distinction between principal and inferior officers in the United States is based on supervision. Principal officers are supervised only by the President, while inferior officers are supervised by higher-ranking, Senate-confirmed officials. Congress has some discretion in appointing inferior officers, allowing them to vest appointment authority in certain officials or entities. However, Congress cannot reserve the authority to appoint any officer, and the President's general authority to oversee the executive branch limits Congress's structural choices in agency design. The President's ability to ensure accountability through removal of executive branch officials is essential for overseeing the enforcement and execution of the law. Removal protections aim to insulate agencies from presidential control, but the President's constitutional duty to oversee the faithful execution of laws cannot be undermined. The Supreme Court has established that Article II confers upon the presidency the \"administrative control\" of the executive branch. The Supreme Court has outlined the President's authority to oversee the executive branch through removal in key cases like Myers v. United States and Humphrey's Executor v. United States. Article II grants the President general administrative control, including the power of appointment and removal of executive officers. Congress can limit the President's removal power by providing for cause removal protections for certain officials. The Supreme Court has upheld for cause removal protections in cases like Morrison v. Olson and Free Enterprise Fund v. PCAOB, ensuring the President's ability to oversee independent investigations and prosecutions while also allowing Congress to limit removal power for certain officials. The Supreme Court has upheld for cause removal protections, limiting the President's authority to hold subordinates accountable and ensuring independence in investigations. Congressional attempts to insulate officials from presidential control may face limitations. Providing officials with removal protections can encourage independence from the President and responsiveness to Congress. Congress controls federal agencies by detailing their jurisdiction, setting policy goals, and choosing whether they can regulate the public. Congressional attempts to insulate officials from presidential control may face limitations. Congress has the authority to grant agencies the power to issue rules, enforce laws, and adjudicate claims. Delegated authority can be adjusted or terminated by Congress at any time, including through sunset provisions. However, Congress is limited by the non-delegation doctrine in its ability to empower agencies. The non-delegation doctrine limits Congress's ability to bestow legislative authority on other entities, including the executive branch, to prevent abdication of its core legislative function. While the Supreme Court has stated that Congress cannot delegate legislative power, the standard for determining delegation is more lenient. The non-delegation doctrine limits Congress's ability to delegate legislative authority, but the standard for delegation is more lenient than expected. Congress must establish an \"intelligible principle\" to govern delegated power, which limits agency discretion and ensures separation of powers. Congress can also condition agency authority based on specific events or factual determinations. The report and wait provisions enacted by Congress allow agencies to report on proposed actions to Congress and wait before implementing them, giving Congress the opportunity to reject the actions through legislation. Congress can establish expedited procedures for rejecting agency actions, such as joint resolutions of disapproval. This framework ensures that agency actions require congressional approval to become effective. The Administrative Procedure Act (APA), enacted in 1946, sets procedural rules for federal agencies to follow when creating regulations and conducting adjudicatory proceedings. This framework ensures that agency actions must be approved through legislation before they can take effect. Congress can also control agencies by prescribing procedures for exercising delegated powers. The APA sets procedural requirements for federal agencies in rulemaking and adjudication proceedings to safeguard public rights and ensure agency flexibility. Agencies must publish proposed rules, allow public comments, and issue final rules with a statement of basis and purpose. Adjudications must be determined on the record after an agency hearing. The APA sets procedural requirements for federal agencies in rulemaking and adjudication proceedings to safeguard public rights and ensure agency flexibility. In adjudications, impartial adjudicators preside over formalized, trial-like procedures. Other statutes like the Congressional Review Act and Regulatory Flexibility Act also govern administrative procedure, impacting agency action by requiring transparency and public accountability. Congress has significant control over agency funding, which can influence agency priorities and actions. This power is granted by Article I of the Constitution, allowing Congress to determine agency appropriations to provide for the \"Common Defence and general Welfare of the United States.\" Congress controls agency funding levels through appropriations, setting limits on funding amounts and specifying purposes. Agencies must not exceed authorized funds or withhold them inappropriately. Federal statutes like the Antideficiency Act reinforce Congress's power over spending. Congress can also restrict fund use to influence agency activities and policy goals. The Supreme Court acknowledges Congress's authority in this matter. The Supreme Court recognizes Congress's authority to control agency funding through appropriations riders, which limit agency discretion in resource allocation. These riders can prevent agencies from certain actions, transforming how federal agencies implement laws. However, Congress cannot use its power of the purse for unconstitutional purposes, as seen in cases like Lovett v. United States. Congress has broad authority to control federal agencies through legislation, but non-statutory tools can also be used independently to influence agency action. The Constitution imposes limitations on how Congress can exercise its power, requiring participation and agreement among the House, Senate, and the President. The Constitution imposes limitations on how Congress can exercise its power over agencies, requiring compliance with specific procedures such as bicameralism and presentment. This ensures that legislation must pass both the House and Senate before being presented to the President for approval. In Chadha, the Court invalidated a provision allowing Congress to veto deportation authority, stating that legislative acts must comply with bicameralism and presentment requirements. The Court defined legislative acts as actions altering legal rights outside the legislative branch. The Chadha opinion identified exceptions to the bicameralism and presentment requirement in the Constitution, highlighting specific powers granted to each House of Congress. This decision emphasized that Congress should only act within a closely defined legislative arena, except in certain enumerated instances. The Chadha decision limits the ability of individual houses or members of Congress to directly control federal agencies. Congress must generally act together, along with the President, to compel or prohibit agency action. The Supreme Court has consistently interpreted Chadha as restricting the legal impact of non-statutory legislative actions. The Supreme Court's interpretation of Article I's bicameralism and presentment requirements affects congressional involvement in administrative decision-making. Congressional actors have non-statutory tools to influence agencies, such as expressions of disapproval, criminal contempt of Congress, and the power to arrest individuals. These tools are significant for both houses of Congress. Congress has the power to issue expressions of disapproval towards executive branch officials, which can take the form of censure, condemnation, or calls for resignation. These expressions are typically in the form of resolutions and have historically been used since 1793. While they have no legal effect, they can influence the behavior of agency officials. Some argue that congressional censure of executive officials is unconstitutional, citing the exclusive nature of impeachment for punishing officials. However, this argument is not widely accepted as censure is seen as a form of disapproval separate from impeachment. Censure resolutions do not legally compel removal from office or serve as punishment after impeachment and conviction. A censure would only violate the Constitution's prohibition on bills of attainder if it imposed punishment without judicial trial. The Supreme Court defines a bill of attainder as legislation that determines guilt and inflicts punishment on an individual without due process. This punishment historically includes imprisonment, banishment, property confiscation, and restrictions on employment. Censure resolutions, unlike bills of attainder, do not impose punishment without judicial trial. While censure does not have direct legal consequences, failure to comply with a congressional subpoena may lead to legal penalties. This could result in criminal prosecution in federal court for individuals who refuse to testify or provide documents in response to a subpoena. The threat of referral to the United States Attorney for criminal prosecution can encourage agency compliance with congressional oversight requests. Refusal to provide testimony or documents to Congress can result in misdemeanor charges, fines, and imprisonment. If approved, a criminal contempt citation is sent to the U.S. attorney for action by the grand jury, with limitations on Congress's use of the statute. The criminal contempt of Congress statute cannot prosecute constitutionally protected conduct and requires a valid subpoena. The executive branch retains discretion in deciding whether to pursue criminal contempt charges. The executive branch has discretion in deciding whether to pursue criminal contempt charges, including presenting the matter to a grand jury. The branch has asserted that the contempt of Congress statute may not apply to an Executive Branch official asserting executive privilege. Past instances show that the Department of Justice may not prosecute criminal contempt when the President directs non-compliance with a subpoena. The executive branch has discretion in deciding whether to pursue criminal contempt charges, including presenting the matter to a grand jury. The inherent contempt power allows each house to arrest and detain individuals obstructing legislative duties. Despite its title, \"inherent\" contempt is more accurately an implied constitutional power. The inherent contempt power, although not explicitly granted by the Constitution, is implied from the general legislative powers of Congress. It allows the House or Senate to authorize the arrest of a contemnor by the Sergeant at Arms and detain them until compliance. This power has been criticized as cumbersome and inefficient, with no inherent contempt proceedings initiated since 1935. The House of Representatives has non-statutory tools with limited legal effect. The House of Representatives has non-statutory tools with limited legal effect, such as resolutions of inquiry to request information from executive branch officials. These tools may have weighty and legally consequential effects, including the ability to impeach federal government officials for \"high Crimes and Misdemeanors\" and initiate civil actions in federal court to enforce compliance with congressional subpoenas. Resolutions of inquiry are non-legally binding tools used by the House to request information from executive branch officials, primarily related to foreign affairs, defense, or intelligence matters. They rely on comity between branches of government rather than compulsion and are privileged if directed towards department heads for factual information. While not legally enforceable, they can be phrased in mandatory terms when directed at officials other than the President. The Constitution gives the House of Representatives the power to impeach federal officials, while the Senate has the sole power to try impeachments. Impeachment is not for punishment but to maintain constitutional government. Impeachment of executive officials is rare, with only two Presidents and one Cabinet member impeached. The House must draft articles of impeachment to formally accuse an official of impeachable offenses. If a simple majority in the House votes to impeach, the proceedings move to the Senate for trial. The Constitution allows the House to impeach federal officials, with the Senate conducting the trial. Impeachment is to uphold constitutional government, with only Presidents and Cabinet members historically impeached. Impeachment is limited to \"civil Officers,\" including federal judges and Cabinet-level officials. Non-Cabinet level executive branch officials may not be subject to impeachment, and non-officer federal employees are likely exempt. Members of Congress and military officials have not been impeached. The Constitution specifies that only \"civil Officers\" can be impeached for committing \"Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.\" The term \"high Crimes and Misdemeanors\" has been broadly interpreted by Congress to include misconduct that damages the state and government institutions. The three general categories of conduct for impeachment are: 1) exceeding or abusing powers of office, 2) behavior incompatible with office functions, and 3) misuse of office for personal gain. The House can use federal courts to influence agency action, mainly related to subpoena enforcement. Recent practice allows the House to authorize a civil claim in federal court through a simple House resolution to enforce a subpoena. The House can authorize a civil claim in federal court through a simple resolution to enforce a subpoena, granting the committee the authority to seek compliance with the demand for information. The court evaluates Congress's oversight powers and the official's justification for non-compliance, ordering disclosure of information if the lawsuit succeeds. The court ruled in Committee on Oversight and Government Reform v. Lynch that the DOJ must comply with a House committee subpoena. The House has standing to challenge expenditures made without congressional appropriation, as seen in United States House of Representatives v. Burwell. However, the House lacks standing when challenging an agency's interpretation or execution of the law. The Senate has oversight tools exclusive to its \"advice and consent\" responsibility. The Senate has exclusive oversight responsibilities related to appointments, treaties, and impeachment trials. It can enforce subpoenas through civil actions in federal court, guided by federal statute. The Senate can enforce subpoenas through civil actions in federal court, but the statute is limited when it comes to agency officials. The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia has jurisdiction to hear claims regarding subpoenas issued by the Senate or its committees. However, federal officials can refuse to comply with a subpoena based on a governmental privilege assertion. Despite this, the Senate may still have the authority to seek enforcement of a subpoena through a Senate resolution authorizing a lawsuit. The Senate can enforce subpoenas through civil actions in federal court, with the authority to seek enforcement of a subpoena through a Senate resolution authorizing a lawsuit. The Constitution grants the Senate the power to influence executive branch functions through the Appointments Clause and the Treaty Clause, requiring Senate approval for appointments and treaties. This allows the Senate to exert control over important executive branch powers by conditioning or withholding consent. The Appointments Clause requires presidential nominations for executive branch positions to be confirmed by a simple majority of Senators. Over 1,200 positions require Senate approval, and acting officials can temporarily perform duties without senatorial approval when a position is vacant. The Senate's advice-and-consent function serves as a check on the executive branch, allowing them to influence nominations and confirmations for important offices. Senators can block nominees to push for agreeable candidates and seek commitments from nominees on policies and principles. The Senate's advice-and-consent function allows them to influence nominations and confirmations for important offices. This power was exemplified during the \"Saturday Night Massacre\" of 1973 when the Attorney General and Deputy Attorney General resigned after being directed to fire the Watergate special prosecutor. Attorney General Elliot Richardson resigned to uphold the independence of the special prosecutor. The Treaty Clause of the Constitution also limits the President's power to ratify treaties with foreign nations. The Treaty Clause of the Constitution requires the President to obtain senatorial consent before ratifying a treaty with a foreign nation or international body. This clause serves as a significant check on the President's foreign relations power, allowing the Senate to withhold consent or impose conditions on treaty ratification. The impeachment and removal process involves distinct roles for both houses of Congress. If the House votes to impeach an official, it will then forward articles of impeachment to the Senate, which has the sole power to try all impeachments. The Vice President generally presides over impeachment trials, but the Chief Justice of the United States presides when the President has been impeached. If two-thirds of the Senate votes to convict the official based on any of the articles of impeachment, the official will be removed from office. After the Senate votes to convict and remove an official based on articles of impeachment, they may hold a separate vote to disqualify the official from holding future federal office. This disqualification only requires a majority vote. The Senate cannot impose any punishment other than removal and disqualification. The full Senate votes on conviction, but a committee of Senators can receive evidence and testimony before the vote, as seen in Nixon v. United States. Nixon v. United States involved the impeachment and conviction of Walter L. Nixon, Jr., a former Chief Judge. Nixon was found guilty of false statements, impeached by the House, and convicted by the Senate. He challenged the Senate's impeachment rule, but the Supreme Court deemed it a nonjusticiable political question. The Supreme Court in Nixon v. United States ruled that the Senate has the sole power to try impeachments, and that judicial review of the Senate's impeachment procedures is not allowed. This decision emphasized the Senate's discretion in conducting impeachment trials and highlighted the limitations of judicial challenges in such cases. Congressional committees have significant influence over executive branch actions through investigative oversight, uncovering abuse of authority or maladministration. Hearings provide opportunities for committees to guide agencies on carrying out their functions. This power complements Congress's authority to conduct investigations. Congress's power to conduct investigations complements its legislative and appropriation functions. The \"power of inquiry\" is essential for gathering information related to legislative activity, allowing Congress to obtain testimony and documents on a wide range of matters. Committees can initiate investigations, hold hearings, and request testimony or documents within constitutional and jurisdictional constraints. Congressional oversight investigations are conducted by committees and subcommittees, which have the authority to hold hearings, request testimony, and enforce compliance through subpoenas. Most investigative oversight into executive agencies is carried out through informal staff-to-staff contacts. Congressional oversight investigations are conducted by committees and subcommittees through informal staff-to-staff contacts. Laws have been enacted to support committee investigative powers, including criminalizing conduct that obstructs oversight. Committees can refer possible offenses to the Department of Justice for investigation, but prosecution decisions are made by the executive branch. Committees are empowered to obtain an immunity order under federal law. Federal law empowers committees to obtain an immunity order from a federal court to compel a witness who has asserted the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination to testify. A court order can be obtained from a United States district court following a two-thirds affirmative vote in the committee conducting the investigation. The district court \"shall grant\" the immunity order when petitioned, although the Attorney General can request to delay the order. The Fifth Amendment's protections prohibit the compelled testimony and any evidence derived from that testimony from being used against the witness in a later criminal prosecution, except for perjury, false statement, or contempt relating to the testimony. Congress's oversight and investigatory powers are not unlimited, with jurisdictional limitations and procedural requirements imposed by each house or committee's rules. Investigations must serve a legislative purpose, allowing inquiries into topics for potential legislation, oversight, or compliance with existing laws. Congressional committees have the power to conduct investigations, but they must respect constitutional restrictions and privileges. The Bill of Rights applies to these investigations, protecting individuals' rights such as free speech, protection against unreasonable subpoenas, and the right against self-incrimination. Executive privilege can also limit a committee's access to information. Executive privilege can limit a committee's authority to obtain information from executive branch agencies. It consists of two components: the deliberative process privilege, which protects decision-making processes, and the presidential communications privilege, which maintains the confidentiality of direct presidential decision-making. These privileges allow the executive branch to discuss options candidly without fear of public disclosure, leading to potential conflicts between committees and agencies during investigations. The legal basis for the deliberative process privilege is less clear compared to the presidential communications privilege. The legal source of the deliberative process privilege, which stems from the Constitution, is unclear. Congressional committees have discretion in recognizing common law privileges asserted by witnesses, affecting the extent to which the privilege limits investigations. Committees can use non-binding report language to influence agency actions, directing fund use and guiding delegated authority implementation. This tool's influence comes from the committee's relationship with overseeing agencies. Committee report language is used to communicate preferences to agencies tasked with implementing legislation. It can explain interpretations of bill provisions or articulate requirements not directly in the bill. While not legally binding like statutory text, agencies typically comply with report directives to avoid offending committees with oversight. Committee report language communicates preferences to agencies for implementing legislation, serving as a non-binding alternative to unconstitutional committee controls. This can lead to informal committee-imposed consequences or formal legislative actions by Congress. Report language and informal agreements do not have the force of law but can influence agency decision-making. Agencies may voluntarily comply with committee report language, which does not violate constitutional principles. Individual Members have tools to influence agency action, such as seeking information through cooperation or utilizing specific powers granted by procedural rules and customary practices. Committee chairs have authority to compel disclosure of information or conduct oversight activities within their jurisdiction. Individual Members of Congress have the power to compel testimony and obtain information from administrative agencies through statutes like the \"Seven Member Rule.\" This authority is derived from the Constitution, and committee chairs also have the authority to compel disclosure of information within their jurisdiction. Individual Members of Congress can obtain information from administrative agencies through various means, including submitting requests under FOIA, relying on investigative agencies, and initiating lawsuits. However, after the Supreme Court's 1997 decision in Raines v. Byrd, individual Members face obstacles in suing executive branch agencies or officials. Individual Members of Congress can sue executive branch agencies or officials in federal court only if alleging a personal or institutional injury. The Supreme Court recognizes standing for legislators when their votes are nullified by executive action. Few legislators without authorization have been successful in pursuing civil actions against the executive branch. Members can also participate in litigation as amici curiae. An amicus curiae is a person who is not a party to a lawsuit but files a brief in the action due to a strong interest in the subject matter. Members of Congress may file amicus briefs in judicial proceedings for various reasons, such as articulating policy views or defending legislative branch interests. While they cannot control agency action, these briefs can alert executive branch officials to certain Members' views. Individual Members of Congress may have some influence over administrative agencies, but courts have imposed limitations on their actions. Courts have imposed limitations on legislators' influence over administrative agencies, particularly prohibiting interference with agency adjudicators' decision-making process to maintain impartiality. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit has established that any extraneous factors affecting the individual decision-maker's consideration can invalidate an adjudication. The D.C. Circuit has ruled that legislator pressure can only invalidate a rule in agency rulemaking if it forces the decision-maker to consider factors not relevant to the statute and if the decision is influenced by those extraneous considerations. Congress has various tools to influence and control executive branch agencies, including establishing agencies, shaping their structures and operations, appointing and removing agency officials, and delegating lawmaking authority. Congress can exert control over executive branch agencies through legislative processes and non-statutory tools, such as impeachment and censure. These tools allow Congress to influence or potentially control agencies and officials."
