    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Improving Employment Outcomes of TANF Recipients Act\" and aims to improve economic mobility of TANF recipients. Section 403(a)(4) of the Social Security Act is amended to improve economic mobility of TANF recipients by measuring state performance through collecting and reporting necessary information for indicators. The indicators for a fiscal year include the employment percentage of families receiving assistance under State programs funded with qualified State expenditures. The retention percentage for the fiscal year is calculated by dividing the number of families with an adult in unsubsidized employment after exiting the program by the number of families who received assistance in the exit quarter. The retention percentage is calculated by dividing the number of families exiting the State program who have an adult in unsubsidized employment in the 4th quarter after exit by the total number of families receiving assistance in the exit quarter. The advancement measure for the fiscal year is the median earnings of adults receiving assistance under the State program funded with qualified State expenditures. The State must agree with the Secretary on performance levels for indicators in fiscal years 2020 and 2021 for individuals exiting the program and entering unsubsidized employment. The State and the Secretary must establish performance levels for indicators in fiscal years 2020 and 2021, taking into account comparisons with other States and adjusting levels using an objective statistical model. The State and the Secretary must establish performance levels for indicators in fiscal years 2020 and 2021, considering differences among States in economic conditions such as unemployment rates and job losses or gains in specific industries. Upon entry into the program, participant characteristics such as work history, educational skills, and other factors affecting employment and earnings are assessed. The State must agree with the Secretary on performance levels for indicators before fiscal year 2022 to promote continuous improvement. Revisions may be made based on economic factors. The Secretary will revise performance levels based on economic conditions and participant characteristics using an objective statistical model. The Secretary will develop a model in consultation with the Secretary of Labor, based on participant characteristics and economic conditions. Each State must use a template by October 1, 2018, to report outcomes of the State program funded under this part. Each report must include the number of individuals who exited the program, their reasons for leaving, and details on work-eligible individuals. Characteristics of those who exited, including length of time in the program, should also be provided. The Secretary must publish reports annually, including details on individuals exiting the program, such as reasons for leaving, work eligibility, length of program participation, educational level, earnings, and performance levels achieved. Reports must be made available electronically to the public by September 30 of each fiscal year. The Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of Labor, will prescribe regulations for measuring State performance on indicators. The amendments made by this Act will be effective on October 1, 2017."
