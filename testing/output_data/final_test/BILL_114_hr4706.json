The \"Interest for Others Act of 2016\" excludes certain interest and money market fund dividends donated to charity from gross income for taxpayers who are individuals, trusts, or estates. The exclusion is limited to interest and dividend income, with specific conditions outlined for deposits in financial institutions. The \"Interest for Others Act of 2016\" allows for the exclusion of interest and money market fund dividends donated to charity from gross income, with a limit of $50 per account for a calendar year. A \"qualified program\" must be adopted by financial institutions or money market funds for this exclusion to apply. The \"Interest for Others Act of 2016\" allows deposit or money market fund owners to donate a chosen amount to a charity through a qualified program. Financial institutions or funds must contribute the elected amount to the designated charity. A \"qualified aggregator\" is defined as an organization that facilitates these donations. A qualified aggregator is a tax-exempt organization that facilitates charitable contributions by aggregating funds and payments to designated entities. The entity can retain a portion of contributions to cover administrative costs as long as notice is provided in advance. The qualified aggregator can retain a portion of contributions for administrative costs without specifying the exact amount. The program will not lose its charitable status if the ultimate recipient is ineligible to receive charitable contributions, as long as a good faith determination was made by the aggregator and financial institution. For the purposes of this section, a financial institution or money market fund can rely on the qualified aggregator's representation that the organizations receiving distributions qualify under section 170(c) for charitable contributions. The term 'financial institution' includes banks, institutions described in section 591, and insured credit unions. The term 'charitable contribution' refers to a contribution as defined in section 170(c) of the Code.

Financial institutions can rely on a qualified aggregator's representation for charitable contributions.
