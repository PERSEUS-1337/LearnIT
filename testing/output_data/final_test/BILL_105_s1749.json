The Act defines key terms such as Recovery Implementation Programs, Secretary, Upper Division States, and Endangered Species Act. The Endangered Species Act defines key terms such as Reclamation, Service, Indian Affairs, Bureau, capital projects, and facilities for conservation and restoration efforts. The term \"interests in land and water\" includes long-term leases, easements, and agreements protecting instream flows. Base funding covers operation, maintenance of capital projects, recovery actions, monitoring, research, and program management. The term \"recovery actions other than capital projects\" includes short-term leases, reintroduction of endangered fish stocks, and control of nonnative fishes. SEC. 4. AUTHORIZATION TO FUND RECOVERY PROGRAMS. Cost of Capital Projects for Recovery Implementation Programs shall not exceed $100,000,000, with specific limits for different programs. Authorization for appropriations of $46,000,000 for Federal participation in capital projects is granted, with adjustments for inflation. The Secretary's authority to request appropriations for capital projects in the Recovery Implementation Program for Endangered Fish Species in the Upper Colorado River Basin expires in 2003 unless reauthorized by Congress. Similarly, the authority for capital projects in the San Juan River Basin Recovery Implementation Program expires in 2007 unless reauthorized. Non-Federal contributions to capital projects are limited to $17,000,000. The Secretary may utilize power revenues from the Colorado River Storage Project Act for capital project costs, with a limit of $17,000,000. This additional contribution can be provided through a loan from the Colorado Water Conservation Board Construction Fund to the Secretary of Energy. Repayment of the loan can be made from power revenues, subject to an agreement between the parties. The agreement between the Colorado Water Conservation Board and the Secretary of Energy aims to minimize power rate increases and ensure a lump-sum repayment by October 31, 2057. Contributions for modifying the Colorado River Storage Project operation and Wolford Mountain Reservoir water value should not exceed $20,000,000. The Secretary can use power revenues for annual base funding contributions to Recovery Implementation Programs. The Secretary can use power revenues for annual base funding contributions to Recovery Implementation Programs for endangered fish species in the Upper Colorado River Basin and the San Juan River. Contributions are capped at $4,000,000 and $2,000,000 per year respectively, with adjustments for inflation. Transfer of funds within these limits to the Service is exempt from transfer fees. A report on power revenue utilization must be submitted to the Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development by December 31, 2010. The Secretary of Energy and Reclamation must make a recommendation on additional funding for the Recovery Implementation Programs. Existing agreements on base funding and depletion fees will not be modified. Unexpended funds for capital projects will be retained for future use. The Secretary may enter agreements and contracts with Federal and non-Federal entities, acquire and transfer interests in land, water, and facilities, and accept or give grants to carry out the purposes of the Act. Funding for activities or capital items in the San Juan River Basin for Indian tribes is not restricted by the Act. The construction and acquisition of facilities and land and water interests under this Act will not be subject to the Reclamation Act of 1902."
