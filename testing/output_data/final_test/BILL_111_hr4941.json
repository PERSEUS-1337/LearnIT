Chapter 53 of title 31, United States Code, is amended to include a new section requiring reports on means of access to funds or the value of funds belonging to a person. The Secretary of the Treasury will define these terms for the purpose of this section. The new section in Chapter 53 of title 31, United States Code requires reports on means of accessing funds, including prepaid or stored value cards, for initiating transfers, obtaining currency, or purchasing goods/services. Debit and credit cards are excluded from this definition. Reports are required only when exporting or importing if done knowingly. Reports under this section are required when knowingly transporting funds or access to funds into or out of the United States. The timing and content of these reports are determined by the Secretary of the Treasury in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security. The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security, requires reports on the legal capacity of the person filing, origin/destination/route of funds, identity of parties involved, and amount/kind of funds. The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security, may require additional information for reporting purposes, including details about the person holding funds for another person and providing access to those funds. This section does not apply to common carriers of passengers or goods under certain circumstances. The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security, may require information from individuals who provide access to funds for others to facilitate reporting. This includes marking tangible mechanisms used for accessing funds to show reportable characteristics. Additionally, section 5316 is amended to include reports on exporting and importing monetary instruments and access devices. The amendment requires individuals to report transporting or receiving monetary instruments or funds over $10,000 between the United States and other countries, with exceptions outlined in subsection (c). The amendment mandates reporting the transportation or receipt of monetary instruments exceeding $10,000 into the US from abroad. It also allows the Secretary of the Treasury or Homeland Security to seek a search warrant for suspected monetary violations. The amendment allows the Secretary of the Treasury or Homeland Security to seek a search warrant if there is suspicion of transporting funds without filing a required report. A court may issue a warrant based on probable cause. Customs officers can also conduct searches at the border to ensure compliance with reporting requirements. Customs officers can stop and search vehicles, vessels, aircraft, containers, and people at the border without a warrant. Criminal forfeiture may be imposed for violations of specific sections, requiring the defendant to forfeit all property involved in the offense. Civil forfeiture procedures under specific sections of the Controlled Substances Act and the United States Code allow for the seizure and forfeiture of property involved in violations of certain financial reporting requirements to the United States. No person shall engage in international transactions to evade these reporting requirements. The text chunk discusses the evasion of reporting requirements related to monetary instruments and funds, including failure to file reports, filing reports with omissions or misstatements, and structuring importation or exportation of funds. It also mentions the criminal offense of smuggling cash and monetary instruments into or out of the United States to evade reporting requirements. The text chunk outlines the criminal offense of currency smuggling, where individuals knowingly conceal and transport more than $10,000 in currency or monetary instruments to evade reporting requirements. The currency smuggling offense involves concealing currency or monetary instruments on a person or in their belongings. The penalty for this offense includes imprisonment for up to 5 years and forfeiture of any property to the United States. The defendant must forfeit any property involved in the offense, including real or personal property traceable to it. The procedure for seizure and forfeiture is governed by the Controlled Substances Act. If the forfeitable property is unavailable, a personal money judgment may be entered against the defendant. Civil forfeiture applies to any property involved in the offense or conspiracy. The property involved in the offense, including any currency or tangible mechanism used to conceal funds, may be seized and forfeited to the United States. The procedures for seizure and forfeiture are governed by civil forfeiture laws in money laundering cases. Property involved in the offense, including any article, container, or conveyance used to conceal or transport currency, may be seized and forfeited to the United States."
