    "content": "The Act titled \"District of Columbia Land Use Notification Act of 1993\" requires certain federal agencies to notify the District of Columbia before carrying out activities affecting property in the district. This includes provisions for the General Services Administration to provide notice of such activities. The Act mandates that the Administrator must notify relevant officials in the District of Columbia before undertaking any activities affecting real property in the district. This includes providing a notice describing the activity and property to the Mayor, Council Chair, and Advisory Neighborhood Commission Chair. The Administrator must notify relevant officials in the District of Columbia before carrying out any activity that may affect real property in the district. The Administrator has the option to waive requirements if public safety or national security is at risk, but must certify and provide reasons to individuals and Congress, allowing them to comment on the decision. The table of contents for the Act is amended by inserting a new item after section 212. Sec. 213 requires covered agencies to provide notice to the District of Columbia before carrying out activities affecting real property in the District. Covered agencies must notify the District of Columbia before conducting activities that impact real property in the area. The agency must also allow individuals in the neighborhood to provide feedback before proceeding, unless there is an emergency situation where public safety or national security is at risk. In this subsection, covered agencies such as the Architect of the Capitol, the National Park Service, and the Smithsonian Institution must notify individuals and Congress before conducting activities that impact real property. Events at the William H. G. Fitzgerald Tennis Center at Rock Creek Park require prior approval from the Director of the National Park Service and the Mayor of the District of Columbia. The amendments made by section 2(a) of the Act will apply to activities conducted after a 60-day period from the enactment date, while sections 2(b) and (c) will apply to activities and events held after the same period."
