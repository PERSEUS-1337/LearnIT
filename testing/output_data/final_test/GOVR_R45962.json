    "content": "Mapping broadband availability is crucial for accurate data used by Congress and the FCC to target federal broadband programs to areas most in need. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 mandates the FCC to determine broadband deployment annually, relying on mapping data. Billions of dollars are directed to unserved areas based on this data, with a focus on rural regions. Mapping broadband availability in the United States is challenging due to various factors, including inaccuracies in the FCC's Fixed Broadband Deployment Map. Concerns have been raised about certain areas, especially rural ones, being underserved or unserved. The map, which relies on data from private providers, lacks independent validation and a challenge process for consumers and entities. In early 2019, the FCC discovered that the map may overstate broadband availability, potentially leading to deployment being overstated in certain areas. In the 116th Congress, efforts have been made to improve broadband mapping accuracy, including the establishment of a new Digital Opportunity Data Collection (DODC) by the FCC. This aims to address concerns about overbuilding in areas with existing broadband and underserving others. Congress may consider oversight of FCC efforts and additional legislative action to enhance broadband mapping accuracy. Broadband mapping accuracy is crucial for ensuring equal access to high-speed internet. Broadband technologies include DSL, cable modem, fiber, wireless, satellite, and BPL. The FCC's current benchmark speed is 25/3 Mbps. The digital divide persists in America, highlighting disparities in internet access. The FCC has updated its broadband definition over the years, with the latest version adopted in 2015. The digital divide in America, highlighted by disparities in internet access, persists despite efforts to deploy broadband to rural areas. Factors like terrain, population density, and market conditions contribute to the urban/rural divide. A 2018 survey by the Pew Research Center found that adults in rural areas often struggle to access high-speed internet. The Broadband Data Improvement Act of 2008 directed federal agencies to map areas lacking high-speed internet access to bridge the urban/rural digital divide. Key agencies involved include NTIA, FCC, and USDA. The program aimed to gather data on broadband availability, speed, and usage in community institutions to create the National Broadband Map. The State Broadband Initiative (SBI) program, administered by NTIA and funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, awarded $293 million to 56 grantees to promote broadband adoption and access. The program collected broadband-related data until June 30, 2014, and the National Broadband Map was decommissioned in 2018, with mapping responsibility shifting to the FCC. In response to the responsibility shift to the FCC, Congress provided $7.5 million to NTIA to develop a National Broadband Availability Map. NTIA partnered with eight states for a pilot project to improve the FCC's Fixed Broadband Deployment Map, with the first phase published in October 2019. The map is accessible only to state and federal partners due to the inclusion of nonpublic data. The FCC established the Form 477 Data Program in 2000 to collect data on broadband services. In 2013, the program was expanded to include fixed broadband data by census block and mobile broadband data by network coverage area. Providers are required to report maximum advertised speeds for each census block. The FCC collects data on fixed and mobile broadband availability through Form 477, requiring providers to report maximum advertised speeds in each census block for fixed broadband and minimum advertised speeds in each coverage area for mobile broadband. Providers must submit data in a uniform format, and speed tiers for broadband subscription data are eliminated. The FCC requires providers to submit data on fixed broadband availability, including technology used, service offerings, and maximum speeds. However, there are limitations to this methodology, as providers only need to list census blocks where they could potentially offer service without significant resources. The FCC requires providers to submit data on fixed broadband availability in census blocks, but the data may not accurately reflect actual service availability due to various factors. The FCC introduced the Digital Opportunity Data Collection (DODC) in August 2019 to improve broadband mapping accuracy by collecting coverage polygons from providers and revising Form 477 filing rules. The FCC introduced the Digital Opportunity Data Collection (DODC) in August 2019 to improve broadband mapping accuracy by collecting coverage polygons from providers, incorporating public input, and revising Form 477 filing rules. The DODC would require fixed providers to submit broadband coverage polygons depicting areas where they have broadband-capable networks, reflect maximum download and upload speeds, technology used, and differentiate between customer types. Public feedback on fixed broadband coverage would be incorporated, and Universal Service Administrative Company (USAC) verification of broadband data would be required. The FCC is seeking stakeholder comment on using the DODC exclusively for broadband mapping and discontinuing Form 477. Initially, the new data collection obligations will be limited to fixed broadband providers. The FCC is seeking feedback on incorporating mobile broadband data into the Digital Opportunity Data Collection (DODC). Proposed changes include transitioning mobile broadband data collection to a USAC-administered portal, maintaining current Form 477 data collection for mobile providers, and reducing the burden on service providers. This suggests the FCC may add mobile broadband data to the Fixed Broadband mapping efforts. The FCC is considering adding mobile broadband data to the Fixed Broadband Deployment Map, while the USDA maps broadband availability for resource visualization. The USDA's Broadband Program Mapping Tool is used by various entities for mapping existing or proposed service areas. The USDA's Broadband Program Mapping Tool allows entities to post Public Notices for funded service areas and upload authenticated maps of existing broadband services. The tool is part of the ReConnect Program, which helps determine service area eligibility for federal funding. Accurate broadband data and mapping assist policymakers in directing federal funding, such as the upcoming Rural Digital Opportunity Fund by the FCC. Accurate maps are crucial for federal funding decisions targeting areas in need of broadband services. Without reliable data, assistance may go to areas with adequate services, leading to disparities. FCC Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel emphasized the importance of accurate mapping for effective policy solutions. The FCC distributes billions annually to accelerate broadband build-out. The FCC distributes billions annually to accelerate broadband build-out. Inaccurate data affected eligibility for federal assistance in the Mobility Fund II program, leading to a $4.53 billion investigation into major carriers violating mapping rules. Congressional attention was drawn to this issue. The FCC's inaccurate broadband mapping has drawn congressional attention, with concerns raised by a bipartisan group of Senators. The Rural Digital Opportunity Fund aims to bridge the urban/rural digital divide, but accurate mapping is crucial for effective fund distribution. FCC Chairman Ajit Pai emphasized the importance of new maps for immediate use. The FCC is moving forward with new maps to direct over $4 billion in funding to deploy high-speed broadband networks in underserved areas. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 requires the FCC to ensure advanced telecommunications capability is deployed to all Americans in a timely manner. The FCC is taking action to accelerate broadband deployment by removing barriers to infrastructure investment and promoting competition in the telecommunications market. The 2019 Broadband Deployment Report evaluates the availability of fixed and mobile broadband services, with a Section 706 finding that advanced telecommunications capability is being deployed to all Americans in a reasonable and timely manner. Difficulty in mapping broadband availability is attributed to factors like lack of data granularity and overstated availability. The FCC requires broadband service providers to submit information at the census block level, but challenges like lack of data granularity and difficulty in real-time tracking hinder accurate mapping. Census blocks, defined by the Census Bureau, vary in size and population, with even one served house or business in a block considered as served. This approach may be misleading, especially in rural areas with large census blocks. In rural areas, large census blocks can lead to misleading data for federal assistance eligibility. Utah officials highlight issues with using census blocks for data collection and funding decisions, especially in remote areas with challenging terrain. For example, the largest populated census block in Utah is 947 square miles, making it difficult to accurately assess broadband coverage. The current Form 477 submission process deems partially covered census blocks ineligible for federal broadband programs, even if only a small percentage is covered. The FCC acknowledges that broadband deployment data may be inaccurate due to misreporting by providers. For example, Barrier Communications Corporation falsely claimed coverage in multiple states, leading to a revised Broadband Deployment Report. Microsoft disputes FCC figures, stating that the percentage of Americans without broadband access is higher. Microsoft disputes FCC figures on broadband access, claiming 162.8 million people lack internet at 25 Mbps speeds. NCTA criticizes Microsoft's analysis, stating it conflates availability and usage. FCC data on broadband access is self-reported by providers and not independently verified. No challenge process exists for potentially inaccurate data. Stakeholders testified at an April 2019 hearing. The FCC's data on broadband access is criticized for potential inaccuracies. Stakeholders argue for a challenge process due to issues with the mobility fund auction. The Fixed Broadband Deployment Map is updated every six months but lags behind current data. The new DODC will require providers to submit updates within six months of new broadband deployments. The FCC's data on broadband access is criticized for inaccuracies. The new DODC will require providers to update their broadband deployments within six months, potentially leading to more up-to-date maps. Congress may address challenges such as data granularity, differences in advertised and actual speeds, and interagency coordination. Legislation in the 116th Congress aims to tackle some of these issues, but the level of granularity needed for policymaking remains uncertain. Increasing data granularity incurs costs that may not be evenly shared among stakeholders. The FCC's new DODC will require providers to update broadband deployments for more accurate maps. Stakeholders are concerned about the costs of increasing data granularity, especially for smaller providers. USTelecom has proposed the Broadband Serviceable Location Fabric methodology to provide more detailed information. USTelecom has proposed the Broadband Serviceable Location Fabric methodology to develop a comprehensive database of broadband serviceable locations in Virginia and Missouri. The methodology includes using address, building, and parcel data, a vendor to clean up address formats, a crowdsourcing platform for consumer input, and customer address lists for validation. Results from the pilot initiative in the two states showed over 450,000 homes with broadband service availability. USTelecom's proposal aims to create a nationwide Broadband Serviceable Location Fabric (BSLF) to accurately identify structures capable of receiving broadband service. The estimated cost for implementing the BSLF is between $8.5 million and $11 million initially, with annual maintenance costs of $3 million to $4 million. This initiative could provide better data but comes with higher data collection expenses. The FCC is urged to consider the sustainability of funding for broadband map maintenance and the lack of validation processes for data accuracy. Crowdsourcing is suggested as a method to improve the Fixed Broadband Deployment Map's accuracy by allowing stakeholders to challenge potential inaccuracies. NCTA raised concerns about delegating authority to USAC for reviewing and disputing coverage under the new DODC. They suggest a more traditional approach of delegating authority to relevant Commission bureaus and offices. Congress may need to decide whether to confirm the delegation to USAC or direct the FCC to handle this activity in-house. The FCC may require broadband providers to submit actual upload and download speeds, as opposed to just advertised speeds. Despite Iowa being identified as having complete high-speed internet access, a study shows that users only experience the advertised speeds 22% of the time. This change in reporting requirements aims to provide more accurate information to consumers. The FCC's August 2019 Report and Order now mandates broadband providers to disclose actual upload and download speeds available in each area, aiming to provide more accurate information to consumers. However, relying solely on maximum speeds may not reflect the actual user experience due to network congestion or weather. Congress could consider a pilot project to assess the feasibility of collecting actual speed data, or leave the decision to the FCC. Alternatively, the FCC could implement a short-term solution to address mapping issues quickly. NCTA proposes using shapefiles for fixed broadband data collection as a quick solution to improve the current broadband map, aiming for more accurate results in a shorter timeframe. USTelecom disagrees with NCTA's proposal to solely rely on shapefiles for broadband data collection, arguing that shapefiles alone do not provide the detailed data needed to bridge the digital divide. The FCC's Second Notice of Proposed Rulemaking seeks input on incorporating location-specific data to accurately identify areas lacking broadband access. Congress must consider whether withholding federal broadband funding is justified until more precise data is available. The FCC collects broadband data every six months through Form 477 but the data lags behind by about a year and a half. Congress may consider updating the data more frequently to reflect network changes. Multiple agencies are involved in broadband data collection. The involvement of multiple agencies like NTIA, FCC, and USDA in broadband mapping and subsidies may pose challenges for interagency coordination. The 116th Congress is considering legislation to address this issue. Interagency coordination was a focus of the February 2019 USDA American Broadband Milestones Initiatives Report, which highlighted NTIA's efforts to streamline broadband permitting and deployment. The 2019 Consolidated Appropriation also emphasizes the importance of maximizing investments through effective coordination. The conference agreement directs the Department of Agriculture to coordinate with the FCC and NTIA to target broadband loans and grants to unserved areas. Some state broadband offices have effective mapping efforts that could serve as models for federal initiatives. For example, Kansas, North Carolina, and Wyoming have implemented detailed broadband maps to identify areas in need of service. Wyoming's interactive map displays internet-speed test results and broadband availability across the state, with color-coded dots showing served and unserved areas. Congressional interest in broadband mapping accuracy has increased due to potential overstatement of availability, leading to the FCC's development of the DODC for more accurate data. The FCC's comment-and-reply process aims to improve broadband mapping data accuracy. Congress may consider monitoring the effort's effectiveness, delaying federal funding distribution until accurate maps are available, or taking additional legislative action. H.R. 1644 includes provisions for reports on broadband competition, infrastructure in rural areas, challenges in mapping, and engaging with tribal communities. The House passed a bill to address broadband needs in tribal communities and delay the release of the 706 Report until data inaccuracies are corrected. Two new bills, H.R. 2643 and H.R. 2741, aim to improve broadband data accuracy and provide funding for infrastructure deployment in unserved areas. The bill H.R. 3055 includes provisions related to broadband mapping, with one provision preventing NTIA from using Form 477 data for updates and providing $1 million in mapping funding. Another bill, H.R. 3162, known as the Broadband Data Improvement Act of 2019, would require the FCC to establish reporting requirements. The Broadband Data Improvement Act of 2019, H.R. 4024, requires accurate reporting of broadband availability and speeds. It also establishes a challenge process for inaccurate information on the National Broadband Map. Referred to the Committee on Energy and Commerce. H.R. 4128, the Map Improvement Act of 2019, directs the FCC to establish a standardized methodology for collecting accurate broadband data. H.R. 4227, the Mapping Accuracy Promotes Services Act, aims to prevent the submission of inaccurate broadband coverage information to the FCC. H.R. 4229, the Broadband Deployment Accuracy and Technological Availability Act, focuses on improving broadband deployment accuracy. The Broadband Deployment Accuracy and Technological Availability Act, introduced on September 6, 2019, would require the FCC to issue rules for collecting data on broadband service availability. S. 842 (Klobuchar) and S. 1485 (Manchin) also aim to improve broadband mapping and coverage data verification processes. The Map Improvement Act of 2019 and the Broadband Data Improvement Act of 2019 aim to establish standardized methodologies for collecting accurate broadband coverage data. The former would create an Office of Broadband Data Collection and Mapping at the FCC, while the latter would require providers to submit more accurate data through a validation process involving public feedback and field validation. The Broadband Deployment Accuracy and Technological Availability Act aims to improve broadband coverage data collection by requiring the FCC to issue rules for more detailed data collection. This includes potentially collecting verified information from state, local, and tribal entities responsible for mapping broadband coverage. The Broadband Transparency and Accountability Act of 2019 (S. 2275) would require reporting of broadband service speed data and verification of data used in the Broadband Map. The Rural Broadband Permitting Efficiency Act (H.R. 292) aims to coordinate federal permitting for broadband expansion in rural and tribal areas. The ACCESS Broadband Act (H.R. 1328) seeks to establish broadband access initiatives. H.R. 1328, introduced on February 25, 2019, as the ACCESS Broadband Act, aims to establish the Office of Internet Connectivity and Growth within NTIA to improve broadband connectivity and digital inclusion. Passed by the House on May 8, 2019. H.R. 2601, introduced on May 8, 2019, as the Office of Rural Telecommunications Act, directs the FCC to establish the Office of Rural Telecommunications to coordinate with federal broadband programs. H.R. 3278, introduced on June 13, 2019, as the Connect America Act of 2019, aims to expand access to broadband and coordinate with other federal programs. H.R. 3676 (Khanna) and H.R. 4283 (Pence) aim to assess the economic impact of broadband deployment and require interagency coordination for broadband funding, respectively. These bills are referred to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce. S. 454 (Cramer) establishes an Office of Rural Broadband within the FCC to coordinate with RUS/USDA, NTIA, and other broadband-related activities. S. 1046 (Cortez Masto) creates the Office of Internet Connectivity and Growth within NTIA to improve broadband connectivity and track federal broadband dollars. S. 1289 (Klobuchar) focuses on measuring broadband deployment. S. 1289 (Klobuchar) directs the Secretary of Commerce to assess the economic impact of broadband deployment and adoption, consulting with federal agencies. S. 1294 (Wicker) requires interagency agreements for broadband funding among FCC, USDA, and NTIA."
