    "content": "The Act titled \"Program for Offshore Wind Energy Research and Development Act of 2010\" or \"POWERED Act of 2010\" aims to promote offshore wind power projects in the United States. Congress recognizes the need for technological advancements to achieve 20 percent of electricity generation from wind by 2030. The Act defines offshore wind power as generating electricity from wind turbines in the Great Lakes, inland navigable waters, and coastal waters of the US. It establishes the Offshore Wind Power Research and Development Program and outlines a roadmap for developing a self-supporting offshore wind power industry in the US over 2, 7, and 10-year periods. The term \"Secretary\" in this Act refers to the Secretary of Energy. SEC. 4. ROADMAP TO AN OFFSHORE WIND POWER FUTURE. The Secretary is required to develop a comprehensive roadmap for offshore wind power implementation within 120 days of the Act's enactment. The roadmap includes compiling previous analyses, assessing technological advances for cost competitiveness, and recommending federal support for research and demonstration projects. The Secretary is tasked with developing a roadmap for offshore wind power implementation, including assessing policy supports and making recommendations for Federal and State policies to promote offshore wind power in the United States. The assessment of offshore wind power permitting system and recommendations for administrative and regulatory changes to promote offshore wind power development in the United States, along with an evaluation of resources needed for infrastructure development. An assessment of costs and technology for alternative ship designs, dock requirements, and personnel skill-sets needed for offshore wind power development in the United States. An assessment of workforce needs, training requirements, impact of winter ice flows on offshore wind power turbine towers, technology to mitigate negative impacts, domestic manufacturing entities for offshore wind power turbines, and necessary capital conversion for industry support. An assessment of energy storage requirements, supply chain availability, freshwater and deepwater offshore wind potential, floating turbine designs, manufacturing logistics, deployment logistics, and suitable locations for demonstration projects in the offshore wind power industry. In consultation with relevant departments, the Secretary will implement specific subsections of the Act. A report outlining the roadmap and recommendations will be submitted to various Senate and House committees within 180 days of the Act's enactment. The Secretary will implement specific subsections of the Act and submit a report to Senate and House committees within 180 days, including the Committee on Natural Resources and the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure of the House of Representatives. The Offshore Wind Power Research and Development Program is established under Section 5 of the Act. The Secretary will establish the Offshore Wind Power Research and Development Program within 120 days of the Act's enactment. The Program will assist in offshore wind power analysis and implementation efforts, focusing on establishing national offshore wind centers through competitive grants to academic institutions or industry-academic consortia. The Offshore Wind Power Research and Development Program will establish national offshore wind centers focusing on different technologies. Grants will be awarded to conduct offshore wind power analysis and research projects, leveraging Department of Energy investments. The Secretary will request proposals for projects under this section for developing alternative State policies for offshore wind power use, estimating wind resources, including wind directions, strengths, bathymetry, waves, currents, and seasonal temperature distributions. The development of offshore wind power projects includes analyzing air and water temperature distributions, ice formation potential, geology studies, earthquake risks, grid connection points, and exclusion of competing uses. Recommendations are made for interconnecting offshore sites and integrating wind resources into the electric grid. The development of offshore wind power projects includes systems analysis for large-scale integration, automatic control management, voltage and frequency regulation, coordination with existing generators, energy storage, and load demand prediction. Additionally, potential wildlife and ecological effects are studied, along with infrastructure needs and academic programs at higher education institutions. Development of advanced offshore wind turbine generator designs, optimization of turbine configurations for efficiency, and advancement of materials and manufacturing techniques to reduce costs and stimulate blade manufacturing capacity in the United States. Development of advanced offshore wind turbine components such as foundations, anchors, moorings, and control systems to reduce costs, improve reliability, and extend water depth installations for offshore wind energy projects. Research on wind turbine design includes large blades, efficient airfoils, de-icing systems, structural analysis, materials, and control systems for load attenuation. Development of new deployment vessels to reduce installation and maintenance costs of offshore wind turbines. Advanced power electronics and electrical systems for connecting offshore wind farms to the mainland grid. Full-scale testing and establishment of experimental offshore wind farms and projects. The Secretary will review and award proposals for offshore wind projects to demonstrate advanced components and validate technology. Consultation with other government departments is required, and proposals must include a written plan from participating entities. The proposal should include plans for using information in offshore wind power decisions, training professionals in analysis, and evidence of capability through research and experience in wind power. The proposal for offshore wind power research should have scientific merit in relevant fields, supplement existing efforts by federal agencies, align with development targets, and have a duration of 1 to 4 years. The proposal for offshore wind power research should have a term of 1 to 4 years. Recipients of grants must submit reports on their research findings to specified authorities. $75,000,000 is authorized for fiscal years 2011 through 2015. The Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 is amended to allow triple credits for offshore wind power generation. Authorization of appropriations is provided for carrying out the Act."
