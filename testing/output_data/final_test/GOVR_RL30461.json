    "content": "U.S. law provides administrative measures to address adverse effects of foreign trade policies on domestic industries. Three forms of relief include safeguards, antidumping, and countervailing duty remedies. Safeguard relief allows for temporary duties or quotas on fairly traded imports causing serious injury to domestic industries. Antidumping relief aims to counteract imports sold below fair value with extra duties. The relief measures for adverse effects of foreign trade policies on domestic industries include antidumping and countervailing duty remedies. These measures aim to eliminate price advantages gained through unfair trade practices and foreign government subsidies. The programs are designed to level the playing field for affected industries facing unfair competition. Adverse effects such as loss of profits, worker layoffs, and plant closures are concentrated in import-sensitive industries. Safeguard relief aims to help the injured industry adjust and minimize trade destabilization. Trade specialists argue that trade remedies address concerns of affected sectors and help achieve a political consensus on trade liberalization. Economists, however, believe that while trade remedies may assist injured industries, they come at a cost to the overall economy. Trade remedies, whether imposed to mitigate unfair trade or fair trade, can lead to higher costs for consumers and reduce real income. This can negatively impact U.S. domestic industries, as seen in a 1991 case where AD duties forced computer manufacturers to move production abroad. U.S. trade remedy statutes and obligations under the World Trade Organization Agreement require investigations. Statutes and obligations under the World Trade Organization Agreement require an investigation of relevant circumstances for trade remedy petitions. The petitioning industry must provide information and follow specific procedures. The Department of Commerce and the U.S. International Trade Commission conduct a multi-stage investigation for AD and most CVD cases. The process involves filing petitions with the DOC and ITC, with four affirmative decisions needed for completion. The Department of Commerce and the U.S. International Trade Commission conduct a multi-stage investigation for anti-dumping and countervailing duty cases. An affirmative decision allows the investigation to continue, leading to preliminary and final determinations. If both final determinations are affirmative, extra duties are imposed. The Department of Commerce (DOC) and the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) conduct investigations for anti-dumping and countervailing duty cases. If both final determinations are affirmative, extra duties are imposed on imports. The DOC considers evidence of subsidies in CVD cases and determines the \"normal value\" in AD cases to assess dumping margins. The determinations are subject to judicial review. The ITC must determine if the domestic industry is being materially injured by imports and if they are a cause of the injury. Safeguard relief process starts with a petition alleging imports causing serious injury. The ITC can also initiate investigations on its own or by request. U.S. law encourages the domestic industry to submit a plan. The ITC conducts investigations to determine if the domestic industry is being harmed by imports. If affirmative, it recommends remedial measures such as increased tariffs, tariff-rate quotas, or trade adjustment assistance. The President then decides on the action to take, considering factors like the industry's adjustment plan, effectiveness of the action, national economic interest, and national security. The ITC conducts investigations to determine harm to the domestic industry by imports. If affirmative, it recommends remedial measures like increased tariffs. The President decides on the action, considering factors like adjustment plans, national economic interest, and national security. U.S. law requires the ITC to make determinations within specified deadlines. Congress may direct the President to implement ITC recommendations if he chooses a different action. Safeguard determinations have higher injury thresholds than AD and CVD cases, requiring imports to be a \"substantial\" cause of serious injury to the domestic industry. The AD and CVD statutes require a determination of \"material injury\" caused by dumped or subsidized imports, with a lower causation threshold than safeguard relief. Safeguard relief decisions are made at a higher policy level by the President, who has discretion in implementing relief measures. In contrast, CVD and AD cases follow determinations made by the DOC without Presidential involvement, reflecting the stricter standards for safeguard relief due to fairly traded imports from all sources. The stricter standards and procedures for safeguard relief have led to fewer cases resulting in relief compared to AD and CVD determinations. Between 1984 and 2002, there were 397 AD cases and 120 CVD cases resulting in relief, while only seven safeguard cases resulted in relief during the same period. The higher standards for section 201 have also sparked criticisms that U.S. safeguard relief does not adequately meet the needs of import-sensitive industries and calls for reform. The Congress has amended U.S. trade remedy statutes over the years in response to industry concerns about the effectiveness of the remedy procedures. The Congress has amended trade remedy laws to better meet industry needs, including criteria for determining injury and shortened timeframes for agency determinations. Recent amendments align U.S. laws with WTO agreements on antidumping, subsidies, and safeguards. U.S. trade remedies are subject to international rules under the WTO and NAFTA. The Uruguay Round Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures outlines definitions, procedures, and criteria for member CVD programs. It requires a determination of material injury before countervailing a subsidy. The agreement also addresses adjudication of CVD disputes between WTO members and establishes procedures for implementing national antidumping programs. Article XIX of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (1994) sets out conditions for WTO members to apply safeguards. The Uruguay Round negotiations expanded Article XIX, including sunset requirements, time limits, and criteria for \"serious injury.\" Before the Uruguay Round, compensation for safeguard actions could be sought, but now it is delayed for three years. The NAFTA also has trade remedy obligations with Canada and Mexico, with measures generally lasting no more than three years under Chapter Eight and allowing for CVD and AD determinations under Chapter 19. The U.S. trade remedy laws have been criticized by trading partners like Japan, Korea, Chile, and Brazil for not fully aligning with WTO rules. Despite resistance from the United States and opposition from Congress, trade remedy laws were included on the agenda of the WTO Ministerial Meeting in Doha in November 2001. Several bills have been introduced in Congress regarding safeguard laws and antidumping/countervailing duty laws, but no further action has been taken. H.R. 2365, the Trade Reform Act of 2003, aims to make changes in this area. H.R. 2365, the Trade Reform Act of 2003, proposes changes to U.S. trade remedy laws, including the section 201 safeguard law. It aims to lower the causal threshold required to establish a link between import surges and injury to U.S. domestic industry. Supporters argue this change aligns with WTO rules, but legal interpretation may vary. The new threshold would only require finding that imports have contributed to injury. The Trade Reform Act of 2003, H.R. 2365, proposes changes to U.S. trade remedy laws, specifically the section 201 safeguard law. It aims to lower the causal threshold needed to link import surges to injury in the domestic industry. The new threshold would only require finding that imports have contributed to injury, not necessarily being the main cause. Additionally, the bill would introduce new factors for consideration, such as changes in sales, production, productivity, capacity utilization, profits, losses, and employment levels. The Trade Reform Act of 2003, H.R. 2365, proposes changes to U.S. trade remedy laws, specifically the section 201 safeguard law. It aims to lower the causal threshold needed to link import surges to injury in the domestic industry. The bill would require the ITC to consider the rate and timing of import increases, and make a determination on critical circumstances within 45 days. Several bills in the 108th Congress aim to change U.S. antidumping or countervailing duty laws. S. 136 (Lincoln)/ H.R. 2092 (Berry) and S. 219 (Craig) propose changes to U.S. antidumping laws. S. 136/H.R. 2092 would expedite antidumping investigations for products similar to those already under an AD order, with a 15% increase threshold. S. 219 would require the inclusion of countervailing duties in the calculation of fair market value for imports. The bills aim to address issues with Canada's treatment of countervailing duties on U.S. imports of softwood lumber. H.R. 491 (Pickering) and Section 109 of H.R. 2365 (English) propose including countervailing duties in the calculation of fair market value for imports, aiming to prevent unfair lowering of antidumping duties. S. 1155 (Grassley)/ H.R. 1073 (Sensenbrenner) and S. 1080 (Hatch) seek to repeal the Antidumping Act of 1916, which allows for treble damages and criminal penalties for dumping. The WTO ruled against the U.S. in a dispute with the EU and Japan over the Act violating GATT 1994 and the Antidumping Agreement. The WTO ruled against the U.S. in a dispute with the EU and Japan over the Antidumping Act of 1916 violating international agreements. Bills were introduced to repeal the law and impose countervailing duties on DRAM semiconductors from South Korea. President Clinton signed the Agriculture, Rural Development, Food bill on October 28, 2000. President Clinton signed the Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act 2001 (P.L. 106-387) on October 28, 2000, which included the \"Continued Dumping and Subsidy Offset Act (CDSOA) of 2000,\" also known as the Byrd Amendment. This provision amended U.S. antidumping and countervailing duty laws to redistribute duties to domestic industries affected by imports subject to AD and CVD orders. The Customs Bureau deposits duties into a special account and distributes funds to eligible firms, farmers, or producers involved in the original AD or CVD cases to offset expenses incurred due to dumped or subsidized imports. The \"Byrd Amendment\" redistributed duties to domestic industries affected by imported goods, providing offsets to cover expenses incurred. It was controversial for being inserted into legislation without committee consideration and raised concerns about WTO compliance. Eleven WTO members filed a complaint, leading to a determination that the amendment violated U.S. obligations under WTO agreements. The WTO ruled that the CSDOA violated U.S. obligations, recommending its repeal. Despite support from Congress, President Bush proposed its repeal in the FY2004 budget. A bill was introduced to repeal the CSDOA and redirect revenues to a trade adjustment program. Trade remedy laws were a contentious issue during trade agreement negotiations in the 107th Congress. During the 107th Congress's debate on extending trade promotion authority (TPA) to the President, the Senate passed a bill containing the Dayton-Craig amendment, which aimed to exclude trade remedy law changes from fast-track procedures. Concerns were raised about potential weakening of U.S. laws due to trade remedies being included in the Doha Development Agenda. The House version of the bill did not include this provision, and it was ultimately not included in the enacted law (P.L. 107-210), although a negotiating objective to preserve U.S. trade remedy laws was included. The \"Byrd Amendment\" has sparked controversy and uncertainty regarding its impact on U.S. trade policy. Industries sensitive to foreign competition generally support trade remedy legislation, while those reliant on imports oppose it due to potential price increases. Changes in trade remedy laws could strain U.S. relations with major trade partners, leading to challenges under the WTO. The European Union and Japan have already challenged U.S. antidumping laws in the WTO. The WTO upheld disputes regarding the U.S. Antidumping Act of 1916, which allows U.S. firms to sue foreign companies over imports dumping. The European Union and Japan advocate for a review of WTO members' antidumping practices, opposed by the United States. Amending U.S. trade remedy statutes could help cushion the impact of import competition on American industries. Some suggest reforming federally funded trade adjustment assistance programs for workers and firms. The Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) programs provide funds for training and adjustment measures to workers and firms impacted by imports. While some economists prefer this option over trade restrictions, labor advocacy groups criticize the current design as ineffective. Congress could also consider halting or restricting imports to address immediate adverse effects, but this may violate WTO rules and reduce competitive pressures on U.S. industries. Halting or restricting imports to address immediate adverse effects may violate WTO rules and reduce competitive pressures on U.S. industries, leading to inefficiency and higher costs."
