    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Delivering Antimicrobial Transparency in Animals Act of 2013\". The Congress recognizes the critical importance of antimicrobials to public health and the economy. The use of antimicrobials in human medicine and agriculture contributes to antimicrobial resistance. Data from the FDA shows that a significant amount of antimicrobials are used in food animals. Studies have shown that even low doses of antimicrobials in animal feed can increase the prevalence of bacteria and antimicrobial resistance genes in pigs. The Animal Drug User Fee Amendments Act of 2008 requires drug producers to provide annual information to the FDA on sales and drug use in food animals. However, a 2011 study found that the data lacked details needed to analyze trends in antimicrobial resistance, specifically in food-producing animal species. The purpose of this Act is to provide better information on the use of antimicrobial drugs in animals used for food to understand trends in microbial resistance, the relationship between drug use and resistance, and to identify interventions. Enhanced reporting requirements are also included. The Act aims to improve reporting on antimicrobial drug use in food-producing animals, requiring sponsors of new animal drugs with antimicrobial ingredients to submit annual reports on ingredient amounts sold or distributed. Reports must detail quantities by container size, strength, dosage form, distribution domestically and exported. The Act requires sponsors of new animal drugs with antimicrobial ingredients to submit annual reports detailing quantities sold or distributed by dosage form for each food-producing animal. Additionally, animal feed containing these drugs must be reported by live poultry dealers, swine contractors, or feed lot operators. The Act mandates annual reporting of quantities of new animal drugs with antimicrobial ingredients sold or distributed for each food-producing animal. Additionally, details of animal feed containing these drugs must be reported, including the amount of each antimicrobial active ingredient per kilogram, quantity sold, and indications for use under a veterinary feed directive. The Act requires annual reporting of new animal drugs with antimicrobial ingredients sold for food-producing animals, including details of feed containing these drugs such as dosage, intended length of use, and production class. Live poultry dealers, swine contractors, or feed lot operators are exempt if the total value of animals they control per year does not exceed a certain amount. The Secretary may specify alternative reporting requirements, including pilot programs, to improve accuracy, lessen burden, facilitate public summaries, and enhance understanding of the relationship between sales, distribution, and end-use practices for feed containing new animal drugs. The report on feed containing new animal drugs and antimicrobial resistance trends must be submitted electronically by March 31 each year, covering the previous calendar year with monthly data in a format specified by the Secretary to enable easy integration and association of reported data. The Secretary can integrate data on drug sales and antimicrobial resistance from Federal databases and share it with the Antimicrobial Resistance Task Force. Summaries of the reported information must be made publicly available by November 30 each year, categorized by antimicrobial drug class. The Secretary must report data on antimicrobial drug sales, including quantity per dosage form, percentage with labeled indications for various purposes, and quantity per marketing category. The veterinary feed directive requires reporting of drug sales per state and per food-producing animal, including production class. For antimicrobial drug classes with fewer than 3 sponsors, alternative reporting measures are implemented. The Secretary shall report data on approved new animal drugs by category of importance to human medicine and specify the quantity and percentage of drugs sold for different purposes within each category. The Secretary shall report data on approved new animal drugs by category of importance to human medicine, including the quantity of drugs sold per marketing categories and State of sale or distribution. The reporting shall be done in a manner that protects national security and confidential business information. The provision applies to reports under paragraphs (3) and (4) of section 512(l) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act for calendar year 2014 onwards. Reports for calendar year 2013 are subject to previous provisions of the Act. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will enhance collaboration with the Secretary of Agriculture to collect data on antimicrobial drug use in food-producing animals. This includes providing information for the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service and the Economic Research Service. SEC. 6. ACTION BY GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY OFFICE. The Secretary of Health and Human Services is required to publish final guidance on new animal drugs within 180 days of the Act's enactment. The Comptroller General of the United States will conduct a study three years after the guidance is published to evaluate the FDA's voluntary approach to reducing antimicrobial drug use in food-producing animals and the effectiveness of data collection. The Comptroller General of the United States will submit a report to the Senate and House committees on the effectiveness of FDA's data collection activities on antimicrobial resistance within a year of commencing the study."
