    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Private Property Rights Implementation Act of 2000\" and pertains to jurisdiction in civil rights cases. Section 1343 of title 28, United States Code, is amended to specify that district courts must not abstain from jurisdiction in cases involving real property unless a parallel state court proceeding is pending. Additionally, district courts may certify unsettled questions of state law to the highest state appellate court for resolution. The appellate court resolves certified questions, then the district court proceeds with the merits. The district court can only certify a state law question if it significantly affects the injured party's federal claim and is unclear. Claims under section 1983 are ripe for adjudication after a final decision causing injury under state law. The final decision exists if a person acting under state law makes a definitive decision regarding permissible property uses. This includes a disapproved application without explanation and unsuccessful appeals or waivers. The curr_chunk provides a mechanism for appeal or waiver by an administrative agency. It states that a meaningful application for property use must be submitted, and if disapproved, the reasons must be provided in writing. If a reapplication is submitted and disapproved, a final decision is reached. The final decision exists if one appeal and one waiver have been applied for and disapproved, as per the applicable statute or ordinance. If review by elected officials is available, but denied, or if the review is disapproved after application, the party seeking redress must follow these steps. No further appeal or waiver is required if none is available. The failure to act within a reasonable time on any application, reapplication, appeal, waiver, or review of the case shall constitute a disapproval. A case is ripe for adjudication even if judicial remedies provided by any State or territory of the United States are not exhausted. Nothing in subsection (c), (d), or (e) alters the substantive law of takings of property. SEC. 3. UNITED STATES AS DEFENDANT. Section 1346 of title 28, United States Code, is amended to allow claims founded on property rights secured by the Constitution to be adjudicated upon a final decision by the United States causing injury to the party seeking redress. A final decision is defined as a definitive decision by the United States on permissible property uses and a disapproved application for property use by the party seeking redress. The party seeking redress can apply for an appeal or waiver if their property rights secured by the Constitution have been infringed upon by a final decision of the United States. If the appeal or waiver is disapproved, the party is not required to reapply if no relief is available or if it would be futile. The United States' failure to act on any application, appeal, or waiver within a reasonable time is considered a disapproval. This does not change the substantive law of property takings. SEC. 4. JURISDICTION OF COURT OF FEDERAL CLAIMS. Section 1491(a) of title 28, United States Code, is amended to allow claims based on property rights or privileges secured by the Constitution to be adjudicated upon a final decision by the United States causing actual injury to the party seeking redress. This final decision includes a definitive decision by the United States on permissible property uses and a disapproved application for property use. The party seeking redress can apply for an appeal or waiver if their property rights are violated by a final decision of the United States. If the appeal or waiver is disapproved, the party is not required to reapply if it would be futile. The United States' failure to act within a reasonable time constitutes a disapproval. This does not change the burden of proof in property takings cases. SEC. 5. DUTY OF NOTICE TO OWNERS: Federal agencies must notify property owners of any actions limiting property use under the amendments made by this Act within 30 days, explaining their rights and compensation procedures. \n\nSEC. 6. EFFECTIVE DATE: The amendments apply to actions starting after the enactment date of this Act."
