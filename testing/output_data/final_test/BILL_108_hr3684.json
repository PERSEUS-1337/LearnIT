    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer Protection Act of 2003\". Approximately 2 percent of adults and 5 percent of infants in the US have food allergies, leading to 30,000 emergency room visits and 150 deaths annually. Eight major foods account for 90 percent of food allergies, with no cure currently available. Allergic consumers must avoid the specific food they are allergic to. In 1999, the FDA found that 25% of sampled foods in Minnesota and Wisconsin failed to list peanuts or eggs as ingredients. Nationally, recalls due to unlabeled allergens increased to 121 in 2000 from about 35 a decade earlier. A study showed that parents of children with food allergies struggled to identify allergens on food labels. Ingredients in foods must be listed by their common or usual name, which may be unfamiliar to consumers. Celiac disease is an immune-mediated condition causing damage to various organs, with the recommended treatment being avoidance of gluten-containing foods. A study estimated the prevalence of celiac disease in the US to be 0.5 to 1 percent of the population. Food labeling requirements include information on allergenic substances. Food labeling requirements now mandate that non-raw agricultural commodities containing major food allergens must clearly indicate the allergen source in the list of ingredients. The name of the food source is not required in the ingredient list if the common or usual name of the ingredient already includes the food source from which the major food allergen is derived. The name of the specific type of nut, species of fish, or Crustacean shellfish must be included in labeling to indicate major food allergens. The Secretary can allow alternative labeling if it protects public health. Flavorings, colorings, or additives containing major food allergens must also be labeled. The Secretary has the authority to adjust or eliminate labeling requirements. The Secretary can modify or eliminate labeling requirements to protect public health. Any person can petition to exempt a food ingredient from allergen labeling requirements, with the burden of providing scientific evidence on the petitioner. The Secretary must approve or deny the petition within 180 days. The Secretary can modify or eliminate labeling requirements to protect public health. A person can petition to exempt a food ingredient from allergen labeling requirements by providing scientific evidence. The determination on the petition is final agency action. The Secretary must post all petitions and responses to a public site within 14 days. A notification with scientific evidence can exempt a food ingredient from allergen labeling requirements. The Secretary can exempt a food ingredient from allergen labeling requirements if it is determined that the ingredient does not contain allergenic protein or cause an allergic response posing a risk to human health. The food ingredient can be introduced into interstate commerce 90 days after notification unless the Secretary finds the notification inadequate or lacking scientific evidence. The Secretary must post all notifications with scientific evidence on a public site promptly. The Secretary must promptly post notifications of food allergens and any objections received. A spice containing a non-major food allergen must be disclosed as specified by the Secretary. The amendments do not affect the Secretary's authority to require labeling for other food allergens under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act is amended to define 'major food allergen' as milk, egg, fish, crustacean shellfish, tree nuts, wheat, peanuts, and soybeans. It also includes food ingredients containing protein derived from these allergens, with exceptions for highly refined oils and certain exempt ingredients. Section 403A(a)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act is amended to include 403(w) and 403(x) in addition to 403(i)(2). These amendments apply to food labeled on or after January 1, 2006. SEC. 4. REPORT ON FOOD ALLERGENS. The Secretary of Health and Human Services must submit a report to specific committees analyzing unintentional contamination of major food allergens in food manufacturing within 18 months of this Act. The report analyzes unintentional contamination of major food allergens in food manufacturing, including ways foods are contaminated and common industry practices. It also advises on reducing cross-contact of allergens and describes advisory labeling used by food producers. The report discusses the use of advisory labeling on food products and consumer preferences for communicating the risk of cross-contact on food labels. It also includes information on inspections of food manufacturing facilities regarding compliance with labeling of major food allergens. The report assesses violations and voluntary recalls related to undeclared major food allergens, as well as the effectiveness of addressing cross-contact issues by the Secretary and the food industry. The Secretary of Health and Human Services conducts inspections of food facilities to ensure compliance with practices to reduce cross-contact of major food allergens and proper labeling. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will define and allow the use of the term \"gluten-free\" on food labels within 2 years of this Act, with a final rule issued within 4 years. Additionally, there will be improvements in data collection and publication regarding food-related allergic responses. The Secretary of Health and Human Services, in consultation with other agencies, will improve the collection and publication of national data on food allergies, adverse events, and treatment/prevention methods. Authorization of appropriations is provided for this purpose. SEC. 8. FOOD ALLERGIES RESEARCH. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will convene an expert panel to review food allergy research efforts and make recommendations for enhancing research activities. SEC. 9. FOOD ALLERGENS IN THE FOOD CODE. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will revise the Food Code to provide guidelines for preparing allergen-free foods in various food establishments. Recommendations for responding to food-related allergic responses will also be considered. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will provide technical assistance on different modes of treatment and prevention of food-related allergic responses to State and local agencies under the Public Health Service Act."
