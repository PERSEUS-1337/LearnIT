It also defines a \"qualified disaster area\" as a census tract or nonmetropolitan county in a major disaster area or a catastrophic incident area that no longer meets the criteria. The text discusses the criteria for a census tract or nonmetropolitan county to be considered a qualified disaster area, which is determined based on the results of a decennial census conducted after the area was designated as a base closure area. After a qualified disaster area is designated, a decennial census is conducted to determine eligibility, starting on the date of the disaster declaration by the President or the date of the catastrophic incident in the area. The Administrator may extend the period for a qualified disaster area if it has not fully recovered from the catastrophic incident. The term 'major disaster area' refers to an area designated by the President. The President has declared a major disaster in a specific area under the Stafford Disaster Relief Act. The term 'qualified HUBZone small business concern' refers to a certified small business in a HUBZone. The Administrator of the Small Business Administration will determine the implementation of certain designations after the Census Bureau releases census results.
