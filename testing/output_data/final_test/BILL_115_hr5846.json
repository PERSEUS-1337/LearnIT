    "content": "The Act titled \"Promoting Flood Risk Mitigation Act\" and a GAO study on buyout practices are included in the legislation. The \"Promoting Flood Risk Mitigation Act\" defines key terms such as Administrator and appropriate committees of Congress, including buyout practices for flood-damaged areas. The \"Promoting Flood Risk Mitigation Act\" defines terms like eligible property owner, National Flood Insurance Program, and repetitive loss structure. Eligible property owners are policyholders with household incomes not exceeding 120% of the mean household income for their community. The \"Promoting Flood Risk Mitigation Act\" requires a study by the Comptroller General to assess the efficacy of buyout practices and ways to streamline them for timely assistance to State and local governments. The study will analyze current and future trends related to repetitive loss structures and severe repetitive loss. The study mandated by the \"Promoting Flood Risk Mitigation Act\" will assess changes in flood risk, frequency, and magnitude for properties insured under the National Flood Insurance Program. It will also examine buyout practices, including funding sources, number of properties acquired, and average time for State or local buyout programs. The study will evaluate the average time for State or local governments to acquire flood-damaged properties under buyout programs, estimate the number of properties that could be acquired, analyze the socioeconomic status of recipients, and provide examples of successful buyout programs. It will also identify constraints that may hinder timely property acquisition. Constraints that may impede timely property acquisition under a buyout program include lack of communication, pressures to redevelop acquired properties, and inadequate funding. Potential options to address these constraints include evaluating the feasibility of a pilot program where property owners agree to participate before a flood event occurs. The Administrator may provide financial assistance to State and local governments willing to participate in a program to purchase properties damaged by floods. Eligible property owners may receive a premium credit to incentivize participation in the program. The Administrator may provide financial assistance to State and local governments for purchasing flood-damaged properties. Properties acquired must be maintained as open space and can be used for mitigation, conservation, and recreational purposes. 5 to 10 State and local governments must participate, and nonprofit organizations could help make buyouts more accessible. The curr_chunk discusses the benefits of buyout practices for flood risk reduction, including ecosystem restoration and nature-based approaches. It also mentions recommendations for best practices and how the Administrator can use buyout programs to reduce future flood risks. The Administrator can use buyout programs to reduce future flood disaster recovery costs attributed to projections of flood risk from sea level rise, population changes, and other factors. A cost-benefit analysis of mitigation and buy-out projects is required, along with leveraging Federal resources for disaster mitigation. The Comptroller General must submit a report to Congress and the Administrator within one year of the Act's enactment. The report submitted shall detail the feasibility of establishing an alternative buyout program, such as the pilot program described in subsection (c)(4)(A). The House of Representatives passed the bill on July 16, 2018. Karen L. Haas attested to it as the Clerk."
