    "content": "Congressional concern over high oil prices, U.S. dependence on oil imports, budgetary pressures, and maintenance of Alaskan oil infrastructure has revived discussion on opening the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) for oil and gas exploration. Proponents argue for smaller surface impact compared to past operations, but current law prohibits development in ANWR. Technological advancements in petroleum exploration and drilling have reduced environmental impacts and improved efficiency. Innovation in seismic data analysis, drilling techniques, and waste reduction has increased exploration success rates and worker productivity in the petroleum industry. These advancements have also helped address economic obstacles in finding and developing hydrocarbons, while decreasing the potential impact of oil and gas operations on the arctic environment. The impact of oil and gas operations on the arctic environment has decreased due to technological advancements. The policy issue of opening ANWR to oil and gas development is not addressed in this report. Discussions on possible effects on the biological environment and regulatory requirements for industry operations can be found in other sources. The report discusses concerns and benefits of Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) development, exploration and drilling technologies, options for commercial production, and production technologies for hydrocarbon recovery. It also compares environmental procedures from 1987 with current practices. The 1987 FLEIS report compares environmental effects of Arctic petroleum technologies then and now. While advancements have reduced impacts, issues like gravel use, spills, and habitat loss remain unresolved. Mining gravel for development may alter local topography, require roads for transport, and result in habitat loss due to secondary effects like dust deposition and altered erosion patterns. The construction and mining activities in the Arctic region will lead to significant water usage for various purposes. Long-term effects of winter operations are unknown, but summer erosion and melting of permafrost may occur. Destruction of tundra, vegetation, and potential spills could harm the environment. Numerous surface disturbances are expected, with production facilities connected by a gathering network. Oil and gas development in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) could potentially bring energy security and economic benefits by reducing U.S. dependency on foreign petroleum, creating jobs, generating tax revenues, and extending the economic life of the Trans Alaska Pipeline System. These benefits are discussed in detail in CRS reports. The petroleum industry has advanced technology for operations in the Arctic since 1987, with some technologies progressing from embryonic to mature stages. Tables show the increasing availability of these technological changes. New exploration technologies in the petroleum industry provide clearer underground structures before drilling, reducing the need for exploratory drilling. Ice roads and insulated ice pads minimize surface disturbance, while high performance drilling reduces industry operations' surface footprint and waste generation. Production technology advancements since 1987 require fewer workers, less land, and generate less waste. The North Slope, home to the largest oil fields in North America, has faced logistical barriers due to harsh environmental conditions. Interest in exploring the 65,000-square-mile coastal plain dates back to 1906, with federal exploration documented for 50 of the last 80 years. Industry exploration has been continuous since 1958. The possibility of petroleum in the subsurface of ANWR was hinted at by oil seeps and oil-stained rock. Federal exploration in the Naval Petroleum Reserve #4 from 1944 to 1953 discovered uneconomic oil and gas fields, supporting the conclusion that the North Slope had potential as a major petroleum province. Profitable operations on the North Slope were indicated by federal exploration and subsequent economic studies. Prudhoe Bay, Kuparuk River, and Alpine are three major oil fields in the Arctic environment. Prudhoe Bay, the largest oil field in North America, had estimated reserves of 9.6 billion barrels of oil in 1968, which have since increased to 14 billion barrels with advanced technology. The Prudhoe Bay oil field spans 125,000 acres with six central production facilities. Extensive gravel roads connect development well pads, with waste treatment facilities and an airstrip at the main operations center. Production peaked at 1.5 million barrels a day between 1977 and 1987, declining to 680,000 barrels per day by 1999. The first horizontal well was drilled in anticipation of production decline. The first horizontal well was drilled in November 1985 to increase production rates in the Prudhoe Bay field. Exploration continues in the area with yearly drilling of exploratory wells. Production from North Slope and southwest Alaska has decreased to about 900,000 barrels per day from a peak of two million barrels per day. The Kuparuk River unit, the second largest oil field in the US, has estimated reserves of 2.9 billion barrels and currently produces about 160,000 barrels per day with remaining reserves of 1.0 billion barrels. The Kuparuk River field has 1.0 billion barrels of remaining reserves. The field installations include a water desalinization plant for production use. The project aimed to reduce costs and environmental impact. Recycling efforts at Kuparuk River led to a 95% reduction in waste material and won an EPA award in 1999. The Alpine field, with initial reserves of 365 million barrels, was discovered in 1994. The Alpine field, with initial reserves of 365 million barrels of oil, was discovered in 1994 and declared commercial in October 1996 after delineation drilling. Reserve estimates increased to 429 million barrels with data from wells and a 3-D seismic survey. Production started in November 2000 with 112 horizontal wells developed instead of 94 conventional wells. Equipment was stored at Kuparuk River field during construction and moved to Alpine site by ice roads in winter, with no long-term damage to the tundra. The Alpine field, discovered in 1994, has seen no long-term damage to the tundra despite operations similar to an offshore platform. With production reaching 120,000 barrels per day in 2005, the field continues to be actively developed. Approval was given in 2004 for two satellite drill sites with five drill pads. Petroleum exploration involves interpreting geological and geophysical data to predict hydrocarbon potential and assess geologic and economic risks before drilling exploratory wells. Advanced seismic data interpretation techniques help geophysicists identify potential hydrocarbon reserves deep underground, reducing costs and environmental impact during exploration and production. The use of advanced exploration techniques has significantly increased exploration success rates in hydrocarbon fields since the 1980s. Despite the benefits, there is still a high risk of drilling dry holes in sparsely explored regions. Evaluating exploration risks is crucial in the petroleum business, with three common factors determining geologic risk for finding economically recoverable hydrocarbons. The use of advanced exploration techniques has increased success rates in finding hydrocarbons. Geologists and geophysicists assess the presence of structure, reservoir, and source rock. Exploration involves prospecting for resources and extending known limits. Success rates have improved to 20%-25% due to advanced technologies. The success rate has increased to 10% due to advanced technologies improving mapping of structure and identification of reservoir rock for finding hydrocarbons. Geophysicists use 2-D and 3-D seismic data to interpret subsurface structure and fluid type of potential reservoirs, with improved techniques accurately identifying features. Companies rely on 2-D seismic data for interpreting structure and selecting exploratory well sites. The application of 3-D seismic techniques has significantly improved success rates in offshore areas, with rates as high as 47% to 70%. The use of 3-D seismic data on land and in data-poor areas is increasing, leading to lower exploration costs and improved data accuracy. While costs for offshore 3-D seismic acquisition have decreased, costs on land remain up to 75% higher. Initially too expensive for small operators, 3-D seismic data is now routinely used by independent operators in the offshore areas of the United States and Europe. In 2000, the cost for a 50-square-mile 3-D seismic survey was reduced to $90,000 from $8.0 million. 3-D seismic surveys are more expensive and disruptive to the environment than 2-D surveys due to requiring more crew members. Difficulties in onshore seismic acquisition include ownership rights, physical barriers, and data interpretation challenges. 3-D seismic surveys have been conducted in Alaska's NPRA and surrounding producing fields on state lands. Recent advances in interpreting seismic data in permafrost regions enable the use of winter-acquired seismic data in mapping structure and depth. 3-D seismic acquisition in the 1002 area of ANWR is feasible due to minimal ownership conflicts and few physical barriers. Seismic data helps interpret subsurface structures but cannot determine if a rock is a source of petroleum. Seismic data is used to interpret subsurface structures and estimate hydrocarbon amounts in reservoir rock by analyzing acoustic waves. Different velocities of echos indicate the presence of gas or oil, which can be used as hydrocarbon indicators in 2-D and 3-D seismic data. These indicators help predict reservoir thickness and hydrocarbon volumes. Analysis of ANWR Oil Seeps: Oil seep data and advanced modeling techniques can determine the presence of oil, natural gas, or both in the 1002 area. One rock formation is identified as the likely source of oil, but it differs from Prudhoe Bay oil. This formation can produce oil and gas or just gas, depending on burial depth by younger rocks. Advanced geological models and satellite data help geologists interpret data more accurately, reducing the need for excessive exploratory drilling to find hydrocarbon accumulations. These models also aid in predicting the distribution and types of reservoir and source rocks, improving field development by conveying reservoir rock properties to engineers and geophysicists. Technologies such as computer power, remote sensing, image-processing, and satellite data have enhanced the interpretation of surface and subsurface data in oil and gas exploration. Technologies like GPS, GIS, and radar satellites aid geologists in interpreting surface and subsurface data accurately. Optical satellite imagery has been crucial for identifying onshore geology since the 1970s. Radar satellites now use microwave frequencies to collect data under any atmospheric condition, allowing for the detection of oil seeps and natural resources. Ice-based technologies have reduced the need for permanent gravel roads in the Arctic, allowing industry to conduct seismic operations and drill exploration wells in the winter with less impact on the environment. Rolligons, vehicles with huge tires, compact ice crystals to transport equipment for ice road construction. Ice road construction in the Arctic involves Rolligons compacting ice crystals to promote freezing, adding snow and water to increase ice thickness, and trimming ice chips from frozen lakes. A warming trend has delayed construction start times. Exploration drilling can be delayed by problems, requiring equipment demobilization and storage. In recent years, higher temperatures on the North Slope have reduced exploratory operations to 75 to 110 days. To lengthen drilling seasons, insulated ice pads are used to preserve drill sites over the summer. This method can extend drilling seasons by 50 to 70 days, but they are still shorter than 30 years ago. If no oil is found, ice pads and roads are allowed to melt. Ice pads and roads are used to preserve drill sites over the summer on the North Slope. If economic quantities of oil are found, a gravel pad is constructed for long-term development, causing vegetation underneath to die. Factors limiting the use of ice technologies include availability of fresh water, distance from water sources, topography, and distance from staging areas. Fresh water supply is crucial as melted saltwater would harm vegetation. Research is ongoing to minimize environmental impact on tundra surrounding pads. The 1002 area in the Refuge has limited fresh water supply, with most lakes freezing solid in winter. A 1989 study found 255 lakes, ponds, and puddles, with only eight containing enough unfrozen water for ice road construction. Ice chips from lakes and rivers can supplement road building, with each mile using one million gallons of water. Water shortages may be addressed by using chipped ice scraped from lakes. Water shortages in the 1002 area of the Refuge may be addressed by using chipped ice scraped from lakes. Ice road construction may be limited by the area's topography, with gravel roads sometimes used for safety reasons in areas with high relief. Distance from developed areas or potential staging areas can also limit ice technology. Ice roads are crucial for transporting equipment to drill sites in remote areas, but distance and topographic limitations can cause delays and increase costs. Gravel construction can be an alternative if ice roads are not feasible. However, with polar warming, the use of ice technology may be further limited. The Alpine field serves as a model for development in the National Petroleum Reserve - Alaska, emphasizing roadless development to minimize environmental impact. The National Petroleum Reserve - Alaska (NPRA) is a model of \"roadless\" development with short roads connecting initial pads. Approval of additional pads will add 28 miles of gravel roads and create disturbed soils. Ice technologies limit development footprints in exploration phases, but may have a more modest role in development phases. Advanced exploration technology has made exploration more efficient compared to 20 years ago. The Department of the Interior assumed in its 1987 FLEIS that additional surface geological work and seismic exploration would occur in ANWR using advanced technology like equipment generating sound waves. Requests for authorizations to conduct 3-D seismic surveys were anticipated, with multiple seismic crews from different companies working in different areas. Movement of equipment was expected on ice roads built for the purpose. The Alaska Department of Natural Resources required 12 inches of frost and 6 inches of snow before vehicles could operate on the tundra. A single drilling season was expected to be approximately 170 days, with one moderately deep well drilled in one season. Drill pads were anticipated to be constructed of various materials and large enough to hold a rig, camp, and facilities. Field work in ANWR is essential for studying rock types and potential reservoir targets. Advances in technology have made data interpretation more efficient, with computer models being used to predict reservoir rock properties. Petroleum companies are utilizing vast amounts of rock data to calibrate these models. In ANWR, seismic data is acquired using vibrators during the winter. Seismic crews use specialized equipment for data collection, with multiple crews working in the area for various companies. 3-D seismic data is valuable for exploring ANWR, especially in areas with known hydrocarbon fields. 2-D seismic surveys are customized for exploration based on geology and terrain. The quality of 2-D seismic data has significantly improved in recent years. Drilling remains the most accurate method to measure subsurface petroleum. Industry on the North Slope can now drill for thinner and deeper reservoirs with fewer wells and less waste. Directional drilling involves advanced technologies to navigate through rock layers and reach predefined targets. Directional drilling has gained widespread acceptance due to solving control and safety problems related to subsurface pressure regimes and fluid types. Advantages include drilling multiple wells from a single location, reaching targets up to five to seven miles away, accessing more of the reservoir formation, and drilling relief wells at an angle in case of a kick. Technology allows wells to deviate from vertical to horizontal, with types including extended reach, horizontal, and designer wells. ERD wells have evolved rapidly since the 1990s, allowing for horizontal displacement of up to five times the vertical depth. They can reach targets in environmentally sensitive areas from fewer surface locations, with some wells extending up to seven miles. Horizontal wells are drilled vertically before turning 90 degrees to continue horizontally through rock formations for up to five miles. Specialized drilling techniques are required for ERD and horizontal wells. Horizontal and ERD wells require specialized equipment for drilling through rock formations up to five miles. Evaluation tools have been developed to measure rock characteristics at the drill bit while drilling at sharp angles, sometimes less than 90\u00b0. 3-D seismic data and new technologies have made complex well drilling practical, allowing for tight turns with steel pipe. The drilling of the well itself is not the limiting factor in horizontal and ERD wells. Advances in drill bit technology and drilling fluids have significantly improved drilling performance in horizontal and ERD wells. The introduction of the polycrystalline diamond compact (PDC) bit in 1973 has allowed for faster drilling and longer bit life. Diamond cutters are 10 times harder than steel, making them highly wear-resistant. Diamond particles are essential in drilling fluids to carry drill cuttings to the surface, maintain pressure balance, lubricate equipment, and prevent fluid influx. Three types of fluids used are water-based mud (WBM), oil-based mud (OBM), and synthetic-based mud (SBM). SBMs are being developed to mimic OBM without environmental issues by using organic substances to replace oil. Drilling operations involve heavy equipment in localized areas for exploration wells, with drill pads covering 5 to 10 acres and reserve pits 0.5 to 2.0 acres in size. Flare pits or vent systems are included for excess gas. Vertical wells are typically used in ANWR for exploratory drilling. If commercial hydrocarbon deposits are found, high-performance drilling techniques would be employed. Production facilities are necessary for extracting hydrocarbons in ANWR, with potentially fewer drill sites needed if high-performance drilling techniques are used. Cuttings from drilling may be stored in temporary reserve pits surrounded by ice walls and repurposed for construction material. Production facilities are essential for extracting hydrocarbons in oil and gas operations. New developments in facility construction and drilling techniques have reduced environmental impacts and waste volumes. Compact, transportable unmanned facilities are used in remote and environmentally sensitive areas like the Arctic, utilizing design integration, equipment elimination, multi-use systems, and automation with the help of 3-D animation graphics. The design of compact facilities in automobile and airplane manufacturing industries is aided by 3-D graphics, allowing for efficient construction. Drilling mud, water, and drill cuttings are major wastes in drilling operations, requiring proper borehole protection. The recently developed Alpine Field disposes of all liquid and solid drilling wastes. At Alpine Field, drilling and associated wastes are disposed of by injecting them into the subsurface. Water is produced with oil, and new technologies can reduce produced water by up to 97%. British Petroleum Exploration Alaska built a facility in 1990 to recycle cuttings into construction gravel. In 1990, a facility was built at Alpine Field to recycle cuttings into construction gravel and ground operational wastes for re-injection. By 1994, Prudhoe Bay operators achieved zero surface discharge of drilling wastes using refined grind-and-inject technology. ARCO conducted a pilot project in 1988 showing that cleaned drill cuttings could be used as road construction material. The industry has used cable and rotary drilling rigs for the past 100 years, with rotary drilling now being used for deeper subsurface drilling. Slim hole drilling, used since 1960 in the oil and gas industry, involves smaller 3-4.25 inch diameter holes compared to conventional 8-10 inch holes. It reduces costs, requires less drilling fluid, and has a smaller drill crew. Slim hole drilling can be transported by helicopter for remote access and is used for exploratory wells and improved production techniques. However, it has challenges in preventing fluid escape. Slim hole drilling has shortcomings in fluid containment and requires non-standard equipment. Traditional rotary drilling rigs are tall and require connecting drill pipes. In contrast, CTD units use flexible steel pipe on a reel, with advantages such as minimal pipe handling, better fluid control, and reduced noise levels. CTD drilling was first used in 1991 on the North Slope. Advantages of CTD include lighter, less toxic muds, lower noise levels, smaller sites with less surface disturbance, reduced heavy equipment and emissions, and no personnel needed at the wellhead. Disadvantages include limitations on drilling objectives, the need for more advanced equipment and practices, and challenges in transporting and lifting the heavy coiled pipe. Multilateral wells allow for drilling additional boreholes from a central borehole, sharing the same surface facility. This technology was first used in production drilling on the North Slope in 1999. The innovative technology developed on the North Slope is through-tubing rotary drilled (TTRD) wells, allowing a new well to be drilled through the production tubing of an older well. This method reduces the need for pulling out old tubing and allows for drilling with smaller rigs. TTRD equipment can be transported over ice bridges with weight restrictions, providing access to areas not open to conventional rigs and decreasing the number of surface drilling sites. However, this technology is only useful in areas where production wells have been completed in the past. The planned petroleum operations in the subsurface area would require numerous production and injection wells, with specific well spacing and drill pad construction. The surface impact was estimated to be limited to the size of the accumulation area. Directional drilling and peak production expectations were also considered in the project. Peak production in the Arctic field was projected to be achievable in two to five years and last for three to eight years, with a total field life of 20-30 years. The time lapse from lease acquisition to initial production was estimated at around 10 years. Drill cuttings would be stored in a reserve pit on the drill pad, while drilling muds would be reinjected into previous wells. Today's production facilities are more compact and utilize advanced production techniques. The Alpine field covers 40,000 acres and includes two production drilling sites connected by a road/airstrip. Alpine field operations cover 97 acres, occupying only 0.2% of the hydrocarbon accumulation area. The footprint is reduced by drilling horizontally and using compact facilities. Drill sites are smaller due to reinjection of drill solids and fluids. Multilateral and coiled tubing wells produce less waste. TTRD units access hard-to-reach areas. Gas is used in projects and may be flared for safety. Drill sites in Alaska are constructed with gravel or recycled cuttings. Improved production techniques have greatly reduced produced water today. Over 95% of operational waste at Prudhoe is recycled, with a goal of zero discharge at the Alpine field. Advances in exploration, drilling, and production operations have minimized the footprint of petroleum operations in Arctic environments. These advancements, including 3-D seismic technology, would be available for use in the 1002 area of ANWR if opened by Congress. Exploration success rates have increased, leading to fewer exploration wells needed. Advances in seismic technology and computer-aided models have improved interpretation of seismic data for hydrocarbon exploration on the North Slope. Operations are conducted in winter to protect the tundra, with reduced spacing between wells and smaller production facilities to minimize environmental impact. Exploration techniques using vibrating instead of explosive methods have been implemented, resulting in fewer and better-placed wells needed for production. The site has significantly shrunk from 65 acres to fewer than 9 acres due to advanced drilling techniques and technology. Reserve pits have been eliminated or used on insulated ice pads temporarily. Operators on the North Slope are using advanced technology to manage drilling wastes effectively, with options like using cleaned well cuttings for construction material. Advanced technologies in Arctic oil and gas development could help mitigate environmental effects, but opponents argue against opening ANWR to energy development. Opponents argue that opening ANWR to energy development would intrude on the ecosystem, interfere with wildlife, risk spills of hazardous materials, and result in a permanent loss of wilderness. The decision to open ANWR remains a policy issue, with exploration in the 1002 area conducted without drilling. Oil and Gas Exploration Programs in the 1002 area from 1983-1985 involved helicopter access only, with no ground vehicles permitted. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service monitored the work and found no adverse effects on fish and wildlife. Seismic surveys, the only exploration technique with mechanized surface transportation, were conducted during winters to minimize impact on wildlife. Only 4.0% of the 1002 area was covered by rock outcrop data collection. The 2-D seismic survey in the 1002 area of ANWR was limited to 1,300 line-miles to identify potential areas for the FLEIS report. Full-time FWS monitors accompanied the seismic crews to mitigate short-term adverse environmental effects. The area is located between two known petroleum provinces, the U.S. North Slope and the Canadian Beaufort Sea. Follow-up studies were planned to assess long-term impacts, but it is unclear if they were carried out or published. The regional geological data collected in the 1980s and 1990s suggest that rocks from nearby provinces may extend into the 1002 area of ANWR. Seismic data was reprocessed and used in petroleum assessments by BLM and USGS. USGS divided the 1002 area into undeformed and deformed areas based on geological structures. The 1002 area in ANWR is divided into undeformed and deformed regions. The undeformed area is similar to North Slope fields, while the deformed area is more like Canadian Beaufort and Mackenzie Delta fields. The complexity of the deformed area makes data interpretation challenging. Different drilling and production techniques would be needed in the deformed area. Determining the presence of a source rock for petroleum generation is crucial before exploration. The geochemistry of rock sequences in the 1002 area indicates potential for oil and gas generation. Gas can be produced from rocks that also generate oil, but they need to be buried deeper. Only one rock sequence is more likely to produce oil, while the other four are more prone to producing gas."
