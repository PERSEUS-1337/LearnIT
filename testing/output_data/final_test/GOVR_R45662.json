    "content": "The Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) is the main source of federal aid for elementary and secondary education, with Title I-A being the largest program funded at $15.8 billion for FY2018. It provides supplementary educational services to low-achieving students in schools with high numbers of low-income families. The U.S. Department of Education determines Title I-A grants to local educational agencies based on four funding formulas. This report estimates FY2018 state grant amounts under each formula. Under Title I-A, funds are allocated to LEAs via state educational agencies (SEAs) using four formulas: Basic Grants, Concentration Grants, Targeted Grants, and EFIG. In FY2018, 41% of funds were allocated through Basic Grants, 9% through Concentration Grants, and 25% each through Targeted Grants and EFIG. Once funds reach LEAs, they are combined and used jointly. Each formula calculates a maximum grant based on a \"formula child count.\" The Title I-A formulas allocate funds to LEAs based on a \"formula child count\" and an \"expenditure factor\" derived from state per pupil expenditures. Maximum grant amounts are determined by multiplying additional factors with the formula child count and expenditure factor. Grants are adjusted to match available appropriations, considering state and LEA minimum grant provisions. LEAs must meet minimum criteria to be eligible for grants under specific formulas, with some qualifying for multiple formulas. In FY2018, Title I-A grants are allocated to LEAs using Basic, Concentration, and Targeted Grants formulas at the state and LEA levels. Grants are calculated by ED and then suballocated to LEAs within each state. California received the largest total Title I-A grant amount of $2.0 million. The percentage share of funds allocated under each formula was calculated for each state. Total Title I-A grants for each state were calculated by summing the grants from the four formulas. In FY2018, California received the largest total Title I-A grant amount of $2.0 billion, representing 12.76% of Title I-A grants. Wyoming received the smallest grant amount at $35.9 million, accounting for 0.23% of grants. Grant amounts vary among states due to different allocation formulas, with the Basic Grant formula generally receiving a greater share of appropriations. States like Texas with larger child populations receive higher estimated grant amounts compared to states like North Carolina. In FY2018, California received the largest Title I-A grant amount of $2.0 billion, while Wyoming received the smallest grant amount at $35.9 million. Grant amounts vary among states due to different allocation formulas, with states like Texas receiving higher estimated grants compared to states like North Carolina. Certain formulas may be more favorable to states, with Florida, Nevada, New York, and Texas estimated to receive a higher percentage share of Targeted Grants than overall Title I-A funds. The Targeted Grant formula is more favorable to certain states than other Title I-A formulas. Four states are estimated to receive a smaller percentage share of Basic Grants compared to overall Title I-A funds. States with minimum grants under all formulas have higher shares under the Targeted Grant and EFIG formulas. Grant amounts denoted with an asterisk (*) in Table 1 indicate minimum grants under a specific Title I-A formula."
