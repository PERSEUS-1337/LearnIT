    "title": "AB 2002",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 82002 of the Government Code is amended to define \"administrative action\" as the process of proposing, drafting, developing, amending, enacting, or defeating rules or regulations by state agencies. It also includes decisions by state agencies to enter into contracts to invest state public retirement system assets on behalf of a state public retirement system. The curr_chunk defines \"ratemaking proceeding\" as any proceeding before the Public Utilities Commission where a rate will be established, including general rate cases and other ratesetting mechanisms. The curr_chunk defines \"quasi-legislative proceeding\" as any proceeding before the Public Utilities Commission that involves establishing policies for a group of people. It also amends the definition of \"lobbyist\" in the Government Code to include individuals who receive $2,000 or more in economic consideration to influence legislative or administrative action. The curr_chunk clarifies that a communication made to influence a Public Utilities Commission proceeding is not considered lobbying if made at a public event or included in the official record. It also specifies that for quasi-judicial matters before the California Coastal Commission, \"agency official\" only refers to a member of the Commission. The curr_chunk amends Section 86300 of the Government Code, stating that elected public officials and state employees acting within their official capacity are exempt from certain provisions. However, state employees attempting to influence legislative action and required to register as lobbyists cannot gift more than $10 in a calendar month to elected state officers or legislative officials. The curr_chunk exempts newspapers, periodicals, book publishers, radio or television stations, and individuals associated with them from certain lobbying restrictions if they only engage in activities related to urging legislative or administrative action within the ordinary course of business. Additionally, individuals representing a church for the purpose of protecting the right to practice its doctrines are also exempt. An employee of a local government agency can influence decisions of the California Coastal Commission within their scope of employment. Ex parte communications must be disclosed and reported to the executive director or on the record of the proceeding at the next commission hearing. Ex parte communications to the California Coastal Commission must be disclosed in writing at least 24 hours before a hearing. The commission must adopt standard disclosure forms including details like the date, time, location, and identities of all parties involved in the communication. Ex parte communications to the California Coastal Commission must be fully disclosed, including the identity of all persons present and a comprehensive description of the communication. The executive director must place reports of ex parte communications in the public record. Testifying at commission hearings or submitting written comments is allowed, with comments to be submitted in writing or delivered to a commission office. Any person who communicates with the California Coastal Commission regarding an administrative action must comply with lobbying requirements outlined in the Government Code. The provisions of this act align with the Political Reform Act of 1974. No reimbursement is required by this act pursuant to Section 6 of Article XIII\u2009B of the California Constitution as it only incurs costs for local agencies or school districts related to creating, eliminating, or changing crimes or infractions."
