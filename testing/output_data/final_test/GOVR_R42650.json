    "content": "The ethical implications of secretly recording conversations by attorneys are complex. The American Bar Association initially deemed it unethical, but many jurisdictions have rejected this stance. Federal and state laws generally prohibit such recordings. The American Bar Association and Model Rules of Professional Conduct condemn recording conversations without consent. Attorneys are advised against recording any conversation without the knowledge of all parties involved. The Texas Professional Ethics Committee concluded that attorneys should not electronically record a conversation without informing all parties involved, as it goes against the concept of honor and fair play. Exceptions may apply for law enforcement officials within statutory limitations. The Texas Professional Ethics Committee prohibits attorneys from recording conversations without informing all parties involved, except for law enforcement officials under strict statutory limitations. Other states have similar rules with expanded exceptions. In Ohio, South Carolina, and Tennessee, there are expanded exceptions for recording conversations, including allowing law enforcement personnel to record without judicial supervision, recording by criminal defense counsel, recording statements that constitute crimes, recording confidential conversations with clients, and recording for creating a memorandum. Other jurisdictions like the District of Columbia, Mississippi, New Mexico, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Oregon, Utah, and Wisconsin suggest that the propriety of attorneys recording conversations depends on the circumstances. The ABA issued Formal Opinion 01-422 in 2001, rejecting a broad proscription on nonconsensual recording of conversations. The opinion stated that lawyers do not violate Model Rules by recording conversations without consent if permitted by law in the jurisdiction. However, if recording private conversations is prohibited by law, lawyers may violate Model Rule 8.4 and Model Rule 4.4 if the purpose is to obtain evidence. It is also noted that a lawyer cannot misrepresent that a conversation is not being recorded. The ABA's Formal Opinion 01-422 addresses the issue of recording conversations without consent. While some states require all parties to consent to recording, others have not withdrawn earlier opinions declaring surreptitious recordings ethically suspect. Some states, including Arizona, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, and Kentucky, believe that recording with the consent of one party is not unethical unless it is illegal. Other states, such as Alabama, Alaska, Hawaii, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, New York, Ohio, Oregon, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, and Vermont, share this view. Maine, Mississippi, North Carolina, and Oklahoma also hold similar opinions. However, there is still some ambivalence among states that now consider secret recording not inherently unethical. Nebraska and New Mexico emphasize the importance of full disclosure, while Minnesota cautions against surreptitious recording. Minnesota cautions against surreptitiously recording client conversations without all parties' knowledge, as it may involve deception and violate ethical codes. Some states allow recording with one party's consent, while others have not clearly stated their position on the matter. The legality of surreptitious recording by lawyers varies by jurisdiction, with some allowing it for evidence gathering purposes in certain circumstances. This includes situations where the recording is unrelated to legal practice, involves criminal activities, or is made for internal documentation. The Alabama State Bar Disciplinary Commission Formal Opinion 1983-183 states that there is no provision in the Code of Professional Responsibility that directly prohibits an attorney from recording conversations without consent if they are one of the conversants.

The Colorado Bar Association Ethics Committee prohibits attorneys from engaging in surreptitious recording of conversations, even if legal under state law. Attorneys cannot direct or authorize agents to record conversations secretly, but may use recordings made by clients lawfully and independently. Attorneys may ethically engage in surreptitious recording in criminal matters for evidence gathering or in personal matters unrelated to their legal practice. In People v. Smith, the respondent recorded telephone conversations secretly during an undercover investigation with the Colorado Bureau of Investigation. The respondent violated ethical standards by using a recording device without disclosure, which goes against the Code of Professional Responsibility. Despite claiming to act under law enforcement direction, the respondent, a private attorney, was found to have breached ethical rules. This conduct was deemed unacceptable by the District of Columbia Bar Opinion No. 323 (2004) and the Virginia Standing Committee on Legal Ethics. The Virginia Standing Committee concluded that the ethical rule prohibiting non-consensual tape recording did not apply to law enforcement undercover activities. District of Columbia Bar Opinion No. 229 (1992) stated that a lawyer can record a meeting with a federal agency investigating their client without ethical violation, as long as no affirmative misrepresentations are made.

Mollman agreed to wear a body microphone to record a conversation with Johnson about their past drug usage. The conversation was scripted by federal agents and intentionally incriminating. Mollman was charged with violating professional ethics by recording the conversation without Johnson's consent. The committee alleged that Mollman's conduct violated formal advisory opinion 83-16, which prohibits lawyers from recording conversations without consent. This rule, adopted in 1982, deems such recordings unethical, even if legal under federal law. The Kansas Bar Association Opinion 96-9 (1997) states that lawyers can ethically make secret recordings under strict limitations, but the exception does not apply to private citizens acting as government agents like Mollman. The rule does not automatically make exceptions, and in this case, the application of the exception cannot be justified. The Kansas Bar Association Opinion 96-9 (1997) prohibits lawyers from secretly recording telephone conversations without the consent of all parties involved, except for specific limitations. Kentucky Bar Association Ethics Opinion KBA E-279 (1984) also states that attorneys cannot record conversations without consent, especially in criminal cases.

Secret recording is illegal in some states and lawyers who deny recording may face discipline. Recording client conversations is only acceptable in limited circumstances. Board Opinion No. 18 (1996)(repealed 2002) stated that it is professional misconduct for a lawyer to record a conversation without the knowledge of all parties, except in specific circumstances. This opinion was referenced in Mississippi Bar v. Attorney ST., 621 So.2d 229 (Miss. 1993). Attorney ST. faced a formal complaint for secretly recording conversations with a judge and police chief. In a previous case, Attorney M was allowed to record conversations with a doctor without his knowledge. The Mississippi Bar referenced Board Opinion No. 18 (1996) which stated recording conversations without all parties' knowledge is misconduct. The Mississippi Bar referenced a case where surreptitious tape recording was deemed ethical under certain circumstances, such as to protect oneself or a client from perjured testimony. However, using secret recordings for blackmail or unfair advantage is considered unethical and potentially illegal. The focus is on how attorneys use surreptitious recordings, rather than the recordings themselves. The Netterville context-of-the-circumstances test distinguishes the ethical use of surreptitious recordings by attorneys. Attorney ST's actions in taping conversations were deemed justified to protect his client's interests but crossed ethical boundaries when he denied doing so.

Both ABA 337 and N.Y. State 328 prohibit secret recordings without express authority, citing reasons like 'elemental fairness,' which is deemed unpersuasive by the New York City ethics committee. The concept of fairness and candor in determining unethical conduct is subjective and can vary depending on the context. The secret recording of a telephone conversation with consent may not be deceitful per se, as it is lawful under New York and federal law. However, there are circumstances where secret recordings could violate ethical provisions. The New York State Bar Association and North Carolina State Bar Ethics Opinions state that secretly recording conversations without informing the other party is ethically improper and violates traditional standards of fairness and candor in the practice of law.

This unethical conduct led to sanctions on attorneys for inappropriate contact with a represented party witness. The ABA published a new Formal Opinion stating that recording conversations without the knowledge of all parties may not violate professional conduct rules. South Dakota laws allow one party to record a conversation without consent. The ABA suggests prohibiting nonconsensual recordings if unethical circumstances are present.
