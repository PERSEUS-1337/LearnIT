    "content": "The United States ratified the UNFCCC in 1992, aiming to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Despite various proposed actions, emissions have continued to rise. President George W. Bush rejected the Kyoto Protocol and mandatory emissions reductions. The focus of U.S. climate change policy has shifted since then. The United States shifted its climate change policy towards voluntary initiatives to reduce greenhouse gas emissions after President George W. Bush rejected mandatory emissions reductions under the Kyoto Protocol. In 2005, the Senate passed a resolution calling for legislation to establish a market-based program to slow, stop, and reverse greenhouse gas growth without harming the economy. Congressional proposals in the 110th Congress focused on monitoring emissions and enacting market-oriented reduction programs. The report focuses on enacting market-oriented greenhouse gas reduction programs, specifically discussing two bills: S. 1766 and S. 2191. It is recommended to consult a more comprehensive report on the costs and benefits of S. 2191. S. 1766, introduced by Senators Bingaman and Specter in July 2007, aims to set emissions targets on most of the country's greenhouse gas emissions. Covered entities would face emissions limits starting in 2012, with targets set at 2006 levels in 2020 and declining steadily until 2030. Compliance can be achieved through a trading program or by paying a Technology Accelerator Payment (TAP). Initially, 24% of allowances are auctioned, with the TAP set at a safety valve price. The TAP is set at $12 per metric ton of carbon dioxide equivalent in 2012, increasing 5% annually above the rate of inflation. S. 2191, introduced by Senators Lieberman and Warner, covers emissions from various sources including petroleum producers, facilities producing fluorinated chemicals, and facilities using coal or natural gas. Countries without comparable emissions control measures must submit special allowances for imports into the United States. S. 2191 aims to reduce U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by 19% below 2005 levels by 2020 and 63% below by 2050. It establishes a Carbon Market Efficiency Board and requires special allowances for imports from countries without emissions control measures. The amendment to S. 3036 sets aside auctioned revenues for deficit reduction. Senator Boxer introduced S. 3036, identical to S. 2191 with the deficit reduction amendment. The Senate invoked cloture on S. 3036 on June 2, 2008. Two studies compare S. 1766 and S. 2191 under the same conditions, conducted by the EPA. The report focuses on three models: ADAGE, IGEM, and IPM, along with two basecases. The models include EPA/ADAGE-REF, EPA/ADAGE-TECH, EPA/IGEM-REF, EPA/IGEM-TECH, and EPA/IPM. Another analysis was done by the Energy Information Administration (EIA). The Energy Information Administration (EIA) conducted a second analysis on the Energy Market and Economic Impacts of S. 2191, the Lieberman-Warner Climate Security Act of 2007, and included an updated analysis of S. 1766. The analysis used EIA's NEMS model, focusing on greenhouse gas emissions reductions under both bills. The spread in projected emissions reductions for S. 2191 is due to emissions growth in parts of the economy not covered by the bill and the use of international allowances or offsets. The use of international credits is evident in the ADAGE estimates. For S. 1766, uncertainties also contribute to the spread, although international credits were not included in the analysis. The TAP (safety valve) is increasingly used by covered entities after 2030, preventing emissions from meeting the bill's targets. Figures 3 and 4 show estimated GDP per capita. The estimated GDP per capita under S. 1766 and S. 2191 shows a range of 62% to 81% increase between 2010 and 2030 in the base cases. The economy continues to grow under both bills, albeit at a slightly slower rate than their respective reference cases. The variability between the base cases and model results is minimal, as shown in Figures 3 and 4. Figure 5 and Figure 6 present the relative percentage reduction in GDP per capita for the two bills. The estimated allowance prices for S. 1766 and S. 2191 show that S. 1766's TAP price controls costs, while prices for S. 2191 gradually increase over time. The EIA/NEMS case for S. 2191 extends to 2050 with a 5 billion allowance bank by 2030. In contrast, S. 1766 exhausts its bank by 2030, leading covered entities to make TAP payments instead of further reductions. Both bills would conduct auctions. Both S. 2191 and S. 1766 would auction a significant portion of allowances, with S. 2191 allocating more allowances for auction and having higher prices. S. 2191 would auction a larger share of allowances in later years compared to S. 1766. The estimated auction revenues based on allowance prices show a significant difference between the two bills. The EPA/ADAGE-TECH case presents the lowest allowance price for S. 2191, while S. 1766 allowance prices are near the TAP price. CRS presents auction revenues only until 2030 due to S. 1766 requiring a new vote to continue beyond that year. The TAP becomes the dominant compliance strategy after 2030, suggesting a reassessment may be needed. S. 1766 and S. 2191 offer different approaches to controlling emissions through market-based mechanisms. S. 2191 leans towards quantity side, while S. 1766 leans towards price side. S. 2191 has more certain emission reductions. Key uncertainty sources for S. 2191 include the number of covered entities. S. 2191 covers about 85% of the country's greenhouse gas emissions and relies on international allowances to meet reduction requirements. Uncertainties include the availability of international credits and the safety valve. The bank is exhausted as the program nears 2030, leading to covered entities making TAP payments. This results in emissions exceeding the bill's target due to the TAP price becoming the allowance price over time. The TAP price is a separate compliance strategy from cap-and-trade, impacting actual emissions reduction based on the interplay between allowance and TAP prices. Unlimited international credits could keep allowance prices below the TAP price, as projected emissions do not go beyond 2030. The sensitivity analyses from EIA's previous analysis did not result in an allowance price below the TAP price in 2030. Updating the sensitivity analyses to the 2008 AEO baseline could potentially change this outcome. The projected cost effects under S. 2191 are more uncertain compared to S. 1766, with a major source of uncertainty being future business-as-usual growth in greenhouse gas emissions by covered entities. The stricter cap on emissions in S. 2191 could lead to higher costs if emissions need to be offset due to economic growth. The cost estimates for S. 2191 are influenced by uncertainties related to allowance prices, availability of cost-effective energy efficiency improvements, non-CO2 greenhouse gas reductions, carbon capture technology, and international allowances. Limiting options for emissions reductions and new technology can increase projected costs. Incentives and funding for new technology are essential for achieving a least-cost solution through a market-based allowance trading system. The cost estimates for S. 2191 are influenced by uncertainties related to allowance prices, availability of cost-effective energy efficiency improvements, non-CO2 greenhouse gas reductions, carbon capture technology, and international allowances. Incentives and funding for new technology are critical for its success. S. 1766 cost estimates are less sensitive and target fewer emission reductions, resulting in lower costs. The TAP price is projected to be the dominant compliance strategy. The impact of the bills on projected 2030 electric generation is illustrated in Table 2. The need for low-carbon electric generation is evident in the comparison between nuclear power, renewables, and coal-fired capacity with CCS under S. 2191. The amount of capacity to be built depends on future supply and demand, consumer response to rising prices, and incentives. EPA/IPM estimates that more capacity would be retired under S. 2191 compared to S. 1766, with historical context provided. Between 1966 and 1984, the United States added 464 GW of generating capacity, including coal, hydropower, natural gas, oil, and peaking capacity. There were also conversions between coal and oil-fired generating units during this period. In more recent years, from 2001 to 2005, the US added 180 GW of new capacity, mostly natural gas-fired. The projected cost of S. 1766 is influenced by the availability of cost-effective control measures. The projected cost of S. 1766 is influenced by the availability of cost-effective control measures, such as energy efficiency improvements, non-CO2 greenhouse gas reductions, carbon capture and storage technology, and cost-effective international credits. S. 1766 does not represent a significant shift in generation supply compared to S. 2191, with stable coal production for electricity generation. S. 1766's safety valve caps the upside risk of costs, ensuring lower costs than S. 2191. S. 1766's safety valve sets a strict upper limit on compliance costs at $12 a ton, increasing 5% annually in real terms. It aims to bound the costs of any climate change control program while allowing the marketplace to determine the economically efficient solution for emissions reduction. The program sets emissions limits and lets the marketplace determine permit values. A carbon tax or safety valve sets maximum cost for reducing emissions. Preference for tradeable permits or safety valve depends on views of cost uncertainty and benefits. Tradeable permits may be suitable for those confident in achieving greenhouse gas reduction with significant benefits. In a tradeable permit program, emission reduction efforts concentrate at sources where controls can be achieved at least cost. Including a safety valve caps the marginal cost of control that affected entities would pay, but the level of greenhouse gas reductions achieved is less certain. Emitters would spend money controlling emissions up to the safety valve level. The proposals S. 1766 and S. 2191 aim to limit greenhouse gas emissions through market-based systems. S. 2191 would establish an absolute cap on emissions and allow trading, while S. 1766 would set emissions targets and offer a safety valve payment option. Both proposals would likely result in lower emissions than business as usual, with S. 2191 guaranteeing reductions. S. 2191 is projected to have larger reductions in emissions over the long-term compared to S. 1766, which is likely to have lower and more predictable costs. The key policy question is whether to prioritize economic costs with some uncertainty in emission reductions (safety valve) or achieving specific reduction levels efficiently without caps (tradeable permits). S. 2191 focuses on total emissions, while S. 1766 leans towards price control."
