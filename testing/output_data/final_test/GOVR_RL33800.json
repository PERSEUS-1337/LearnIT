    "content": "The Clean Water Act, enacted in 1972, aims to restore and maintain the integrity of the nation's waters by regulating pollution from both point and nonpoint sources. Despite progress, water quality issues persist, including runoff from farms, cities, and industrial discharges. The Clean Water Act of 1972 aims to eliminate pollution and achieve zero discharge of pollutants, with federal financial assistance for wastewater treatment plant construction. The Environmental Protection Agency administers federal programs, while state and local governments enforce CWA regulations. Goals include making waters \"fishable and swimmable\" by 1983 and eliminating pollutant discharge by 1985, although full achievement has not been reached. Progress has been made in controlling conventional pollutants like suspended solids and bacteria. Progress has been mixed in controlling discharges of toxic pollutants (heavy metals, inorganic and organic chemicals), which can harm human health and the environment even in small amounts. Efforts to control nonpoint source pollution from urban, suburban, and agricultural areas are more recent. Data from EPA and states show that a significant percentage of river and stream miles and lake acres do not meet water quality standards. EPA issued an assessment of streams and small water bodies in 2006. In 2006, EPA reported that 67% of U.S. stream miles are in poor or fair condition, with nutrients and streambed sediments having the largest impact. There are fish-consumption advisories for 95,000 lakes and 544,000 river miles in the U.S. due to chemical contaminants. Mercury contamination is a growing concern, with 45 states issuing advisories for elevated levels. The Water Quality Act of 1987 was the last major amendment to the law. The Clean Water Act underwent comprehensive amendments in 1987, extending and revising the act significantly. Despite some authorizations expiring in the early 1990s, Congress has continued to appropriate funds for the programs. The act has been successful in achieving its goals, but there is debate over the costs and benefits of further actions. Criticism of the Clean Water Act has come from industry, developers, property rights groups, states, and cities, with concerns about costs and new regulations. Environmental groups advocate for further adjustments to maintain progress. Legislative activity was minimal until the 104th Congress in 1995. Legislative activity for the Clean Water Act was active until the 104th Congress in 1995. A comprehensive reauthorization bill, H.R. 961, was passed by the House but not taken up by the Senate. The bill aimed to amend regulatory provisions, require new risk assessment procedures, and increase flexibility with regulatory relief. Critics argued that the bill would weaken protections for U.S. waters. Since then, no comprehensive reauthorization legislation has been introduced, but specific water quality bills have been enacted starting from the 106th Congress. The 107th Congress passed bills to strengthen protection of coastal recreation waters and reauthorized existing Clean Water Act programs. The Great Lakes Legacy Act was enacted to remediate sediment contamination in the Great Lakes. The 108th Congress extended the National Estuary Program. The 109th Congress enacted legislation to extend the National Estuary Program through FY2010, authorizing funding for specific programs like Long Island Sound and Lake Pontchartrain Basin. President Bush signed these bills into law in December 2005 and November 2006. The main issue during this time was water infrastructure financing for municipal wastewater treatment projects. During the 110th Congress, various bills on Clean Water Act (CWA) programs were discussed, including water infrastructure funding, wetlands protection, vessel wastewater discharge regulation, and the Great Lakes Legacy Act extension. Controversies have prevented the enactment of bills authorizing financial assistance for municipal wastewater treatment projects. The 110th Congress discussed bills on Clean Water Act programs, including water infrastructure funding, wetlands protection, vessel wastewater discharge regulation, and the Great Lakes Legacy Act extension. Other issues addressed were stormwater discharges, sewer overflow management, wastewater security, nonpoint source pollution, and waste discharge from animal feeding operations. Observers note progress but acknowledge significant water pollution problems persist, with debates on necessary solutions and potential new legislation. Efforts to amend the Clean Water Act have stalled as interests debate changes, facing tradeoffs between economic impacts, scientific uncertainty, and governmental responsibilities. Congress focuses on narrow bills to extend or modify selected CWA programs instead of comprehensive proposals. The 110th Congress is anticipated to focus on oversight of clean water and other environmental programs, with a particular legislative focus on water infrastructure financing legislation. Congressional attention has shifted to security, terrorism, and Iraq war issues since the 2006 mid-term elections. The 110th Congress is focusing on oversight of clean water and environmental programs, with a legislative focus on water infrastructure financing. Key issues include reauthorization of the financial aid program, geographic reach of the Clean Water Act, stormwater and nonpoint source pollution management, animal feeding operation waste discharges, and court rulings on discharge permit requirements. Building and upgrading wastewater infrastructure is crucial for achieving water quality objectives under the Clean Water Act. The Clean Water Act's program provides financial aid for municipal wastewater treatment plant construction to achieve water quality objectives. Congress has allocated over $78 billion since 1972, with additional funding needs estimated at $202.5 billion nationwide. Aging infrastructure and treatment issues contribute to the increased funding requirements. The EPA reported increased funding needs for wastewater infrastructure due to aging infrastructure, meeting water quality standards, handling wet weather flows, and stormwater management. The estimate includes $134.4 billion for wastewater treatment, $54.8 billion for sewer overflow corrections, $9 billion for stormwater management, and $4.3 billion for recycled water distribution systems. Funding for security issues, growth-related needs, and climate change adaptation is not explicitly included in the estimate. The EPA released a study called the Gap Analysis in 2002, estimating that the US needs $390 billion for wastewater infrastructure over the next two decades. An additional $148 billion is needed for operation and maintenance. Without increased investment, there will be a $6 billion gap between current and projected spending. A 3% annual increase in wastewater spending could reduce this gap. The federal role in assisting states and cities with wastewater infrastructure funding has been a topic of debate. The 1987 amendments to the act introduced grants for sewage treatment projects and State Water Pollution Control Revolving Funds. States must deposit at least 20% of the federal capitalization grant into the revolving fund. This program aims to address the projected funding needs for wastewater treatment construction. Under the revolving fund concept, monies used for wastewater treatment construction would be repaid by loan recipients to the states, to be recycled for future construction in other communities, providing ongoing financing. Federal contributions to State Revolving Funds (SRFs) were expected to help transition to full state and local financing by FY1995. However, early funding and administrative issues, along with large funding needs, have delayed the shift to full state responsibility. SRF issues have been prominent in Clean Water Act reauthorization discussions. SRF monies can be used for various activities, including providing loans for up to 100% of project costs at or below market interest rates. The State Revolving Fund (SRF) program provides loans, loan guarantees, and credit enhancements for cities' debt obligations. States use SRF monies to fund projects that meet environmental standards and enforceable requirements. The program has assisted over 8,650 nonpoint management projects with $2.6 billion in funding. States have established mechanisms to administer the loan programs and receive SRF capitalization funds. The SRF program, funded under Title VI, has faced criticism for being overly complex due to federal rules, despite Congress intending for states to have more flexibility. Congressional oversight has focused on reducing the backlog of wastewater treatment facilities to meet water quality objectives. The SRF program has received continued support from Congress, providing an average of $1.35 billion annually for state capitalization grants. The SRF program has faced criticism for being complex despite Congress intending for states to have flexibility. Funding has been declining since FY2005, with small communities struggling to participate due to limited resources. Congress is interested in addressing the needs of small towns through a grant program or special loan rules. The EPA estimates that the cost of projects to control sewer overflows and manage stormwater runoff nationwide is nearly $64 billion. Wastewater utilities are seeking assistance to assess vulnerabilities and upgrade physical protection against possible terrorist attacks on water infrastructure systems. The EPA's principal water infrastructure initiative focuses on supporting responses to ensure investment needs are met efficiently and equitably. Since 2003, the EPA has promoted the Four Pillars of Sustainable Infrastructure, emphasizing better management, full-cost pricing, efficient water use, and watershed protection. Additionally, the agency is working with water utilities on a Sustainable Infrastructure Leadership Initiative. The EPA is partnering with water utilities to promote the Four Pillars of Sustainable Infrastructure, aiming to find new ways to ensure sustainability in the water and wastewater industries. They are encouraging full-cost pricing, water metering, conservation measures, and the use of water-efficient products to reduce national water and wastewater infrastructure needs. Congress has addressed water infrastructure funding issues, including extending the SRF program and increasing federal support. House and Senate committees approved bills to extend the SRF program and increase federal assistance, but neither bill progressed further due to controversies over prevailing wage requirements and SRF grant allocation formulas. The Davis-Bacon Act's applicability to SRF-funded projects has been a longstanding issue, with critics arguing it raises costs and hampers competition, while supporters believe it stabilizes the local construction industry. In 1987, the Davis-Bacon Act applied to \"first use\" monies from the SRF program, but expired in FY1994. The issue now is whether to restore these requirements. In the 108th Congress, bills were introduced to reauthorize the Clean Water Act SRF program and funding for sewer overflow grants. In October 2004, legislation was reported authorizing $41.25 billion over five years for wastewater and drinking water infrastructure programs. The Senate committee approved $20 billion for the clean water SRF program, with new allocation formulas and provisions for disadvantaged communities. House legislation similar to H.R. 3930 was not further acted upon. Disputes over funding allocation formulas and Administration opposition to authorization levels clouded the bills in the 109th Congress. The Senate Environment and Public Works Committee approved S. 1400, the Water Infrastructure Financing Act, in the 109th Congress, authorizing $20 billion for Clean Water Act SRFs and $15 billion for Safe Drinking Water Act SRFs through FY2010. The bill included revisions to the funding allocation formulas and prevailing wage requirements. Interest has been growing in new mechanisms to fund water infrastructure projects beyond federal grants or SRFs. The House Transportation and Infrastructure Subcommittee on Water Resources and Environment discussed alternative means to fund water infrastructure projects, including creating a national clean water trust fund and exploring other financing options like tax-exempt private activity bonds. Witnesses and members addressed challenges in identifying fair revenue sources. In the 109th Congress, legislation was introduced for a $7.5 billion federal trust fund for wastewater infrastructure improvements, using a concept supported by industry officials and environmentalists. The bill proposed user fees to create the fund, but Congress did not act on it. In the 110th Congress, the House passed the Water Quality Financing Act of 2007, but the Senate did not take action. The Water Quality Financing Act of 2007 (H.R. 720) authorizes $14 billion for the clean water SRF program for FY2008-FY2011. It includes provisions to benefit economically disadvantaged communities, such as extended loan repayments and additional subsidies. The bill also requires communities to plan for capital replacement needs and develop asset management plans for infrastructure maintenance. H.R. 720 authorizes $14 billion for the clean water SRF program for FY2008-FY2011. It includes provisions for economically disadvantaged communities, such as extended loan repayments and subsidies. The bill specifies that the Davis-Bacon Act prevailing wage requirement applies to projects financed through the SRF. Amendments to delete this requirement and request a GAO study were defeated. The bill also requests a GAO report on alternative funding mechanisms for water infrastructure and a clean water trust fund. Amendments adopted include directing EPA to study U.S. and Canadian wastewater discharges to the Great Lakes and states to prioritize funding for existing needs. H.R. 569 and H.R. 700 reauthorize Clean Water Act sections for sewer overflow projects and alternative water source development. The House passed both bills in March 2007, allocating $1.7 billion and $125 million respectively. The Senate discussed wastewater infrastructure needs in 2007 and financing issues in 2008. The committee approved the Water Infrastructure Financing Act (S. 3617) in September 2008, authorizing $20 billion for Clean Water Act SRF grants and $15 billion for Safe Drinking Water Act SRF grants through FY2012. The bill expands eligibility for clean water SRF assistance to include projects like stormwater management and water conservation. It also allows SRF assistance for private wastewater treatment systems and includes provisions to benefit small or economically disadvantaged communities. The committee approved an amendment adding Davis-Bacon Act language similar to that in House-passed H.R. 720, specifying prevailing wage requirements for projects financed through an SRF. The regulation of activities in wetlands under the CWA, particularly Section 404's permit program, has become a contentious environmental policy issue. Landowners or developers must obtain permits for disposal of material into navigable waters, including wetlands. The Section 404 regulatory program under the Clean Water Act is a key federal tool for wetlands protection, administered by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Other federal agencies like the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and Natural Resource Conservation Service play limited roles in permitting decisions. Tension exists between wetlands regulation under Section 404 and related laws. Conflicts over wetlands regulation have mainly occurred in administrative proceedings due to the lack of amendments to Section 404 since 1977. Controversies include the extent of federal jurisdiction, impacts on private property, permit procedures' burdens and delays, and the roles of federal agencies and states in issuing permits. One contentious issue is whether isolated waters should fall under Section 404 jurisdiction, as they may not provide all the values typically associated with wetlands. The Supreme Court ruling in SWANCC v. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers questioned the authority of the Corps and EPA over isolated waters under the Clean Water Act. The decision highlighted the uncertainty surrounding regulatory protection of wetlands post-SWANCC, with differing interpretations in subsequent court cases. The SWANCC decision has impacted the protection of wetlands, shifting responsibility to states and localities. Environmentalists criticize the Court's interpretation of congressional intent, while industry groups support the ruling. The extent of federal regulation restrictions post-SWANCC varies depending on how broadly the decision is applied. Some courts interpret it narrowly, limiting its impact on permit rules, while others interpret it more broadly. The EPA-Corps guidance issued in 2003 takes a narrow reading, allowing federal regulation of some isolated waters to continue with more headquarters review in disputed cases. The government's commitment to \"no-net-loss\" wetlands policy is demonstrated through the EPA-Corps guidance issued in 2003, which allows federal regulation of some isolated waters to continue with more headquarters review in disputed cases. An advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPRM) was also issued to seek comments on defining waters under regulatory jurisdiction, indicating possible modifications to Clean Water Act rules to limit federal jurisdiction further. Environmentalists and many states oppose changing any rules, advocating for a broad interpretation of the Clean Water Act. In December 2003, the EPA and the Corps announced they would not pursue rule changes on federal regulatory jurisdiction over isolated wetlands, avoiding a contentious debate. Environmentalists and state representatives expressed relief at the decision, while interest groups criticized the confusion in implementing the 2003 guidance. Federal courts continue to play a key role in interpreting the reach of the SWANCC decision. Interpretations of wetland rules continue, with federal courts playing a key role in clarifying the SWANCC decision. The Supreme Court heard arguments in cases seeking to narrow the scope of the CWA permit program for wetland development. The Court's ruling in Rapanos v. United States brought some clarity on the reach of federal jurisdiction. In Rapanos v. United States, a 5-4 decision led by Justice Scalia held that the lower court applied an incorrect standard to determine wetlands covered by the CWA. Justice Kennedy joined the decision to vacate lower court rulings and remand the cases for further consideration. The ruling's implications are unclear, leading to more case-by-case determinations and potential pressure on the Corps and EPA to clarify issues through rulemaking. The EPA and Corps issued guidance in response to the Rapanos ruling, clarifying CWA jurisdiction. They will assert regulatory jurisdiction over certain waters, like traditional navigable waters and adjacent wetlands. Other waters will be determined on a case-by-case basis to establish a significant nexus with traditional navigable waters. The guidance does not aim to change CWA jurisdiction and does not override previous guidance on isolated wetlands. The EPA and Corps issued guidance in response to the Rapanos ruling, clarifying CWA jurisdiction by nullifying the 2003 guidance on isolated wetlands. The 2007 guidance provides clarity on jurisdictional determinations for non-navigable tributaries and adjacent wetlands, but legal challenges are expected to continue. Public comments were solicited for six months, with potential changes based on feedback. The government responded to the SWANCC decision with guidance that led to inconsistent regulatory decisions. Corps and EPA officials testified on their efforts to develop guidance, released in January 2003. Concern over lingering confusion and criticism from developers and the regulated community followed. Hearings were held by the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee and a House Transportation and Infrastructure subcommittee on post-SWANCC issues. In March 2004, the House Transportation and Infrastructure subcommittee held a hearing on post-SWANCC issues. Controversies surround the 2003 SWANCC guidance, with an amendment in May 2006 aiming to prevent EPA from implementing it. Supporters argued that the guidance exceeded the Supreme Court's requirements, leaving many streams and wetlands vulnerable to development. Opponents feared it would complicate regulatory efforts. Congress adjourned without finalizing the bill. Legislation in the 110th Congress aimed to overturn SWANCC and Rapanos decisions by defining \"waters of the United States\" broadly. Legislation introduced in various Congresses aimed to define \"waters of the United States\" broadly. The Rapanos and Carabell cases raised uncertainties about federal jurisdiction over wetlands and waters, leading to congressional hearings. The SWANCC and Rapanos rulings remain controversial. The Senate held hearings on issues related to the Rapanos ruling and legislation on CWA jurisdiction. Proponents argue for clarifying Congress's intent, while critics question the constitutionality and potential expansion of federal authority. Uncertainty surrounds the legislation's prospects due to differing interpretations by agencies and courts. The court ruling on regulation of ballast water, used by ships for stability, has raised concerns. Environmental groups sued EPA to rescind the exemption for ballast water under the Clean Water Act. A federal district court ruled in favor of the groups, requiring EPA to issue permits for ballast water discharge by September 30, 2008. The court ruling on regulation of ballast water, used by ships for stability, has raised concerns. The EPA was required to issue permits for vessel discharges, including gray water, ballast water, and bilge water, by September 30, 2008. The district court's ruling was upheld on July 23, with the deadline extended to December 19, 2008. The EPA initiated efforts to comply with the court's mandate, anticipating a potential unsuccessful appeal. Legislation clarification was suggested due to the appeal timeline uncertainty. Up to 13 million recreational boats and 98,000 commercial vessels could be affected. In response to concerns over potential impacts on vessels, Congress passed two bills in the 110th Congress to exempt vessels from Clean Water Act permit requirements. One bill exempts recreational boats and requires EPA to develop management practices for incidental discharges. The other bill provides a two-year permit moratorium for fishing vessels and smaller vessels, requiring EPA to evaluate the impact of incidental discharges. On June 17, EPA proposed two CWA general permits for vessels, one for recreational vessels under 79 feet and another for commercial and large recreational vessels. Legislation was considered in the 110th Congress to address aquatic nuisance species from ballast water. S. 2766 and S. 3298 exempted recreational boats from permit requirements, but up to 50,000 large commercial vessels still need to comply. Some groups oppose the bills as they would preempt states from enacting stricter ballast water management programs. The Great Lakes Legacy Act of 2002 amended the CWA to address contaminated sediments in the Great Lakes, allowing funds for monitoring and remediation. Concerns over slow progress and limited funding for remedial actions led to the enactment of this legislation. The 110th Congress enacted legislation (H.R. 6460) to extend authorizations for the Great Lakes Legacy Act, allowing for continued funding at $50 million per year through FY2010. The new legislation includes procedural changes to speed up cleanup efforts and allows for habitat restoration. President Bush signed the bill into law on October 8, 2008 (P.L. 110-365). Other issues related to the Clean Water Act were also addressed during this time. The BEACH Act aimed to improve water quality standards for coastal recreation waters, including the Great Lakes. Despite most provisions being implemented, the EPA had not yet published new criteria by 2005 as required. Several bills were introduced in Congress to extend funding for BEACH grants, with the House approving H.R. 2537 in April 2008. The House approved H.R. 2537 in April 2008, allowing states to use BEACH Act funds for pollution tracking and rapid testing of beach water. The bill increased grant funds to $40 million annually and directed EPA to publish revised water quality criteria for pathogens. The Senate introduced companion legislation, S. 2844, with authorized grant funds of $60 million per year, but no further action was taken. EPA has faced challenges regulating stormwater discharges since the 1970s. Regulations were established by Congress in P.L. 100-4 to address the contamination in stormwater discharges, including pollutants like oil, grease, heavy metals, and pesticides. EPA issued rules in 1990 for Phase I of the program, requiring permits for industries, municipalities, and construction sites over 5 acres. Rules for smaller stormwater dischargers were developed with stakeholder input starting in 1994. In 1994, rules were developed for regulating smaller stormwater dischargers not covered by the 1990 rules. Phase II of the program, issued in October 1999, posed compliance challenges for industries and municipalities, especially small cities. A GAO report in May 2007 found delays in permit issuance, with almost 11% of communities not permitted by fall 2006. GAO concluded that it is too early to assess the overall burden of the regulatory program. GAO found methodological and data problems with EPA's estimates of program costs, making it difficult to assess the stormwater program's overall burden. Municipalities' reports to EPA were limited and inconsistent. Congress addressed stormwater issues in omnibus energy legislation. EPA extended compliance deadlines for small construction sites, including small oil and gas sites, to assess economic impact. Congress enacted a legislative solution in Section 323. In 2006, Congress enacted Section 323 of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (P.L. 109-58) to provide a permanent exemption from stormwater runoff rules for oil and gas construction sites. The provision aims to reduce costly permitting requirements for drilling sites with minimal stormwater runoff pollution potential. Critics argue that this provision, applicable to all oil and gas development sites, lacks evidence of pollution reduction compared to other industries. In July 2005, Congress passed legislation with an oil and gas stormwater provision, signed into law by President Bush in August 2005. EPA issued a rule in June 2006 exempting oil and gas construction activities from CWA permits, including sediment-laden stormwater discharges. Environmental groups challenged the rule, leading to a federal court ruling in May 2008 that vacated the regulation. A total of 772 municipalities have combined sewers serving approximately 40 million people in older urban and coastal cities. Combined sewer overflow (CSO) occurs when the system is overwhelmed by rainwater or snowmelt, leading to direct discharge into waterways. EPA's rule exempting oil and gas construction activities from CWA permits was vacated in May 2008. EPA has not indicated how it will respond to the vacatur of the rule. Combined sewer systems in urban areas often discharge untreated sewage, industrial wastes, and stormwater into waterways during heavy rain or snowmelt. EPA implemented a CSO permitting strategy in 1994, requiring cities to adopt minimum controls by 1997 to address the issue. These controls include proper maintenance programs and pollution prevention measures. Only about half of the cities have complied with these requirements as of 1998. EPA has been working with states to remind cities of their obligations to address CSO problems, but a formal enforcement strategy is not planned. Some cities also face issues with overflows from separate sanitary sewers, which can discharge untreated sewage due to various infrastructure issues. EPA estimates that around 18,000 municipalities with separate sanitary sewers may experience overflows under certain circumstances, but there is currently no explicit control policy in place. EPA convened a stakeholders' group in 1995 to discuss how to address these overflows. In 1995, EPA convened stakeholders to address overflows with high environmental and health risks. The Clinton Administration proposed regulations in 2001 to improve municipal sewer systems and clarify SSO discharges. The proposal was not finalized by the Bush Administration, which is still considering SSO policy issues. Funding for CSO and SSO projects is a major concern, with Congress passing legislation in 2000 for a grants program to reduce wet weather flows. The Quality Act authorized a $1.5 billion grants program to reduce wet weather flows from municipal sewer systems, but no appropriations were provided during the two-year authorization period. In March 2007, the House passed legislation to reauthorize the grant program. The 110th Congress also addressed the issue of public notification during sewer overflow events, passing a bill to ensure sewage treatment plants monitor and report discharges of raw sewage. The Senate Environment and Public Works Committee approved S. 2080 with an amendment providing the text of House-passed H.R. 2452, focusing on security, preparedness, and emergency response issues related to water infrastructure facilities. Policymakers have examined legislative options for enhanced security, communication, coordination, and research in the 107th Congress. The House passed legislation (H.R. 5169) authorizing $200 million in grants for security at wastewater treatment plants. Similar legislation (S. 3037) was introduced in the Senate but did not progress. Congress enacted a law (P.L. 107-188) requiring drinking water utilities to assess terrorist attack vulnerabilities and providing $160 million in grants for assessments. In the 108th Congress, the House passed a bill (H.R. 866) for $200 million in grants for wastewater utilities' vulnerability assessments and $20 million for technical assistance. The Senate Environment and Public Works Committee approved a similar bill (S. 1039) but no further action was taken. In the 109th Congress, wastewater security issues were addressed with the approval of S. 2781 by the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. The bill aimed to encourage vulnerability assessments for wastewater utilities and provide $220 million for assessments and security plans. It also addressed concerns raised by a GAO report regarding vulnerabilities in collection systems. S. 2781 aimed to authorize EPA research on vulnerability assessments for wastewater utilities and potential security enhancements. An amendment to require mandatory vulnerability assessments and switching to safer technologies was rejected. Another bill in the 110th Congress, S. 1968, would authorize grants for assessments and security enhancements at treatment plants but saw no action. Prior to 1987, the Clean Water Act focused on controlling pollution from \"point\" sources. Nonpoint pollution has become a significant issue in water quality problems, potentially contributing up to 50% of the nation's water pollution. This type of pollution includes runoff from farm and urban areas, construction sites, forestry, and mining sites. In 1987, Congress added Section 319 to the Clean Water Act to address nonpoint pollution by requiring states to develop programs to control it. Federal grants totaling $400 million were authorized to cover up to 60% of the costs for managing pollution from runoff. Federal grants totaling $400 million were authorized to cover up to 60% of the costs for managing nonpoint source pollution. Concerns have been raised about the effectiveness of the Section 319 program, with some critics questioning the voluntary nature of the program. Funding has become an important issue as states transition from assessment to management of nonpoint pollution. In 1994, EPA estimated that current spending on nonpoint pollution controls is between $750 million and $1.1 billion per year. Adequate funding is crucial for implementing state management plans under Section 319 to control nonpoint source pollution, especially from agricultural activities. Questions have been raised about the efficacy of the 319 grant program and its overlap with farm bill conservation funding. The White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) found that EPA's Section 319 program lacks demonstrated results and recommends shifting focus from agricultural projects to impaired waters. State officials are concerned about OMB's understanding of the program's broader nonpoint pollution control needs. EPA reports identify agricultural activities as the main source of water impairments, with animal feeding operations (AFOs) drawing increased attention for their environmental impacts. AFOs confine livestock and contribute to water runoff issues. Animal feeding operations (AFOs) are agricultural facilities that concentrate livestock and waste, posing risks to water quality. EPA issued regulations in 2002 to address waste discharges from confined animal feeding operations (CAFOs), including requirements for nutrient management plans. Compliance with discharge permits for AFOs has been poor, with outdated regulations acknowledged by EPA. The rules for CAFOs include requirements for nutrient management plans to manage manure application. EPA estimated 15,500 CAFOs would be regulated with a compliance cost of $335 million. Farm groups find the regulations workable, but environmental groups criticize them for not adequately addressing animal waste runoff. A GAO report in January 2003 stated that EPA needs to increase oversight of state regulatory programs for effective implementation. In February 2005, a federal court ruling addressed challenges to the CAFO rule's permitting scheme. The court upheld major parts of the EPA rule, ruling in favor of industry and environmental challenges, and directed EPA to provide further explanations on specific provisions. In response, EPA issued final revisions to the 2003 CAFO rule. Court rulings have impacted the implementation of existing law provisions, particularly on the need for Clean Water Act discharge permits. In 2004, the Supreme Court ruled that transferring polluted water between waterbodies requires a permit under the NPDES program. This decision raised concerns in agricultural areas where water transfers for irrigation occur without permits. Congress has not addressed the ruling, but in 2008, the EPA issued a rule defining water transfers that do not need permits. In 2006, EPA finalized a rule to address the conflict over the regulatory scope of the Clean Water Act (CWA) and the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) related to pesticide use, following federal court decisions requiring CWA permits for aerial pesticide application over U.S. waters. This rule aimed to clarify the requirements for pesticide applicators, including mosquito control districts, concerned about controlling pests like the West Nile virus. In response to recent litigation, EPA promulgated a regulation to clarify when a CWA permit is needed for activities under FIFRA. Legal challenges are ongoing in federal court. Congress has held oversight hearings on this issue and introduced legislation like the Pest Management and Fire Suppression Flexibility Act in the 109th Congress. Clean water funding questions are still being addressed by Congress. Clean water funding questions are being addressed by Congress in the context of appropriations. The President's FY2008 budget requested $687.6 million for clean water SRF grants, with reduced funding for some water quality programs and increased funding for others. H.R. 2643 was passed by the House on June 27, providing FY2008 appropriations for EPA. The House passed H.R. 2643 on June 27, providing FY2008 appropriations for EPA, including $1.125 billion for clean water SRF grants and $175.5 million for water infrastructure project grants. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved companion legislation with higher funding levels for water quality programs, but Congress had not enacted any FY2008 appropriations bills by October 1. In FY2008, Congress did not pass any appropriations bills by October 1. Short-term resolutions were enacted to fund EPA until December 2007. The Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2008 included $689 million for clean water SRF grants and $177 million for earmarked grants. The President's FY2009 budget requested $7.1 billion for EPA programs, 5% less than the previous year. The FY2009 budget requested reductions for water quality programs, including $555 million for the clean water SRF program, a decrease of 20% from FY2008. The budget also proposed cuts for nonpoint pollution management grants and no funding for targeted watershed grants. However, a House Appropriations subcommittee approved a bill with increased funds for clean water SRF capitalization grants and earmarked water infrastructure grants for FY2009. The Consolidated Security, Disaster Assistance, and Continuing Resolution Act, 2009 (P.L. 110-329) provided partial-year funding for EPA and other agencies at FY2008-enacted levels through March 6, 2009. Final action on FY2009 appropriations was expected in early 2009."
