    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Improving Opportunities for Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses Act of 2013\". The definition of a small business concern is consolidated. Section 3(q) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632(q)) is amended to define a small business concern owned and controlled by service-disabled veterans as one where at least 51 percent is owned by service-disabled veterans and the management is controlled by service-disabled veterans or their spouses. The Small Business Act is amended to define a small business concern owned and controlled by service-disabled veterans as one where at least 51 percent is owned by such veterans. Additionally, businesses are required to maintain this ownership percentage even after the death of a service-disabled veteran owner. The surviving spouse of a service-disabled veteran who acquires ownership rights in a small business concern can be treated as the veteran for maintaining the business's status as owned by service-disabled veterans. This treatment lasts until the spouse remarries. The surviving spouse of a service-disabled veteran can maintain ownership rights in a small business concern until the spouse remarries or relinquishes ownership interest. SEC. 3 amends the definition of a small business concern under title 38, United States Code. SEC. 4 gives the Small Business Administration control over verifying ownership and control status of applicants for inclusion in the database of small businesses owned by veterans. The Administrator will take control of the program under section 8127 of title 38, United States Code, including maintenance of the database and verifications. Rules must be made within 270 days of the memorandum of understanding. Failure to do so will result in a delay of exercising authority under section 7(a)(25)(A). The Secretary will reimburse the Small Business Administration for costs incurred under the program for a period of 6 years. Disputes between the Secretary and the Administrator will be resolved by the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. The Secretary will enter into a memorandum of understanding with the Administrator of the Small Business Administration within 180 days."
