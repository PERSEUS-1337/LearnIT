    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Officer Dale Claxton Bullet Resistant Police Protective Equipment Act of 1999\". Congress finds that Officer Dale Claxton of the Cortez, Colorado, Police Department was shot and killed by bullets that passed through the windshield of his police car, highlighting the need for bullet resistant equipment to protect law enforcement officers. Studies show that equipping all officers with such equipment could significantly decrease the number of fatalities in the line of duty. Between 1985 and 1994, 709 law enforcement officers in the United States were feloniously killed, emphasizing the importance of enhancing officer safety. The risk of fatality for law enforcement officers not wearing bullet-resistant equipment is 14 times higher than for those wearing it. Studies show that between 1985 and 1994, bullet-resistant materials saved the lives of over 2,000 officers in the United States. The Executive Committee for Indian Country Law Enforcement Improvements has reported a rise in violent crime in Indian country despite a national decrease, labeling it a \"public safety crisis.\" The purpose of this Act is to save officers' lives by providing them with bullet-resistant equipment and video cameras.
