    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"State Court Interpreter Grant Program Act\". Congress recognizes the importance of court interpreters for individuals with limited English proficiency in judicial proceedings, as highlighted by the significant non-English speaking population in the United States. Qualified court interpreters play a crucial role in ensuring equal access to justice, with specialized skills different from other interpretation settings. The Federal Government's commitment to providing language access in legal settings is emphasized. Executive Order 13166 requires Federal Agencies, including courts, to improve access for persons with limited English proficiency. 29 States are developing court interpreting programs with robust and effective guidelines for recruiting, training, certifying, and funding court interpreters. Federal funding is necessary to encourage, assist, and enhance court interpreter programs in States, regardless of their current stage of development. The State Court Interpreter Program is established under Section 3. The Administrator of the Office of Justice Programs shall make grants to States to help individuals with limited English proficiency access State court proceedings. Grants can also be used to assess regional language demands. States can use grants to assess language demands, develop court interpreter programs, administer language certification exams, recruit and certify interpreters, cover program costs, and engage in related activities as directed by the Attorney General. States must submit an application for the grant, and allotments are based on annual appropriations. The Administrator allocates funds to States with approved applications for court interpreter programs, including a base amount of $100,000 per State, a discretionary allotment of $5,000,000 for States with extraordinary needs, and an additional allotment based on the unallocated balance of funds. The Administrator allocates funds to States for court interpreter programs based on the number of people who speak a language other than English at home in the State compared to all States receiving an allocation. Authorization of appropriations for $15,000,000 annually from 2005 to 2008 to implement the Act."
