    "content": "The United States has a unified inspections operation at the borders, with one inspector responsible for examining people, animals, plants, goods, and cargo upon entry. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) now oversees immigration, customs, and animal and plant health inspections, emphasizing border security as the top priority. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) inspectors are now interchangeable and responsible for all primary inspections, reflecting a significant policy shift. Laws regarding border inspections have been in place since the early days of the United States. Border inspections in the United States have a long history, dating back to the early days of the federal government. The Customs Service was established in 1789 to assess and collect duties on imported goods. Immigration inspections began in 1882, leading to the creation of the Bureau of Immigration in 1891. Plant quarantine and inspection laws were enacted in 1912. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has historically handled plant and animal inspections independently. Today, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) oversees most border inspection functions through the Bureau of Customs and Border Protection (CBP), which includes customs, immigration, and agricultural inspectors. This reorganization of border inspections has been deemed necessary for efficiency. The reorganization of border inspections under DHS aims to streamline procedures with a single chain of command. However, concerns exist that the complexity of inspections may lead to more people and goods being sent to secondary inspections. The report provides an overview of border parameters, statutory basis, and policies for immigration, customs, and agricultural inspections, as well as trends in inspections leading up to the establishment of DHS. Budget and staffing summaries are also included. The report discusses budget and staffing for immigration, customs, and agricultural inspections over the past five years under DHS. It also addresses emerging issues with unified border inspections policies and procedures at the 317 official ports of entry into the United States, where inspectors may have multiple responsibilities across air, land, and sea conveyance types. The merging of agencies into one port of entry definition is still a work in progress according to CBP. CBP reports 216 international airports, 143 seaports, and 115 land POEs. The land border with Canada is 5,525 miles long with 84 land POEs. Over 250,000 people enter the US from Canada daily, with trade exceeding $372 billion in 2003. The Ambassador Bridge sees over 7,000 trucks crossing daily. The southern land border with Mexico spans 1,933 miles and has 25 land POEs, including six in California, six in Arizona, two in New Mexico, and 11 in Texas. Over 800,000 people arrive from Mexico daily, making it the second largest trading partner with total merchandise trade at $220.3 billion in 2003. The POE at Laredo/Nuevo Laredo has the highest volume of trade on the southern border. The US coastline is 12,479 miles long with 143 sea POEs, some of which are commercial ports. Legal boundaries for inspection purposes are flexible and may vary from geographical confines. Border searches may occur at land entry points from Mexico or Canada, at ports where ships dock after foreign travel, and at any US airport receiving international flights. Courts have expanded the definition of \"border\" to combat mobile smuggling. The law allows searches beyond physical borders, including at the \"functional equivalent\" of a border, typically the first practical detention point after crossing or the final port of entry. This exception is justified due to the challenges of detecting smugglers. The border search exception allows for searches at the functional equivalent of a border, such as international airports or ports within the country's territorial waters. The exception may also be extended to allow warrantless searches beyond the border or its functional equivalent. Under the \"extended border search\" doctrine, government officials may conduct warrantless searches beyond the border or its functional equivalent if they have reasonable certainty that a border was crossed, no change in the object of the search has occurred, and there is reasonable suspicion of criminal activity. This three-part test ensures a significant nexus with a border crossing for statutory and constitutional authority. The Homeland Security Act transferred inspection functions to DHS but did not revise the laws authorizing these searches. The Homeland Security Act transferred inspection functions to DHS without revising the laws authorizing these inspections. It is important to understand the legal authorities guiding agricultural, customs, and immigration inspections before and after the transfer. The future consolidation of authorities from legacy agencies remains uncertain under the \"one face at the border\" initiative. The former INS, through the Attorney General, enforced the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952. The Homeland Security Act transferred immigration enforcement authority to the Directorate of Border and Transportation Security, separate from the Immigration and Nationality Act. DHS regulations now vest all immigration enforcement functions in the Secretary of DHS or his delegate, while the Attorney General retains concurrent authority in key areas of immigration law. Immigration officials use various enforcement mechanisms to carry out their mission, including border security, inspections at ports, detaining and removing violators of immigration laws, and providing intelligence. Aliens found in violation of immigration laws are inspected by immigration officers for admission to the United States. If an alien is not clearly entitled to enter, they may be detained pending a final determination by an immigration judge. Immigration officers have the authority to board any conveyance they believe is bringing aliens into the country. Immigration officers in the United States, as defined by the INA, include various CBP and ICE officials authorized to exercise powers specified by the law. The Secretary of DHS can also designate other employees as immigration officers. Section 1357 of Title 8 U.S. Code grants officers the authority to interrogate aliens, make arrests, and conduct inspections without a warrant. The AG has the authority to interrogate aliens, make arrests, conduct searches, board vessels, and administer oaths without a warrant. Section 1357 of Title 8 U.S. Code authorizes INS officers to arrest aliens entering the US in violation of immigration laws, board and search vessels within US territorial waters, and make felony arrests. Officers can also search individuals and their belongings without a warrant. Customs inspectors enforced laws to ensure compliance with U.S. regulations, collect revenues, and prevent smuggling. The HSA transferred customs functions to the DHS, with border activities handled by CBP and interior enforcement by ICE officers. Customs inspectors, now conducted through the CBP, have significant authority to inspect people and merchandise at ports of entry. Federal authority for customs inspections dates back to 1789 and was further expanded in 1866 and the Tariff Act of 1930. Courts have interpreted the law to grant broad authority to customs inspectors to conduct border searches. Customs officers have the authority to inspect vessels, vehicles, merchandise, baggage, and persons at ports of entry. They can use necessary force to ensure compliance and are granted the power to search for duty or prohibited items in baggage of persons arriving in the United States. Customs officers, empowered by Congress under 19 U.S.C. \u00a7482, have the authority to stop, search, and examine vehicles, beasts, persons, trunks, and envelopes suspected of carrying merchandise subject to duty or unlawfully introduced to the United States. They can seize and secure such merchandise for trial if found. Additionally, officers can search and inspect vessels and vehicles within customs waters for compliance. Customs officials in the United States have the authority to search vessels and vehicles within customs waters for duty-related merchandise. Coast Guard officers are considered customs officers and can conduct inspections on the high seas. Regulations allow for the search of persons and baggage, with reporting requirements for goods entering the country. Customs officials in the United States have the authority to search vessels and vehicles within customs waters for duty-related merchandise. Coast Guard officers can also conduct inspections on the high seas. There are reporting requirements for goods entering the country, and the Customs Service inspects shipments to ensure compliance with laws. Agriculture inspectors play a role in ensuring a safe food supply by conducting inspections at ports of entry. The Department of Agriculture's import and entry inspection activities have been transferred to the DHS. The Under Secretary for Border and Transportation Security is responsible for conducting agricultural inspections at ports of entry in accordance with various animal and plant protection laws transferred to the DHS. Agriculture inspectors enforce laws such as the Virus-Serum-Toxin Act, the Honeybee Act, the Federal Seed Act, the Plant Protection Act, the Animal Health Protection Act, the Lacey Act Amendments, and the Endangered Species Act. They have the authority to conduct warrantless searches in some cases. Agriculture inspectors have the authority to conduct warrantless searches of any person or conveyance entering the country under various laws such as the Plant Protection Act, Animal Health Protection Act, Lacey Act, and Endangered Species Act. They can detain vessels, vehicles, aircraft, packages, crates, and containers for inspection upon arrival in the United States. The HSA reorganized border inspections but did not change this authority. The HSA reorganized border inspections but did not make significant changes in policies and practices. Congress had already strengthened anti-terrorism provisions before the establishment of CBP. Various statutory revisions were in place for antiterrorism and border security. US-VISIT was first required in 1996, and further measures were enacted after the 9/11 attacks to improve terrorist detection capabilities. CBP inspectors have enhanced terrorist detection capabilities and are responsible for enforcing immigration laws. Having a visa does not guarantee entry into the US, as all travelers are subject to inspection to determine admissibility. Immigration officers have the authority to question individuals and search their belongings without a warrant. Immigration inspectors enforce various statutes, conduct inspections, and adjudicate applications for immigration benefits. Primary inspections involve a brief interview and document check, with suspicious cases referred to secondary inspection. Nonimmigrants are entered into the system at airports and seaports. At airports and seaports, nonimmigrants are entered into the US-VISIT system using biometric identification for identity verification. Secondary inspections involve extensive questioning and document examination, with only a small percentage of travelers subjected to this process. Immigration inspectors consider various factors when deciding if an alien can withdraw their admission application. Prior to the terrorist attacks, immigration officials were allowing over 60% of inadmissible aliens to withdraw their application for admission. However, after the attacks, the percentage dropped to 37% in FY2001 and 34% in FY2002. This process allows aliens to apply for reentry at a later point without penalty. In 1996, Congress enacted the expedited removal policy to target abuses of the asylum process by restricting the hearing, review, and appeal process for aliens at the port of entry. Immigration inspectors can deny admission and order aliens removed if they arrive without proper documentation. Aliens with legal rights to reside in the US are provided with additional procedural protections. Aliens whose visas are revoked by the Department of State are subject to expedited removal, with limited circumstances for review. Deferred Inspections occur when an immediate decision regarding admissibility cannot be made at the port of entry, usually in cases involving arrivals by aircraft. Less than 20,000 travelers are referred to deferred inspections each year. Departure Control is an inspection of travelers departing Guam, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands en route to the continental United States, including crew members. Departure control provides an added level of security to the inspection process for travelers en route to the United States. Immigration officials can prevent the departure of persons if the national interest is at stake. Airline carriers are required to provide electronic passenger manifests to the Attorney General before arriving in or departing from the United States. Passenger manifests are transmitted through the Advance Passenger Information System (APIS), which was created in 1988 in cooperation with various agencies and the airline industry. This system allows immigration officials to perform inspections more efficiently. Automated inspections under the Enhanced Border Security and Visa Entry Reform Act of 2002 allow immigration officials to inspect travelers before their arrival. The former INS program PortPASS, now managed by CBP, provides dedicated commuter lanes for low-risk travelers at land ports of entry. Enrollees in PortPASS are precleared for inspection but may be subject to random searches. Automated inspections under the Enhanced Border Security and Visa Entry Reform Act of 2002 allow immigration officials to inspect travelers before their arrival. The INS Passenger Accelerated Service System (INSPASS) is used at selected international airports for travelers entering the US on certain nonimmigrant visas or under the Visa Waiver Program. The number of travelers using automated inspections has increased, peaking at 2.6 million in FY2002. Mexicans entering the US must have proper immigration documents, including a Mexican \"laser visa\" for short-term entry for business or tourism. Mexican citizens can obtain a laser visa from the Department of State for multiple entries into the US for business or tourism, valid for at least 10 years. Canadians are waived from documentary requirements for entry, based on various reasons including reciprocity. The southwest border historically received more resources than the northern border. The southwest border historically received more resources than its northern counterpart due to a border patrol strategy implemented in 1994. This strategy aimed to strengthen enforcement of US immigration laws and reduce illegal immigration. Additional resources were also allocated to southwest ports of entry. However, the terrorist attacks shifted focus to the understaffed and under-equipped northern border, leading to legislation for increased staffing and resources. Customs inspections along the northern border aim to ensure efficient flow of legitimate traffic while preventing entry of illegitimate goods or people into the US. They play a crucial role in intercepting terrorists, illegal drugs, and contraband. CBP faces the challenge of balancing security with efficiency. The Customs and Border Protection (CBP) faces the challenge of balancing security with the efficient flow of commercial trade at the border. The commercial import process involves entry documentation filing, inspection, appraisement, and classification. Importers often file entry documents electronically and pay surety bonds to expedite clearance of goods. Importers or their agents must file entry documentation within five working days of the arrival of a shipment at the port of entry. Entry documents include bills of lading, entry forms, invoices, and evidence of the right to make entry. Goods are examined by CBP inspectors for admissibility upon arrival at a port of entry before being released from CBP custody. CBP inspectors ensure merchandise is properly marked to denote country of origin or other special designations required by law. Upon arrival at a port of entry, CBP inspectors examine goods for admissibility, ensuring proper marking for country of origin and other designations. Inspectors may find prohibited articles, discrepancies in invoiced goods, or unpaid duties. Goods are typically released to the importer under bond for potential charges. Duty owed is determined by tariff classification and valuation, with final liability calculated in a process called liquidation. CBP uses targeting mechanisms and inspections to identify high-risk passengers and cargo. Cargo targeting and inspection in customs business is increasingly electronic, with the Automated Broker Interface (ABI) used to track and process commercial goods entering the United States. ABI is a voluntary program for qualified participants to file import data electronically with CBP. Over 96% of entries are filed through ABI. The carrier or shipper must also file manifest information with the port director. The importer or broker uses ABI to file entry documents. The Automated Manifest System (AMS) is used for filing manifest information for commercial goods entering the United States. AMS has variations like Sea or Vessel AMS, Air AMS, and Rail AMS, each with different levels of automation. The most automated is Vessel AMS, while the truck system is the least automated. A risk assessment system called the Automated Targeting System (ATS) flags high-risk shipments for customs inspections based on standardized data from ACS. ATS evaluates and scores shipments using weighted rules derived from experienced personnel's targeting methods. The Automated Targeting System (ATS) scores shipments based on weighted rules from experienced personnel to determine the level of inspection needed. High-risk shipments flagged by ATS are sent to CBP's National Targeting Center (NTC) for further inspection at border terminals. Customs inspections rely on accurate manifest information for timely risk assessment and targeting procedures. Customs requires the electronic submission of cargo manifest data 24 hours before vessel lading at the foreign port, as mandated by the Trade Act of 2002. Advanced electronic manifest rules also apply to air and rail shipments. Customs requires electronic submission of cargo manifest data 24 hours before vessel lading at the foreign port, as mandated by the Trade Act of 2002. Advance manifest regulations also apply to air, rail, and truck shipments entering the United States, with varying time requirements depending on the mode of transportation. The Automated Targeting System (ATS) at the National Targeting Center (NTC) is used to process advance manifests before shipments reach a U.S. port of entry. Modal differences exist in the level of automation in the AMS system, leading to variations in targeting and commercial processing for shipments arriving by truck, railcar, or vessel. Truck cargo entry at the border is the least automated mode, with drivers presenting paper entry documents to CBP inspectors. The inspector reviews the documents, questions the driver, and decides on further inspection. ABI allows for electronic pre-filing of entry documentation for truck shipments, but most carriers do not file manifest information electronically. Automated line release programs like BRASS exist at the northern and southern borders for truck entry. The Border Release Advanced Selectivity System (BRASS) allows drivers to present a pre-assigned bar code, invoice, and manifest for cargo release. The release data is submitted to ACS for entry and entry summary requirements. The Free and Secure Trade (FAST) initiative aims to harmonize inspection and commercial operations at the border for expedited cargo releases. The FAST program allows major importers and carriers to use dedicated inspection lanes for expedited cargo releases. The Container Security Initiative (CSI) was initiated to prevent global containerized cargo from being exploited by terrorists. The Container Security Initiative (CSI) is a program aimed at securing the supply chain by identifying and pre-screening high-risk containers at participating ports before they are loaded onto U.S. bound ships. CSI focuses on developing criteria, pre-screening containers early, using technology for quick screening, and utilizing smart and secure containers. The program targets the top 20 high-volume ports that handle 70% of containers shipped to U.S. seaports, with agreements in place for 19 of these ports as of September 2003. In 2003, 19 out of 20 ports had signed agreements to implement the Container Security Initiative (CSI), with 16 ports actually implementing it. Cargo shipments may undergo secondary inspections for security and trade compliance purposes, which can include document checks, radiation monitoring, x-ray or gamma ray imaging, and physical examination. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) uses non-intrusive inspection (NII) technologies such as x-ray and gamma ray systems, including the Vehicle and Cargo Inspection Systems (VACIS) for inspecting container contents. CBP utilizes various non-intrusive inspection (NII) technologies such as x-ray systems, rail VACIS system, truck x-ray systems, Mobile Sea Container Examinations Systems, and Pallet Gamma Ray System at ports of entry. Canine teams are also deployed to assist in cargo and passenger inspections. In FY2003, NII technology was used for over 4.8 million examinations resulting in 2,190 seizures of narcotics totaling more than 1.1 million pounds. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) utilizes canine teams trained to detect contraband like narcotics, explosives, chemicals, and currency for cargo and passenger inspections. Passenger inspection involves collecting duties on imported items and preventing contraband entry. Individuals entering the US via land border crossings make verbal declarations, while those arriving by air or sea fill out Customs declaration forms with personal information. The Customs declaration form requires personal information and details about the trip, including countries visited and goods being brought into the country. Duty may be assessed on goods exceeding exemption limits. Inspections are conducted based on various factors to determine who needs further scrutiny. Customs inspections involve targeting individuals for more intense scrutiny through secondary inspections, which may include interviews, document reviews, baggage inspections, and personal searches. Advance Passenger Information System (APIS) is used for screening passenger and crew lists for air and sea arrivals, while license plate readers are deployed at land borders to target vehicles and passengers for additional inspection. The primary mission of CBP is to prevent terrorists and terrorist weapons from entering the country, including interdicting prohibited items like illegal drugs, ammunition, firearms, and counterfeit goods. Every person or conveyance crossing the border presents an opportunity for smuggling, as shown in the statistics in Appendix C. License plate readers are used to communicate vehicle license plate data to TECS and NCIC for record matches. CBP has installed license plate readers on the southern and northern borders. During FY2002, Customs officers made 12,570 arrests and seized various items including ammunition, firearms, ecstasy tablets, merchandise, and counterfeit goods. Operational differences between Customs inspections on the northern and southern borders are due to the nature of cross-border traffic. The southern border deals with more pedestrian and personal vehicle traffic, while the northern border handles more commercial traffic. Appendices E and F in the report illustrate these differences. The report highlights operational differences between the northern and southern borders in terms of vehicle crossings and progress on bilateral agreements with Canada and Mexico. For example, in CY2002, 73% of personally operated vehicles entered the US via the southern border, while 27% entered via the northern border. Freight truck crossings were also higher at the northern border, with 61% compared to 39% at the southern border. Rail freight crossings showed a similar trend, with 75% entering via the northern border. The progress report on the United States-Canada Smart Border Declaration and the United States-Mexico Border Partnership accord endorsed by Presidents Bush and Fox included efforts to expedite shipments, harmonize commercial processing, improve container targeting at seaports, and develop intelligent transportation systems. The Department of Homeland Security issued a joint statement on progress achieved on the United States-Mexico Border Partnership, which included a 22-point action plan focusing on customs-related items. Three working groups were established to implement initiatives from the plan, including the Border Working Group, Enforcement Working Group, and Technology and Customs Procedures Working Group. FAST became operational at one commercial crossing along the southern border in El Paso, contributing to national security by preventing the entry of exotic plant and animal pests and diseases. Agricultural inspection at U.S. borders, ports of entry, and off-shore locations has increased since September 11, 2001, focusing on preventing entry of pests and diseases that could be used for bioterrorism. Inspection methods include human examination, X-ray, detector dogs, and document checks for compliance with health and trade agreements. Forbidden fruits and vegetables may introduce plant diseases and pests. Meat products from certain countries can contain animal disease organisms. Foreign meals scraps could contaminate domestic livestock feed sources. Foot and mouth disease can be transmitted through footwear or clothing. Plant and animal disease outbreaks can be costly to eradicate. The transfer of 2,680 APHIS inspectors to CBP accounts for two-thirds of the AQI program's personnel and one-third of APHIS' total staffing. Combining agricultural inspections with other border security activities can increase the number of inspectors monitoring for prohibited agricultural products, but diligence is needed to maintain adequate agricultural inspections amidst customs and immigration concerns. Passenger and cargo inspection procedures at ports of entry utilize a risk assessment approach to identify targets for inspection, enhancing security and facilitating legitimate trade and immigration. Inspectors randomly check passenger baggage and engage in conversations to determine potential agricultural and food product violations based on travelers' point of departure. Passenger inspection procedures focus on identifying high-risk individuals carrying prohibited agricultural products. Inspections are coordinated with other agencies to target potential violators. Inspector dog teams help detect agricultural products without opening individual bags. APHIS uses x-ray technology for screening targeted baggage and conducts pre-clearance inspections for passengers departing Hawaii, Puerto Rico, Bermuda, the Bahamas, Aruba, and certain cities in Canada. This helps to prevent agricultural threats to the mainland and ensures that passengers are inspected before reaching U.S. ports of entry. Cargo shipments are targeted for efficient inspections based on manifest descriptions of the containers at ports of entry and departure ports. Inspectors board various modes of transportation to thoroughly inspect shipments, including off-loading products for a more detailed inspection. Additionally, inspectors examine autoparts or other products arriving in crates or pallets with solid wood packing material that could harbor harmful pests. The USDA oversees fumigation of agricultural cargo at ports of entry and is adapting new technologies for biological agent detection. The RAPID device can identify pathogens in 30 minutes, reducing laboratory time. Pre-clearance of cargo enhances security and reduces border inspector workload. Checking commodities for pests at the source is practical and effective in intercepting destructive pests before transport. APHIS conducts 35 commodity pre-clearance programs overseas to intercept destructive pests before they reach the United States. Importers pay for pre-clearance through user fees. Pre-cleared commodities are less likely to require intensive inspections at the port of entry, although they may be subject to random checks for compliance. Some commodities require treatment before entry. APHIS conducts pre-clearance programs overseas to intercept pests before they reach the US. Some commodities require treatment before entry, such as hot water immersion, cold treatment, and fumigation. Inspectors ensure proper handling and disposal of international trash to prevent harm to US agriculture. A Smuggling Interdiction and Trade Compliance team monitors pathways for prohibited products entering the US. In FY2002, APHIS staff seized 6,000 kilograms of prohibited plant products and 9,000 kilograms of prohibited animal products. Agricultural inspections are uniform at land border crossings with Canada and Mexico, as pests and diseases of concern can enter the US through both borders. Different procedures are necessary for pests and diseases from Canada and Mexico. The differences in border inspections between Canada and Mexico involve various procedures based on risk assessments of pest and disease differentials. Live cattle from Mexico are treated with insecticide, while imports from Canada are currently prohibited due to BSE restrictions. Other related policies include TSA's responsibility for aviation security and USDA's role in plant and animal inspections. DOS also plays a part in border procedures. The Department of State's Bureau of Consular Affairs issues visas for foreign nationals entering the US, while the Department of Health and Human Services sets policies for screening travelers for diseases. Customs initiatives aim to streamline inspections for cargo security. TSA is responsible for airport security, air cargo, and passenger screening to protect air travelers. The TSA's main focus is on protecting air travelers by implementing security measures from curbside to cockpit, supported by intelligence and threat analysis. They use the CAPPS system to assess threats from airline passengers, but the implementation of CAPPS II is facing privacy concerns. TSA is also working on enhancing cargo screening processes to secure 2.8 million tons of cargo on passenger planes and 9.7 million tons on cargo planes annually. The USDA-APHIS retains a significant presence in border inspection activities, with nearly 1,300 AQI employees continuing to conduct certain domestic inspection functions. The USDA-APHIS oversees domestic inspection functions for entry to the mainland from Hawaii and Puerto Rico, sets agricultural inspection policies for DHS border inspectors, provides training, manages data, monitors smuggling, pre-clears commodities, inspects imported material, monitors animals in quarantine, and conducts port activities. They negotiate MOUs with DHS to ensure necessary agricultural inspections are conducted. This separation of duties allows for a consolidated border inspection function with customs and immigration personnel for intelligence and security goals. The USDA-APHIS oversees domestic inspection functions for entry to the mainland from Hawaii and Puerto Rico, sets agricultural inspection policies for DHS border inspectors, and manages data. At ports of entry, FSIS and FDA personnel inspect shipments of food and food products imported into the United States to ensure they meet U.S. standards and do not pose any risk to public health. The Department of Interior Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) inspects international cargo, baggage, passengers, and mail in approved processing facilities to enforce U.S. and international laws on trade in endangered species. Visa procedures for foreign nationals coming to the U.S. involve obtaining visas issued by the Department of State's Bureau of Consular Affairs, with DHS responsible for formulating regulations and USCIS handling immigration services. DHS's USCIS approves immigrant petitions for visas, with documentary requirements stated in \u00c2\u00a7222 of the INA. All aliens seeking visas undergo admissibility reviews by DOS consular officers to ensure eligibility. Background checks are conducted for all visa holders, with machine-readable visas issued by Consular Affairs. Consular Affairs issues machine-readable visas with biometric identifiers required by October 2004. The Centers for Disease Control lead in protection against communicable diseases at the border. A medical examination is mandatory for aliens seeking residency or refugee status, and may be required for nonimmigrant visa applicants. Inadmissibility due to health-related conditions is determined during immigration inspections, with AIDS and certain communicable diseases leading to inadmissibility. Aliens seeking entry into the US are required to have vaccinations against specific diseases as determined by the Secretary of HHS. These diseases include cholera, diphtheria, tuberculosis, plague, smallpox, yellow fever, viral hemorrhagic fevers, SARS, and other vaccine-preventable diseases. CDC officials are not present at the border daily, but quarantine stations in major international airports monitor for ill persons and public health concerns. The CDC trains CBP inspectors to identify potential health risks and collaborates with state and local health officials in affected areas. CBP works with state and local health officials during immigration emergencies and public health threats. They focus on securing high-risk shipments and the entire supply chain through initiatives like C-TPAT, offering expedited processing for compliant importers. Businesses must conduct a self-assessment of supply chain security to participate in C-TPAT. The C-TPAT security guidelines are used to enhance supply chain security. Companies need to submit a security profile questionnaire to CBP and implement security programs in line with C-TPAT guidelines. Border inspections number in the hundreds of millions annually, with passenger inspections peaking in FY2000. Immigration and customs inspectors conducted these inspections before the establishment of CBP. APHIS completed 44 million animal and plant inspections of passengers. In FY2002, APHIS completed 44 million animal and plant inspections of passengers, while CBP reported inspecting 412.8 million passengers in FY2003. Workload trends for immigration, customs, and agricultural inspections are analyzed based on data from legacy agencies. Passenger inspections peaked in FY2000 with 534 million travelers inspected, declining after the September 11, 2001 attacks. Following the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, the number of travelers referred to secondary inspections began to rise, peaking at over 10 million in FY2002. The number of persons denied entry remained steady from FY1998 to FY2002, with less than 1% of all travelers being denied entry. Land ports of entry in Texas and California led in the number of travelers inspected, while New York, Miami, and Los Angeles International Airports accounted for a significant number of air ports of entry travelers. In FY2002, New York, Miami, and Los Angeles International Airports accounted for 32% of all inspections. Land ports of entry, especially those in Texas, California, and Arizona, saw the highest volume of travelers seeking entry into the United States. Southwest border land ports of entry were the busiest, with over 70% of all inspections at the top five busiest ports in FY2002. In FY2002, air ports of entry accounted for 15% of travelers seeking entry to the United States. California's airports had the largest volume of immigration inspections, followed by Florida and New York. Texas, Illinois, and New Jersey also had significant immigration inspections. Prior to the IIRIRA mandate, immigration inspectors at airports collected the I-94 form from aliens to determine their length of stay and immigration classification. The information from the form was later entered into the Non-Immigrant Information System (NIIS). The I-94 form is collected at air ports of entry but rarely upon exit. The implementation of US-VISIT may impact the Non-Immigrant Information System (NIIS). Seaports of entry categorize immigration statistics for seaports and cruise ships, with aliens required to submit an I-94 form. Inspections at seaports and cruise ships accounted for less than 1% of all travelers entering the US in FY2002. Florida has the highest volume of immigration inspections. Florida consistently ranks as the state with the largest volume of immigration inspections at seaports. Alien crew members arriving on vessels must submit an I-94 form prior to arrival. In FY2002, customs inspectors processed cargo valued at $1,183 billion, with most arriving by truck. Railcars and vessels were also used for conveyance. In FY2002, customs inspectors processed cargo valued at $1,183 billion, with most arriving by truck, railcars, and vessels. Commissioner Bonner testified that currently, CBP is inspecting approximately 12.1% of all cargo containers entering the United States, up from 7.6% two years ago. In FY2002, Customs processed a significant amount of cargo, including 770,000 commercial aircraft and 210,000 private aircraft. The top ten US airports by volume of international cargo were Memphis, Los Angeles, Anchorage, Miami, New York, Louisville, Chicago, Indianapolis, Newark, and Atlanta. Additionally, Customs processed 7.3 million vessel cargo containers, with the top 10 US container ports handling 84% of the total volume. Los Angeles was the busiest port, accounting for 21% of the total volume. In FY2002, Customs processed a significant amount of cargo at U.S. seaports. Los Angeles handled the highest volume of TEU's, accounting for 21% of the total. Detroit, Michigan was the busiest land port with 1.7 million trucks crossing, while Laredo, Texas was the busiest POE for truck crossings along the southern border. Northern POEs overall handled more truck crossings than southern POEs. Customs processed 2.4 million railcars in FY2002. The data from FY2000-FY2002 shows railcar crossings at the northern and southern borders, with most crossings being with Canada. Top ports accounted for a high percentage of total crossings at both borders. Appendices include railcar processing data from FY1997-FY2002. APHIS collects inspection data through its Work Accomplishment Data System, with three key statistics for assessing the process. APHIS conducts inspections through detector dogs, x-ray, or visual examination at primary inspection stations. Interceptions involve identifying items with quarantine significance, while violations occur when goods are misrepresented or import rules are violated. APHIS uses a targeted inspection approach, making it misleading to present a ratio of goods or people inspected from all international arrivals. Using intelligence and risk assessment models, APHIS targets higher-risk entrants for inspection, leading to higher interception and violation rates. Preclearance of certain cargo shipments also reduces the need for inspection at ports of entry. APHIS tabulates cargo inspection statistics by bill of lading, making it infeasible to compute an overall ratio of goods inspected. Approximately 2%-3% of targeted passengers and 1%-2% of inspected cargo shipments are found with items of quarantine significance. In FY2002, APHIS inspected 33.8 million passengers entering the US, making 890,000 interceptions of quarantine significance, with a low interception rate of 2.6% due to targeted inspections. Nearly half of inspected aircraft have intercepted items, while 15% of ships and 12% of vehicles contain intercepted items. International mail has a higher interception rate of 3%-8%. Appendices H and I contain inspection statistics compiled by APHIS. In FY2002, APHIS conducted pre-clearance inspections of over 10.5 million passengers, with a low interception rate of about 2%. The rate of interceptions in the pre-clearance program is less than that for passenger inspections at ports of entry, likely due to selected departure points with below-average risk profiles. Additionally, APHIS inspected 953,000 cargo shipments in FY2002, with the number of inspections rising by nearly a third since 1998. In FY2002, APHIS conducted over 10.5 million pre-clearance inspections of passengers with a low interception rate of about 2%. The number of inspections has risen by nearly a third since 1998. Violations doubled between 1998 and 2002, with a small ratio of one-twentieth of 1%. Inspections of international mail for agricultural pests and diseases have remained steady since 1998, with interception and violation rates higher than cargo inspections. In FY2002, APHIS inspected 64,000 ships for agricultural purposes. In FY2002, APHIS conducted inspections on 64,000 ships, with 15% resulting in interceptions for improper handling of garbage and waste. The number of aircraft inspected was 423,000, with a high rate of agricultural pest interceptions. Inspections of vehicles entering the US from Canada and Mexico increased by 60% from 1998 to 2002, totaling 2.9 million inspections. Border inspections conducted by APHIS in FY2002 totaled 2.9 million, resulting in 341,000 interceptions. The interception rate decreased from 15% in 1998 to 12% in 2002. Funding for border security and inspections in FY2004 was $2,496 million, with a request for $2,724 million in FY2005. The House and Senate bills proposed $5.1 billion and $5.0 billion respectively for CBP. Historic funding data for inspections cannot be directly compared across agencies. The funding and staff data presented cannot be totaled for inspections. The number of inspectors grew from FY2001 to FY2003, with more customs inspectors than immigration and agricultural inspectors combined. Prior to the transfer of INS to DHS, funding for salaries and expenses came from various sources. Funding for immigration inspections was appropriated from general revenues, fee receipts, and the Violent Crime Trust Fund. Specific funding for construction projects came from a construction account. The former INS' immigration appropriations account was divided between immigration adjudications and services, and enforcement and border affairs. Funding for immigration inspections had increased in the late 1990s. The funding for immigration inspections includes user fees from aliens entering the US, fines from carriers, and fees from the Examinations Fee Account for processing various immigration benefits. The construction account included appropriations for construction projects for the entire agency, including Customs activities funded by direct appropriations and fee revenue. Prior to the transfer of the U.S. Customs Service to DHS, Congress funded Customs activities from various sources and accounts, with most funding allocated to the Salaries and Expenses account for commercial and enforcement activities. Table 3 shows budget authority for Customs commercial activities from FY1998 to FY2002. The FY1999-FY2003 budget justification materials for CBP included estimates for FY2002 Commercial Activity Appropriation and FTEs. The off-setting receipt revenue from user fees is a significant funding source for customs inspections, with COBRA fees generating $271 million in FY2002 and estimated to reach $288 million in FY2003. The authorization to charge COBRA fees expires on March 1, 2005. CBP collects COBRA fees and merchandise processing fees (MPF) to offset costs. MPF receipts were $955 million in FY2002 and are estimated to be $1,022 million in FY2003. Authorization to charge MPF expires on March 1, 2005. User fees fund agricultural animal and plant health inspections, with primary funding from international air passengers and commercial vehicles. User fees have been authorized since 1990 and continue to be collected by USDA. User fees fund agricultural animal and plant health inspections, with primary funding from international air passengers and commercial vehicles. USDA transfers funds periodically to cover DHS-related costs. User fees are not collected for passengers or cargo entering from Canada or pedestrians and vehicles entering from Mexico. Appropriated funding supports activities at high-volume ports of entry, including pre-departure inspections from Hawaii and Puerto Rico. 80%-85% of AQI funding comes from user fees, with funding levels growing by nearly 90% from FY1998 to FY2002. Staffing levels increased by nearly 43%, and the number of canine inspection teams more than doubled between 1998 and 2002. The number of agricultural inspectors and canine inspection teams significantly increased between 1998 and 2002, with the top five states in staffing being Florida, California, Hawaii, Texas, and New York. These states accounted for two-thirds of the total AQI staffing and canine inspection teams. Top local offices included Miami, Honolulu, Los Angeles, the Citrus Canker Project, New York City/JFK Airport, San Francisco, Chicago/O'Hare Airport, and Elizabeth, NJ. The top 10 offices in FY2002 staffing levels were New York City/JFK Airport, San Francisco, Chicago/O'Hare Airport, Elizabeth, NJ, Kahului-Maui, and Houston. These offices accounted for nearly half of the staffing levels and over half of the canine inspection teams. The creation of CBP under HSA reorganized major border inspections functions. Various issues and concerns have emerged since CBP was established, leading to discussions on policy, administrative, and constitutional considerations. Competing mandates exist for CBP inspectors, balancing thorough inspections for various threats with efficient processing to avoid disruptions in travel and trade. Increased inspections post-9/11 caused significant delays at border crossings, impacting trade and production. Inspectors are urged to find a balance between security and facilitation. Some critics argue that CBP inspectors prioritize trade and travel facilitation over thorough scrutiny of passengers and goods, pointing to low percentages of cargo inspected and short primary immigration inspection times. However, others believe that CBP inspections have improved with the use of analytical targeting units to focus on high-risk shipments, balancing border security with smooth flow of goods and people. The advance cargo manifest rules aim to provide CBP with necessary information for targeting high-risk containers. Concerns have been raised about using the cargo manifest for security screening due to potential lack of crucial information. Since 9/11, concerns have been raised about aliens entering the US legally on temporary visas. While CBP has made efforts to improve targeting operations, GAO highlighted the lack of comprehensive risk assessments and modeling practices in CBP's targeting strategy. Since 9/11, concerns have been raised about aliens entering the US legally on temporary visas. Congress has enacted laws to improve information sharing and databases for screening potential terrorists. The Terrorist Screening Center was created to consolidate watchlists into a single database. Donna Bucella testified about progress in developing a database of known or suspected terrorists. Some observers raise concerns about the lack of government-wide standards for placing individuals on watchlists, leading to civil liberty issues. Turf battles persist among various anti-terror entities, hindering effective information sharing. Questions arise about the effectiveness of the US-VISIT system in identifying terrorists and tracking suspicious foreign nationals entering and exiting the country. The US-VISIT system faces challenges in including millions of foreign nationals entering through the Visa Waiver Program, potentially allowing terrorists and criminals to evade detection. While efforts are being made to address these concerns, there are doubts about the ability of participating nations to meet biometric passport deadlines. Despite challenges, officials remain confident in the ultimate success of US-VISIT, citing apprehensions and denials through the National Security Entry Exit Registration System. The US-VISIT system, building on NSEERS and CCD, has had successes with 100 alien \"hits\" on biometrics. The 9/11 Commission recommendations emphasize the importance of targeting terrorist travel and suggest legislative actions for border security. The United States should integrate terrorist travel intelligence, operations, and law enforcement to intercept terrorists and constrain their mobility. The border security system should be part of a larger network of screening points, including transportation systems and vital facilities like nuclear reactors. The Department of Homeland Security should quickly implement a biometric entry-exit screening system. Legislation implementing 9/11 Commission recommendations is being considered by Congress. The 9/11 Commission recommendations (S. 2845, H.R. 10, S. 2774/H.R. 5040 and H.R. 5024) had provisions for border inspections, including the development of a biometric entry and exit data system integrated with various databases. Legislation required the Secretary of Homeland Security to expedite processing. The bills aim to expedite processing for registered travelers through a single program, integrate the program into the entry and exit data system, improve security for passports and travel documents, and expand pre-inspection programs in foreign countries. The bill aims to limit the President's waiver authority for U.S. citizens traveling abroad, specifically focusing on document requirements for travelers to and from foreign contiguous territories. The National Intelligence Reform Act of 2004 (P.L.108-458) requires accelerated deployment of the biometric entry and exit system for processing data on aliens and expands pre-inspection programs at foreign airports for travelers entering the United States. The Act mandates improvements in technology and training for detecting and combating terrorist travel. It establishes the Human Smuggling and Trafficking Center and a Visa and Passport Security Program. The FY2000 Treasury-Postal Appropriations Act required Customs to consult with the GSA on infrastructure adequacy. Customs, in consultation with the GSA and federal inspection agencies, identified 822 infrastructure projects costing $784 million on the northern and southwestern borders. The Coordinated Border Infrastructure program aims to improve movement across borders with Canada and Mexico, but controversy exists over funding non-transportation projects. Concerns arise over the inadequacy of current infrastructure at U.S. ports of entry for the US-VISIT data system. The US-VISIT automated entry and exit data system requires sufficient lanes, staff, and resources at land ports of entry. Additional lanes may be needed to accommodate the large number of individuals entering the United States. Concerns exist about the current infrastructure at air ports of entry not being able to handle US-VISIT when fully operational. Limited space and resources at airports could lead to significant delays for travelers. The need for inter-agency coordination is crucial for the success of CBP's mission, highlighted by new regulations from various agencies. For example, while CBP is finalizing rules for electronic manifest submissions, the FDA has issued advance notification regulations for certain food imports with different time frames. The FDA rules require advance notice for food imports, with specific time frames based on the mode of transportation. It is unclear how the FDA and CBP requirements will be integrated, but importers must submit advance notice using CBP's systems. Collaboration between FDA and CBP is crucial, as evidenced by the need for inter-agency cooperation in various federal entities. The responsibilities for aliens seeking asylum in the United States are divided among various agencies within DHS and DOJ, with USCIS and EOIR leading in setting asylum standards. CBP inspectors, often the first point of contact for asylum seekers, must undergo extensive training in complex laws and procedures to identify violators. Some express concern about the ability of customs inspectors to recognize and differentiate between fraudulent and legitimate travel documents, as this skill is learned through experience and training. There are worries about the adequacy of training for inspectors who must also access various data systems. Specific concerns are raised about the agricultural training of primary inspectors in CBP, with arguments that current training may be insufficient compared to former APHIS inspectors who had science and biology backgrounds. Critics raise concerns about the training and technological infrastructure of CBP inspectors, particularly in agricultural inspections. They question if enough attention will be given to this area, while others argue that the new 14-week training course for inspectors addresses these issues. Additionally, there are worries about the security risks posed by the current technological infrastructure, as mandated by the Enhanced Border Security and Visa Entry Reform Act of 2002. The integration of law enforcement and intelligence data systems with immigration databases is crucial for CBP inspectors to screen individuals entering the US. Coordination and sharing of intelligence among agencies are essential for effective immigration policy and homeland security. Concerns remain about the interoperability of databases across relevant agencies. The need for an interoperable database system among relevant agencies is crucial for effective immigration policy and homeland security. Some argue that the cost and complexity of developing such a system, along with determining appropriate biometric identifiers, pose challenges. Success of this technology depends on 100% inclusion of aliens, but the sheer scope of implementation in \"real time\" is a concern. The Automated Commercial Environment (ACE) is being developed by CBP to replace the outmoded and inefficient ACS system. Difficulties with ACS include uneven levels of automation for different modes of transportation, as seen in the varying rollout deadlines for the new mandatory advance electronic manifest rule. Inconsistent automation poses challenges for effective data sharing and interoperability among agencies, raising concerns about national security and privacy breaches. The new mandatory advance electronic manifest rule proposed by CBP aims to improve automation for commercial trucks through programs like FAST, PAPS, and BRASS until ACE is fully functional. ACE is developing protocols for expedited tracking and screening, while also collaborating with other agencies on the Integrated Trade Data System (ITDS). Questions remain about how ACE and ITDS will fit into the larger DHS strategy and interact with existing databases. The Fourth Amendment protects individuals at the border, but the scope of protections may be more limited. Racial profiling is a constitutional concern in targeting individuals based on race or ethnicity for law enforcement purposes. Several courts have addressed the constitutional implications of this practice. Several courts have considered the constitutional ramifications of racial profiling in immigration inspections, with the unsettled constitutionality of making distinctions based on race or nationality. While race alone cannot justify a stop by a roving patrol near the border, it can be more determinative at fixed immigration checkpoints. The Fifth Amendment distinguishes between aliens for procedural due process in immigration law. Under the Fifth Amendment, immigration law distinguishes between aliens seeking admission and those already in the United States. The Supreme Court has recognized additional rights for those within the country, while aliens seeking admission must accept statutory rights granted by Congress. In cases of suspected terrorism, arriving aliens may be excluded without further administrative rights. The regional director can exclude aliens without further administrative rights, especially if suspected of terrorism. Congress is concerned about the implementation of border security reforms and the efficiency of new technologies like US-VISIT. Questions arise about the need for additional resources and infrastructure for border inspections, including the possibility of raising fees or appropriating funds. The inspections system must balance terrorism protection with the ability to facilitate movement of people and goods. The inspections system must balance protection against terrorism with other threats like contagious diseases and asylum seekers. Amendments to laws may be needed to tighten or expand the inspections process. Striking a balance between facilitating travel and trade while protecting against harm remains a challenge.
