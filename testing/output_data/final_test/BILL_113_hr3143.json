    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act\" and its purpose is outlined in Section 2 as findings and purpose. Congress finds that international terrorism poses a serious threat to the United States, impacting vital interests. The Constitution grants Congress the power to punish crimes against the law of nations and enforce treaty obligations. International terrorism disrupts interstate and foreign commerce, affecting trade, market stability, and travel. Foreign terrorist organizations, including affiliated groups, raise significant funds outside the United States for conduct targeted at the country. Contributions to these organizations facilitate criminal conduct, making civil liability necessary along the terrorism funding chain to deter such activities. Civil liability is crucial in deterring terrorism funding, as damages are less effective against terrorists themselves. Recognizing causes of action for aiding and abetting and conspiracy under the Anti-Terrorism Act is essential, especially since some circuits currently do not allow such liability theories. The decision in Halberstam v. Welch by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia is significant in this context. The Halberstam v. Welch case in the District of Columbia provides the legal framework for Federal civil aiding and abetting and conspiracy liability, as recognized by the Supreme Court. The United Nations Security Council Resolution 1373 emphasizes the obligation to refrain from supporting terrorist acts and bring perpetrators to justice. The United States emphasizes that no country has the discretion to finance or sponsor terrorism. Those who knowingly support terrorism should expect to face legal consequences in the United States. The US is committed to holding accountable those who contribute to terrorist activities that harm its nationals or threaten its security. The purpose of this Act is to allow victims of terrorist attacks in the United States to pursue civil claims against those who provided support to the perpetrators. It aims to provide broad legal grounds for seeking relief against individuals, entities, and foreign countries involved in terrorist activities against the US. SEC. 3. FOREIGN SOVEREIGN IMMUNITY. Section 1605(a) of title 28, United States Code is amended to include cases where money damages are sought against a foreign state for physical injury, death, or property damage in the US caused by the tortious act of that foreign state or its officials or employees. This includes claims related to extrajudicial killing, terrorism, and material support for such acts. The amendment to Section 1605(a) of title 28, United States Code limits claims against foreign states for physical injury, death, or property damage caused by their tortious acts. It excludes claims related to discretionary functions, malicious prosecution, abuse of process, and other specific actions. The amendment to Section 1605(a) of title 28, United States Code limits claims against foreign states for physical injury, death, or property damage caused by their tortious acts. It excludes claims related to discretionary functions, malicious prosecution, abuse of process, and other specific actions. Additionally, definitions for terms like 'aircraft sabotage', 'extrajudicial killing', 'hostage taking', 'material support or resources', and 'terrorism' are provided in the amendment. SEC. 4. AIDING AND ABETTING LIABILITY FOR CIVIL ACTIONS REGARDING TERRORIST ACTS. Section 2333 of title 18, United States Code, is amended to allow liability to be asserted against individuals or entities involved in acts of international terrorism. This amendment does not affect the immunity of foreign states under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act. The amendments in this section impact the immunity of a foreign state from jurisdiction under other laws. SEC. 5 amends Section 2334 of title 18, granting district courts jurisdiction over individuals involved in international terrorism acts causing harm to U.S. nationals. SEC. 6 addresses liability of government officials in civil actions related to terrorist acts. Section 2337 of title 18, United States Code is amended to limit suits against government officials. If any provision of this Act is held invalid, the rest remains unaffected. Effective date of the Act is specified in Section 8. The amendments made by this Act will apply to any civil action pending on or after the date of enactment."
