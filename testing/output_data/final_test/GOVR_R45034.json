    "content": "Haiti was without an elected president from February 2016 until February 2017. Former President Michel Martelly ended his term without a successor, leading to Senate President Jocelerme Privert being named interim president. Privert established a verification commission to investigate electoral fraud allegations, resulting in a call for a reheld presidential election. International observers disagreed on the need for a re-election but recognized the political necessity due to public perception. Privert's term expired in June 2016, and the Haitian legislature did not vote on extending it. Haiti's political turmoil continued as the term of interim President Jocelerme Privert expired in June 2016 without a successor being appointed. The electoral council scheduled new presidential elections for October 2016, delayed to November due to Hurricane Matthew. Political novice Jovenel Mo\u00efse won the elections in January 2017, becoming president on February 7, 2017. Mo\u00efse, a member of the Bald Head Party, won with 56% of the vote, marking a return to constitutional order. Voter turnout was low at 21%. Jovenel Mo\u00efse, a political newcomer, won the presidential elections in Haiti in January 2017. Despite his party, PHTK, having the most seats in the legislature, no single party holds a majority. Mo\u00efse may need to form alliances to pass legislation. Challenges he faces include recovering from natural disasters, economic stagnation, and a polarized political climate. Additionally, Mo\u00efse's weak mandate, potential social unrest, and ongoing government investigation into money laundering allegations pose obstacles during his term. In March, the Haitian Congress approved President Mo\u00efse's choice for prime minister, Dr. Jack Guy Lafontant, along with his cabinet and policy agenda. The agenda includes reviving the agricultural sector, implementing a national health care insurance system, bringing alternative energy to Haiti, and infrastructure repair. The government ended fuel subsidies in May to fund these objectives. In September 2017, the legislature approved the president's agenda. In September 2017, the legislature approved the president's budget, which included tax increases for revenue generation. The public responded with violent street protests. Workers have been striking for higher wages since May, particularly in the textile manufacturing sector. Street protests have become common during Mr. Mo\u00efse's administration. Transportation unions held strikes in September and October, leading to the withdrawal of proposed transport-related tax increases. In November, protests erupted over the remobilization of the army and government corruption. The United Nations ended its 13-year mission in Haiti in October 2017, replaced by a smaller mission focused on judicial support. Haiti, the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere, continues to struggle with chronic political instability and natural disasters. Almost 60% of the population lives below the national poverty line, with over 24% in extreme poverty. The country is still recovering from the 2010 earthquake and Hurricane Matthew in 2016, which caused significant damage to the economy. The United Nations mission in Haiti has been replaced by a smaller mission focused on strengthening judicial institutions and protecting human rights. The earthquake in Haiti caused damage equivalent to 32% of the country's GDP, with losses of $600 million in the agricultural, livestock, and fishing sectors. A two-year drought and Hurricane Matthew have devastated Haiti's food supply, putting over 90% of the population at risk from natural disasters. Despite limited resources, Haiti is transitioning from post-disaster to reconstruction and long-term development, with a modest economic growth rate of 1.4% in 2015/2016 and a forecasted increase to 1.7% in 2017/2018. However, economic growth is hindered by institutional weaknesses according to the EIU. The UN Security Council voted to close MINUSTAH in Haiti by October 15, 2017, after 13 years of operation. The mission had 5,063 personnel, including troops, police officers, civilians, and volunteers. The resolution cited Haiti's completion of an electoral process and return to constitutional order in February 2017 as reasons for ending the mission. The Security Council praised MINUSTAH for its role in stabilizing Haiti post-election in 2017, but faced criticism for introducing cholera and allegations of sexual abuse. Haiti's vulnerability to disasters and poor living conditions contributed to the rapid spread of cholera. In August 2016, the U.N. acknowledged moral responsibility for the cholera outbreak in Haiti and announced a program to support victims. However, the $400 million cholera plan is not fully funded, and victims have not been consulted regarding compensation. Charges of sexual abuse by MINUSTAH personnel have fueled anti-MINUSTAH sentiment, with 35 cases substantiated and seven pending. The U.N. has a zero-tolerance policy towards sexual abuse and exploitation. The U.N. acknowledged moral responsibility for the cholera outbreak in Haiti and announced a program to support victims. Charges of sexual abuse by MINUSTAH personnel have fueled anti-MINUSTAH sentiment, with 35 cases substantiated and seven pending. The U.N. Security Council provided for a smaller follow-on mission, MINUJUSTH, to focus on rule of law, development of the Haitian National Police force, and human rights. MINUJUSTH is initially authorized from October 16, 2017, to April 15, 2018, with up to seven formed police units deployed in five political departments and 295 individual police officers. The Haitian police force has increased in size, with new commissariats built to improve security services. A police academy class graduating in 2017 will bring the total force to 14,500 officers, close to the goal of 15,000 officers. Concerns remain about the force being underfunded and below optimal size. Former President Michel Martelly revived the Haitian army after a 22-year absence, despite past human rights violations. Observers question if the police force can maintain security without international support. The Haitian army, revived by former President Martelly, is being continued by President Mo\u00efse with plans to recruit more soldiers. The army is intended to focus on border patrol, combating smuggling, and disaster recovery, but many in the international community believe Haiti should strengthen its police force instead. Relations between Haiti and the Dominican Republic have been strained historically, with new tensions arising after a 2013 court ruling that stripped Dominicans of Haitian descent of their citizenship. The Dominican government claimed it was normalizing immigration, but international agencies and human rights groups challenged the decision. Congress has supported U.N. missions in Haiti to improve security conditions by professionalizing and strengthening the police force. The IACHR criticized the Dominican Republic's ruling on nationality, stating it was arbitrary and discriminatory towards Dominicans of Haitian descent. A regularization plan in 2013 allowed foreigners to register for legal status, with 240,000 qualifying out of 290,000 applicants. After a 2015 deadline, authorities could expel Haitian descendants without proper documentation. From July 2015 to September 17, 2017, the Dominican Republic deported over 58,000 people, with 37,942 claiming to have been deported. Thousands struggle to obtain birth certificates due to officials denying documents to those of Haitian descent. A naturalization law revalidated citizenship for 55,000 people and allowed their children to become citizens. Haiti and the Dominican Republic formed a Joint Bilateral Commission in May 2017 to address security and border issues. The Dominican Republic and Haiti revived the Joint Bilateral Commission to address security, border, and migration issues. U.S. policy towards Haiti aims to strengthen democratic foundations, reduce poverty, promote economic growth, improve healthcare and food security, respect human rights, and enhance the Haitian National Police. Tensions between the two countries escalated due to the Trump Administration's decision to end Temporary Protected Status. The Trump Administration's decision to end Temporary Protected Status for about 60,000 Haitians has caused tension between the U.S. and Haiti. Despite being the second-largest recipient of U.S. aid in the region, Haiti faces a 30% reduction in aid for FY2018, with a total request of $157.5 million. The USAID-administered part of the GHP received $48 million, $8 million for the new Economic Support and Development Fund, $255,000 for International Military Education and Training (IMET), and $0.5 million increase for International Narcotics Control and Law Enforcement (INCLE) to support the HNP in maintaining security after MINUSTAH departed. Haiti is a transit point for cocaine and marijuana to U.S. markets, but does not produce a significant amount of illicit drugs for export due to its subsistence-level economy. Haiti's subsistence-level economy limits domestic drug use, but criminal gangs are involved in international drug trafficking. The government has increased efforts to combat drug trafficking, including boosting staffing for counternarcotics units. Despite some improvements in interdicting illicit drugs domestically, Haiti's capacity to interrupt drug trafficking remains low due to inadequate border control. The land border with the Dominican Republic is largely uncontrolled, and the Haitian Coast Guard lacks resources to effectively patrol maritime borders. Haiti's limited ability to patrol its maritime borders with only five operational boats and 160 officers hampers efforts to combat drug trafficking. The weak judicial system also hinders prosecution of drug traffickers and money launderers. Haiti is classified as a major money laundering country, with property confiscations mainly involving drug traffickers convicted in the United States. Successful cooperation between Haiti and the United States in law enforcement has been seen recently. The extradition of former coup leader Guy Philippe to the United States in January 2017 showcased successful cooperation between Haiti and the U.S. law enforcement. Philippe admitted to accepting money from drug smugglers while serving as a police commander in Haiti. This collaboration highlights the challenges faced by Haiti in combating drug trafficking due to limited resources and a weak judicial system. In 1960, there were around 668,000 Haitian immigrants in the United States by 2016. Majority arrived before 2000, with 16% coming after 2010. 57% of Haitians in the US were naturalized citizens in 2015. Haitians make up less than 2% of the foreign-born population. TPS was granted to Haitians after the 2010 earthquake, providing temporary lawful status. The program was regularly extended, including eligible Haitians arriving up to one year after the earthquake. On May 22, 2017, then-DHS Secretary John Kelly extended TPS for Haitians for an additional 6 months from July 2017 through January 2018. He mentioned that Haiti's recovery progress \"may not warrant further TPS extension past January 2018.\" President Mo\u00efse stated that it is not an option to send back 60,000 Haitians. The Haitian government formally requested the Trump Administration to extend TPS for another 18 months on October 6. Acting DHS Secretary Elaine Duke announced the termination of TPS for Haitians on July 22, 2019, citing improved conditions in Haiti. Concerns were raised about the potential return of Haitians and the impact on Haiti's economy, as remittances from Haitians in the US make up a significant portion of Haiti's GDP. The Haitian Family Reunification Parole Program supports the idea of Haitians working in the US and sending remittances to aid in Haiti's long-term development. Members have introduced various bills related to Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Haitians, with some proposing a new protected status lasting six years or a path to permanent residency. Other bills aim to limit the program by transferring country designation authority from the Department of Homeland Security to Congress, making certain individuals ineligible, or subjecting TPS holders to detention and expedited removal. Additionally, the Haitian Family Reunification Parole Program allows eligible U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents to apply for parole for family members in Haiti. The Haitian Family Reunification Parole Program (HFRP) allows family members in Haiti with scheduled U.S. entry visas to reunite with their sponsors in the United States. Only individuals living in Haiti are eligible for the program, and beneficiaries cannot apply for themselves. The program aims to expedite family reunification and support U.S. development goals by allowing parolees to work in the U.S. and send remittances back to Haiti. USCIS anticipates conducting 5,000 HFRP program interviews per year, with a reported 6,864 approvals out of 9,758 applications accepted as of September 30, 2017. In 2017, USCIS denied 1,672, approved 6,864, and had 1,222 pending applications for the Haitian Family Reunification Parole Program. The State Department issued 12,534 invitations covering 23,993 beneficiaries. Haiti faces challenges with weak governance, lack of rule of law, and corruption. Calls for investigations into past human rights violations have been made. Elected government may improve human rights and governance. President Mo\u00efse's administration in Haiti has faced allegations of corruption, with the legislature divided and investigations ongoing. The Senate's report highlighted embezzlement and fraud involving $2 billion in loans from Venezuela's PetroCaribe program. The U.N. expert emphasized the need to address illiteracy as a top human rights priority in Haiti, where half of the population aged 15 and above is illiterate. Haiti faces numerous human rights issues, including high illiteracy rates, allegations of unlawful killings by government officials, overcrowded prisons, unreliable judiciary, discrimination and violence against women, child abuse, and trafficking in persons. The State Department's 2017 Trafficking in Persons Report identifies Haiti as a source, transit, and destination country for forced labor and sex trafficking, with a focus on cases involving children in domestic servitude known as \"restaveks.\" Haiti's human rights issues include high illiteracy rates, unlawful killings, overcrowded prisons, discrimination against women, child abuse, and trafficking in persons. Children in domestic servitude, known as \"restaveks,\" face slave-like conditions, abuse, and lack of education. Approximately 286,000 children under 15 work in domestic servitude, with one in four not living with their biological parents. Haiti is classified as a Tier 2 Watch List country for not fully complying with anti-trafficking standards but making efforts to do so. Haiti improved in 2016 to be upgraded from Tier 3 in anti-trafficking efforts. The government increased funding for prevention and law enforcement, leading to three trafficking convictions. Programs are being developed to comply with a 2014 anti-trafficking law, but many are not yet implemented."
