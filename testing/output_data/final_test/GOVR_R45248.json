    "content": "Under the Congressional Review Act (CRA), agencies must submit a report to Congress and the Government Accountability Office (GAO) before a rule can take effect. Major rules require additional time for Congressional review, and GAO assesses the agency's compliance with procedural steps. Congress can use expedited procedures to overturn a rule by submitting a resolution of disapproval. The Congressional Review Act (CRA) allows Congress to use expedited procedures to overturn a rule by submitting a resolution of disapproval. The expedited procedures primarily exist in the Senate and include steps such as discharging a Senate committee, making a nondebatable motion to proceed, and holding up to 10 hours of debate before a vote. If both houses pass the joint resolution, it is sent to the President for signature or veto. The Congressional Review Act (CRA) allows Congress to overturn a rule by submitting a resolution of disapproval. If the President vetoes the resolution, Congress can override the veto. If the resolution is signed by the President or Congress overrides the veto, the rule will not take effect. The rule would be deemed to have had no effect, and the status quo prior to the rule's issuance would be reinstated. Additionally, a rule cannot be issued in a substantially similar form unless authorized by a subsequent law. The Congressional Review Act (CRA) allows Congress to overturn a rule by submitting a resolution of disapproval. If the President vetoes the resolution, Congress can override the veto. The CRA governs \"rules\" promulgated by a \"federal agency,\" using the definition of \"agency\" provided in the APA. The more difficult interpretive issue is what types of agency actions should be considered \"rules\" under the CRA. The CRA adopts a broad definition of the word \"rule\" from the APA, but then creates three exceptions to that definition. The Congressional Review Act (CRA) allows Congress to overturn agency rules through a resolution of disapproval. The definition of \"rule\" under the CRA is broad, but with exceptions for rules of particular applicability. The Congressional Review Act (CRA) allows Congress to overturn agency rules through a resolution of disapproval. The definition of \"rule\" under the CRA is broad, with exceptions for rules of particular applicability. Determining if an agency action is subject to the CRA involves two steps: first, determining if it qualifies as a rule under the APA definition, and second, checking if it falls within any exceptions to the CRA's definition of rule. This process is detailed in the report. Courts have distinguished agency rulemaking actions from adjudicatory and investigatory functions. To qualify as a rule under the APA, an agency statement must be of general applicability, have future effect, and be designed to implement, interpret, or prescribe law or policy. The CRA exempts rules of particular applicability, rules relating to agency management or personnel, and any rule of agency organization, procedure, or practice that does not substantially affect non-agency parties' rights or obligations. Both inquiries are fact-specific. The CRA defines the word \"rule\" by incorporating the APA's definition. The APA distinguishes different types of agency actions, separating rules from orders and investigatory acts, which may be relevant when deciding if an agency action is a rule subject to the CRA. An agency action is classified as a rule subject to the CRA based on the APA's definition. The APA distinguishes between rules and orders, with orders resulting from agency adjudication and rules from rulemaking. Courts determine the classification by looking at the substance of the action rather than its label. Rulemaking affects broad classes of individuals, while adjudications resolve specific disputes with immediate effects on those involved. Rulemaking is prospective and has a definitive effect on individuals only after the rule is applied. Courts have distinguished rules from agency investigations, with some actions related to investigations potentially qualifying as rules. An agency's decision to investigate may be considered a rule if the procedures governing it precede the agency's ultimate act. The APA defines a \"rule\" as an agency statement that is of general or particular applicability, has future effect, and is designed to implement, interpret, or prescribe law or policy. Most agency statements fulfill the first requirement. The second requirement, that a rule has future effect, distinguishes rulemaking from agency adjudication. Rules operate prospectively to inform future conduct. The APA defines a \"rule\" as an agency statement with future effect intended to inform future conduct. Courts have interpreted this to mean that rules have legal consequences only for the future, distinguishing them from orders with both future and past legal consequences. Judge Silberman argued that not every agency statement with future effect is a rule under the APA, only those that authoritatively answer an underlying issue. Judge Silberman argued that only agency statements that \"seek to authoritatively answer an underlying policy or legal issue\" should be considered rules. However, there are unanswered questions regarding the interpretation of the phrase \"future effect\" in the APA definition of a rule as \"binding.\" The cases do not fully explain what it means for an agency statement to be binding or how to distinguish this requirement from the notice-and-comment rulemaking procedures. The legal effect test for notice-and-comment rulemaking determines if a rule is legally binding and subject to the procedures outlined in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7553. This test is different from the future effect inquiry, which determines if an agency action is considered a \"rule\" under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7551(4). The distinction is important as interpretive rules may not require notice-and-comment but are still considered \"rules\" within the legal framework. The legal effect test for notice-and-comment rulemaking determines if a rule is legally binding and subject to procedures. Interpretive rules may not need notice-and-comment but are still considered \"rules\" under the legal framework. Agency actions must be designed to implement, interpret, or prescribe law or policy to be considered APA rules. The D.C. Circuit has ruled that agency documents that do not change existing law or policy are not considered rules. The APA outlines rulemaking procedures for agencies to follow when formulating, amending, or repealing rules. Notice-and-comment rulemaking requires agencies to notify the public of proposed rules and allow for public comment. However, certain agency acts like interpretative rules, general policy statements, or organizational rules are exempt from notice-and-comment requirements under the APA. The APA's rulemaking procedures do not apply to agency management or personnel matters. Agency statements like guidance documents may not need notice-and-comment rulemaking but could still be considered APA \"rules.\" Courts often exempt agency guidance documents from notice-and-comment requirements, categorizing them as interpretive rules or general policy statements. Interpretive rules clarify existing legal obligations without imposing new ones, while general policy statements describe how an agency will enforce its discretion without being binding. The distinction between \"legislative\" rules and general policy statements lies in whether the agency action binds private parties or the agency itself with the 'force of law.' General policy statements are not legally binding and do not require notice-and-comment rulemaking procedures. Some cases suggest that general policy statements may not be considered \"rules\" under the APA definition if they do not bind the agency to a particular legal position. The APA distinguishes between \"legislative\" rules and general policy statements based on their binding effect. General policy statements, while not legally binding, may still be considered APA rules. The CRA incorporates the APA definition of \"rule,\" suggesting that judicial constructions of this definition should be taken into account. Some courts have applied the APA's rules vs. orders distinction when interpreting the CRA. The CRA may not apply to agency actions done through orders or investigatory acts. There is debate on using the CRA to revoke agencies' guidance documents, but the term \"guidance document\" is not defined in the CRA or APA. The key question is whether agency statements labeled as guidance qualify as a \"rule\" under the CRA. The CRA's definition of \"rule\" includes agency guidance documents, which may not be exempt from its requirements unlike the APA's exemptions for interpretive rules or general policy statements. The CRA encompasses most rules that require notice-and-comment procedures, including some that do not. The CRA's definition of \"rule\" includes agency guidance documents, which may not be exempt from its requirements unlike the APA's exemptions for interpretive rules or general policy statements. The effect of a disapproval resolution on guidance documents may be limited as they generally lack legal effect. The post-enactment legislative history of the CRA indicates that it was intended to cover a wide range of agency actions. The CRA's definition of \"rule\" under subsection 804(3) is broad and includes agency policy statements, interpretive rules, and certain rules of agency organization. There is ambiguity regarding whether non-binding statements are considered rules under the APA definition and therefore under the CRA. The CRA's definition of \"rule\" is broad and includes agency policy statements. GAO has concluded that general policy statements should be considered \"rules\" under the CRA, even if they are not rules under the APA definition. The CRA exempts certain rules from its definition, such as rules of particular applicability or relating to agency management. The CRA contains exemptions for rules related to monetary policy by the Federal Reserve, as well as for rules related to hunting, fishing, or camping activities. These exemptions allow agencies to determine when rules take effect, despite CRA requirements. The CRA exempts rules of particular applicability, which are directed at specifically named parties. GAO has clarified that a rule does not need to apply to the entire population to be considered generally applicable under the CRA. For example, GAO determined that a decision to counter decreased river flows in a specific area was not of particular applicability. The CRA exempts rules of particular applicability, which are directed at specifically named parties. GAO clarified that rules with significant economic and environmental impact in major watersheds are still subject to the CRA. Examples of such rules include those related to rates, wages, prices, services, corporate structures, and environmental designations. IRS private letter rulings and Customs Service letter rulings are cited as classic examples of rules of particular applicability. The CRA exempts rules of particular applicability, which are directed at specifically named parties. The second exemption excludes rules relating to agency management or personnel. Courts have interpreted this exemption to cover internal matters that do not substantially affect parties outside an agency. It is unclear whether the substantial-effect requirement developed by courts in the context of the APA should be applied to the CRA. The CRA's second exemption, for rules relating to agency management or personnel, may be interpreted more broadly than the APA exception, as it does not mention a rule's impact on third parties. This could mean that the CRA's exception excludes such rules regardless of their effect on third parties, displacing the usual presumption of incorporating case law. The CRA's second exemption may be interpreted broadly, possibly due to prior judicial interpretation of similar APA language. Congress added a substantial-effect requirement to the third exception to clarify ambiguity in APA cases. The CRA exempts agency rules that do not substantially affect non-agency parties, similar to the APA's exclusion of rules on agency organization and procedure from notice-and-comment requirements. The APA exemption under the CRA does not explicitly limit exceptions based on impact on non-agency parties. Courts have used the \"substantial impact test\" to determine if agency actions significantly affect the regulated industry, even if they are procedural in nature. The CRA mandates the use of a substantial impact test to determine if a rule falls within the exception for rules of agency organization, procedure, or practice that do not substantially affect non-agency parties' rights or obligations. The focus is on the rule's effect on non-agency parties, with only rules with a truly minor, incidental effect being excluded. The exclusion under the CRA only applies to rules with a truly minor, incidental effect on non-agency parties. GAO has used APA case law to analyze if actions fall under the CRA, but the substantial-impact and substantive-value-judgment tests may not directly apply. The CRA requires agencies to submit actions falling within its definition of a rule to Congress and GAO before they can take effect, including rules from APA notice-and-comment procedures and other agency statements. Section 801(a)(1)(A) of the CRA mandates agencies to submit reports to Congress and the Comptroller General, including a general statement on the rule, its effective date, and details on cost-benefit analysis. GAO assesses compliance with additional requirements for major rules and includes its assessment in the major rule report submitted to House and Senate committees within 15 calendar days. Agencies must submit a report to House and Senate committees within 15 days of a rule's submission or publication. The report includes information required by Section 801(a)(1)(A) and, for major rules, details for GAO's major rule report. OMB provided a standard form for agencies to use for this reporting requirement in FY1999. Submission of rules to Congress under the CRA is crucial as it triggers expedited procedures for considering a resolution of disapproval. The receipt of the rule in Congress initiates the CRA's fast-track procedures, allowing Members to act on the resolution. Failure to submit a rule to Congress would prevent the House and Senate from utilizing these special procedures. After the enactment of the CRA in 1996, concerns were raised about agencies not submitting their rules as required. In hearings in 1997 and 1998, it was noted that agencies were not fully complying with the submission requirement. To improve compliance, Congress required OMB to issue guidance on the submission requirement in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7801(a)(1). To improve compliance with the submission requirement under the CRA, OMB Director Jacob J. Lew issued a memorandum in March 1999 detailing where agencies should send their rules, what information to include, and which types of rules needed to be submitted. GAO began monitoring agencies' compliance by comparing final rules in the Federal Register with those submitted to GAO, a voluntary role not mandated by the CRA. In 1998, GAO reviewed agency compliance with the Congressional Review Act submission requirement. They found rules published in the Federal Register were not effective unless filed with Congress and GAO. GAO submitted a list of rules not filed to OIRA, who then distributed it to affected agencies for follow-up. In 1998, GAO reviewed agency compliance with the Congressional Review Act submission requirement. They found rules published in the Federal Register were not effective unless filed with Congress and GAO. GAO submitted a list of rules not filed to OIRA, who then distributed it to affected agencies for follow-up. GAO criticized OIRA for not being proactive in ensuring agencies were aware of filing requirements and complying with them. GAO continued to monitor rule submissions, periodically sending letters to OIRA until 2012 when they decided to only track major rules not received. GAO has noted exceptions, but agencies generally submit rules to Congress and GAO after APA rulemaking. GAO's database lists thousands of rules annually. However, rules not subject to notice-and-comment procedures often lack submission. GAO's tracking of compliance is incomplete, comparing Federal Register regulations to those received under the CRA. This method helps identify rules subject to the CRA. Using the Federal Register to identify rules subject to the CRA is helpful, but many agency actions not subject to notice-and-comment requirements are not published in the Federal Register or submitted to GAO. This leads to many rules that should have been submitted being undetected by GAO, resulting in noncompliance with the CRA's submission requirement for agency actions conducted outside the notice-and-comment rulemaking process. The practical difficulty of submitting agency statements that qualify as rules under the CRA is likely due to the large number of actions taken by agencies annually. Full compliance with the CRA's submission requirement could overwhelm Congress and the GAO with filings, potentially diverting attention from larger, controversial matters. The CRA's submission requirement may be challenging due to the high volume of agency actions, potentially diverting attention from larger, controversial matters. Many agencies may not be fully aware of the breadth of the CRA's coverage beyond notice-and-comment rules. The Counsel of HHS stated that the July 12 Information Memorandum is not a rule under the CRA. GAO disagreed, emphasizing the importance of rule submission for Congress's review. The Senate has a practice to review rules even if agencies do not submit them. The GAO has issued opinions on whether agency actions should have been submitted under the CRA, defining the term \"rule\" expansively. In 11 out of 21 opinions, GAO stated that the agency actions should have been reviewed by Congress. These opinions are summarized in a report and listed in an appendix. The GAO has issued opinions on whether agency actions should have been submitted under the CRA, defining the term \"rule\" expansively. In recent years, the Senate has considered using GAO's opinion as a trigger for the initiation period to submit a disapproval resolution and for expedited consideration. GAO plays a crucial role in determining the applicability of the CRA by providing opinions on agency actions. The GAO plays a crucial role in determining the applicability of the CRA by providing opinions on agency actions, including major and non-major rules. They have voluntarily created an online database of rules submitted under the CRA to facilitate implementation beyond what is required by the statute. The GAO voluntarily created an online database of rules submitted under the CRA to go beyond statutory requirements and facilitate implementation. The database allows for searching rules by various elements and contains links to GAO's major rule reports. The GAO's determination of agency actions as \"rules\" under the CRA is closely tied to monitoring agency compliance with submission requirements. The GAO's role in determining agency actions as \"rules\" under the CRA is highlighted in a discussion on the Tongass Land Management Plan in 1997. GAO's general counsel testified that the plan should have been submitted as a rule under the CRA. Former Senator Larry Craig asked GAO's general counsel about their role in advising Congress and agencies on policy decisions constituting rules under the CRA. GAO's counsel stated that the CRA does not specify who decides what constitutes a rule, unlike major rule determinations assigned to other officials. The GAO's role in advising Congress on whether agency actions constitute rules under the CRA is done in an advisory capacity, not specified by the statute. Despite issuing 21 opinions since 1996, Congress's response to these opinions has varied over time. In 2008, GAO determined that a letter from CMS regarding SCHIP was a rule under the CRA. Senator Rockefeller introduced a resolution to disapprove the guidance, but it was not acted upon due to missed deadlines. The first resolution acted upon after a GAO opinion was in 2012 when the House passed H.J.Res. 118. In 2012, the House passed a resolution to overturn an information memorandum from the Department of Health and Human Services related to the TANF program. The Senate later passed a resolution overturning guidance from the CFPB on auto lending. GAO opinions on agency actions under the CRA are advisory and do not have legal effect. The GAO opinions on agency actions under the CRA are advisory and do not have immediate legal effect. However, the Senate has treated GAO opinions as dispositive in some cases, leading to the commencement of time periods under the CRA and potential use of GAO opinions as a substitute for agency submissions to Congress. The GAO opinions under the CRA facilitate congressional review of rules not submitted to Congress. A provision in the CRA prevents judicial review of GAO opinions or congressional determinations regarding a rule's CRA applicability. Most courts have declined to review claims regarding agency actions under the CRA, as judicial review is barred by the provision in the CRA. The determination of whether an agency action is subject to the CRA will likely be settled politically, with GAO opinions potentially serving as the final word. The provision also raises the question of whether a rule has taken effect, which may be addressed through GAO opinions rather than in the courts. The CRA provision raises questions about when a rule takes effect, with courts unlikely to enforce the requirement for rules to be submitted to Congress before taking effect. GAO opinions may play a role in determining if agency actions are subject to the CRA. The GAO opinion may indicate to agencies that a rule did not \"take effect\" under the CRA if the submission requirement was not fulfilled. However, for agency rules without legal effect, the CRA's definition of \"effect\" may not have much practical impact. The term \"effect\" in the CRA submission requirement may refer to something other than legal effect, as some agency statements lacking legal effect still need to be submitted. Some courts have ruled that the CRA can suspend a rule during notice-and-comment rulemakings. Some courts have ruled that the CRA can suspend a rule during notice-and-comment rulemakings, even if a rule technically became effective. For agency rules without legal force, compliance with the CRA's submission requirement may not have a significant impact. The GAO has issued 21 opinions on whether certain agency actions qualify as rules eligible for disapproval under the CRA, listing them chronologically. The Emergency Sale Timber Program was enacted to increase salvage timber sales for forest health. A memorandum from the Secretary of Agriculture regarding the program was deemed a rule under the CRA by the GAO. The Department of Agriculture's Forest Service issued the Tongass National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan, which sets management direction for the forest. GAO determined the plan was a rule under the CRA and not excepted under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7804(3) because decisions in the plan affect non-agency parties. President Clinton signed Executive Order 13061 related to the American Heritage River Initiative. The American Heritage River Initiative (AHRI) aimed to support communities in restoring and protecting rivers. The President designated 10 rivers for the program. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) determined that Executive Order 13061 was not subject to the Congressional Review Act (CRA) as the President is not considered an \"agency\" under the CRA. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued guidance on investigating discrimination complaints in environmental permitting, which GAO deemed as affecting non-agency parties and therefore a rule under the CRA. The Farm Credit Administration issued a booklet providing guidance on national charter application processes and territories, which GAO determined to be a legislative rule under the CRA, requiring informal rulemaking procedures. The GAO determined that the Trinity River Record of Decision (ROD) was a rule under the CRA due to its policy-setting nature and broad impact on non-agency parties. The ROD outlined actions to restore anadromous fish in the Trinity River, addressing decreased river flows in the basin. The Department of Veterans Affairs issued a memorandum directing network directors to stop certain marketing activities to enroll new veterans in the VA health care system. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) concluded that the memorandum was not a rule under the Congressional Review Act (CRA) as it was considered a statement of agency procedure or practice that did not affect the rights or obligations of non-agency parties. The VA issued a memorandum terminating the Vendee Loan Program, which allowed loans for the sale of foreclosed VA-guaranteed property. The memorandum was considered a rule relating to agency management and did not substantially affect non-agency parties' rights or obligations. The VA terminated the Vendee Loan Program, a discretionary management decision, which did not impact any party's rights or obligations. In a separate development, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services issued a letter clarifying requirements for the State Children's Health Insurance Program. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) determined that a letter regarding the State Children's Health Insurance Program and an information memorandum about the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program were considered rules under the Congressional Review Act (CRA). The letter and memorandum were deemed as statements with general applicability and future effect, designed to implement, interpret, or prescribe law or policy. The Environmental Protection Agency issued a proposed rule on greenhouse gas emissions from electric utility generating units on January 8, 2014. The rule aimed to set standards for fossil fuel-fired electric steam generating units. The GAO concluded that the proposed rule on greenhouse gas emissions from steam generating units and combustion turbines was not covered by the CRA, as it only applies to final rules. Additionally, the interagency guidance on leveraged lending was issued on March 22, 2013. The GAO concluded that the leveraged-lending guidance was a rule under the CRA due to its future effect and lack of exceptions. The guidance included principles for safe-and-sound leveraged lending activities for agency-supervised institutions. The Forest Service updated the Tongass Land and Resource Management Plan, which outlined permissible uses in different forest areas. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) determined that the plan amendment was a substantive rule under the Congressional Review Act (CRA), impacting the regulated community. Despite USDA's argument, the plan did not qualify for an exception. Additionally, the Bureau of Land Management issued resource management plans for four areas in Alaska. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) concluded that the Eastern Interior Plan was a rule under the Congressional Review Act (CRA) due to its general applicability and future effect. The plan was designed to implement law and did not fit into any exceptions. On March 21, 2013, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau issued guidance on indirect auto lending compliance with the Equal Credit Opportunity Act. The GAO concluded that the bulletin on indirect auto lenders' compliance with fair lending requirements was a rule under the CRA. President Trump issued a memorandum on global health assistance funding. The City Policy prohibits assistance to foreign organizations promoting abortion. The Department of State and USAID issued fact sheets to implement the policy. GAO determined these actions were not rules under the CRA as they were implementing the President's decision. The court held that agency actions implementing President Trump's policy decision were not subject to review under the APA, as it involved policy-making at the highest level by the executive branch. IRS announced it would not accept electronically filed tax returns without ACA reporting requirements. The GAO concluded that the IRS statement regarding health coverage reporting is not a rule under the CRA, as it only changes the timing of compliance measures without affecting taxpayers' rights. The SSA's HALLEX manual outlines how disability benefit claims are processed under the Social Security Act. The SSA's HALLEX manual policy prohibits using Internet information in benefit claim decisions, except for specific procedures. GAO determined these sections are procedural rules exempt from the CRA. IRS issued Revenue Procedure 2018-38 modifying tax-exempt entities' reporting requirements, submitted to Congress under the CRA. Senator Orrin Hatch requested GAO's opinion on the matter. The GAO opinion was sought by Senator Orrin Hatch regarding the IRS's submission of Revenue Procedure 2018-38 under the CRA. The IRS argued that the document was not covered by the CRA, despite submitting it to Congress. This was a unique situation as it was the first time GAO had to consider the application of the CRA in such a case. The GAO opinion addressed whether the submission of the IRS revenue procedure triggered the CRA's timelines, not whether the procedure met the statutory definition of a \"rule.\" GAO stated that since the IRS had already submitted the rule, a GAO opinion on the CRA's applicability was unnecessary. The IRS submission allowed for congressional review under the CRA, enabling Congress to exercise its oversight powers. The GAO concluded that the April 2018 memorandum on zero-tolerance policy for illegal border crossings was not a rule under the CRA as it pertained to agency organization, procedure, or practice, and did not change individuals' rights or obligations. This exception allowed the memorandum to be exempt from the CRA's timelines. In 2018, the Secretary of Commerce justified adding a citizenship question to the 2020 census in a memorandum to the Under Secretary of Commerce for Economic Affairs. The GAO stated that the memorandum was not a rule under the CRA, as it was part of the statutory process for informing Congress of census questions. The GAO stated that the memorandum justifying the citizenship question on the 2020 census did not meet the definition of a \"rule\" under the CRA."
