    "content": "The Act titled \"Post Office Community Partnership Act of 1999\" provides guidelines for the relocation, closing, consolidation, or construction of post offices. Section 404 of title 39, United States Code, is amended to require the Postal Service to provide notice to persons served by a post office at least 60 days before making a final determination to relocate, close, consolidate, or construct the post office. The notice must be in writing, hand-delivered or mailed to affected individuals, and published in newspapers within the zip codes served by the post office. The Postal Service must notify individuals served by a post office at least 60 days before deciding to relocate, close, consolidate, or construct the post office. The notification should include details such as the reasons for the action, proposed date, opportunity for a hearing, and public comment. Individuals can propose alternative plans within the 60-day period. After this period, the Postal Service will make a final determination. Before making a final determination, the Postal Service must conduct a hearing if requested by individuals served by the post office in question. During the hearing, individuals can provide testimony regarding the relocation, closing, consolidation, or construction of the post office. The Postal Service must consider factors such as the post office's location in a downtown business area, the impact on the community, and the needs of the community when deciding whether to relocate, close, consolidate, or construct a post office. The Postal Service must consider factors such as community opposition, impact on employees, adherence to government policy, economic savings, and adequacy of the existing post office when deciding on relocation, closing, consolidation, or construction. The Postal Service must consider factors such as community opposition, impact on employees, adherence to government policy, economic savings, and adequacy of the existing post office when deciding on relocation, closing, consolidation, or construction. Any determination made by the Postal Service regarding relocation, closure, consolidation, or construction of a post office must be in writing and include findings on the required considerations. Compliance with the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 cannot be a factor in the decision-making process. The Postal Service must respond to alternative proposals in a consolidated report, including findings and responses. A copy of the report must be made public at the relevant post office. No action can be taken to relocate, close, consolidate, or construct a post office until a specified date. The Postal Rate Commission must make a determination on any appeal regarding the relocation, closure, consolidation, or construction of a post office within 120 days of the appeal being made. The Commission will review the Postal Service's decision based on the available record and may set aside any findings deemed inappropriate. The Postal Rate Commission reviews appeals regarding post office actions and can overturn decisions that are deemed arbitrary, not following proper procedures, or lacking substantial evidence. The Commission can affirm or return matters for further consideration but cannot modify Postal Service determinations. The Commission is not bound by certain procedural requirements during its review process. The Postal Rate Commission can review post office actions, but Title 5 does not apply to their reviews. Determinations made by the Commission are not subject to judicial review. If a community has stricter public participation procedures for post office actions, the Postal Service must follow those instead of the standard procedures. The Postal Service must also comply with zoning, planning, and land use laws when making decisions about post office relocations, closures, consolidations, or constructions. The relocation, closing, consolidation, or construction of any post office must comply with zoning laws and the National Historic Preservation Act. Temporary facilities for less than 60 days are exempt. Emergencies, such as natural disasters or lease terminations, allow for immediate relocation without following standard procedures. The Postmaster General can temporarily suspend certain provisions for up to 180 days for a specific post office in case of emergencies."
