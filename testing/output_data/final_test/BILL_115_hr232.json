    "content": "The State National Forest Management Act of 2017, also known as the Act, includes a table of contents with sections detailing definitions, state selection of National Forest System portions for management, transition provisions, miscellaneous duties, and conditions on changes to land management plans. The Act is officially titled as the \"State National Forest Management Act of 2017\" and provides definitions for key terms. The Act defines key terms such as \"Commissioner\" as the head of the Department of Natural Resources of a State, \"eligible portions of the National Forest System\" as all US interests in surface and subsurface lands, and \"Federal obligation\" as duties arising from Forest Service agreements. The term \"forest operations\" refers to developing forest operating plans for eligible parts of the National Forest System, including timber resource inventories and necessary access engineering. The term \"patent date\" is defined as the last day of the selection-transition period, and the term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of the relevant department. The term \"selection-transition period\" is defined as the period starting from the selection date when a State elects to acquire eligible portions of the National Forest System and ending no more than one year later on the patent date. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Agriculture, acting through the Chief of the Forest Service. The term \"State\" includes all States and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. The term \"State forest practices law\" refers to laws applicable to State or privately owned forest land, including regulations for forest management. The term \"State obligation\" refers to any obligation or duty of the State related to leases, permits, licenses, contracts, and other legal instruments issued for the selected lands under this Act. State selection of eligible portions of the National Forest System for acquisition and management is outlined in Section 3. During a 10-year period, a State can elect to select and acquire eligible portions of the National Forest System by enacting a law through its legislature. The Secretary will then convey the selected portions to the State, subject to valid existing rights. The State can acquire eligible portions of the National Forest System through purchase, exchange, or land selection rights, subject to valid existing rights and acceptance of specified procedures. Acceptance by the State of Alaska of rights and obligations under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act regarding acquired lands shall not be infringed. Up to 50% of annual timber harvest from eligible National Forest System portions to be acquired must be offered in 10-year contracts, meeting the needs of wood processing operations and complying with State forest practices law. During the selection period, a State can enact multiple laws to acquire National Forest System lands, not exceeding 2,000,000 acres. The Secretary will prepare patents for the State's selected lands for conveyance. The Secretary will prepare and convey patents for National Forest System lands selected by the State, with the conveyance being purely ministerial. The United States Supreme Court has exclusive jurisdiction to compel actions necessary for conveyance. Additionally, the Secretary will convey the right and title to all other types of property used for operating and administering the National Forest System. On the patent date, the State will receive property used for managing National Forest System land, including existing special use permits. During the exchange-transition period, there are transition provisions in place. During the selection-transition period, the United States remains obligated for all Federal obligations incurred prior to the patent date. Employees affected by this Act will be interviewed for reemployment by the State or placement in an equivalent position within the Federal Government. Management of National Forest System lands acquired by the State will be handled until the patent date. Eligible portions of the National Forest System not yet patented to the State will be managed under applicable Federal law. Receipts from rentals or sales on selected portions will be kept in escrow and transferred to the State on the patent date. SEC. 5. Transition provisions outside the transition period. Beginning on the patent date, eligible portions of the National Forest System conveyed to a State under this Act shall be managed primarily for timber production. Land use designations and subsistence use in Alaska will continue until the patent date. The Secretary of the Interior will retain authority to manage subsistence uses of fish and wildlife on these lands. Access provisions are also included. Following the patent date, eligible portions of the National Forest System conveyed to a State under this Act shall be managed primarily for timber production. The Secretary shall provide access in the form of easements across lands owned by the United States to and from eligible portions of the National Forest System conveyed to the State. The State shall issue easements to the United States for reasonable access after the patent date. After the patent date, eligible portions of the National Forest System conveyed to a State shall be managed for timber production. Easements will be provided for access across lands owned by the United States, and mining claims on these lands will remain subject to federal laws but administered by the State. Claimholders can apply to patent a mining claim and have reasonable access to it. During the selection-transition period, the Federal Government will escrow fees and revenues for Federal mining claims on eligible National Forest System portions. On the patent date, these receipts will be transferred to the State for mining claim administration. Any mining claims filed after the selection date will be subject only to State laws on eligible National Forest System portions. After the patent date, escrowed fees and fees from special use permits on eligible National Forest System portions will be transferred to the State. The State will assume Federal obligations and duties, except for claims arising before the patent date. SEC. 6. MISCELLANEOUS DUTIES OF THE PARTIES AND OTHER PROVISIONS RELATING TO THE TRANSFER. The Secretary will provide records on hazardous materials in National Forest System areas for state review. Costs for remedial action will be borne by responsible entities. If no responsible party is found, the Secretary will cover costs. Land selection under this Act is not subject to judicial review, except where specifically allowed. The Act allows for judicial review only in specific cases outlined by the Constitution or the Act itself. No formal rules are needed for implementation. A field survey is not required for the transfer of National Forest System portions to a State, but a survey will be completed after the transfer. The Secretary will provide a list of encumbrances for a smooth transition to State ownership and management. During the transition to State management, the Secretary will provide a list of encumbrances on the selected lands to the Commissioner. The lands chosen under this Act will be subject to existing encumbrances. SEC. 7. CONDITIONS ON CHANGES TO LAND MANAGEMENT PLANS FOR YOUNG-GROWTH STANDS. Before any changes to a land management plan affecting young-growth stands, the Secretary must conduct a comprehensive inventory, provide public notice, and allow a 90-day comment period. The inventory must cover all 462,000 acres of young-growth timber in the Tongass National Forest and assess all age classes of timber. The Secretary must conduct a comprehensive inventory of all age classes of timber in the Tongass National Forest to refine inventory and growth data for forecasting yields and economic feasibility."
