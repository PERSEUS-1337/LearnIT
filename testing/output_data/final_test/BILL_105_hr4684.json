    "content": "The \"Community Savings and Investment Act of 1998\" may be cited as the short title. It includes provisions for income tax on qualified community lenders. The \"Community Savings and Investment Act of 1998\" includes provisions for income tax on qualified community lenders, where the tax imposed is based on a percentage of taxable income exceeding certain thresholds. The term 'qualified community lender' refers to a bank that meets specific criteria, including a satisfactory record of meeting community credit needs, having local community loans comprising at least 60% of total outstanding loans, meeting ownership requirements, and having total assets not exceeding $1,000,000,000. Ownership requirements are met if the bank meets certain criteria. The paragraph discusses the criteria for a bank to be considered a qualified community lender, including ownership requirements related to the location of shareholders. The definition of a \"bank\" for the purpose of being a qualified community lender is based on the location of the main office or state of charter. Interests in the bank are owned by other qualified community lenders with the sole purpose of serving their banking needs. A local community loan is defined as a loan originated by a bank to a resident of the community where the bank is chartered or operates an office accepting deposits. The curr_chunk discusses the definition of a \"related person\" in relation to a bank, including affiliates, directors, officers, principal shareholders, and immediate family members. It also mentions the use of loan proceeds for trade or business purposes in a community. The curr_chunk introduces a new subsection regarding community lender income from an S corporation, outlining the tax implications based on taxable income and community lender income. The curr_chunk discusses the tax rates on community lender income, with rates ranging from zero to the highest rate applicable to the taxpayer. The term \"qualified community lender income\" is defined as taxable income of a qualified community lender. The curr_chunk defines different categories of community lender income for S corporations, including zero-rate and 15 percent community lender income, with special rules for determining the taxpayer's share. The amendments made by this section apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 1998, with income determined under part II of subchapter S after the application of subsection (h). SEC. 3. EXCLUSION FROM INCOME TAXATION FOR INCOME DERIVED FROM BANKING SERVICES WITHIN DISTRESSED COMMUNITIES. This section amends the Internal Revenue Code to exclude income derived from banking services in distressed communities from federal taxation. Gross income can exclude distressed community banking income at the taxpayer's election. Distressed community banking income is the net income from a qualified depository institution operating in a distressed community. A qualified depository institution must be insured, located in a distressed community, and have at least 85% of its loans from that community. The text chunk discusses the definition of a distressed community and the requirements for a qualified depository institution to be considered as such. It also includes a clerical amendment related to the tax code. The amendments in this section pertain to banking services in distressed communities and cross references to other Acts. These changes will be effective for taxable years starting after the enactment of this Act."
