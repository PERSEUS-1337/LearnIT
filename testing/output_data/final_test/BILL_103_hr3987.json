    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Rhinoceros and Tiger Conservation Act of 1994\". The Congress finds that the world's rhinoceros population has declined by 90% since 1970, all rhinoceros species are listed as endangered, and there have been international efforts to halt the sale and trade of rhinoceros products. The Fishermen's Protective Act of 1967 highlighted the trade of rhinoceros and tiger parts between China and Taiwan, impacting international conservation efforts. In 1993, CITES urged stricter measures, including an immediate prohibition on wildlife trade. The Act aims to support conservation programs for rhinoceros and tigers, providing financial resources for nations involved in these efforts. Definitions are also outlined in the Act. The Act defines \"CITES\" as the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, \"conservation\" as methods to prevent extinction of rhinoceros and tigers, and \"fish products\" as aquatic species and their parts. The Act defines \"wildlife products\" as any wild animal taken within a country and all products and parts thereof, excluding fish products for scientific research or sport-hunted trophies. SEC. 5. RHINOCEROS AND TIGER CONSERVATION ASSISTANCE. The Secretary will use funds from the Fund to provide financial assistance for rhinoceros and tiger conservation projects. Project proposals must include details such as project leader, objectives, qualifications of individuals involved, estimated funds and time needed, and support from relevant governmental entities. The Secretary will review project proposals within 6 months to determine eligibility for funding under the Act. Projects must enhance conservation programs for rhinoceros or tigers to be approved. Each person receiving assistance for a conservation project must provide periodic reports to the Secretary with requested information for evaluating progress and success. SEC. 6. RHINOCEROS AND TIGER CONSERVATION FUND. Establishment of the \"Rhinoceros and Tiger Conservation Fund\" in the Treasury's general fund to receive donations and appropriations. The Secretary of the Treasury can use the Fund to provide assistance without further appropriation, with a limit of 6 percent for administration. Acceptance and use of donations are allowed. The Secretary can accept donations to provide assistance under section 5, which will be transferred to the Treasury for deposit into the Fund. SEC. 7. SANCTIONS AGAINST FOREIGN COUNTRIES. The Secretary must review foreign countries affecting rhinoceros or tiger populations and certify any citizen engaging in harmful activities to the President. The President must then consult with the country within 30 days of certification. Additionally, a moratorium on importation must be established within 60 days. The President must direct the Secretary of the Treasury to establish a moratorium on importing fish and wildlife products from a foreign country if consultations are not successful within 60 days of certification. The moratorium must be implemented within 45 days and publicly announced before enforcement. The Secretary will periodically review foreign citizens' activities to determine if the reasons for certification still exist. If reasons no longer exist, the moratorium will be terminated after public comment. Additionally, the effectiveness of the moratorium will be assessed within 6 months of certification for a foreign country. The Secretary will determine if a moratorium is insufficient to improve conservation efforts for rhinoceros or tigers in a foreign country. Certification of this determination will be provided to the President, and it is considered a certification under the Fishermen's Protective Act of 1967. Authorization of appropriations of $10,000,000 for each fiscal year from 1995 to 1999 to carry out the Act."
