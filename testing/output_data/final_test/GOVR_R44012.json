    "content": "Tax expenditures are defined as revenue losses from provisions in Federal tax laws that provide special exclusions, exemptions, deductions, credits, preferential tax rates, or deferrals. They fall under the same budget functions as discretionary and mandatory spending and serve similar policy goals. Tax expenditures aim to measure income accurately, adjust fiscal benefits based on ability-to-pay, and promote desirable activities. The construction of tax expenditures and the income tax system impact who benefits and how much federal revenues are reduced. Exclusions, exemptions, and deductions indirectly lower taxes. Tax expenditures reduce federal revenues by indirectly lowering taxes through exclusions, exemptions, and deductions. These provisions decrease taxable income, with their value increasing as income rises. Tax credits directly reduce taxes owed, with some being refundable. Preferential tax rates lower taxes by taxing certain income at a lower rate. Preferential tax rates may increase as income rises, altering tax payments timing. Tax expenditures are measured relative to a \"normal\" tax system, using a modified Haig-Simons comprehensive income tax as a baseline. Tax expenditures are provisions not essential to the income tax structure. Tax expenditures are provisions that are not essential to the income tax structure, specifically referring to corporate and individual income taxes. Other parts of the Internal Revenue Code may also have exceptions, exclusions, refunds, and credits, but they are not included in tax expenditure budgets. These budgets list the estimated annual revenue losses associated with each tax expenditure and have been required to be published since 1975. The classification of certain provisions as tax expenditures is still being refined. Tax expenditures are provisions that reduce tax liability for qualified taxpayers, functioning more like entitlement programs than discretionary spending. Listing them increases tax system transparency and allows for a comprehensive examination of federal programs. Periodic review is needed to ensure they efficiently meet national goals. Some recommend developing a framework to evaluate tax expenditures. The distribution of tax expenditures is skewed towards individuals, with the top 10 accounting for 66% of forgone revenue. Each tax expenditure is calculated separately. The distribution of tax expenditures is skewed towards individuals, with the top 10 accounting for 66% of forgone revenue. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) analyzed major individual tax expenditures by income distribution, showing that the top quintile claims 51% of the benefits, while the bottom four quintiles claim 49%. The CBO analysis reveals that the top quintile benefits the most from tax expenditures, especially in categories like capital gains, dividends, and itemized deductions. In contrast, tax credits primarily benefit the bottom two quintiles. Trends over time show the scale of revenue forgone from tax expenditures in relation to federal revenue and GDP. The analysis shows that tax expenditures grew rapidly from 1974 to the mid-1980s, then decreased after the Tax Reform Act of 1986. The amount of tax expenditures grew modestly until the 2001/2003 tax cuts, and increased significantly after the enactment of the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 and the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003. This divergence is likely due to tax stimulus measures reducing revenue collections. Tax expenditures are often referred to as \"spending through the tax code\" and can be compared to federal spending levels. In 1974, tax expenditures and discretionary defense spending were similar, but by 2014, tax expenditures were double the size of defense spending. Tax expenditures can be decomposed by budget function for selected years to observe changes in their dispersion. Tax expenditures for health, international affairs, and education have grown significantly over time due to various factors. Broad support exists for base-broadening tax reform, similar to TRA86, but some obstacles may complicate matters. Some policy analysts suggest reforming tax expenditures by converting them into tax credits, either refundable or at a lower rate than the top tax rate. Another option is to cap the value of tax expenditures in dollar terms or as a percentage of income. However, applying these limitations to exclusions and preferential rates poses challenges due to the diverse forms and activities covered by tax expenditures. One possible criterion for limiting tax expenditures could be to remove social policy from the tax code, allowing it to focus on collecting revenue for government spending. Converting tax expenditures into spending programs, like the deduction for classroom expenses, could be a straightforward process. However, for tax expenditures like the Earned Income Tax Credit or student loan interest deduction, the process is less straightforward. Tax expenditures, such as the Earned Income Tax Credit or student loan interest deduction, rely on tax information already collected. Concerns about confidentiality and economic inefficiency exist, but tax expenditures can address market failures or policy goals. For example, retirement savings tax expenditures increase savings levels. In some cases, tax expenditures reduce the burden of complying with the tax system. Tax expenditures, like the exclusion of capital gains on owner-occupied housing, aim to reduce the burden of tax compliance and achieve policy objectives, particularly benefiting low- and middle-income taxpayers. Examples include the EITC, child tax credit, and exclusions of Social Security and Medicare benefits. Some tax expenditures are challenging to quantify and may represent income not received in a given tax year. Tax expenditures, such as pensions, employer health insurance, and Medicare benefits, pose challenges in determining their current value due to future uncertainties. These provisions account for over 20% of revenue loss. Various tax expenditures, like mortgage interest deduction and earned income credit, benefit a large number of taxpayers, reducing their tax burden significantly. Many tax expenditures, including retirement benefits and the child tax credit, are utilized by a significant number of taxpayers and have broad public support. Survey respondents show limited support for reducing tax rates by eliminating deductions for state and local taxes or charitable contributions."
