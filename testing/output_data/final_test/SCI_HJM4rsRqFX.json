This paper introduces two Variational Inference frameworks for generative models of Knowledge Graphs: Latent Fact Model and Latent Information Model. The new framework utilizes parameterisable distributions and back-propagation for scalable training, allowing models to discover probabilistic semantics in the symbolic representation. The paper introduces two Variational Inference frameworks for generative models of Knowledge Graphs, utilizing parameterisable distributions and back-propagation for scalable training. The framework allows for training under any prior distribution and scoring function, displaying efficiency in improving benchmarks with Gaussian prior representations. The ability to represent uncertainty is crucial in fields like physics and biology, with potential applications in link prediction for driving pharmaceutical experiments. Current neural link prediction models lack the ability to express uncertainty, especially in large and incomplete Knowledge Graphs. Generative probabilistic models could leverage variance in parameters for active learning. While some models use dropout for uncertainty, it is only applied at test time, with current models providing point estimates and being trained discriminatively. The article highlights the need for methods to quantify predictive uncertainty in knowledge graph embedding representation. It introduces a framework for scalable probabilistic models using variational inference, addressing the lack of such models in the field. This approach allows for the use of any prior distribution that permits re-parametrisation. In this work, the focus is on variational inference for predicting missing links in large, multi-relational networks like FREEBASE. Specifically, the study concentrates on knowledge graphs, which are graph-structured knowledge bases storing factual information as relationships between entities. Link prediction in knowledge graphs, also known as knowledge base population, is explored. Link prediction in knowledge graphs involves encoding relationships between entities using neural networks. A specific class of link predictors, resembling multi-layer neural networks, has gained attention. These predictors use an encoding layer to map entities to low-dimensional vector representations and a scoring layer to calculate scores for relationships. The architecture for link prediction in knowledge graphs involves encoding entities and relations into low-dimensional vectors using neural networks. The scoring layer calculates scores for entity and relation representations, aiming to associate more likely triples with higher scores and less likely triples with lower scores. Various encoding and scoring strategies exist, but the method discussed makes no additional assumptions about the network architecture. The entity encoder in link prediction models is typically implemented as a simple embedding layer. Different encoding mechanisms like recurrent or convolutional neural networks can also be used. DistMult represents relations using a parameter vector and scores links using a tri-linear dot product. ComplEx extends DistMult using complex-valued embeddings and defines the scoring function accordingly. In the proposed generative models, complex vectors are used to represent triples in a Knowledge Graph. The models assume that the graph was generated based on specific generative models, with embeddings sampled for each triple. The joint probability of the model is determined by the set of latent variables. The Latent Fact Model uses a set of latent variables to define the joint probability of variables. The log-marginal likelihood of the data is bounded by the ELBO. The model assumes randomly generated variables and uses Importance Sampling or Bernoulli Sampling for approximation. The Latent Fact Model uses latent variables to define joint probability, with the ELBO bounding the log-marginal likelihood. The model assumes randomly generated variables and uses Importance Sampling or Bernoulli Sampling for approximation. The probability distribution for sampling from positive and negative sets is defined, leading to an estimate for the ELBO. The Knowledge Graph is generated according to a specific model, with a marginal distribution over the data defined. The log-marginal likelihood of the data under the Latent Information Model is defined by the marginal distribution over D. The ELBO of LIM can be estimated using Bernoulli Sampling, separating the KL term from the observed triples. This simplifies the approximation process, leading to a more straightforward computation. Variational Deep Learning has been successful in document and image modeling. Stochastic variational inference, known as \"Bayes By Backprop,\" has been used to learn probability distributions over model weights. Recent work has focused on word and graph embeddings within a Bayesian framework, but these methods are costly to train due to complex tensor inversions. Recent work has focused on training word embeddings through a variational Bayes framework and probabilistic embedding methods for modeling uncertainties in knowledge graphs. Different generative models have been proposed, with some limitations in scalability and distribution priors. Our work introduces a framework for variational generative models over multi-relational data, unlike previous models that focused on single generative models over uni-relational data. We also differentiate our model from a graph feature model by offering a generative model for knowledge graph embeddings with no constraints on the number of relationships between entities. Our work introduces a framework for variational generative models over multi-relational data. We run experiments over 500 epochs, validating every 50 epochs on KB datasets split into training, development, and test facts. Evaluation includes ranking predictions of corrupted facts under the local closed world assumption. Training involves Bernoulli sampling for ELBO estimation, with various techniques applied. Variational ComplEx shows improvements on WN18 compared to ComplEX, attributed to a well-balanced model. The variational framework outperforms existing non-generative models in identifying symmetric relationships. WordNet18 (WN18) and FB15K datasets are compared, with FB15K-257 being a refined asymmetric dataset. The model is compared to TransG and KG2E for multi-relational generative modeling. The probabilistic embedding method KG2E shows improvements in performance on the WN18 dataset compared to the previous state-of-the-art model. LFM has slightly lower performance on Hits@10, possibly due to differences in negative sample generation methods. Results for models tested on WN18, WN18RR, and FB15K datasets are shown in Table 1. The analysis focused on filtered Hits@ metrics for different models on various datasets. Results were reported from BID39 and BID13 for the ComplEx model. The study examined predictions of subject and object for each test fact, with a focus on accurate relations. The relation \"_derivationally_related_form\" was the most accurate for Hits@1 predictions when removing the subject from the tested fact. The analysis focused on filtered Hits@ metrics for different models on various datasets, with a focus on accurate relations. The \"_member_meronym\" relation was the least accurate for subject Hits@1 predictions, highlighting the need for improvement in asymmetric modeling. The \"_hypernym\" relation was challenging to predict Hits@1 for objects, impacting model performance significantly. The results suggest that the slightly stronger performance of WN18 may be due to covariances in the variational framework capturing symbol frequencies. The variational framework's covariances capture symbol frequencies, confirmed by plotting mean covariance matrices. Covariances grow with frequency, suggesting a preference for predicting relationships between less frequent symbols. High-dimensional embeddings are projected to two dimensions using PPCA and NNMF. Parameters for a bivariate normal distribution are obtained, and sampling is done 1,000 times. After obtaining parameters for a bivariate normal distribution, sampling is done 1,000 times to visualize the space in which entities or relations occupy. A clustering of subject, object, and predicate for a positive fact is shown in Figure 4, with a clear separation from randomly sampled corrupted entities likely to create negative facts. The first test fact \"(USA, Commonbloc0, Netherlands)\" displays irrational similarity between objects, with corrupted entity Jordan far from the items in the test. The analysis shows that the corrupted entity Jordan is far from the items in the tested fact, indicating a lack of commonality with USA or Netherlands. The framework allows for learning embeddings of any prior distribution, supporting the idea of probabilistic semantics. This reduces parameters by using a re-parametrisation trick with scoring functions, eliminating the need for regularisation terms. The Gaussian distribution is self-regularising, eliminating the need for tuning a regularisation term for an l1/l2 loss term. Preliminary experiments show competitive results with current models, enabling knowledge graph researchers to create better predictive uncertainty models. Further exploration into encoding functions and measuring uncertainty estimates is recommended."
