    "content": "The \"National Care Corps Act of 2014\" establishes the National Care Corps, defines key terms like Corps and Director, and outlines the Local Care Corps program funded by grants. The Secretary of Health and Human Services is also defined in the Act. The National Care Corps is established in the Department of Health and Human Services to provide services to individuals in need through local Care Corps programs. The Director of the Corps is appointed by the Secretary and is responsible for designing, developing, and administering Corps programs. The Director may employ staff as necessary to carry out the Act. Selection and eligibility of members are outlined in Section 4 of the Act. The Director selects eligible individuals for membership in the Corps, complying with nondiscrimination laws. To be eligible, individuals must be at least 18 years old, commit to a maximum of 24 months in the Corps, submit an application, and pass a criminal background check. Before selecting any individual for membership in the Corps, the Director shall request a criminal background check. An individual may be ineligible if they refuse consent or if the check does not demonstrate their fitness for Corps service. SEC. 5. AUTHORIZED BENEFITS FOR CORPS MEMBERS. The Director shall provide Corps members with allowances, health insurance, and post-service educational awards to support their maintenance, health, and capacity to serve effectively. Allowances include living, travel, and leave allowances, as well as housing, transportation, supplies, equipment, and subsistence. Health insurance coverage meeting minimum essential requirements and post-service educational awards will also be provided. The Director will establish an educational award for Corps members based on their service duration. The award amount for a 12-month full-time service is equivalent to the maximum Federal Pell Grant value. Corps members can receive up to 2 such awards. Corps members who complete less than a 12-month term of service may receive a portion of the educational award corresponding to their completed service. The award can be used for higher education costs or to repay loans for education expenses. The term \"cost of attendance\" and \"institution of higher education\" are defined in the Higher Education Act of 1965. The Director will issue necessary regulations to implement this section. SEC. 6. ASSIGNMENT OF CORPS MEMBERS TO SENIORS AND INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES. The Director assigns Corps members to local Care Corps programs, with priority given to areas lacking services for individuals in need. Corps members provide approved services directly to individuals in home-based settings. Corps members provide person-to-person, supportive relationships to individuals in home-based settings to support independent living. Prohibited services include professional medical care, administrative support, care in institutional settings, and care prohibited by State law. The Director may issue guidance on the scope of services provided by Corps members, with a public comment period. An \"individual in need\" is defined as someone at least 65 years old or with a disability, having difficulty with self-care, and meeting other criteria determined by the Director. SEC. 7. TRAINING AND STANDARDS OF CONDUCT.\n\nThe Director will develop a training program for Corps members, including at least 20 hours of instruction and other necessary requirements. Standards of conduct will be established to ensure proper behavior within the Corps.\n\nSEC. 8. STATUS OF CORPS MEMBERS UNDER FEDERAL LAW. Members of the Corps are not considered Federal employees except for work-related injuries, where they are treated as employees of the United States for compensation purposes under certain conditions. Members of the Corps are treated as employees of the United States for tort claims liability and procedure under chapter 171 of title 28, United States Code. The Secretary of Health and Human Services must provide an annual report to Congress on the Corps, including details on the population served, an evaluation of operations, and any recommendations for improvement. Additionally, there are provisions for the Local Care Corps Programs. Local Care Corps programs are responsible for conducting training, assigning members to individuals in need, maintaining records, and carrying out activities as directed by the Director. Grants may be awarded to qualified entities for operating these programs. Qualified entities are defined as public or private nonprofit organizations within the aging network. Qualified entities eligible for grants under this program include aging network organizations, time-banking agencies, volunteer organizing agencies, and government entities. To apply for a grant, the entity must submit an application to the Director and comply with the terms and conditions set by the Director. Authorization of appropriations is set at $350,000,000 for each fiscal year after the enactment of the Act, with funds remaining available for the following fiscal year."
