    "content": "SECTION 1. FINDINGS. Congress finds that the estimated veteran population is 22,328,000, with nearly 30 percent living in rural areas. Younger veterans from Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom are more likely to live in rural areas and are reported to be in poorer health. Rural veterans often have to travel long distances for medical care despite the Department of Veterans Affairs having numerous facilities. Rural veterans make up 41 percent of the total veteran population. (6) Rural veterans make up 41 percent of veterans enrolled in the Department of Veterans Affairs patient enrollment system. (7) A higher percentage of rural veterans have disabilities compared to urban veterans. (8) Over 150,000 Armed Forces members transition to veteran status annually. (9) Transitioning from the Department of Defense to the Department of Veterans Affairs involves data coordination. (10) Developing electronic health records is crucial. Developing electronic health records is crucial for both the Department of Defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs to ensure greater availability of healthcare information for members of the Armed Forces and veterans. Transportation grants for rural veterans service organizations are addressed in Section 2. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs will establish a grant program to provide innovative transportation options to veterans in highly rural areas. Grants can be used to help veterans travel to VA medical centers and provide medical care in these areas, with a maximum amount of $50,000 per grant and no matching funds required from recipients. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs will establish a grant program for innovative transportation options in highly rural areas. Grants up to $50,000 per recipient can be used for travel to VA medical centers. Unused funds must be returned by September 30. The Secretary will provide annual reports to Congress on grant recipients. Regulations will be set for evaluating applications and program administration. The grant program for innovative transportation options in highly rural areas will include the name of the grant recipient and the amount of the grant. A veterans service organization is defined as any organization recognized by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs for the representation of veterans. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs is required to conduct outreach to educate veterans and their families about transportation options to VA medical facilities in rural areas. This includes a pilot program for implementing electronic health record systems in rural VA facilities. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs, in cooperation with the Secretary of Defense, will conduct a pilot program at rural VA medical facilities to implement electronic health record systems for interoperability between the Department of Defense and VA, improve healthcare quality for veterans, and provide technological advances for physicians and personnel. The pilot program aims to provide access to complete health information for discharged Armed Forces members and improve electronic health record accessibility, efficiency, and use at selected rural VA medical facilities. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs will submit annual reports to Congress on the program's progress. The annual reports to Congress on the pilot program's progress will evaluate best practices for healthcare in rural areas, education and training at participating medical facilities, and the healthcare provided to rural veterans."
