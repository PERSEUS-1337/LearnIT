    "content": "Human communication goes beyond understanding the topic at hand; it also involves recognizing and responding to the emotions of the conversation partner. Research in this area is challenging due to the lack of suitable datasets for emotions and dialogues. A new task for empathetic dialogue generation is proposed, along with the EmpatheticDialogues dataset containing 25k conversations grounded in emotional situations. Experiments show that dialogue models using this dataset are perceived as more empathetic by human evaluators and perform better on various metrics compared to models trained on internet conversation data. The curr_chunk discusses the importance of empathetic responses in natural communication, citing examples from studies and chatbots. It emphasizes the need for dialogue agents to react empathetically to others' feelings. The curr_chunk introduces a new task for dialogue systems to respond empathetically to people discussing everyday situations, based on a dataset of personal dialogues. It aims to evaluate machines' ability to show empathy in conversations. The dataset for empathetic dialogues contains a wide range of emotions and involves speakers sharing personal stories with listeners. The conversations aim to evaluate machines' ability to show empathy in everyday situations. The dataset for empathetic dialogues contains a variety of emotions and personal stories shared between speakers and listeners. The conversations evaluate machines' empathy in everyday situations, including one-on-one interactions with diverse emotional labels. The proposed open resource for empathetic dialogues involves crowdsourced one-on-one conversations covering a wide range of emotions. Training a dialogue system using neural networks on conversation corpora shows promise for better generalization. Fine-tuning the dialogue agent on this dataset leads to improved performance on empathetic tasks, with pretraining on Internet conversation data being the most time-consuming step. Comparisons are made to facilitate model performance improvement with minimal re-training and resource reuse. The study introduces a new empathetic dialogue dataset and demonstrates how training on this dataset can enhance the performance of an end-to-end dialogue system. Various methods of supplementing a pretrained model with additional representations are compared to improve performance without extensive re-training. Emotions play a crucial role in responding effectively, with different schemas attempting to categorize emotions based on biological responses and contextual cues. The curr_chunk discusses the incorporation of emotions from various annotation schemas in dialogue scenarios, utilizing multidimensional distributional embeddings for rich information representation. The current state of the art in emotion classification relies on deep networks pretrained on large-scale weakly labeled data from social media content. The SEMEVAL2019 EmoContext challenge uses conversation data for detecting a wide range of emotions. The curr_chunk discusses emotions extracted from Twitter exchanges and the limitations of using public social media content for training models intended for one-on-one conversations. The content is influenced by the presence of large peripheral audiences, leading to curated self-presentation and different subject choices compared to private conversations. The curr_chunk discusses generating balanced emotions in one-on-one conversations, contrasting with Twitter's limited character format. Previous works focused on personal contexts in chit-chat dialogue models. The DAILYDIALOG dataset includes dialogues from educational websites for English learners. The curr_chunk discusses dialogues from educational websites for English learners, annotated with emotion labels. Only a small percentage of utterances have emotions other than \"none\" or \"happy\". The focus is on emotionally grounded situations with a diverse set of emotions and an empathetic listener in the conversation. Previous works have controlled emotional content in text responses. The curr_chunk discusses generating empathetic responses based on text signals, focusing on producing appropriate responses without pre-specified emotions. It explores one-on-one conversations grounded in emotional situations. The curr_chunk discusses one-on-one conversations grounded in emotional situations, where a Speaker initiates a conversation about a situation with an emotion label, and the Listener responds. The models tested in the role of Listener do not have access to the situation description provided by the Speaker. The dataset comprises 24,850 conversations about emotional situations, gathered from 810 participants using the ParlAI framework and Amazon Mechanical Turk. Emotion label prompts are evenly distributed, with conversations averaging 4.3 utterances and 15.2 words per utterance. The conversations are 4-8 utterances long on average. The dataset consists of 24,850 conversations about emotional situations, with an average utterance length of 15.2 words. The conversations were split into train, validation, and test partitions. The final split resulted in 19533 train, 2770 validation, and 2547 test conversations. The dataset is used to train models for generating empathetic conversation responses. The model plays the Listener role and has access to previous utterances during testing. The dialogue model, based on Transformer networks, is trained to generate or retrieve responses in a conversation context. In the retrieval setting, the model selects the best response from a set of candidates using Transformer encoders for context and response candidates. The model selects candidate sentences based on dot product similarity between context and candidates. Training uses a large batch size for more negative examples. In inference, candidate sentences are from various dialogue datasets. Each candidate is tokenized and encoded for retrieval. The system uses a Transformer architecture to predict replies from Reddit conversations. The model is trained to minimize negative log-likelihood and uses diverse beam search during inference. Training data includes 1.7 billion Reddit conversations with a limit of 100 word tokens for context and response. The Transformer networks used in experiments have a base architecture of four layers and six transformer heads. Models are trained for up to 10 epochs with 300-d word embeddings pretrained on common-crawl data. Fine-tuning over task domain data may improve the model's empathy, as data was collected with instructions to be empathetic in one-on-one settings. Pretrained models are fine-tuned to predict the next utterance over EMPATHETICDIALOGUES with a context window of four previous utterances. These models are referred to as \"Base\" models. In experiments, the base architecture of Transformer networks is fine-tuned for empathy by predicting emotion labels in conversations. This involves altering the objective function to optimize for predicting emotion labels and adding a linear layer to predict emotions from context sentences. The base architecture of Transformer networks is fine-tuned for empathy by predicting emotion labels in conversations. Existing models pretrained on supervised tasks like predicting emoji labels can be combined with the base architecture for benefits from previous training and external data. Ways to incorporate additional supervised information include using the context representation as input to a classifier and generating the next utterance, or running input sequences through a pretrained classifier. The input sequence is processed through a pretrained classifier to generate top k output labels, which are then fed into the corresponding encoder to produce a hidden representation. This approach aims to enhance model performance by leveraging additional supervised information and increasing the effective capacity of the resulting models. In order to assess the impact of different architecture set-ups or supervision domains on performance improvement, two methods are tested: prepending predicted label words and ensemble learning over encoders trained on prediction objectives. Prepending predicted labels is a simple way to add supervised information to data without modifying the architecture, using top-K predicted labels from a classifier. This method has been used for controlling text style and involves running both context and candidates through a fastText model as the prediction architecture. We experiment with two sources of supervision (EMOPREPEND and TOPICPREPEND) by training a classifier to predict emotion labels from the situation descriptions in EMPATHETICDIALOGUES. Additionally, we explore using an Ensemble encoder from the 20-Newsgroup dataset for topic classification in our Transformer networks. The text chunk discusses how a Transformer encoder is used in a dialogue model, along with a pretrained classifier, to incorporate emotion-related supervision from sources like Twitter emojis and social media content labeled with emotions. The model's linear layers are trained while the base encoder and classifier are frozen. The text chunk discusses training a second Transformer encoder (ENSEM-TRAN) using social media content labeled with emotion tags to reproduce the Listener's portion of a conversation. Evaluation is done using automated metrics like BLEU scores and human judgment to assess dialogue quality. The evaluation includes reporting perplexity of the gold response and computing accuracy of retrieval systems at choosing the correct response out of a hundred examples. Human ratings were collected through crowdsourcing tasks on MTurk to score model responses based on different aspects, including acknowledging the conversation partner's feelings. The evaluation involved collecting human ratings on model responses based on empathy/sympathy, relevance, and fluency. Participants were asked to choose the better response between two models in a task where only differing responses were provided. Fine-tuning for conversation responses improved automated metrics, with in-domain candidates leading to higher BLEU scores. Fine-tuning a conversational model on EMPATHETICDIALOGUES data and using candidates from the dataset significantly enhances performance on all metrics, especially the Empathy subscore. The improvement mainly stems from fine-tuning on the dataset, with slight enhancements in Empathy rating observed in the multitask setting. Model capacity remains unchanged despite the performance boost. The multitask setting slightly increases the capacity of the base architecture, which may account for the performance improvement. Results for a larger Transformer model are also provided, showing that a generative model trained on the data performs as well as a generative pretrained Transformer model with one extra layer. Augmenting conversation models with external pretrained classifiers is discussed in TAB1. In TAB1, retrieval models with external classifiers show worsened accuracy but improved BLEU scores. Generative models only improve with ensemble setting. Human evaluations in TAB2 indicate models generally enhance Empathy scores, with Ensem-Tran performing best. Models with topic classifiers improve relevance significantly, while fluency scores remain stable. Combining pretrained models minimizes re-training and leverages existing models effectively. Pre-training larger Transformer models and fine-tuning on data leads to better performance. Augmenting models with pre-trained unsupervised sentence representations in an ensemble setting shows promise for future investigations. Model responses focus on speaker feelings and topics, with different components providing generic or specific responses. Responses from retrieval systems are often preferred over generation systems, with models incorporating emotion supervision ranking higher. The ratio of selecting a line from a model with emotion supervision is significantly higher compared to raw pretrained models. Additionally, models fine-tuned on data show promise in capturing speaker feelings and topics. In the retrieval case, raters generally picked lines equally from models with emotion supervision and base models. However, in the generation case, raters favored models with explicit emotion supervision. A new dataset of 25k dialogues grounded in specific emotion labels improved empathy in conversation models. Augmenting fine-tuned models with an external pretrained classifier can enhance performance without extensive retraining. Future work will explore integrating empathetic responses into general dialogue. The dataset of 25k dialogues grounded in specific emotion labels aims to improve empathy in conversation models. Crowdsourced dialogues were collected using the ParlAI platform to interact with Amazon Mechanical Turk. Workers were asked to select an emotion word and describe a situation when they felt that way, followed by having a conversation about each situation. This data could potentially serve as weakly supervised data for more complex emotion-related tasks. The hope is that these results will inspire further research in making dialog systems more empathetic. In the first stage of the task, workers describe a personal situation based on a given emotion label. They are asked to keep the descriptions brief, averaging 19.8 words. In the second stage, workers engage in short conversations about their described situations, with each conversation consisting of 4-8 utterances on average. The goal is to improve empathy in conversation models using dialogues grounded in specific emotion labels. After initial data collection rounds, workers were guided to select less chosen emotion labels to ensure balanced prompt coverage for conversations. This approach aimed to address biases towards easier-to-describe situations and prepare conversation models for handling less frequent emotions. Workers were recruited using MTurk to contribute situation descriptions and conversations. Each worker had to provide at least one situation description and one pair of conversations as Speaker and Listener. Additional contributions were allowed, with a median of 8 conversations per worker. The speaker talks about their chickens, including 2 Australorps, 3 Rhode Island Reds, 3 Barred Plymouth Rocks, and 1 Welsummer, with 4 turning out to be roosters. They mention one hen named Curly and express frustration with the roosters crowing. The speaker also shares winning $100 on a scratch-off lottery ticket, expressing shock as they usually don't win. The listener reacts positively and asks about their lottery playing habits. The speaker won $100 on a scratch-off lottery ticket and shared their experience with coworkers. They hand-checked random subsets of conversations by their most-frequent workers to ensure quality. Their dataset can be used to train an emotion classifier, and they added qualifications to limit active workers to 100 conversations. Human evaluations were collected on MTurk for model comparison tasks. Workers rated responses from different models and selected their preferences. Scores less than 1 indicated a preference for one model, while scores greater than 1 indicated a preference for the other model."
