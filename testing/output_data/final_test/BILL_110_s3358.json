    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Improving Food-borne Illness Surveillance and Response Act of 2008\" and includes enhanced food-borne illness surveillance measures. The \"Improving Food-borne Illness Surveillance and Response Act of 2008\" mandates the Secretary of Health and Human Services to strengthen food-borne illness surveillance systems to prevent outbreaks and improve response efforts. The definition of a food-borne illness outbreak is when 2 or more cases of a similar illness occur from consuming a common food. The Secretary, through the CDC Director, will enhance surveillance systems to address these issues. The \"Improving Food-borne Illness Surveillance and Response Act of 2008\" mandates enhancing food-borne illness surveillance systems to improve data collection, analysis, and reporting. This includes coordinating systems to produce better information on illnesses associated with foods and facilitating data sharing among governmental agencies. Additionally, systems will be augmented to improve attribution of food-borne illness outbreaks to specific foods. The \"Improving Food-borne Illness Surveillance and Response Act of 2008\" aims to enhance surveillance systems by developing tools for obtaining exposure data, improving tracebacks to identify contaminated food products, implementing fingerprinting strategies for infectious agents, and allowing public access to surveillance data. Additionally, it includes publishing annual reports on findings and exploring the establishment of registries for long-term case follow-up. The \"Improving Food-borne Illness Surveillance and Response Act of 2008\" aims to enhance surveillance systems by developing tools for obtaining exposure data, improving tracebacks to identify contaminated food products, implementing fingerprinting strategies for infectious agents, and allowing public access to surveillance data. It also includes establishing a flexible mechanism for supporting scientific research by academic centers of excellence. The Act aims to improve state surveillance capacity by supporting outbreak investigations with specialty expertise and implementing model practices at the state and local level. The Act aims to improve state surveillance capacity by facilitating rapid shipment of clinical isolates, conducting standardized interviews, and sharing information timely among public health agencies, the food industry, healthcare providers, and the public. The Act focuses on enhancing surveillance capacity by developing training curricula, integrating new diagnostic tools, supporting research for pathogen subtyping, establishing core competencies for public health labs, and facilitating regional collaboration. The Secretary will support core food safety functions of State and local public health laboratories by facilitating partnerships, providing technical assistance, partnering with the FDA for communication, and developing standardized response procedures. The Secretary will support core food safety functions of State and local public health laboratories by establishing fellowships, training personnel, forming partnerships between private and public labs, strengthening surveillance systems, and providing data systems hardware and software. Additionally, a diverse working group of experts and stakeholders will be established to improve food-borne illness surveillance and response. A diverse working group of experts and stakeholders from various sectors will provide advice and recommendations to the Secretary on improving food-borne illness surveillance and implementation. This includes prioritizing information needs, enhancing initiatives at different levels, and promoting coordination among regulatory agencies and industry stakeholders. The working group will focus on improving food-borne illness surveillance by enhancing access to data, identifying barriers, and proposing specific actions with measurable objectives and timelines. SEC. 399JJ. PLAN TO IMPROVE FOOD SAFETY CAPACITY AT THE STATE AND LOCAL LEVEL. The Secretary aims to enhance food safety capacity at State and local agencies to achieve goals such as improving outbreak response, surveillance, and oversight at the retail level. This includes strengthening inspection and enforcement in food processing establishments to ensure compliance with safety standards. The Secretary aims to enhance food safety capacity at State and local agencies by conducting a survey to assess staffing levels, expertise, laboratory capacity, information systems, and needs for improvement. The Secretary plans to develop and implement a national food safety system, including criteria for assessing State and local capacity for food safety functions. The Secretary plans to develop a national food safety system with priorities for enhancing State and local agencies, action plans for capacity needs, improved coordination among agencies, and integration of inspection programs. The curr_chunk discusses joint planning and priority setting between Administration and State/local agencies, eliminating barriers to information flow, expanding State inspection of processing establishments, and reliance on the Food and Drug Administration. The curr_chunk discusses the Food and Drug Administration's reliance on State inspection and food sample analyses in Federal enforcement activities, along with the allocation of grants to enhance State and local food safety capacity. $25,000,000 is authorized for each fiscal year from 2010 to 2012 for this purpose. A report to Congress is required within one year of the enactment of the Improving Food-borne Illness Surveillance and Response Act. The Secretary must submit an annual report to Congress detailing the progress and obstacles in implementing the Improving Food-borne Illness Surveillance and Response Act of 2008, along with any legislative recommendations or additional resources needed for full implementation."
