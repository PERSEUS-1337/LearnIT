    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Small Business Compliance Assistance Enhancement Act of 2005\". Congress finds that small businesses play a significant role in the economy, representing 99.7 percent of all employers, generating a majority of new jobs, and facing higher regulatory burdens compared to larger firms. The Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996 requires agencies to produce compliance guides for small entities, but agencies have rarely complied with this requirement and often did not provide adequate assistance materials. The Fairness Act of 1996 aims to clarify requirements for agencies to produce compliance guides for small businesses and ensure the provision of useful assistance materials to help small businesses comply with regulations. SEC. 3. ENHANCED COMPLIANCE ASSISTANCE FOR SMALL BUSINESSES. Enhanced compliance assistance for small businesses through the publication of small entity compliance guides to help with regulatory flexibility analysis. Guides must be easily accessible on agency websites and distributed to relevant industries. The publication of small entity compliance guides is required to assist small businesses in understanding and complying with regulations. The guides must be distributed to industry contacts and published on agency websites before the effective date of the rule. Compliance actions for small entities are explained in the guides. The explanation under subparagraph (A) includes actions needed to meet rule requirements for small entities. Possible procedures, like conducting tests, may be described to assist small entities. Procedures suggested under subparagraph (B)(ii) are not additional requirements. The agency, at its discretion, will ensure that guides for small entities are written in plain language. Separate guides may be prepared for groups of small entities, and reporting is required within one year of the Small Business Compliance Assistance enactment. The Small Business Compliance Assistance Enhancement Act of 2005 requires agencies to report annually on their compliance with specific paragraphs. Additionally, a technical amendment to the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996 is made."
