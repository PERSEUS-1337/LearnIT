    "content": "The Act titled \"Private Security Officer Quality Assurance Act of 1996\" is also known as the \"Short Title\". It includes findings outlined in Section 2. Congress finds that private security officers are experiencing rapid growth in the United States, offering entry-level opportunities for job seekers, including those affected by unemployment. Sworn law enforcement officers play a crucial role in public safety, with private security officers providing supplementary prevention and reporting services. The increase in private shopping malls has led to more interactions between the American public and private security personnel on a daily basis. The public has difficulty discerning between sworn law enforcement officers and private security personnel. The American public demands well-trained private security personnel as an adjunct, not a replacement for law enforcement officers. SEC. 3. BACKGROUND CHECKS. An association of employers of private security officers can submit fingerprints or other identification methods to the Attorney General for applicants seeking a State license as a private security officer. The Attorney General can exchange identification and criminal history records with State agencies for licensing and employment purposes. The Attorney General has the authority to establish regulations for this process. The Attorney General can establish regulations for the submission of fingerprints by employers of private security officers for State licensing purposes. The regulations may include measures for information security, audits, and fees. The Attorney General is required to report to the Senate and House Committees on the Judiciary on the inquiries made by employers under this section after 2 years of the bill's enactment. Congress believes that States should participate in the background check system, as established in section 3. Definitions are provided in section 5. The Act defines terms such as \"employee,\" \"employer,\" and \"private security officer,\" specifying the roles and responsibilities of individuals involved in providing security services. The Act defines a private security officer as an individual engaged in specific security activities, excluding sworn police officers, licensed professionals, and certain internal audit or credit function employees.
