    "content": "The Obama Administration's FY2017 budget request includes at least $925,000 in foreign aid for Brazil. The IMF revised down its forecast for the Brazilian economy, estimating a 3.8% contraction in 2015 and forecasting a 3.5% contraction in 2016. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 authorized reforms to the IMF, providing greater voting power to Brazil and other emerging economies, along with $10.5 million in foreign assistance for Brazil. Brazil received $10.5 million in foreign assistance for conservation programs in the Amazon. Impeachment proceedings were initiated against President Rousseff for violating fiscal laws. A public health emergency was declared due to an increase in infants born with microcephaly possibly linked to the Zika virus. President Rousseff met with President Obama at the White House, signaling cooperation between the two countries. President Obama signed the Trade Preferences Extension Act of 2015, extending the Generalized System of Preferences program through 2017, benefiting Brazil. The Brazilian Congress approved two defense cooperation agreements with the United States, pending since 2010. President Dilma Rousseff of the Workers Party assumed office in January 2011. President Dilma Rousseff of the center-left Workers Party (PT) took office in January 2011 following her predecessors' notable progress in democratic governance, stabilizing the economy, and reducing social disparities. Brazil benefited from favorable economic conditions prior to her election, but economic challenges arose during her term. Rousseff struggled to address weak growth and popular discontent, yet narrowly won reelection. In her second term, she faces difficulties in fulfilling campaign promises of protecting social welfare programs and maintaining low unemployment while implementing austerity measures. President Dilma Rousseff of Brazil has faced economic challenges and a major corruption scandal, leading to a significant decline in her public approval rating. She has lost support from some legislators and is facing impeachment proceedings. Brazil, with a population of 204.5 million, declared independence from Portugal in 1822 and abolished slavery in 1888. Brazil became a republic in 1889, with economic and political power concentrated in the hands of large landowners. The authoritarian government of Get\u00falio Vargas (1930-1945) incorporated the working classes but controlled labor tightly. Vargas also expanded the state's role in the economy and pursued import-substitution industrialization. The military seized power in a 1964 coup, leading to two decades of authoritarian rule (1964-1985). During the military era in Brazil, the dictatorship stifled democracy and civic action while pursuing state-led development. The regime was responsible for the deaths and disappearances of at least 434 people. Brazil transitioned back to civilian rule in 1985, establishing a liberal democracy with a strong president, bicameral Congress, and independent judiciary. The constitution, enacted in 1988, decentralized power under a federal structure with 26 states. Power in Brazil is decentralized under a federal structure with 26 states, a federal district, and over 5,500 municipalities. The country faced economic recession and political uncertainty after the transition to democracy, with efforts to control inflation failing. President Fernando Henrique Cardoso stabilized the situation during his two terms from 1995 to 2002, implementing the successful anti-inflation \"Real Plan.\" President Itamar Franco (1992-1994) implemented a new currency, the real, pegged to the U.S. dollar, along with a strict monetary policy and significant fiscal adjustments. Annual inflation dropped from 2,730% in 1993 to around 18% in 1995. President Fernando Henrique Cardoso continued economic reforms by privatizing state-owned enterprises and opening up the economy to foreign trade and investment. However, macroeconomic stability remained a challenge, especially after the 1997 East Asian and 1998 Russian financial crises led to capital flight and a 40% devaluation of the real. President Fernando Henrique Cardoso implemented economic reforms, including privatizing state-owned enterprises and opening up the economy. Despite a 40% devaluation of the real, he laid the foundation for Brazil's macroeconomic stability. His policies, such as a floating exchange rate and income transfer programs, were continued by subsequent administrations. Luis In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, known as Lula, maintained market-oriented economic policies during his presidency starting in 2002. During his presidency, Lula continued market-oriented economic policies, controlled expenditures, raised the budget surplus, and expanded social programs like Bolsa Familia. Despite a vote-buying scandal involving top PT officials, he was reelected in 2006. Lula also increased the state's role in economic development. During his second term, Lula expanded social welfare programs, raised the minimum wage, and implemented stimulus measures to counter the global financial crisis. His administration's timely policies helped the Brazilian economy recover, with a 7.6% growth in 2010. Lula also increased the state's involvement in exploiting Brazil's offshore oil reserves for long-term economic development. Lula's administration focused on social welfare programs, minimum wage increases, and stimulus measures to combat the global financial crisis. His policies led to a significant reduction in poverty and income inequality in Brazil between 2001 and 2011. The decline in income inequality was attributed to increases in the minimum wage and the Bolsa Fam\u00edlia program. President Dilma Rousseff of the center-left PT struggled to address Brazil's deteriorating economic situation during her first term, facing popular unrest and mass demonstrations in June 2013. Despite opposition criticism, Rousseff and the PT convinced many Brazilians that they would protect popular social welfare programs. President Dilma Rousseff narrowly won reelection with 51.6% of the vote, but now faces economic and political challenges. She is struggling to fulfill campaign promises while implementing austerity measures to boost growth. Rousseff's political standing has declined due to economic deterioration and a corruption scandal implicating officials in her coalition. Brazil experienced rapid economic growth between 2003 and 2010, driven by international demand for commodities. President Dilma Rousseff faces impeachment proceedings amid economic challenges, trying to stimulate domestic consumption and protect industries. President Dilma Rousseff's administration implemented short-term tax cuts and subsidized credit to keep unemployment low, but this eroded the budget surplus and led to high inflation. To combat this, fuel and electricity prices were kept low, deterring investment and causing economic growth to slow significantly. Facing the threat of losing Brazil's credit rating, Rousseff shifted to austerity measures to stabilize the country's debt levels after her reelection. The Rousseff Administration implemented austerity measures to stabilize Brazil's debt levels and boost growth, including budget freezes, ministry reductions, and cuts to pension and unemployment benefits. The Central Bank raised interest rates to combat inflation, but the economy continued to deteriorate with a 3.8% contraction in 2015 and an expected 3.5% contraction in 2016. Unemployment reached 9% in August-October, with 1.5 million jobs lost in the formal economy. In 2015, Brazil's formal economy lost 1.5 million jobs, leading to a 9% unemployment rate. Real median wages decreased by 1%, and inflation stood at 10.7%. The Rousseff Administration failed to meet its budget surplus target, resulting in a deficit of 1.9%. Brazil's sovereign credit rating was downgraded to \"junk\" status by two major credit agencies, prompting investors to withdraw funds. The IMF recommends Brazil to restore a fiscal surplus quickly. The IMF suggests Brazil needs to restore fiscal surplus, lower inflation, and address growth impediments like infrastructure bottlenecks and a complex tax system. Some economists believe regaining market credibility requires negotiating with the IMF. President Rousseff's resistance to austerity measures and political battles in Congress hinder economic adjustments. The ongoing impeachment debate further delays addressing Brazil's economic challenges. President Rousseff has been managing the fallout of a major corruption scandal in Brazil involving collusion among construction and engineering firms to inflate contract prices with Petrobras. Over $3 billion was allegedly funneled to corrupt executives and politicians. More than 100 individuals have been indicted, 13 companies charged, and several politicians arrested, including top officials in Rousseff's PT party. Despite serving as Petrobras chairwoman from 2003-2010, prosecutors have not found evidence implicating Rousseff in the corruption scheme. Despite anti-corruption legislation enacted during Rousseff's first term, prosecutors have not found evidence linking her to the corruption scheme involving collusion among construction and engineering firms to inflate contract prices with Petrobras. Rousseff's political support has significantly declined as more information about the scandal has emerged, with her public approval rating dropping from 23% to 11% and her disapproval rating rising from 44% to 65% between February and December 2015. This lack of popular support has hindered her ability to negotiate with the Brazilian Congress, despite her electoral coalition winning a majority of seats in the Chamber of Deputies and the Federal Senate in the 2014 elections. Despite winning a majority of seats in the Federal Senate in the 2014 elections, President Rousseff has faced challenges in advancing her policy agenda due to her administration's austerity policies. She has struggled to maintain support from allied legislators, including some from her own party who oppose her economic policy shift. In December 2015, impeachment proceedings were initiated against Rousseff by Brazilian Chamber of Deputies President Eduardo Cunha. President Rousseff faced impeachment proceedings initiated by Brazilian Chamber of Deputies President Eduardo Cunha for alleged fiscal misconduct, driven by political factors. President Rousseff faces impeachment proceedings initiated by Brazilian Chamber of Deputies President Eduardo Cunha. She maintains there is no legal justification for her impeachment, calling it a \"coup.\" Rousseff's opponents need two-thirds majorities in both houses of Congress to impeach her. Most analysts believe she currently has enough support to remain in office, but this could change if evidence links her to the Petrobras scandal or if economic conditions worsen. Efforts to address Brazil's economic challenges are likely stalled until the political crisis is resolved. The United States and Brazil have strong political and economic relations with active bilateral dialogues on various issues. Despite occasional strains due to divergent national interests, both countries have recognized each other as important global partners. Brazil's opposition to international efforts to diplomatically isolate Russia and reluctance to criticize Venezuela's government's actions have led to a different approach than the United States. Brazilian officials have also been disappointed by the U.S. government's lack of support for Brazil's efforts to become a permanent member of a reformed U.N. Security Council and IMF reforms. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 authorized the IMF reforms, pending since December 2010, despite NSA activities in Brazil impeding bilateral relations. The NSA's activities in Brazil, including spying on President Rousseff and Petrobras, led to strained bilateral cooperation. This resulted in Brazil postponing a state visit to Washington and making decisions to terminate contracts with U.S. companies in favor of European competitors. Rousseff denounced the NSA's actions as a breach of international law and a threat to democratic governance. \"In the absence of the right to privacy, there can be no true freedom of expression and opinion, and therefore no effective democracy. Friendly governments cannot allow recurring illegal actions to take place as if they were normal. The U.S. and Brazilian governments have moved past the surveillance dispute and signed a memorandum of understanding in October 2014. Rousseff appointed her former ambassador as foreign minister and emphasized the importance of improving the relationship with the United States during her January 2015 inaugural address.\" During her visit to the United States in June 2015, Brazilian President Rousseff met with President Obama at the White House. The Brazilian Congress approved defense cooperation agreements and a tax information exchange agreement. The two countries are collaborating on addressing the Zika virus outbreak. Brazil has received decreasing amounts of U.S. assistance in recent years, with $1.4 million requested for FY2016. The Obama Administration requested $1.4 million in assistance for Brazil in FY2016. $500,000 for HIV/AIDS strategy, $625,000 for military training, and $240,000 for trade control compliance. Congress included $10.5 million for environmental programs in the Brazilian Amazon. FY2017 budget request includes at least $925,000 for Brazil. USAID is working with Brazil's development agency. International Development (USAID) is collaborating with Brazil's development agency, the Brazilian Cooperation Agency (ABC), in third countries through trilateral development initiatives. They are working together on agricultural productivity, food security, renewable energy, and citizen security programs in countries like Haiti, Honduras, and Mozambique. Brazil declared a public health emergency due to an increase in infants born with microcephaly. The increase in microcephaly cases in Brazil, suspected to be linked to Zika virus, has raised concerns among health officials. Pregnant women infected with Zika may pass the virus to their unborn children, increasing the risk of microcephaly. Brazilian health officials have investigated over 1,100 suspected cases, with 17 confirmed to have been infected by Zika. The Brazilian government has launched a \"National Plan to Combat Aedes and Microcephaly\" to address the increase in microcephaly cases suspected to be linked to Zika virus. They have dispatched troops and health agents to educate the population and eliminate mosquito breeding grounds, with a focus on mosquito control efforts in Rio de Janeiro. Brazil is working with local and international partners to develop diagnostic kits, antiviral drugs, and a Zika vaccine. The U.S. is collaborating with Brazil and international organizations to address the Zika outbreak. The CDC has been working with Brazil's Ministry of Health since November 2015 to understand microcephaly and Zika's impact during pregnancy. The Obama Administration requested $1.8 billion in emergency funding for Zika response, with $375 million supporting initiatives in South America, Central America, and the Caribbean. Funding specifics for Brazil are unclear. Brazil's trade policy has prioritized integration with South American neighbors through Mercosur. The bloc, established in 1991, includes Argentina, Paraguay, Uruguay, and Venezuela. However, Mercosur has faced challenges in achieving full economic integration and has become more protectionist, shielding its members from external competition. Brazil has evolved into a protectionist arrangement within Mercosur, resisting external competition. It played a key role in WTO negotiations, leading the G-20 group in advocating for reduced agricultural tariffs. In 2013, Roberto Azev\u00eado, a respected diplomat, became Director General of the WTO. Roberto Azev\u00eado, Director General of the WTO, has worked on reviving the Doha round with a trade facilitation agreement. However, negotiations on sensitive issues like agriculture are stalled. Some analysts suggest that Brazil should reconsider its trade policy due to the changing international trading system. Large-scale agreements like the TPP and T-TIP could establish new trade rules, potentially bypassing the WTO and impacting Brazil's influence. Brazil should accelerate trade agreement negotiations with the EU and consider a trade agreement with the US to remain competitive in the global market. Some in the Rousseff Administration support this, while others fear it would harm Brazilian industry. The government is focusing on concluding agreements with Mercosur and the EU, as well as other nations, with future policy decisions influenced by the progress of the TPP and T-TIP negotiations and Brazil's economic conditions. Despite differences in trade policy and the lack of a free trade agreement, U.S.-Brazil trade has grown considerably over the past decade. Between 2005 and 2014, U.S.-Brazil merchandise trade increased by more than 83%, but declined by nearly 20% in 2015 due to declining commodity prices and the deteriorating economic situation in Brazil. In 2015, U.S. goods exports to Brazil declined by 25% and U.S. goods imports from Brazil declined by 10%. Despite the decline in exports, the United States maintained a slight merchandise trade surplus with Brazil valued at $4.3 billion. Top U.S. goods exports to Brazil included refined civilian aircraft and parts, heavy and electric machinery, oil products, and medical equipment. Top U.S. goods imports from Brazil included... In 2014, U.S.-Brazil services trade grew rapidly, with a 446% increase from $6.7 billion to $36.7 billion. The United States had a services trade surplus of $19.8 billion, with top categories including travel, transport, telecommunications, and intellectual property charges. Business services were the top category of U.S. imports from Brazil. In 2014, Brazil benefited from the GSP program, with duty-free imports valued at $2.3 billion. The program was reauthorized through 2017, providing tariff treatment to certain products from developing countries. Some question the inclusion of Brazil in the program. Observers have questioned the inclusion of Brazil and other upper-middle-income countries in the GSP program, as the European Union removed such countries from its GSP program in 2014. Foreign direct investment between the United States and Brazil mainly flows towards Brazil, with significant investments in manufacturing and finance. In 2014, the accumulated stock of U.S. FDI in Brazil was $70.5 billion, while Brazilian FDI in the United States totaled $616 million. Brazil and the United States resolved a long-standing dispute over U.S. government support for cotton farmers in October 2014, following a WTO ruling in Brazil's favor in 2004. In 2007, a WTO compliance panel found U.S. agricultural support payments and export guarantees to be inconsistent with WTO commitments. Brazil planned retaliatory measures worth $829 million, including higher tariffs and suspension of intellectual property rights. A temporary agreement in June 2010 avoided these measures, with the U.S. making short-term changes to export credit guarantees and providing $147 million annually to assist Brazilian cotton farmers. The U.S. government stopped complying with a fund to assist Brazilian cotton farmers in 2013, leading to the suspension of payments and potential retaliatory measures by Brazil. Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack cited budget sequestration as the reason for the partial payment and the inability to continue payments after the farm bill expired. President Obama signed a new farm bill into law in February 2014 (P.L. 113-79). In February 2014, President Obama signed a new farm bill (P.L. 113-79) which included changes to U.S. cotton support programs to resolve a dispute with Brazil. Brazil's CAMEX authorized a WTO panel assessment, but a settlement was reached instead. The United States agreed to make a $300 million payment to the Brazil Cotton Institute and implement additional changes. In exchange for a $300 million payment to the Brazil Cotton Institute, the U.S. made changes to its export credit guarantee program. Brazil agreed not to challenge U.S. cotton support programs at the WTO until September 30, 2018. The two countries also cooperate in the energy sector, focusing on ethanol production, offshore oil deposits, and renewable energy development. President Obama and President Rousseff launched a Strategic Energy Dialogue in 2011 to enhance energy cooperation. The Brazilian government aims to increase the share of renewables in electricity generation to 20% by 2030, focusing on sugarcane ethanol production. Despite challenges like poor harvests and lower demand, efforts are being made to support the ethanol industry through measures like raising gasoline prices and reducing taxes on ethanol. In 2014, Brazil produced 497,000 barrels per day of ethanol, an increase of 3.6% from 2013. The United States and Brazil signed an agreement in 2007 to promote cooperation on ethanol and biofuels, including technology sharing and global development efforts. Some analysts believe that uncertainty in gasoline price determination may hinder investment in the industry. The United States and Brazil have been working together since 2007 to promote the development of biofuels. They have focused on modeling sustainability, improving fuel economy in flex-fuel vehicles, and developing sustainable aviation biofuels. Additionally, they are providing technical assistance to strengthen policy frameworks and implement blending laws in various countries. Together with other members of the Global Bioenergy Partnership, they are promoting the sustainable production and use of modern bioenergy. The United States and Brazil have taken steps to liberalize trade in ethanol, with Brazil providing duty-free treatment for imported ethanol until December 31, 2021, and the U.S. allowing a duty on imported ethanol to expire in 2011. Bilateral ethanol trade has declined since then, with the U.S. exporting 7,000 barrels per day to Brazil and importing 3,000 barrels per day from Brazil in 2014. Brazil's new offshore oil fields have the potential to make it a top oil producer. In 2014, Brazil had 16.2 billion barrels of proven oil reserves and produced 2.3 million barrels per day. The Brazilian government approved a new regulatory framework in 2010 to develop pre-salt reserves for long-term economic growth. The new regulatory framework in Brazil, established in 2010, designated state-owned Petrobras as the sole operator for offshore projects, implemented a production sharing regime, ensured Petrobras a minimum 30% stake in joint ventures, created a public company called Petrosal to manage offshore reserves, increased local content requirements, and allocated offshore revenues towards education, infrastructure, science and technology, and poverty reduction. The Brazilian Congress debated oil royalty distribution laws until 2013, delaying the approval process. The new regulatory framework in Brazil, established in 2010, designated Petrobras as the sole operator for offshore projects and implemented a production sharing regime. However, oil production did not increase as predicted, leading to calls for modifications to attract more investment. The ANP held its first auction of pre-salt concessions in 2013, with only 11 companies participating. Energy analysts suggest changes to the regulatory framework to accelerate production. Petrobras is facing challenges due to corruption investigations and the decline in oil prices, leading to a 25% cut in planned investments. There is a push for regulatory changes to allow foreign companies to participate in Brazil's offshore resources, but President Rousseff opposes these reforms. U.S.-Brazilian oil trade has grown significantly in the past decade, with U.S. crude oil imports from Brazil increasing from 51,000 to 295,000 barrels per day by 2009. In 2014, the United States imported 145,000 barrels per day of crude oil from Brazil, equivalent to about 2% of total U.S. crude imports. U.S. exports of refined products to Brazil have grown quickly, exceeding U.S. crude imports from Brazil for the past two years. Brazil's reliance on imports has increased due to faster consumption growth than production and refinery capacity. U.S.-Brazilian cooperation on security issues has increased over the past decade. Brazil has seen an increase in law enforcement and military ties over the past decade, focusing on counternarcotics, counterterrorism, and defense. Despite not being a major drug producer, Brazil is the world's second-largest consumer of cocaine hydrochloride and a transit point for illicit drugs. Organized crime has grown alongside the drug trade, with criminal groups like the Red Command and First Capital Command operating transnationally. Brazil has taken steps to enhance its antidrug efforts in response to these challenges. Brazil has improved its antidrug efforts by implementing an air bridge denial program, passing antidrug laws, enhancing border security, deploying resources like UAVs, and conducting joint operations with neighboring countries. In 2014, authorities seized significant amounts of cocaine and marijuana. In 2008, the U.S. and Brazilian governments signed a memorandum of understanding to combat drug trafficking and reduce domestic drug demand. The United States provided training on investigative techniques and money laundering to Brazilian law enforcement and supported anti-drug community coalitions. U.S. counternarcotics assistance to Brazil totaled $3.5 million in FY2012, $1.9 million in FY2013, and $15,000 in FY2014. The Obama Administration did not request counternarcotics assistance for Brazil in FY2015, FY2016, or FY2017. According to the State Department's Country Reports on Terrorism, there are no confirmed operational cells of al Qaeda or Hezbollah in the Western Hemisphere, but ideological sympathizers provide support to terrorist groups. In 2010, the U.S. Treasury Department sanctioned Hezbollah's chief representative in South America, Bilal Mohsen Wehbe, for transferring funds collected in Brazil to Hezbollah in Lebanon. Wehbe raised over $500,000 from Lebanese businessmen in the tri-border area of Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay after the 2006 conflict between Israel and Hezbollah. He oversaw Hezbollah's counterintelligence activity in the region and had ties to Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamene'i. The U.S. government collaborated with Brazil to address concerns in the tri-border area and enhance counterterrorism capabilities. The \"3+1 Group on Tri-Border Area Security\" was created in 2002 by countries in the tri-border area and the United States. In 2007, a Joint Intelligence Center was established to combat trans-border criminal organizations. The United States has supported initiatives in Brazil such as the Container Security Initiative at the port of Santos and training programs for Brazilian law enforcement agencies on counterterrorism measures. These efforts aim to enhance investigative capabilities and prevent terrorist attacks, as recognized in the State Department's Country Reports on Terrorism for 2014. The Brazilian government has shown support for counterterrorism activities, but lacks antiterrorism legislation hindering prosecutions. Brazil is working on defining terrorism and making it an autonomous offense through bills passed in 2015. The Brazilian Congress is currently reconciling the differences between the bills. The Brazilian Congress is expected to enact legislation in early 2016 to increase U.S.-Brazil military cooperation. This includes a Defense Cooperation Agreement and a General Security of Military Information Agreement signed in 2010 to promote cooperation in research, technology security, and defense product acquisition. President Rousseff and President Obama aimed to elevate defense ties further. In 2012, President Rousseff and President Obama launched a Defense Cooperation Dialogue to strengthen defense ties. Despite a cooling in relations post-NSA revelations, military cooperation at operational levels remained strong. The Defense Cooperation Agreement and General Security of Military Information Agreement were approved in June 2015, enhancing Brazil's capacity for peacekeeping and counterterrorism with U.S. assistance. Brazil received military training assistance from the U.S. in FY2014 and FY2015, with plans for further training in the future. Despite economic and social improvements, racial disparities persist in educational attainment among Afro-Brazilians. In 2010, Afro-Brazilians had lower median income and higher homicide rates compared to white Brazilians. Despite education and occupation, wage disparities persist. The government has implemented antidiscrimination and affirmative action measures to address racial inequalities. In 2010, Brazil enacted the Statute of Racial Equality, offering tax incentives for businesses promoting racial inclusion and requiring affirmative action programs in federal universities. Admissions spots were reserved for Afro-Brazilian, indigenous, and low-income students, gradually increasing from 12.5% in 2013 to 50% in 2016. President Rousseff also reserved 20% of... President Rousseff enacted a law in 2014 reserving 20% of jobs in the Brazilian executive branch and state-owned enterprises for Afro-Brazilians. Race-based affirmative action policies are upheld as constitutional by the Brazilian Supreme Court. In 2008, Brazil and the United States signed an agreement to eliminate racial and ethnic discrimination, promoting equality through various activities and partnerships. The initiative focuses on expanding access to education, eliminating racial health disparities, addressing environmental impacts, criminal justice challenges, and ensuring equal economic opportunities for students of African descent. Congress recommended strengthening the initiative in FY2015, but did not address it in the FY2016 omnibus appropriations bill. The Amazon Basin spans over 6.8 million square kilometers, producing 20% of the world's fresh water discharge and containing the largest remaining rainforest on Earth. The Amazon Rainforest is a vital global carbon sink, holding about 100 billion tons of carbon. The Brazilian Amazon has seen significant deforestation due to settlements, roads, logging, and farming, leading to an 80% decline in forest cover. The region's population grew from 6 million in 1960 to 25 million in 2010, largely due to government incentives for development. The Brazilian government has implemented policies to slow deforestation in the Amazon Rainforest, including the Amazon Protected Areas Program and a plan to reduce deforestation by 80% by 2020. Surveillance and sustainable development projects have been increased to meet this goal, resulting in a significant decrease in annual deforestation from 27,772 square kilometers in 2004 to 5,831 square kilometers in 2014. Despite progress, the deforestation rate in 2015 was 28% higher than the low point. In 2015, Brazil's deforestation rate increased by 28% compared to the low point in 2012. Government policy changes, such as transferring environmental oversight to local officials and relaxing conservation requirements, have been attributed to the rise in deforestation. Critics argue that local authorities lack necessary resources and are more susceptible to corruption. The final version of the forest code in Brazil relaxed conservation requirements for sensitive areas, reduced reforestation mandates, and decreased the amount of forest to be preserved. Supporters claim it was necessary to bring farmers into compliance, while critics question the government's commitment to conservation due to appointing climate change skeptics. The United States has provided assistance for tropical forest conservation in Brazil through sustainable land use initiatives. The Amazon Basin Conservation Initiative is supported by USAID, providing funds to conserve biodiversity in the Amazon Basin. The Obama Administration did not request funds for conservation efforts in Brazil in FY2016, but the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 recommends $10.5 million for environmental programs in the Brazilian Amazon. The United States also signed a debt-for-nature agreement with Brazil in 2010, reducing debt payments by $21 million over five years for conservation activities. The government allocated funds for conservation activities in endangered areas outside of the Amazon Rainforest, such as the Atlantic Rainforest, Caatinga, and Cerrado ecosystems."
