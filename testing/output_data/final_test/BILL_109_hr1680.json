The Brownfield Cleanup Enhancement Act of 2005 introduces a credit for taxpayers holding qualified brownfields cleanup bonds, allowing a 25 percent annual credit against the tax imposed for such bonds. The credit rate is determined based on the outstanding face amount of the bond and the applicable credit rate, which is calculated as the average market yield on outstanding long-term corporate debt obligations. In the case of bonds issued within a 3-month period ending on a credit allowance date, the credit amount is prorated based on the portion of the period during which the bond was held. A qualified brownfields cleanup bond is defined as a bond issued by a State or local government for hazardous substance abatement at a contaminated site, with a maximum term of 15 years. The maximum aggregate face amount of bonds issued in a calendar year for brownfields cleanup is limited to $100,000,000 for 2006, $150,000,000 for 2007, and zero for subsequent years. The allocation of this limitation among states is determined by the Secretary of the Treasury. The Secretary of the Treasury allocates the limitation amount of bonds for brownfields cleanup among states. Any excess amount allocated to a state in a calendar year can be carried over to the following year. A bond must be paid back from any increase in real property tax revenues resulting from the cleanup activities. The credit allowed for any taxable year shall not exceed the regular tax liability plus the tax imposed by section 55, minus the credits allowable under part IV of subchapter A. If the credit exceeds the limitation, the excess can be carried over to the following year. The excess credit for a taxable year can be carried over to the following year. Definitions for terms like 'credit allowance date', 'bond', 'State', and 'qualified contaminated site' are provided.

Qualified brownfields cleanup bond holders may receive the credit. Ownership of a qualified brownfields cleanup may be separated under regulations.

The ownership of a qualified brownfields cleanup bond can be separated from the entitlement to the credit. The credit allowed for holding the bond is considered for estimated tax purposes and can be transferred through sale agreements. Issuers of these bonds must submit reports similar to those required for other bonds.

Reporting requirements for corporations regarding this interest are specified, and the Secretary has regulatory authority to prescribe necessary regulations for compliance. The table of sections for subpart B of part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1 of the Code is amended to include new item for reporting requirements. The amendments made by this section apply to obligations issued after December 31, 2005."
