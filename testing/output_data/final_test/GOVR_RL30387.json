    "content": "Federal employees are covered by either the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) or the Federal Employees' Retirement System (FERS). CSRS, established in 1920 for employees hired before 1984, does not include Social Security benefits. FERS, created in 1986 for employees hired after 1983, integrates Social Security with federal pension benefits. The Federal Employees' Retirement System (FERS) was established in 1986 and includes Social Security, a basic retirement annuity, and the Thrift Savings Plan. As of September 30, 2013, 90% of federal employees were enrolled in FERS. Workers are fully vested in the FERS basic retirement annuity after five years of service, with the minimum retirement age increasing to 57 for those born in 1970 or later. In 2015, federal employees can retire with an immediate, unreduced annuity at different ages based on years of service under FERS. An employee with 30 years of service can retire at 56, 20 years at 60, and 5 years at 62. Those with 10 or more years can opt for a reduced annuity at the minimum retirement age, with a permanent reduction based on age. For example, retiring at 56 with less than 30 years of service results in a 30% reduction in annuity. In FY2013, 39% of federal employees retiring under CSRS were aged 55-59, with an average of 34.4 years of civilian federal service. 35% were aged 62 or older, with an average age of 61.3 years and 35.5 years of federal service. Few employees hired before 1984 switched to FERS, resulting in late-career retirees under FERS in FY2013. In FY2013, 51,861 federal employees retired with immediate annuities under FERS at an average age of 63.7 years and 20.7 years of civilian service. The FERS basic retirement annuity is determined by years of service, accrual rate, and salary base. The salary base is the average of the employee's three highest consecutive years of basic pay. Under FERS, retirement benefits accrue based on years of service and salary base. The annual benefit accrual rate is 1.0% per year, increasing to 1.1% for employees with 20 or more years of service who retire at 62 or later. For example, a worker with 30 years of service would receive a pension benefit equal to 30% of their high-three average pay. Delaying retirement by one year would increase the annuity to 33% due to the higher accrual rate. Under CSRS, employees accrue pension benefits based on length of service, with rates increasing over time. The retirement annuity can reach 56.25% of high-three average pay after 30 years of service. FERS was designed to include Social Security, FERS annuity, and Thrift Savings Plan. A temporary supplement is provided for federal workers who retire before age 62, equal to the portion of Social Security benefit they would receive at 62 based on years of federal employment under FERS. The FERS supplement is paid until age 62 to workers who retire at the minimum retirement age with at least 30 years of service or at age 60 with at least 20 years of service. Cost-of-living adjustments protect retirement benefits from inflation, with COLAs in effect since 1962 for CSRS and FERS. Retirement benefits under CSRS are fully indexed for inflation, while FERS benefits are partially indexed if inflation exceeds 2%. The FERS retirement benefits are adjusted for inflation based on the CPI-W. COLAs are provided to retirees aged 62 or older, disabled annuitants, and survivor annuitants. The Thrift Savings Plan is a DC retirement plan for federal employees, similar to 401(k) plans. Newly hired employees with a 401(k) plan can roll over their balances into the TSP. Participants in the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) can leave their money in the TSP when leaving the federal government or roll it over into another tax-qualified retirement savings account. They are immediately vested in their contributions, federal matching contributions, and any growth in their investment. Additionally, they become fully vested in the 1% agency automatic contributions after a certain period. The Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) allows federal employees to make tax-deferred contributions immediately upon employment. Military personnel can also participate in the TSP without matching contributions. Newly hired federal employees are automatically enrolled in the TSP with a default contribution rate of 3% of pay. P.L. 113-255 changed the default investment option for automatic contributions to TSP to the age-appropriate Lifecycle Fund. Employees under FERS can contribute up to $18,000 to the TSP in 2015, with an additional $6,000 for those aged 50 and older. Contributions can be made on a pre-tax basis, and neither the contributions nor investment earnings are taxed until withdrawal. Under P.L. 111-31, a Roth contribution option was authorized for the TSP, allowing after-tax income deferrals into the retirement plan. Qualified distributions from the Roth TSP plan option are tax-free after five years and age 59\u00bd. FERS employees can contribute up to 5% of pay, matched by the government, while CSRS employees can contribute but receive no matching contributions. Prior to July 1, 2001, FERS employees could contribute up to 10% of pay or the maximum tax-deferred contribution permissible. P.L. 106-554 increased employee contributions to the TSP by one percentage point each year for five years, reaching 15% for FERS and 10% for CSRS in 2005. Contribution limits were eliminated in 2006, and now follow IRC Section 402(g) with a limit of $18,000 in 2015. Employees aged 50 or older can make additional \"catch-up\" contributions of up to $6,000. I.R.C. Section 72(t) imposes a 10% additional tax on distributions from qualified plans like the TSP, unless the individual is over 59\u00bd, dies, or becomes disabled. Exceptions to this tax include distributions after reaching 59\u00bd, to beneficiaries after death, due to disability, under a QDRO, for early retirement after 55, as ESOP dividends, through IRS levy for back taxes, for medical expenses exceeding 7.5% of AGI, or as part of a series of substantially equal payments. Participants in the TSP must start taking distributions no later than April of the year after turning 70\u00bd, unless still employed by the government. Distributions are taxable income, except for qualified Roth contributions. Participants can borrow from their TSP accounts, with general purpose loans repaid within five years and residential loans for a primary residence repaid within 15 years. Participant loans from TSP accounts for purchasing a primary residence must be repaid within 15 years. The loan amount cannot exceed one-half of the participant's vested account balance or $50,000. The interest rate is fixed at the \"G\" Fund rate at the time of the loan agreement. Defaulted loans must be repaid within the following calendar quarter to avoid penalties. If not repaid, the loan plus interest is treated as a taxable distribution, potentially subject to a 10% penalty for early retirement plan withdrawals. If the participant leaves federal service, the loan balance must be repaid in full. If a participant leaves federal service, the loan balance from TSP must be repaid in full to avoid it being treated as a taxable distribution. Withdrawals from TSP while still employed by the federal government are only allowed in cases of financial hardship or reaching the age of 59\u00bd. Participants over 59\u00bd can make a single age-based withdrawal, which must be included in taxable income unless deposited into an IRA within 60 days. In-service withdrawals due to financial hardship are also subject to taxation. A participant in the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) may face a 10% tax penalty for withdrawals before age 59\u00bd. Withdrawals are limited to the participant's contributions and earnings, based on financial need. After a hardship withdrawal, contributions to the TSP are prohibited for six months. Qualifying financial needs include negative cash flow, uncovered medical expenses, personal losses, or legal expenses from separation or divorce. The TSP contribution to a federal employee's retirement income depends on the account value at retirement, influenced by the worker's salary during federal service. The value of a participant's Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) account depends on their salary during federal service, percentage of salary contributed, years of investment earnings, and fund performance. Participants can deposit contributions into five funds: \"C\" Fund replicates S&P 500, \"F\" Fund invests in bonds, \"G\" Fund in government securities, and \"S\" Fund in Dow Jones U.S. Completion Total Stock Market Index. The TSP offers Lifecycle Funds that adjust investment allocations based on retirement timeline, reducing stock investments as retirement nears to protect against market volatility. The funds include L2020, L2030, L2040, L2050, and L Income Fund. The TSP offers Lifecycle Funds (L2020, L2030, L2040, L2050, and L Income Fund) with historical rates of return. Employees can withdraw funds in various ways at retirement. As of October 2014, there were 4.7 million active and retired participants in the TSP, with high participation rates among FERS and CSRS employees. Among employees enrolled in the TSP, 60% were contributing. The average TSP account balance in October 2014 was $113,934 for FERS participants and $113,057 for CSRS participants. Total assets in the TSP were $431.6 billion, with different funds holding varying percentages of the total assets. The allocation of assets among the funds reflects historical rates of return, contributions, and transfers by participating employees. The tables illustrate the role of the TSP in ensuring retirement income for federal employees enrolled in FERS. They show annual salaries before retirement for employees at different pay grades, with estimated replacement rates for retirement income from TSP accounts. The tables show retirement income replacement rates for federal employees at different pay grades based on their contributions to the TSP. Rates vary depending on the assumed rate of return and years of service at retirement. The tables in the study illustrate retirement income replacement rates for federal employees based on their contributions to the TSP. The rates vary depending on the assumed rate of return, years of service at retirement, and career-long employee contribution rates. The proportion of pre-retirement income replaced by converting the employee's TSP account into a retirement annuity depends on various factors such as age, account balance, and interest rates. Actual rates of return may vary, and examples provided are for illustration purposes only. The account balance at retirement depends on the employee's contributions, rate of return, and length of time in the fund. An older individual will receive a larger annuity. The annuity interest rate is determined by prevailing long-term interest rates. Employees in FERS have 1% of pay contributed to TSP by their agencies. The Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) allows federal employees to save for retirement through contributions from their salaries. With a 6.0% annual investment return, retiring after 30 years could replace 2.3% of final salary without voluntary contributions. Increasing contributions to 5% of pay could boost replacement rates to 23.2% after a 30-year career. Matching contributions from the employer for each additional percentage of pay contributed by the employee significantly impact the replacement rate. Employee contributions to the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) are matched by the employer, with the first 3% matched dollar-for-dollar and the next 2% matched at a rate of 50 cents on the dollar. Higher investment returns lead to a higher replacement rate in retirement. For example, a 5% contribution over 30 years with an 8.0% annual return would replace 31.3% of final salary. Contributions above 5% are not matched but still impact replacement rates significantly. A 10% contribution over 30 years with a 6.0% return would result in a replacement rate of 34.8% of final pay. Employees who contribute 10% of pay over a 30-year career can replace 47.0% of their final pay from the TSP. For employees with 20 years of service under FERS, the agency automatic contribution would replace 1.6% of pay with an 8.0% annual investment return. Participating in the TSP only during the 20 years before retirement results in a lower income replacement rate. Employees who contribute to the TSP for 20 years before retirement will achieve a lower income replacement rate compared to those who contribute for 30 years. For example, contributing 5% of pay over 20 years with a 6% annual return would result in a 13.2% replacement rate, whereas contributing for 30 years would yield a 32.2% replacement rate. Similarly, contributing 10% of pay over 20 years at a 6% return would result in a 19.8% replacement rate, lower than the 34.8% replacement rate for 30 years. An 8.0% annual return with a 5% contribution can achieve a 16.0% replacement rate from the TSP. The TSP was designed to supplement retirement income from the FERS annuity and Social Security. For a federal employee retiring at 62 after 30 years, the FERS annuity provides 31.7% of final salary. For those retiring at 62 with 20 years, the FERS annuity replaces about 21.2% of earnings. The replacement rate for Social Security benefits decreases as income increases. Social Security benefits provide a higher percentage of earnings replacement for low-wage workers compared to high-wage workers. Federal employees covered by FERS are also covered by Social Security, with estimates showing that benefits replace around 39.0% of earnings for a medium-earning worker and 32.3% for a high-earning worker retiring at 65 in 2014. Social Security benefits provide different levels of earnings replacement for federal employees based on their GS level. For GS-8 employees, benefits would replace about 32.3% of career-average earnings. For GS-12 and GS-15 employees, benefits would replace about 25% of $117,000 for retirement at 65 in 2014. Defined contribution retirement plans like the TSP have an advantage for employees who switch jobs, as the accrued benefit can continue to increase until retirement age. Employees who have vested in a traditional defined benefit pension, like FERS, are entitled to their earned benefits upon reaching retirement age, even if they no longer work for the employer. The annuity is based on the employee's earnings during their employment and is not adjusted for inflation. The defined benefit pension under FERS entitles employees to an annuity based on their earnings, with no inflation adjustment. In contrast, a defined contribution plan like the TSP allows for continued growth of funds regardless of job changes. For example, if an employee contributed 10% of pay to the TSP annually with a 6% return rate, the account could reach $81,000 after 10 years in 1993, continuing to grow if left invested or transferred to another retirement account. The Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act (P.L. 111-31) includes the Thrift Savings Plan Enhancement Act, which allows newly hired federal employees to be enrolled automatically in the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) at a default contribution rate of 3% of pay. It also establishes a qualified Roth contribution program within the TSP for after-tax contributions and tax-free distributions. Additionally, the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board is given the authority to allow TSP participants to invest in mutual funds and is required to submit an annual report to Congress with demographic information about TSP participants. The Smart Savings Act, P.L. 113-255, requires annual demographic reports on TSP participants and fund managers, mandates acknowledgment of risk for non-government securities investments, grants subpoena authority to the TSP executive director, allows court orders for restitution payments from TSP accounts, requires a report on agency match costs for uniformed services contributions, and permits surviving spouses to maintain deceased participants' accounts. The default investment option for TSP contributions was changed by this law signed on December 18, 2014. The default investment option for TSP contributions was changed by the Smart Savings Act, P.L. 113-255, from the \"G\" Fund to the age-appropriate Lifecycle Fund. Military servicemembers are not affected by this change and their default TSP investment option remains the \"G\" Fund. The Thrift Savings Plan is managed by the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board, which operates the plan in the best interest of participants and their beneficiaries. The assets of the Thrift Plan are held in the Thrift Savings Fund and invested in five authorized investment funds. The Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) currently contracts with BlackRock Institutional Trust Company to manage index funds where F, C, S, and I Fund assets are invested. Contracts are open to competitive bids every three to five years. Administrative costs in 2013 were 2.9 basis points, or about 29 cents for every $1,000 invested. Participant accounts are credited with contributions and agency contributions, and charged for withdrawals. Account value reflects fund shares and daily share prices. Administrative expenses factor into share price calculation. The Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board, established by the FERS Act of 1986, oversees the management of the Thrift Plan. The board develops investment policies and appoints an Executive Director for day-to-day operations. Board members are appointed by the President and serve four-year terms. The Thrift Board oversees the management of the Thrift Plan, with members serving four-year terms. Nominees must have expertise in financial investments and pension plans. Communication includes distributing information to plan participants and providing investment details through various resources like the TSP Fund Sheet and quarterly newsletter. The Thrift Board oversees the management of the Thrift Plan, providing investment details through resources like the TSP Fund Sheet and quarterly newsletter. Participants can access account information, request transactions, use retirement planning tools, and receive updates through TSP Bulletins and the ThriftLine. The Board's authority includes appointing the Executive Director and ensuring independence from political pressures. The Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board has the authority to appoint and remove the Executive Director of the Thrift Plan, establish investment policies, and submit legislative proposals to Congress. Board members are nominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate for four-year terms, ensuring independence from political pressures. The Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board is responsible for overseeing the Thrift Plan's investment policies and management practices. The board members are required to act solely in the interest of participants and beneficiaries, ensuring the efficient and prudent management of the fund's assets. Administrative expenses are covered by forfeited contributions from employees and charges against participant accounts. The board is insulated from external pressures to adopt policies that may not benefit the fund's long-term security and performance. The Thrift Board ensures efficient and prudent management of the fund's assets. The Employee Thrift Advisory Council represents various stakeholders and all fiduciaries, including board members, must be bonded. The Secretary of Labor can investigate breaches of duty, and financial statements are audited regularly. Congressional oversight is conducted by specific committees. The Thrift Board is overseen by specific committees like the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform and the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs."
