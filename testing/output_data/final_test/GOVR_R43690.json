    "content": "The report discusses federal financial incentives for \"clean coal\" projects, including loan guarantees and tax incentives available since the Energy Policy Act of 2005. Congress is concerned about the private sector's use of these tools to develop technology for reducing CO2 emissions from coal-fired power plants, a major source of greenhouse gas emissions in the U.S. Coal-fired plants are a significant source of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States, emitting 1.5 billion metric tons of CO2 in 2012. The use of coal for electricity generation has decreased from 2008 to 2012, leading to a decline in total coal consumption and carbon dioxide emissions. Policy efforts to reduce emissions are complicated by the reliance on coal. Congress is considering EPA regulatory proposals to limit emissions from coal-fired power plants, which could impact the future of coal-fired electricity generation in the U.S. The U.S. coal-fired electricity industry's viability is linked to capturing and sequestering CO2 emissions. The U.S. Department of Energy focuses on mitigating CO2 emissions through the Coal R&D program, receiving significant funding from Congress, including $3.4 billion from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. The U.S. Department of Energy has received approximately $6 billion for CCS R&D since 2008. The term clean coal refers to activities aimed at reducing emissions from coal combustion, such as carbon capture and sequestration. DOE's efforts focus on developing advanced technologies for existing and new fossil-fueled power plants. Loan guarantees have been used for various purposes, including clean coal initiatives. The DOE loan guarantee program, authorized in EPACT05, supports projects reducing greenhouse gas emissions through advanced fossil energy technology and carbon capture practices. EPACT05 Section 1703 outlined eligible gasification projects for loan guarantees, including integrated gasification combined cycle, industrial, petroleum coke, and liquefaction projects. Projects had emissions limits for sulfur dioxide, mercury, nitrogen oxide, and particulates, but no restrictions on CO2 emissions. Integrated gasification combined cycle plants had to accommodate CO2 capture equipment. Loan guarantees required funding from appropriated funds. Loan guarantee costs for Section 1703 projects must be paid for by appropriated funds or the borrower. These costs include the credit subsidy cost, reflecting expected payments by and to the government over the loan term. Without a specific appropriation, applicants are responsible for their own credit subsidy costs. Congress has not appropriated funds for credit subsidy costs for Section 1703 loan guarantees, except for one exception. Section 1703 projects must cover administrative costs such as application, facility, and maintenance fees. The debt guaranteed by DOE is limited to 80% of total project costs. Loan guarantee commitment is the full principal amount of the loan. Applicants are responsible for their own credit subsidy costs. EPACT05 allows projects receiving tax credits for \"clean coal\" technology to also receive loan guarantees under Section 1703. DOE has offered solicitations for projects to utilize the loan guarantee authorization since EPACT05. Congressional appropriations bills have amended loan guarantee authorization under Title XVII Section 1703. In 2007, Congress limited loan guarantee commitments under EPACT05 to $4 billion, with borrowers covering credit subsidy costs. In FY2009, the Consolidated Appropriations Act increased funding for coal-based power generation and advanced coal gasification to $6 billion and $2 billion respectively. In FY2009, the Omnibus Appropriations Act increased funding for coal-based power generation and advanced coal gasification to $6 billion and $2 billion respectively. The Department of Defense and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act in FY2011 provided an additional $1.18 billion in loan guarantee authority for eligible projects under the EPACT05 Title XVII program. DOE has issued two solicitations for clean coal project loan guarantees under Section 1703 since EPACT05. The 2006 solicitation required congressional authorization for loan guarantees, which was granted in P.L. 110-161. The first solicitation was issued in 2008, with applications due in December of that year. DOE issued a solicitation in 2008 under P.L. 110-161 for $6 billion for coal-based power generation and industrial gasification projects with CCS. A second solicitation in 2013 under P.L. 111-8 provided up to $8 billion in loan guarantees for eligible projects. The DOE issued a solicitation in 2008 for projects using advanced fossil energy technology in areas such as carbon capture and low-carbon power systems. No loan guarantees have been issued to clean coal projects since EPACT05. The DOE Loan Programs Office has guaranteed $32.4 billion in loans for over 30 projects, with only two projects under Section 1703, both related to nuclear power. The Section 1705 loan program and the Advanced Technology Vehicle Manufacturing program were used for projects in the current portfolio. Clean coal investment tax credits were authorized in EPACT05 and further incentives were provided in the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008. Tax incentives for clean coal technologies and carbon capture were codified in the Internal Revenue Code. $800 million was authorized for tax credits under IRC Section 48A for advanced coal projects. Under EPACT05, $800 million was authorized for Section 48A tax credits for integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) projects, with a 20% tax credit rate. Another $500 million was available for investments in other advanced coal-based electricity generation technologies (ACBGT) at a 15% tax credit rate. IRC Section 48B provided tax credits for qualifying gasification projects, with $350 million authorized for this purpose. The Department of the Treasury and DOE evaluate projects seeking tax credits under IRC Sections 48A and 48B. Taxpayers investing in clean coal projects must apply for these tax credits. In late 2006, the IRS awarded nearly $1 billion in investment tax credits to nine clean coal projects across different states. Various projects received tax credits ranging from $40.7 million to $133.5 million, with a total of 49 companies requesting $5 billion in credits for projects costing $58 billion. Credits were awarded to projects deemed technologically and economically feasible under EPACT05. The Energy Improvement and Extension Act of 2008 authorized additional investment tax credits for clean coal projects, with a tax credit rate increase to 30%. Qualifying projects must now include equipment that separates and sequesters a percentage of CO2 emissions. Gasification projects must separate and sequester 75% of total CO2 emissions. Gasification projects must separate and sequester 75% of total CO2 emissions. Credits are awarded for certified projects through a competitive bidding process. The 2009-2010 allocation round awarded over $1 billion for Section 48A credits, leaving $240 million available for future allocation. All $250 million for gasification projects under EESA was awarded in the same allocation round. In the 2009-2010 allocation round, over $1 billion was awarded for Section 48A credits, leaving $240 million available for future allocation. The 2011-2012 allocation round resulted in one allocation of $103.6 million in Section 48A credits. In 2012, $658.5 million of Section 48A credits were available for allocation, including funding from projects with revoked certification. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that clean coal tax credits will reduce revenue collections by $1.0 billion between fiscal years 2014 and 2018. The JCT estimated that clean coal investment tax credits reduced federal revenue collections by $1.3 billion from 2006 to 2013, totaling $2.3 billion through 2018. The Section 45Q credit allows taxpayers to claim a $20 per metric ton credit for qualifying domestic carbon dioxide captured and sequestered. The Section 45Q credit offers a $10 per metric ton credit for captured CO2 used in enhanced oil or natural gas recovery projects. It is set to end after 75 million metric tons of qualified CO2 have been captured, with 27 million metric tons accounted for as of June 1, 2014. The Section 45Q credit was claimed for 6 million metric tons of captured CO2 by June 1, 2014, costing an estimated $1.1 billion over a 10-year period. The Treasury predicts a $0.1 billion reduction in federal revenues for FY2014 and $0.7 billion between 2014 and 2018 due to the credit. Concerns also arise regarding the tax treatment of grants from the Clean Coal Power Initiative, allowing them to be excluded from gross income for corporate taxpayers. Under proposed legislation, the EXPIRE Act of 2014 would allow non-corporate taxpayers to exclude CCPI grants and awards from gross income. Recipients would need to reduce their basis in the property by the amount of the award and pay an upfront interest charge. Various challenges, including technological and financial issues, impact the future of clean coal projects in the US. The challenges of liability, ownership, and long-term stewardship add complexity to clean coal projects. Congress may need to consider why no loan guarantees have been issued for these projects despite authorizations and solicitations. Only two nuclear power-related projects have received loan guarantees under Section 1703 since EPACT05. Section 1705 of Congress provides funds for loan guarantee credit subsidy costs for renewable energy, electric power transmission, and biofuel projects. DOE has not sought appropriations for Section 1703 projects, but nuclear power projects have zero credit subsidy costs. Projects receiving loan guarantees do not have to pay credit subsidy costs themselves. Industry interest in Section 1703 guaranteed loans is unclear without knowing the number of clean coal project applications. The number of applications for clean coal projects submitted in response to solicitations is unclear. Challenges for these projects include meeting program criteria, employing new technology, and achieving commercial viability. EPA proposals to regulate CO2 from coal-fired power plants have introduced uncertainty. The impact of these proposals on loan guarantees and tax incentives for clean coal is uncertain. Congress has options to consider for tax incentives, including maintaining the status quo. The current options for Congress regarding tax incentives for clean coal projects include allowing existing incentives to phase out or authorizing additional funding for investment tax credits under Sections 48A and 48B. However, the availability of funds for new investments or CO2 sequestration is limited, and the effectiveness of these tax credits in developing eligible technologies is uncertain. Technical changes have also been suggested to improve existing tax benefits, such as modifications to the Section 45Q credit. Modifications to the Section 45Q credit have been proposed in the Carbon Capture and Sequestration Deployment Act of 2014 (S. 2287). S. 2287 would change the current structure of Section 45Q by allocating credits to applicants before CO2 capture, providing greater industry certainty. It would also allow credit transfer to the company storing the CO2, as recommended in 2012. Unresolved issues exist for Sections 48A and 48B investment credits, including reallocations for forfeited credits and recertification for projects missing deadlines, which may be addressed through Treasury. Tax incentives and policy changes could impact the outlook for clean coal and carbon capture technologies. For example, a tax on carbon emissions or regulations increasing the cost of carbon-intensive electricity production could make low-carbon coal options more competitive. Clean energy production credits and investment incentives, like those proposed by Max Baucus, could benefit facilities with carbon capture technology. The debate continues on whether tax incentives should promote investment in clean coal, carbon capture, and related technologies, despite the general preference for market-driven investments. Tax incentives can improve resource allocation in the economy by encouraging investments in technologies that reduce pollution and emissions. Concerns exist about the structure of clean coal tax credits, particularly regarding the selection of recipients and specified technologies. Limited benefits are provided to firms that do not pay taxes through tax credits."
