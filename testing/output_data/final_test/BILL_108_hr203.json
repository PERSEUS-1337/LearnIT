    "content": "The \"Acid Rain Control Act\" mandates reductions in annual emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides by utility units and affected facilities, respectively. Emissions of sulfur dioxide are to be reduced from 8.90 million tons to 4.45 million tons for the years 2008-2011, and further reduced to 3 million tons thereafter. The Environmental Protection Agency must limit annual nitrogen oxides emissions from affected facilities to 2.10 million tons for 2008-2011 and 1.70 million tons from 2012 onwards. Owners/operators exceeding these limits will face penalties under the Clean Air Act. The penalty for exceeding emissions limits under the Clean Air Act is calculated based on the excess tons emitted multiplied by $6,000. Owners/operators must offset excess emissions by an equal tonnage amount. An affected facility is defined as one with combustion units serving an electricity generator of at least 25 megawatts. SEC. 4. MERCURY EMISSION CONTROL. The Administrator must regulate electric utility and industrial source emissions of mercury by December 15, 2004. Prohibition on transferring mercury emission allowances. SEC. 5. REGULATIONS. The Administrator is required to promulgate regulations to carry out sections 2, 3, and 4 of the Act, including market-oriented mechanisms, prevention of adverse effects on public health and the environment, and ensuring emission reductions in both Eastern and Western regions of the United States. Deadlines are set for the promulgation of these regulations. The Administrator must submit a report to Congress by December 31, 2007, outlining objectives for credible environmental indicators to protect sensitive ecosystems and water bodies in various mountain ranges and lakes. The report must include acid neutralizing capacity as an indicator and aim to increase the proportion of water bodies with this capacity in sensitive areas. The Administrator is required to submit an updated report to Congress by December 31, 2011, assessing environmental indicators for regional ecosystems with acid neutralizing capacity greater than zero. The reports are subject to the requirements of the Clean Air Act. Additionally, by the same date, the Administrator must determine if emissions reductions are necessary. The Administrator will assess if emissions reductions are sufficient to meet the objectives of the Act. If not, regulations will be promulgated within 2 years to protect sensitive ecosystems. The term \"Administrator\" in this Act refers to the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency."
