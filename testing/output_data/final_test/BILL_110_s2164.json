    "content": "The Act titled \"NOAA Scholarship Act of 2007\" establishes a Science and Technology Scholarship Program. The Administrator is authorized to establish a Science and Technology Scholarship Program to recruit and prepare students for careers in the National Weather Service and marine, atmospheric, and satellite research. Scholarships are awarded based on academic merit, with consideration for financial need and promoting diversity. Service agreements are required for scholarship recipients. The Administrator will enter into service agreements with selected individuals to work as full-time employees in fields needed by the Administration in exchange for receiving a scholarship. To be eligible for the program, individuals must be enrolled as full-time students in specified academic programs, be U.S. citizens or permanent residents. The scholarship program requires applicants to be U.S. citizens or permanent residents, not be current U.S. employees, and submit an application with required information. The Administrator will provide a list of eligible academic programs and fields of study for scholarship utilization. The scholarship program allows individuals to apply for a scholarship for an academic year if they propose a degree program from a specified list. The scholarship is limited to 4 academic years unless a waiver is granted, and the amount is determined by the Administrator but cannot exceed the cost of attendance. The scholarship program allows individuals to apply for a scholarship for an academic year for tuition, fees, and other authorized expenses. The Administrator may enter into contracts with institutions for direct payments. The obligated service period for scholarship recipients is determined by the Administration. The obligated service period for scholarship recipients under the Administration is 24 months for each academic year. The service must begin within 60 days of obtaining the educational degree, with the option for deferral under certain circumstances. Penalties for Breach of Scholarship Agreement include scholarship recipients failing to maintain academic standing, being dismissed for disciplinary reasons, or voluntarily terminating academic training before graduation. They must repay all scholarship funds within 1 year of default, except under certain circumstances. The repayment period for scholarship recipients may be extended by the Administrator if necessary. Failure to fulfill the service obligation or deferment terms will result in breach of the agreement, leading to liability for the total amount received. The scholarship program requires repayment of the total amount received plus interest in case of breach. Obligations are waived in case of death or extreme hardship. The scholarship program allows for the waiver or suspension of obligations in cases of extreme hardship or impossibility of compliance, if enforcing the obligation would not be in the best interests of the United States. The definitions in this Act include terms like Administration, Administrator, Cost of Attendance, Institution of Higher Education, and Scholarship Program."
