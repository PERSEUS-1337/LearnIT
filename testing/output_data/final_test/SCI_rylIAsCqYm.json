    "content": "In this paper, the Asynchronous Accelerated Nonuniform Randomized Block Coordinate Descent algorithm (A2BCD) is proposed, proving convergence to a solution of the convex minimization problem at the same rate as NU_ACDM. It is the first asynchronous Nesterov-accelerated algorithm with a provable speedup and optimal complexity. A2BCD outperforms NU_ACDM by converging 4-5x faster on some datasets in terms of wall-clock time. Additionally, a continuous-time analog of the algorithm is analyzed and shown to converge at the same rate. The Asynchronous Accelerated Nonuniform Randomized Block Coordinate Descent algorithm (A2BCD) is proven to achieve optimal complexity and is the first asynchronous Nesterov-accelerated algorithm with a speedup. It aims to find the minimizer of the unconstrained minimization problem with strong convexity and Lipschitz gradient. The algorithm can also be applied to non-strongly convex objectives. The algorithm A2BCD is designed for unconstrained minimization with strong convexity and Lipschitz gradient. It can be applied to non-strongly convex objectives and uses randomized block coordinate descent for updates. The complexity of the algorithm is measured by the number of iterations needed to decrease the error below a certain threshold. The A2BCD algorithm is a state-of-the-art coordinate descent method for solving equations with strong convexity and Lipschitz gradient. It improves on previous methods by decreasing complexity and achieving faster convergence rates. In the asynchronous case, a collection of computing nodes continually read a shared solution vector y and compute block gradients to update shared solution vectors. Convergence in this setting requires new technical machinery due to the lack of synchronization rounds seen in traditional synchronous-parallel implementations. The asynchronous approach avoids costly synchronization processes that can be problematic at scale due to differences in node computing speeds and network delays. Asynchronous solvers update solution vectors without waiting for others, leading to faster iterations due to no idle time. Random delays make asynchronous algorithms faster than synchronous ones. However, outdated information may affect the solution vector updates. Factors influencing iteration speed are discussed in Hannah & Yin (2017a). The block gradient \u2207i kf is computed at a delayed iterate \u0177k with delay parameters j(k, 1), ..., j(k, n) \u2208 N. Different blocks may be out of date by varying amounts, known as an inconsistent read. Asynchronous algorithms were first proposed in 1969 to solve linear systems, with later developments in convergence theory. There is also research on asynchronous SGD, with global convergence shown in distributed settings even with growing delays. An asynchronous decentralized SGD with optimal sublinear convergence rate has been proposed. Decentralized SGD was proposed with optimal sublinear convergence rate and linear speedup with respect to the number of workers. Previous work has analyzed the tradeoff between asynchrony and momentum in SGD algorithms. Authors have proven convergence results for asynchronous SGD, highlighting the tradeoff between faster iterations and iteration complexity. In this paper, it is shown that A2BCD achieves state-of-the-art iteration complexity for solving a specific equation, as long as delays are not too large. The proof involves technical innovations related to the analysis of asynchronicity and complexity. Additionally, A2BCD is shown to have optimal complexity within a constant factor. A2BCD has optimal complexity over a general class of randomized block coordinate descent algorithms, extending previous results. It is expected to be faster than existing coordinate descent algorithms and has been confirmed as the fastest. This is the first analysis of asynchronous Nesterov-accelerated algorithms that achieves a speedup, with optimal results for delays. The work of Meng et al. claims to achieve square-root speedup for asynchronous accelerated SVRG, but does not obtain accelerated rates. Fang et al. devised accelerated schemes for asynchronous coordinate descent and SVRG with improved complexity results, although they do not prove any speedup. Adding more computing nodes according to their results will increase running time. The authors aim to extend their results to linear speedup for asynchronous, accelerated SVRG under sparsity assumptions, but have not yet provided proof. They derive a second-order ODE that extends the ODE found in a previous study to an asynchronous accelerated algorithm. The ODE linearly converges to a solution without needing restarting techniques, motivating the proof strategy of the main result. The function considered should be \"coordinate friendly\" for efficient parallelization. The authors introduce Asynchronous Accelerated Randomized Block Coordinate Descent (A2BCD) for solving the L2-regularized empirical risk minimization problem efficiently. The algorithm uses one block of the gradient to calculate each iteration and assumes independent delays. The A2BCD algorithm is defined using Lipschitz parameters and an asynchronicity parameter to quantify convergence effects. Coefficients are determined through trial and error, but the algorithm does not depend on them. The algorithm is not dependent on coefficients and is defined using Lipschitz parameters and an asynchronicity parameter. The Lyapunov function is introduced, and the paper's main contribution is presented with a theorem. Asynchronous algorithms are more resilient to delays in practice than in theory. The paper introduces a new algorithm, NU_ACDM, with a linear convergence rate and complexity. It also discusses assumptions made for simplification and compares the complexity of A2BCD to NU_ACDM. A2BCD is noted for combining complexity with faster iterations and superior scaling. A2BCD combines state-of-the-art complexity with faster iterations and superior scaling through asynchronous iterations. Special cases of conditions on the maximum delay \u03c4 are discussed, with \u03c4 being a function of the number of computing nodes, p. The gradient complexity K( , \u03c4 ) is defined as the number of gradients required for an asynchronous algorithm to attain suboptimality. In Theorem 1, an asynchronous algorithm achieves a linear complexity speedup, leading to faster convergence compared to synchronous methods. Despite challenges like parallel overhead factors, the algorithm still shows significant improvement in wall-clock time. The asynchronous algorithm shows faster convergence compared to its synchronous counterpart experimentally. NU_ACDM and A2BCD are optimal among a wide class of coordinate descent algorithms in terms of worst-case complexity. The work extends to encompass asynchronous algorithms with unequal L i. Definition 4 defines Asynchronous Randomized Incremental Algorithms for unconstrained minimization problems. The proof in Section D follows similar lines to previous works by Lan & Zhou (2015) and Nesterov (2013). An ODE is presented as the continuous-time limit of A2BCD, which is a strongly convex and asynchronous version of a previously studied ODE. The ODE is derived from the discrete limit of synchronous A2BCD, with parameters defined and an energy function introduced. This analysis is akin to traditional proofs, leading to the derivation of a lower complexity bound for A. In Section D, a linear convergence result is derived for an asynchronous version of equation 3.1 with a delayed version of Y(t). The energy E(t) may not always decrease, but adding a continuous-time asynchronicity error can create a decreasing energy. When r\u03c4 \u2264 1/2, the asynchronicity error A(t) satisfies a certain condition, leading to linear convergence of f(Y(t)) to f(x*) with a specific rate. This condition is similar to Corollary 3 but slightly looser. The convergence condition in Theorem 1 can be improved to match Corollary 3, with Nesterov acceleration showing that asynchronous algorithms can outperform traditional ones. In Xiao et al. (2017), a novel asynchronous catalyst-accelerated BID6 primal-dual algorithm is proposed to solve regularized ERM problems. The parallel updates ensure that the data an update depends on is up to date. However, catalyst acceleration incurs a log(\u03ba) penalty compared to Nesterov acceleration. The inner iterations of catalyst acceleration are challenging to tune, making it less practical than Nesterov acceleration. A2BCD is used to solve the ridge regression problem, comparing primal and dual objectives. In a comparison of asynchronous accelerated A2BCD, synchronous NU_ACDM, and asynchronous RBCD algorithms for solving regularized ERM problems, nodes select coordinate blocks, calculate block gradients, and update shared solution vectors. Synchronous NU_ACDM operates in batches with a batch size of p, while asynchronous algorithms compute with the most up-to-date information available. Datasets used include w1a, wxa, and aloi from LIBSVM Chang & Lin (2011). The algorithm for solving regularized ERM problems is implemented in a multi-threaded fashion using C++11 and GNU Scientific Library. Efficient update schemes are crucial for maintaining or recovering Ay in linear regression applications. Accelerated iterations are necessary for block gradient evaluations to be as efficient as full-gradient calculations.

Efficient update schemes are crucial for maintaining or recovering Ay in linear regression applications. Accelerated iterations are necessary for block gradient evaluations to be as efficient as full-gradient calculations. Lee & Sidford (2013a) introduces a linear transformation that allows for sparse updates to new iteration variables p and q, improving computational efficiency for both sparse and dense problems. The specifics of this efficient implementation are discussed in Section A.2. Table 5 shows sub-optimality vs. time for decreasing \u03bb values, corresponding to larger condition numbers \u03ba. For small \u03ba, A2BCD and async-RBCD outperform sync-NU_ACDM due to faster iterations. However, async-RBCD becomes less competitive as \u03ba increases. A2BCD is significantly faster than sync-NU_ACDM despite being in an ideal synchronous environment. In large-scale heterogeneous systems, sync-NU_ACDM may face synchronization overhead, bandwidth constraints, and latency issues. In large-scale heterogeneous systems, A2BCD has a significant advantage over sync-NU_ACDM due to synchronization overhead, bandwidth constraints, and latency issues. Efficient implementation requires coordinate blocks of size greater than 1 to ensure the efficiency of linear algebra subroutines. Storing y k and v k centrally allows for fast updates based on delayed gradients \u2207 i k f (\u0177 k). In large-scale heterogeneous systems, A2BCD is advantageous over sync-NU_ACDM due to synchronization overhead, bandwidth constraints, and latency issues. Efficient implementation requires coordinate blocks of size greater than 1 for linear algebra subroutines. Storing y k and v k centrally allows for fast updates based on delayed gradients \u2207 i k f (\u0177 k). A write mutex over (y, v) has minimal overhead and ensures unambiguous labeling of iterates. It is not necessary in practice and does not affect convergence rates or computation time. Convergence can be proven under more general asynchronicity.Coefficients may be underestimated or overestimated if exact values are unavailable. x k can be eliminated from the iteration, and the block gradient \u2207 i k f (\u0177 k ) only needs to be calculated once per iteration. A larger maximum delay \u03c4 will cause a larger asynchronicity parameter \u03c8. To estimate the asynchronicity parameter \u03c8, a dry run with all coefficients set to 0 can be performed to estimate the maximum delay \u03c4. \u03c8 and \u03c4 do not affect the execution patterns of processors but change parameters. Tuning showed that \u03c8 = 0.25 resulted in good performance. It is difficult to achieve acceleration without prior knowledge of \u03c3, the strong convexity modulus. Ideally, \u03c3 should be pre-specified in a regularization term. If Lipschitz constants cannot be calculated directly, convergence can still be proven under more general asynchronicity. The line-search method from Roux et al. (2012) can be used when Lipschitz constants cannot be directly calculated. Lee & Sidford (2013a) proposed a linear transformation for sparse coordinate updates. The proposed algorithm eliminates x_k from A2BCD and defines auxiliary variables p_k, q_k. The gradient of the dual function is given by a sparse evolution of variables p_k and q_k. The proposed algorithm in A2BCD eliminates x_k and introduces auxiliary variables p_k, q_k for sparse coordinate updates. The gradient of the dual function is computed using these auxiliary vectors, Ap_k and Aq_k. Algorithm 1 provides an efficient implementation for this method, which involves periodically recovering v_k and y_k, resetting values, and restarting the scheme. Each computing node maintains local outdated versions of p, q, Ap, Aq for optimization. The proposed algorithm in A2BCD introduces auxiliary variables p_k, q_k for sparse coordinate updates. Algorithm 1 efficiently implements this method by periodically recovering v_k and y_k. Each computing node maintains local outdated versions of p, q, Ap, Aq for optimization. The algorithm involves randomly selecting block i, reading shared data into local memory, computing block gradient, and increasing iteration count. The text also discusses inequalities for convex functions and defines a norm. Lemma 8 is essential for analyzing terms related to asynchronicity in the algorithm. The terms resulting from asynchronicity are identified and analyzed separately from traditional Nesterov analysis. Equations B.8 and B.9 are proven using strong convexity and Lipschitz continuity. The proof involves utilizing Lemma 8 with specific parameters. Lemma 8 is crucial for analyzing terms related to asynchronicity in the algorithm. The proof of equation B.9 involves utilizing Lemma 8 with specific parameters and considering the growth of the f(x_k) term in the Lyapunov function. The proof also involves analyzing the middle term and combining equations B.11 to complete the proof. Lemma 11 explains how asynchronicity errors can be incorporated into a Lyapunov function, allowing for the conversion of difficult difference terms into more manageable terms that can be negated. This conversion maintains a convergence rate of r. The proof analyzes the cost of negating difference terms in equation B.13 and B.14, using algebraic manipulation and the definitions of h and \u03b1. The master inequality for the Lyapunov function \u03c1 k is derived, showing linear convergence to 0 with rate \u03b2. Lemma 13 presents the master inequality, organizing terms and adding function-value and asynchronicity terms to the analysis. The coefficient formula from equation 2.9 is recovered using Lemma 11 with a specific choice of parameters. The proof shows that every coefficient in equation B.16 is 0 or less, completing the proof of Theorem 1. The coefficient in Lemma 13 is proven to be non-positive by bounding c1 and using a specific inequality. The proof of Theorem 1 involves analyzing coefficients and using inequalities to show a decrease in the Lyapunov function. The complexity of NU_ACDM is then determined based on certain conditions and expressions. The proof of Theorem 1 involves analyzing coefficients and using inequalities to show a decrease in the Lyapunov function. The complexity of NU_ACDM is then determined based on certain conditions and expressions. The derivation of ODE for synchronous A2BCD involves defining parameters and iterating to find coefficients, leading to a convergence proof in Section 3. The modification of coefficients for the asynchronicity parameter leads to increased complexity in the proof, with no restriction on \u03c8 and \u03c4. The resulting condition matches Theorem 3 in Section 3, but the stronger result is not proven due to space and simplicity constraints."
