    "content": "Both NATO and the European Community (EC), now the European Union (EU), were established post-World War II to bring stability to Europe. NATO's original purpose was collective defense against potential threats from the Soviet Union, while the EC/EU aimed to secure democracy and free markets. Congress and Administrations have strongly supported both organizations, believing that stability in Europe fosters democracy, military allies, and trading partners. In the 110th Congress, Members are likely to focus on NATO's development of mobile combat forces, its role in Afghanistan, potential missile defense systems for Europe, and alliance enlargement. The evolution of the NATO-EU relationship post-Soviet Union collapse in 1991 has led to friction between the United States and its allies over security responsibilities. European NATO allies within the EC/EU sought to build a security apparatus to respond to threats specific to Europe after the Gulf War in 1990. France and other European governments realized their lack of military capabilities to address distant threats, leading to discussions with the US. The European NATO allies sought to establish the European Security and Defense Identity (ESDI) within NATO to address distant threats. The Clinton Administration initially hesitated to involve the US in conflicts in Yugoslavia, prompting allies to enhance political consultation, unity, and military capabilities. NATO endorsed steps to build a separable ESDI in 1994-1996. In 1994-1996, NATO endorsed steps to establish an ESDI within NATO to give European allies the ability to act in crises. The EU later adopted ESDI as its own, transforming it into a European Security and Defense Policy (ESDP) with a focus on independence from NATO tutelage and more defined decision-making structures. The Kosovo conflict of 1999 highlighted the need for more mobile and sustainable forces for crisis management within the EU. Disputes with the US over involving international institutions and the balance between political and military instruments have fueled European desires for a more independent ESDP closely tied to NATO. Congress is actively engaged in the evolving NATO-EU relationship. Congress supports greater political integration in the NATO-EU relationship and calls for improved European military capabilities to combat terrorism and WMD proliferation. The Senate approved new members to enhance European stability and democratic governments. Senator Jon Kyl emphasized the need for NATO to counter new threats like terrorism and WMD proliferation. The European allies are urged to develop capabilities for projecting power and forming ad hoc coalitions. NATO's Strategic Concept emphasizes the need for national military capabilities to deploy forces rapidly and operate jointly with the United States. The debate over European security in the 1990s continues today, focusing on NATO and EU missions, the balance between political and military instruments in defense, and addressing terrorism and proliferation. The report discusses NATO and EU's roles in defending against terrorism and proliferation. NATO's 1999 Strategic Concept highlights the need to address nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons proliferation. Terrorism is also recognized as a threat, with emphasis on political and diplomatic solutions. The document discusses NATO's response to terrorism and proliferation threats. After the 9/11 attacks, NATO agreed to field forces quickly and established a NATO Response Force for rapid deployment in operations, including fighting terrorism. NATO allies agreed to develop new capabilities under the Prague Capabilities Commitment (PCC) to sustain European defense budgets. Despite differences, there is a transatlantic agreement on common threats, the NRF, and the PCC. The allies' response to the Bush Administration's doctrine of \"pre-emptive attack\" in the face of an imminent threat captures elements of the transatlantic debate over response to the threat. Some allies view the doctrine as an example of U.S. unilateralism, believing military action must be undertaken within a multilateral framework. The allied debate over pre-emptive attack was affected by the U.S. decision to terminate UN weapons inspections and go to war against Iraq in March 2003. The conflict in March 2003 was aimed at preventing the Hussein regime from using weapons of mass destruction. The refusal by some allies to approve NATO military assistance to Turkey in anticipation of an attack by Iraq caused division in the alliance. The inability to find WMD in Iraq led European allies to insist on a UN resolution for NATO operations. Europeans are cautious about crossing borders and resorting to military action without international legitimacy. The establishment of the United Nations in 1946, under U.S. leadership, aimed to enhance understanding of impending dangers and how to respond to them. The North Atlantic Treaty's reliance on consensus decision-making and the debate over pre-emptive attacks were highlighted by the Bush Administration's frustration with alliance decision-making procedures. The Administration believes NATO military actions should be conducted by \"coalitions of the willing\" to counter threats. The European allies prefer consensus decision-making within NATO to maintain political solidarity for controversial measures. They believe that coalitions of the willing undermine alliance solidarity. This was evident in NATO's decision to intervene in Kosovo in 1999 when Russian resistance blocked a UN Security Council resolution. The missile defense system proposed for Poland and the Czech Republic to defend against a potential Iranian missile attack raised concerns in Congress and Europe. Allies are debating the need for a new NATO Strategic Concept to address the balance between military and political tools for global stability. Discussions on drafting a new Strategic Concept are expected at NATO's Bucharest summit in April 2008. Many allies lack mobile forces for operations outside Europe. Former NATO Secretary General George Robertson highlighted the limited deployment of non-U.S. allies on multinational operations. Former NATO Supreme Allied Commander General James Jones highlighted the need for more expeditionarily deployable European forces to support multinational operations like the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan. The NATO Response Force and Prague Capabilities Commitment were proposed to address this issue by creating integrated forces with shared funding for capabilities like aerial refuelers and airlift capacities. This would help reduce costs for individual governments and improve the effectiveness of deployments. At NATO's Riga summit in November 2006, the allies declared the NRF fully operational with 20,000 troops on rotation in high-readiness status. The NRF can respond to various crises within 7-30 days but has faced challenges in filling out rotations due to concerns about costs and equitable burden-sharing among allies. Some governments are hesitant to contribute forces, leading to a debate on the NRF's evolving role. The debate over the role of the NRF at NATO centers on whether it should be used in current operations like Afghanistan or preserved as a quick-insertion force in crises to encourage military transformation. General Jones advocates for more joint funding of NATO assets to ensure equipment availability. Currently, NATO operates on a \"costs lie where they fall\" principle, leading to concerns about disproportionate burdens on larger countries for providing security. At the Riga summit, sixteen allies announced pooling resources to purchase four Boeing C-17s in 2007, enhancing NATO's airlift capability. The Prague Capabilities Commitment (PCC) targets allies' deficiencies with goals like strategic lift, aerial refueling, and special forces. NATO also announced a fully operational Chemical/Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear defense battalion at the Istanbul summit in June 2004. The Chemical/Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear defense battalion is fully operational, sea lift procurement is progressing, and precision-guided munitions acquisition is on track. However, there are serious shortfalls in aerial refuelers and air lift, hindering PCC goals. Allies' capabilities list is integrated, but some systems are not being acquired, affecting overall effectiveness. Improved lift capacity is crucial for timely deployment of equipment and forces. Competing budget priorities, like pension programs, are delaying military modernization plans for some governments like Germany. The German parliament has reduced defense expenditures and capped them for the next few years. At the 2006 NATO Riga summit, allies called for developing forces with specific deployment and sustained operation capabilities. Analysts are concerned about potential competition between NATO and the EU for mobile, high-readiness forces. The EU is creating its own rapid reaction forces, some of which can be used by both the EU and NATO. The EU is also enhancing its military capabilities and equipment procurement, including strategic lift and weapons for enemy air defense suppression. The issue of which organization, NATO or the EU, could use national forces if there were simultaneous crises has not been resolved. Some NATO officials believe that the EU places more restrictions on use of its forces than does NATO, reflected in the training of those forces. Former SACEUR General Jones criticized NATO governments for imposing restrictions on tasks forces may undertake, causing trouble in operations such as in the Balkans. In March 2004, German troops refused orders to join other elements of KFOR in crowd control during riots in Kosovo. German troops in Kosovo refused orders to join KFOR in crowd control, with only 6,000 of 18,000 troops authorized to use force. NATO is addressing this issue by providing more riot-control training. In Afghanistan, some governments have placed restrictions on their forces, such as lack of equipment, night flight bans, and movement limitations. Germany limits its forces to northern Afghanistan, only deploying to the south in urgent situations. The allies lifted some caveats at the Riga summit, but national restrictions remain. At the Riga summit, national caveats in Afghanistan were discussed as an expression of sovereignty by member governments. The United States criticized governments for placing restrictions on their forces, while some allies argue that the US also has its own caveats under a different name. US military officials oppose national caveats as they complicate force-planning processes. Military officials oppose national caveats as they complicate force-planning processes. With caveats in place, force planners must persuade member states to supply troops with the necessary authority and skills for the mission. NATO's KFOR operation in Kosovo has been ongoing since 1999, tasked with maintaining security and supporting an international civilian administration. A study recommended \"supervised independence\" for Kosovo, opposed by Serbia and Russia, with the US and European governments considering recognition even without Russian approval. NATO confirms forces will stay in Kosovo for stability. Kosovo may test NATO-EU cooperation. NATO's key priority is peace in Afghanistan. NATO leads ISAF to stabilize Afghanistan, while the US leads OEF to eliminate Taliban and Al Qaeda. NATO aims to bring ISAF and OEF missions closer together. In 2006, ISAF took control of all of Afghanistan under a U.N. resolution with approximately 41,000 troops from NATO member states, including the United States, Germany, Canada, Britain, France, and the Netherlands. Partner countries like Australia and New Zealand have also contributed troops. The Taliban has seen a resurgence since 2006, particularly in the southern and eastern parts of the country, taking advantage of the weak governance in Kabul and the re-emergence of warlords. ISAF has established Provincial Reconstruction Teams (PRTs) in Afghanistan to extend central government authority, provide security, and boost the economy. However, the effort has had mixed success due to slow sponsorship and lack of deployable forces. Allies are debating the next steps to stabilize the country, with some believing NATO relies too heavily on combat power. NATO is urged to focus more on economic and political reconstruction in Afghanistan, rather than relying solely on combat power. The United States and allies are facing challenges in stabilizing the country, particularly in the south and east where fighting is intense. Efforts are being made to combat Afghanistan's significant opium production, which fuels corruption and violence. The United States and allies are debating ways to eliminate opium production in Afghanistan. The Bush Administration proposed an aerial spraying program, but the Karzai government and allies are resisting. Afghanistan's weak institutions hinder progress, and some allies believe the Afghan government should lead efforts to reduce the poppy crop. The U.S. invasion of Iraq has caused controversy within the alliance. France and Germany argued that the main threats to allies were from Iran and North Korea's nuclear programs, as well as instability in Pakistan and Afghanistan. They believed Iraq could be contained through sanctions and UN inspections. Transatlantic differences over Iraq led to a dispute in NATO in 2003. The debate over NATO's role in Iraq intensified after the failure to find WMD. The US Administration argued that stabilizing Iraq was in the interest of all allies. The Bush Administration has gained some NATO involvement in Iraq for a training mission for Iraqi security forces. Many allies, including France and Germany, believe that stabilizing Iraq is crucial to the volatile Middle East, but they are skeptical of U.S. policy favoring Israel excessively and doubt the ability of outside powers to develop democracy in Iraq. Most NATO allies have withdrawn their troops from Iraq, a country with sectarian divisions and no history of representative government. Several countries joined NATO in 2004, with Albania, Croatia, and Macedonia being candidates for future enlargement. Macedonia is seen as making the most progress towards NATO membership, despite being a poor country with limited military capabilities. Croatia has a stronger economy but faces challenges in achieving stability. Croatia, Albania, Georgia, and Ukraine face challenges in NATO membership. Georgia's conflicts with Russia and autocratic practices hinder its progress. The Bush Administration aims to fast-track Georgia's membership, but some allies resist. Ukraine is likely on a slower track than Georgia. Ukraine's slower track for NATO membership is influenced by its large Russian population and economic potential, which Russia opposes. Legislation in the 110th Congress endorsed enlargement and provided security assistance for candidate states like Georgia and Ukraine. Hearings on Albania, Croatia, and Macedonia's candidacies are expected in the second session. The Bush Administration proposed elements of a U.S. ground-based system to Poland and the Czech Republic in 2007. The Administration proposed placing elements of a U.S. missile defense system in Poland and the Czech Republic for defense against a possible Iranian missile attack. The proposal sparked controversy among NATO officials and governments, with concerns about bypassing alliance vetting and potential implications for Russia's missile capabilities. The Administration proposed a missile defense system in Poland and the Czech Republic to deter potential Iranian missile attacks. Congress questioned the system's timing and feasibility, suggesting more mobile systems. The 110th Congress blocked funding for site development in FY2008, pending agreements with both countries. Warsaw and Prague raised concerns about becoming targets in a conflict. Poland requested the US to pay for an upgraded air defense system. The United States is facing opposition from public opinion in both countries regarding the proposed upgraded air defense system. The Bush Administration's focus on shifting NATO's mission to combating terrorism and proliferation in the Middle East has raised concerns and challenges from some allies. Despite all allies recognizing terrorism and proliferation as serious threats and the need for more expeditionary forces, key allies have doubts about the Administration's leadership and commitment to NATO. International political considerations also play a role in questioning U.S. leadership, especially among EU members who value international institutions for solving transnational problems. The legacy of two world wars in Europe continues to influence these dynamics. The legacy of two world wars in Europe shapes governments' policies, supporting the establishment of the UN, EU, and NATO to prevent illegitimate violations of sovereignty. European opposition to the Bush Administration's pre-emptive action doctrine stems from a belief in the absence of a strong international security architecture. The US, by avoiding reliance on the UN, is seen as a revolutionary hyperpower due to its resort to force in Iraq without clear UN support. This contrasts with past US global leadership embedded in the international rule of law. The Clinton and Bush Administrations justified the use of force without UN authorization in Kosovo and Iraq due to impending threats. Some allies criticize the US for using NATO as a \"toolbox\" and advocating for coalitions of the willing. Some allies criticize the US for using NATO as a \"toolbox\" and advocating for coalitions of the willing, arguing that the Administration's doctrine weakens allied solidarity and reliance on military power over political solutions. They emphasize the importance of their strategic relationship with the United States. The European Union has discussed creating a common security and defense policy, with past efforts hindered by concerns over national sovereignty and NATO's role. In 1998, UK Prime Minister Tony Blair shifted Britain's stance to support an EU defense arm, aligning with France to push for a separate defense identity. This move was influenced by U.S. hesitancy in the Balkans and Blair's desire for European leadership. The EU's European Security and Defense Policy (ESDP) was propelled by deficiencies in European defense capabilities highlighted during NATO's 1999 Kosovo air campaign. ESDP aims to strengthen the Union's Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) and enhance its global influence, while providing member states with more crisis response options. The EU emphasizes that ESDP is not meant to replace NATO's defense role or weaken the transatlantic alliance, with most EU members, including the UK, advocating for ESDP to be linked to NATO. At the NATO Washington Summit in April 1999, NATO welcomed the EU's commitment to bolster its defense capabilities. France and some other EU countries support the development of an autonomous EU defense arm to counterbalance the United States on the international stage. However, new French President Nicolas Sarkozy takes a pragmatic approach, emphasizing the importance of a U.S. component in European security through NATO. U.S. support for EU-led operations is conditioned on three \"redlines,\" including ESDP complementing NATO and not threatening its unity. The EU announced its determination to develop an autonomous capacity for military operations at its December 1999 Helsinki summit. This included establishing a decision-making framework for ESDP and a 60,000-strong rapid reaction force to be operational by 2003, deployable within 60 days for at least a year. Non-EU NATO members were concerned about being excluded from participating in ESDP and lending NATO assets to the EU. The EU aimed to have a 60,000-strong rapid reaction force operational by 2003 for humanitarian assistance, peacekeeping, and peace enforcement tasks. Troops would be drawn from existing national forces, not a standing EU army. Efforts were made to restructure European defense industries to support ESDP military requirements. Additionally, the EU focused on developing civilian capacities for crisis management, including a civilian police force and deployable teams of experts in various fields. In December 2004, EU leaders agreed on a Civilian Headline Goal for 2008 to enhance civilian crisis management capabilities. New defense decision-making bodies were established, including the Political and Security Committee, the Military Committee, and the Military Staff. Cooperation mechanisms with NATO were also set up to address U.S. concerns about ESDP. The EU-NATO link was formalized in December 2002, leading to the implementation of the \"Berlin Plus\" arrangement in March 2003. This arrangement allows the EU to borrow NATO assets for EU-led operations, preventing duplication of structures and unnecessary defense spending. It also provides the EU with access to NATO planning capabilities and common assets for operations where the Alliance as a whole is not involved. The EU-NATO link was formalized in December 2002, leading to the implementation of the \"Berlin Plus\" arrangement in March 2003. This allows the EU to access NATO common assets for EU-led operations not involving the Alliance as a whole. In December 2003, NATO and the EU agreed to enhance the EU's military planning capabilities and NATO-EU links, including establishing an EU planning cell at NATO headquarters and adding a small cell for operational planning within the EU Military Staff. This agreement was controversial for some NATO advocates and U.S. officials concerned about potential rivalry with NATO structures. The EU-NATO link was formalized in December 2002, leading to the implementation of the \"Berlin Plus\" arrangement in March 2003. In December 2003, NATO and the EU agreed to enhance the EU's military planning capabilities and NATO-EU links. Washington approved a deal for a new EU cell, which scaled back earlier proposals for a separate European military headquarters. UK officials argued that blocking the initiative would lead to a European headquarters outside of the EU structure, which would be more objectionable to NATO interests. NATO-EU relations remain somewhat strained due to differences in membership and ongoing disputes. The EU-NATO link was formalized in December 2002 with the \"Berlin Plus\" arrangement in March 2003. NATO and the EU agreed to enhance military planning capabilities and links in December 2003. However, disputes over membership differences, the Cyprus issue, and differing views on NATO-EU relations have strained cooperation. Turkey objects to Cyprus participating in NATO-EU meetings, limiting discussions to joint operations in Bosnia and military capabilities improvement. Disputes have also hindered cooperation in operations in Afghanistan. Enhancing European military capabilities remains a key challenge for the EU. European military capabilities have been a key challenge for the EU in establishing a credible ESDP. The 1999 NATO war in Kosovo highlighted deficiencies in European military assets compared to U.S. forces, including strategic airlift, precision-guided munitions, and intelligence. EU leaders aimed to enhance force deployability and sustainability through the \"Headline Goal\" rapid reaction force, with some members envisioning a combat capability equivalent to NATO. This effort required reorienting and increasing defense spending to fill equipment gaps. In 2000 and 2001, the EU organized military capability commitment conferences to address capability shortfalls for the rapid reaction force. Member states pledged over 60,000 troops, 400 combat aircraft, and 100 naval vessels. The European Capability Action Plan (ECAP) was initiated in 2001 to address capability gaps. By May 2003, the EU declared operational capability for the rapid reaction force but acknowledged limitations and recognized defense capability shortfalls. ESDP missions are expected to focus on lower-end tasks rather than higher-end peace enforcement operations in the near to medium term. EU officials acknowledge that European defense spending is insufficient for all ESDP requirements. Despite limited budgets, they aim to enhance defense capabilities by utilizing existing resources more effectively. Rationalizing member states' defense efforts and promoting multinational projects are key goals of ECAP, with options like leasing commercial assets and sharing resources being considered. The EU is considering various options to enhance defense capabilities, such as leasing commercial assets, sharing national assets, niche specialization, and joint procurement projects. In 2004, the European Defense Agency (EDA) was established to improve military capabilities and cooperation. The EDA aims to help EU members maximize defense funds through collaboration in weapons research, development, and procurement. In 2005, EU defense ministers agreed on a voluntary code of conduct to promote cross-border competition in the defense equipment market. The EU introduced a code of conduct in 2005 to promote competition in the defense equipment market, aiming to lower procurement costs and enhance capabilities. Critics doubt the effectiveness of this initiative, questioning whether member states will make necessary sacrifices to improve efficiency and competitiveness. The European Defense Agency's efforts to harmonize equipment purchases face skepticism due to member states' reluctance to relinquish national controls and expose defense industries to competition. Critics doubt the effectiveness of the voluntary code of conduct to liberalize defense markets, with concerns about slow adoption and continued investment in costly projects like the Airbus A400M. Some suggest buying U.S.-built transporters as a cheaper and quicker alternative. At the June 2004 EU summit in Brussels, EU leaders endorsed the Headline Goal 2010 to enhance European military capabilities, focusing on interoperability, deployability, and sustainability. The \"battlegroups concept\" aims to improve the EU's rapid crisis response with 1,500 high-readiness troops deployable within 15 days for stand-alone missions or as a spearhead force. The EU established 13 battlegroups at the third military capability commitment conference in November 2004, with the capacity to field two battlegroup operations simultaneously by January 2007. These battlegroups are expected to operate in trouble spots in Africa or the Balkans. The EU's battlegroups are seen as more sustainable and practical than the rapid reaction force. Emphasis on highly trained multinational formations shows EU's commitment to enhancing defense capabilities. The battlegroup concept complements the NATO Response Force, with the NRF likely to undertake higher-intensity operations. Despite challenges, the EU continues to push for ESDP. The EU has launched civilian and military missions in the Balkans under ESDP, with Operation Concordia replacing a NATO peacekeeping mission in Macedonia. Operation Althea, the largest ESDP military mission, started with 6,500 troops in Bosnia in 2004 and was downsized to 2,500 troops in 2007. NATO supports these missions through \"Berlin Plus\" arrangements. The EU has conducted military missions in the Balkans under ESDP, with Operation Concordia replacing a NATO peacekeeping mission in Macedonia. Operation Althea, the largest ESDP military mission, started with 6,500 troops in Bosnia in 2004 and was downsized to 2,500 troops in 2007. NATO retains a small headquarters presence in Sarajevo to assist with Bosnian defense reforms, counterterrorism efforts, and the apprehension of war criminals. Additionally, the EU led an international peacekeeping force in the Democratic Republic of Congo in 2003 to stop rebel fighting and protect aid workers, surprising many observers with its geographical reach and independence from NATO assets.

NATO retains a small headquarters presence in Sarajevo to assist with Bosnian defense reforms, counterterrorism efforts, and the apprehension of war criminals. The EU led an international peacekeeping force in the Democratic Republic of Congo in 2003 to stop rebel fighting and protect aid workers, showing its independence from NATO assets. EU officials consulted with NATO about the mission but maintained they were not obliged to ask for permission since they were not requesting to use NATO assets. In June 2005, the EU and NATO agreed to coordinate efforts to airlift African Union peacekeepers to Sudan to help quell violence in Darfur. In January 2008, the EU approved deploying a 3,700-strong peacekeeping force to Chad to protect Sudanese refugees. In 2005, the EU launched civilian missions in Asia and the Middle East, including training Iraqi police and monitoring peace agreements in Banda Aceh, Indonesia. They also deployed monitors to the Rafah border crossing between Gaza and Egypt. The EU maintained its mission in Gaza despite the closure of the Rafah checkpoint in 2007. They also established police training missions in Palestine and Afghanistan, expanding their reach beyond Kabul. However, Turkey's obstruction of NATO-EU cooperation in Afghanistan has been a challenge. U.S. officials have called for more EU trainers in Afghanistan. The EU has increased its involvement in promoting security and stability in its wider European neighborhood. This includes setting up civilian rule of law missions in Georgia and launching a border mission to Moldova and Ukraine. EU leaders see the European Security and Defense Policy (ESDP) as a key project for European integration. Efforts to boost defense capabilities should complement NATO's. Countries like the UK, Italy, and Spain are looking to enhance ESDP over the next decade. Countries like the UK, Italy, and Spain aim to strengthen the European Security and Defense Policy (ESDP) by bringing more military hardware to the table. Newer EU member states from central and eastern Europe support ESDP but emphasize the importance of not weakening NATO. Germany, critical to ESDP's success, has been cautious in its involvement due to U.S. concerns. In 2003, during the transatlantic dispute over Iraq, the German government appeared receptive to French efforts to create a separate European defense arm independent of NATO. In 2003, French, German, Belgian, and Luxembourg leaders discussed creating a separate European military headquarters and armaments agency. Germany has since shifted its stance to improve ties with the United States. France has traditionally aimed for a more autonomous European defense identity, but new French President Sarkozy has downplayed building up ESDP as an alternative to NATO. Sarkozy suggests France may draw closer to NATO by rejoining its integrated military command structure and supports improving NATO-EU cooperation. He also believes the EU should develop its own command and planning structure, which is opposed by the UK and other EU countries. The EU has debated expanding ESDP's role to include combating external terrorist threats and developing counter-terrorism force requirements. In 2002, EU leaders agreed to develop counter-terrorism force requirements but did not expand the Petersberg tasks. There is a growing recognition among EU member states that ESDP must address new challenges to remain relevant. The Lisbon Treaty suggests expanding Petersberg tasks to combat terrorism. After the 2004 terrorist bombings in Spain, EU leaders called for ESDP to contribute to the fight against terrorism. In November 2004, EU officials outlined a plan to enhance EU military and civilian capabilities to prevent and protect against terrorist attacks, improve crisis management, and support third countries in combating terrorism. The focus on countering terrorism is not the main priority of ESDP, as it is seen as primarily a law enforcement and political issue. The U.S. has supported the EU's ESDP project to enhance European defense capabilities and work more effectively with U.S. forces. The EU's ESDP agenda has made quick progress, with missions in the Balkans and Congo showing effective crisis management. US officials support tying EU defense efforts to NATO to prevent competition and maintain transatlantic security. France and other EU members pushing for autonomous defense identity raise concerns about potential rivalry with NATO. Critics argue that NATO-EU rivalry delayed a mission in Sudan in 2005. They believe the current parallel airlift missions by NATO and the EU are inefficient. Concerns include decreased US influence in Europe and potential complications in alliance decision-making. EU's rapid reaction force plans may impact NATO's forces availability for larger crises. The EU's success in establishing defense decision-making bodies has not been matched by capability improvements, potentially leading to a situation where the EU may need the United States and NATO to bail it out in a conflict."
