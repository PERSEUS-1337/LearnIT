    "title": "AB 1671",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 632 of the Penal Code in California is amended. Section 632 of the Penal Code is amended to include penalties for using electronic devices to eavesdrop on confidential communications without consent. Penalties include fines up to $10,000 and imprisonment for up to one year. For the purposes of this section, \"person\" refers to individuals or entities, excluding those known to be overhearing or recording confidential communications. \"Confidential communication\" includes any communication intended to be private, excluding those made in public or open settings where overhearing or recording is expected. Evidence obtained from eavesdropping or recording confidential communications in violation of this section is not admissible in any legal proceedings. This section does not apply to public utilities providing communication services, telephonic communication systems used exclusively within certain facilities, or instruments used under public utility tariffs. This section exempts the use of hearing aids and similar devices by individuals with impaired hearing to overcome their impairment and hear sounds audible to the human ear. A new section is added to the Penal Code, stating that a person who violates a specific section shall be punished if they intentionally disclose confidential communication with a health care provider obtained in violation of the law, on social media or any other platform. A violation of the new Penal Code section may result in a fine up to $2,500 or imprisonment. Repeat offenders may face a fine up to $10,000. The term \"health care provider\" includes licensed individuals under Division 2 of the Business and Professions Code. The individuals or entities covered under the new Penal Code section include licensed healthcare providers, certified individuals, clinics, health facilities, employees of healthcare service plans, professionals associated with healthcare providers, and professional organizations representing healthcare providers. The disclosure or distribution of a confidential communication is exempt under certain circumstances, such as when a party overhears or records a communication within the scope of their authority, related to sexual assault, or authorized by specific sections of the law. The Penal Code allows for the recording of confidential communications in specific situations, such as obtaining evidence of a crime, recording prohibited communications in cases of domestic violence, or when a peace officer needs to eavesdrop during an emergency. This section does not impact the admissibility of evidence allowed by other specified sections. Section 633.5 of the Penal Code is amended to allow one party to a confidential communication to record it for the purpose of obtaining evidence related to certain crimes. This amendment does not make the evidence inadmissible in a prosecution for those crimes. Section 637.2 is also amended. Section 637.2 of the Penal Code is amended to allow individuals to bring actions against violators for damages or injunctions, without the need for actual damages as a prerequisite. This section does not affect Title 4 of the Civil Code. The amendment to Section 637.2 of the Penal Code allows individuals to take legal action against violators for damages or injunctions without requiring actual damages as a prerequisite. This change does not impose any reimbursement costs on local agencies or school districts as it pertains to creating, eliminating, or changing penalties for crimes or infractions."
