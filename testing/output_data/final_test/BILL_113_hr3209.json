    "content": "The Act titled \"Boko Haram Terrorist Designation Act of 2013\" establishes the designation of Boko Haram as a foreign terrorist organization. Boko Haram, a Nigerian jihadist organization, has been responsible for over 10,000 deaths since its founding in 2001. The group is designated as a terrorist organization by the Government of Nigeria and claimed responsibility for the 2011 bombing of the United Nations Building in Abuja. In 2011, Boko Haram bombed the United Nations Building in Abuja, killing 21 and injuring 60. The group is interested in targeting the U.S. Embassy and hotels frequented by Westerners. The criteria for designating an organization as a Foreign Terrorist Organization include being a foreign organization. The organization must be foreign and engage in terrorist activity that threatens the security of United States nationals or national security. Boko Haram has met the criteria for designation as a Foreign Terrorist Organization. The Secretary of State should designate Boko Haram as a Foreign Terrorist Organization within 60 days, or provide a report to Congress explaining the reasons for not doing so. Sanctions will be imposed on individuals who knowingly support Boko Haram or its affiliates, associated groups, or agents. Sanctions will be imposed on individuals in the United States or under U.S. jurisdiction who provide material support to Boko Haram or its affiliates. The term \"material support or resources\" is defined in section 2339A(b)(1) of title 18, United States Code. Additionally, members or representatives of Boko Haram are not eligible for visas to enter the United States. Any alien who is a member or representative of Boko Haram or its affiliates can be removed from the United States under certain circumstances. US financial institutions holding funds linked to Boko Haram must report and retain control over the funds."
