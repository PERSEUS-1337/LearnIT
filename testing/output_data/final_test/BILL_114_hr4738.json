The Digital Coast Act of 2016 finds that access to geospatial information for the coastal region is crucial for public safety and the economy, with over half of the US population living near a coast. Coastal counties have a higher population density compared to the national average. The Digital Coast Act of 2016 emphasizes the importance of geospatial data for coastal regions due to their high economic productivity and population density. Remote sensing data is crucial for various coastal management activities such as flood prediction, hazard assessment, and community resilience planning. The Digital Coast Act of 2016 highlights the significance of geospatial data for coastal areas. This data is essential for activities like flood prediction, hazard assessment, and community resilience planning. Additionally, it supports tasks such as local planning, habitat assessments, and landscape change detection. The Digital Coast Act of 2016 emphasizes the importance of geospatial data for coastal areas, supporting activities like flood prediction, hazard assessment, and community resilience planning. The Digital Coast Act of 2016 defines key terms related to geospatial data for coastal regions, including \"coastal region,\" \"coastal state,\" \"Federal Geographic Data Committee,\" and \"remote sensing and other geospatial.\" The Digital Coast Act of 2016 defines terms related to geospatial data for coastal regions, including surveys, maps, charts, satellite data, and services provided by professionals like surveyors and cartographers. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Commerce acting through the Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Establishment of the Digital Coast. The Secretary will establish the \"Digital Coast\" program to provide an enabling platform integrating geospatial data, tools, training, and best practices for coastal management. The program aims to enhance resilient communities, ecosystem values, and coastal economic growth through cost-effective solutions. The program requirements include data integration, tool development, training, documentation, dissemination, and archive. The Digital Coast program aims to enhance coastal management by providing integrated data, decision-support tools, training, documentation, and archiving of raw data to Federal standards. The Digital Coast program aims to enhance coastal management by coordinating activities with coastal managers, decisionmakers, coastal States, local governments, academia, private sector, and NGOs to optimize data collection and minimize duplication. The Secretary also consults with other Federal agencies on relevant activities. The Digital Coast program aims to enhance coastal management by coordinating activities with various stakeholders and ensuring interoperability of geospatial data among different users, including NOAA, federal agencies, state and local governments, and the private sector. The Secretary will coordinate with the Federal Geographic Data Committee, seek assistance and cooperation, and provide liaison as required by Office of Management and Budget Circular A-16 and Executive Order 12906. The program will focus on maximizing the use of remote sensing and geospatial data collection to fill data needs and gaps for coastal management, including underserved areas and the Arctic under U.S. jurisdiction. The program aims to support the coordination and integration of key data sets for coastal management in the United States. This includes data on coastal elevation, land use, socioeconomic factors, critical infrastructure, structures, living resources, cadastral information, and aerial imagery. The priority is to integrate these data sets with other available data to benefit coastal resource management constituents and applications. The Secretary may enter into financial agreements to support the coastal management program, including grants, contracts, and registration fees for training and conferences. The Secretary may enter into contracts with private sector entities for products and services necessary for collecting and processing geospatial data. These contracts are considered \"surveying and mapping\" services and may require appropriations to carry out. The Secretary may enter into contracts with private sector entities for surveying and mapping services, requiring appropriations to carry out the program in fiscal years 2017 through 2021."
