    "content": "Hydraulic fracturing is a technique used to extract oil and gas from underground rock formations by pumping a fluid under high pressure to crack the rock. The fluid typically contains water, sand, and chemical additives to aid in the process. Some additives can be harmful to health and the environment. In 2011, President Barack Obama directed Secretary of Energy Steven Chu to form a panel to study the effects of shale gas production on health and the environment. The Shale Gas Production Subcommittee of the Secretary of Energy Advisory Board recommended public disclosure of all chemical ingredients in fracturing fluids on a \"well-by-well basis\" to aid in medical emergencies and health studies. The report provides an overview of laws and regulations requiring disclosure of chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing, despite industry reluctance due to concerns about revealing proprietary formulas. In 2012, President Obama called for disclosure of chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing on public lands. The Bureau of Land Management proposed a rule for disclosure, and there were legislative efforts for broader disclosure requirements at both federal and state levels. State regulators and industry representatives argue that current state regulation of hydraulic fracturing is sufficient, with at least 15 states having some form of chemical disclosure requirements. These requirements vary in terms of who must disclose information, what information must be disclosed about chemical additives, protections for trade secrets, and timing of disclosure. Other states are also considering implementing disclosure laws or regulations. For a glossary of terms, refer to Appendix A. No federal law currently requires detailed disclosure of hydraulic fracturing fluid chemicals. Under EPCRA, facilities with hazardous chemicals may have to comply with emergency planning, release notification, and storage reporting. Environmental groups have petitioned the EPA to regulate fracking chemicals under TSCA and require reporting under the Toxics Release Inventory. The Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) requires the industry to report toxic chemicals released under the EPA's Toxics Release Inventory to protect human health and the environment. The EPA can require manufacturers to report data on chemicals' effects and restrict chemicals presenting unreasonable risks. Environmental groups petitioned the EPA to regulate chemicals under TSCA for oil use. The petition urged the EPA to establish rules for testing E&P Chemicals used in oil and gas exploration, citing a lack of information on their health and environmental effects. EPA's authority under TSCA allows for testing of chemicals to assess risks to health and the environment. The petition urged the EPA to establish rules for testing E&P Chemicals used in oil and gas exploration due to potential risks to health and the environment. Earthjustice and other petitioners argued that these chemicals may pose unreasonable risks, including harm to people, animals, air, water, and soil. Testing is necessary to determine the impact of these chemicals on human health and the environment. The petitioners requested testing of E&P Chemicals used in oil and gas exploration to gather data on their effects. The EPA denied the request for a TSCA section 4 test rule, stating insufficient evidence was provided. Section 8 of TSCA allows the EPA to require data on health and environmental effects of chemicals. Earthjustice and advocacy groups asked the EPA to adopt a rule under TSCA section 8(a) to better understand the impact of E&P Chemicals on human health and the environment. The EPA partially granted petitioners' requests to require manufacturers and processors of E&P Chemicals to maintain records and submit reports disclosing the identities, quantities, and potential health and environmental effects of the chemicals. They also called for the submission of all existing health and safety studies related to E&P Chemicals. The EPA partially granted petitioners' requests for section 8(a) and 8(d) reporting requirements on chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing, but declined to issue rules for other chemicals in the oil and gas sector. The agency plans to discuss reporting requirements with stakeholders to minimize burdens and costs. No proposed rule has been issued yet, and concerns have been raised about potential duplication with state laws. The EPA may require manufacturers and processors of chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing to report information on their health and safety effects. State and federal disclosure requirements could both apply, as EPA rules under TSCA may not preempt state laws. The EPA's TSCA rule for hydraulic fracturing aims to complement state disclosure programs by providing aggregate chemical usage data. Concerns arise about potential overlap with future federal chemical disclosure rules by other agencies. EPA is mandated to coordinate with other federal agencies to enforce TSCA efficiently and minimize duplicative requirements. The EPA's TSCA rule aims to enforce regulations with minimal duplicative requirements. Issues may arise with trade secret disclosure and potential property rights violations. OSHA's Hazard Communication Standard ensures workplace safety regarding hazardous chemicals. Employees exposed to hazardous chemicals in the workplace must be aware of the potential dangers. Manufacturers and importers are required to obtain or develop Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) for hazardous hydraulic fracturing chemicals. MSDS must include basic information about the chemicals' identity, potential hazards, and safety precautions for handling. The HCS mandates operators to keep MSDS for hazardous chemicals on-site, which may provide limited information about hydraulic fracturing chemicals. Specific details required on MSDS include the common or chemical names of hazardous substances, while Chemical Abstract Service Registry Numbers (CASRNs) are not mandatory to list. Parties preparing MSDS have the option to withhold chemical information. The Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA) establishes programs to provide public information about hazardous chemicals in communities. It requires coordination between government levels and industries to prepare response plans for chemical emergencies. Each state is encouraged to establish a State Emergency Response Commission (SERC) which appoints Local Emergency Planning Committees (LEPC) for emergency planning districts. The Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) is responsible for developing emergency response plans for accidental chemical releases with input from stakeholders and submitting them to the State Emergency Response Commission (SERC). Facilities are subject to EPCRA's emergency planning requirements if they have extremely hazardous substances (EHS) present in quantities exceeding EPA thresholds. Notification to the SERC and community emergency coordinator is required for any EHS accidental release exceeding reportable quantities. Facility owners must submit MSDS or chemical inventory information for hazardous chemicals exceeding EPA thresholds to LEPC, SERC, and fire department under EPCRA Sections 311 and 312. LEPC provides MSDS to the public upon request for non-proprietary information. Two types of information, \"Tier I information\" and annual chemical inventory, may need to be submitted. Facility owners are required to report \"Tier I information\" and \"Tier II information\" for hazardous chemicals to LEPC, SERC, and fire department under EPCRA Sections 311 and 312. Tier II information includes the chemical name, storage location, and must be made available to the public upon request. If SERC or LEPC lacks information, they must request it from the facility owner. Section 313 of EPCRA requires facility owners to report information about the release of toxic chemicals into the environment. This information is disclosed to federal and state officials, who then make non-proprietary details available to the public via the Toxics Release Inventory (TRI) website. Reporting requirements apply to facilities with 10 or more full-time employees in certain industries that use listed toxic chemicals above threshold amounts. Oil and gas industry facilities are generally not included in these requirements. In October 2012, Earthworks and other environmental groups requested the EPA to include the oil and gas extraction industry in reporting toxic chemical releases under the TRI program. The EPA can add or remove industry codes as needed, considering factors like the presence of toxic chemicals at facilities and their activities involving these chemicals. The Earthworks petitioners argued that the oil and gas extraction industry should report toxic chemical releases under the TRI program due to their use of chemicals in drilling, well development, and hydraulic fracturing. Despite considering adding the industry to the reporting list in 1997, the EPA decided against it at that time. The EPA considered adding the oil and gas extraction industry to the TRI program for reporting toxic chemical releases in 1997 but decided against it due to uncertainties about defining \"facility\" under EPCRA section 313. This decision was influenced by concerns about how individual wells involved in related activities across large geographic areas would be included in the definition. In Sierra Club, Inc. v. Tyson Foods, Inc., plaintiffs sued defendants for failing to report ammonia releases from chicken production operations, alleging a violation of EPCRA section 304. In a lawsuit, plaintiffs claimed that multiple chicken houses owned by the same person could be considered a single \"facility\" under EPCRA section 304. BLM proposed regulations for hydraulic fracturing on federal lands, requiring approval and detailed disclosure before well stimulation activities. The BLM proposed regulations for hydraulic fracturing on federal lands, requiring detailed disclosure of well stimulation activities, including fluid volume, injection pressure, flowback handling, and post-activity chemical disclosure. The BLM proposed regulations for hydraulic fracturing on federal lands, requiring detailed disclosure of well stimulation activities, including fluid volume, injection pressure, flowback handling, and post-activity chemical disclosure. The proposed rule also sets forth reporting requirements similar to those adopted by the State of Colorado in 2011. Additionally, the Fracturing Responsibility and Awareness of Chemicals Act of 2011 was introduced in both the Senate and the House of Representatives, aiming to amend the Safe Drinking Water Act to include hydraulic fracturing and create a new disclosure requirement for chemicals used in the process. The FRAC Act amendment to the Safe Drinking Water Act would have required disclosure of chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing operations, including a list of chemicals, their constituents, Chemical Abstracts Service numbers, material safety data sheets, and anticipated volumes. The FRAC Act amendment to the Safe Drinking Water Act would have mandated disclosure of chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing operations, including a list of chemicals, their constituents, Chemical Abstracts Service numbers, material safety data sheets, and volumes. The disclosure requirements focused on the chemicals used, not their proprietary formulas or usage details. The FRAC Act aimed to mandate disclosure of chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing operations, focusing on the chemicals used rather than their proprietary formulas or usage details. Calls for disclosure have increased due to concerns about unknown chemicals in well water near oil and gas operations. At least 15 states require some disclosure of information about the chemicals added to hydraulic fracturing fluid. State requirements for disclosure of chemicals in hydraulic fracturing fluid vary widely, falling into four categories: parties required to disclose, information to be disclosed, protection of trade secrets, and timing of disclosure. States frequently update their laws on chemical disclosure, showing trends in how these provisions are structured. State disclosure laws for hydraulic fracturing require parties involved in the process to divulge information about the chemicals used in the fluid. Parties must disclose this information to the public or state agencies, with some states mandating public disclosure on websites like FracFocus Chemical Disclosure Registry. Some state laws do not mandate direct public disclosure of fracturing chemicals, but state agencies may choose to post the information on their websites. State open records laws may allow individuals to request chemical information submitted to state agencies, unless exempted as trade secrets. In four states, chemical information must be directly submitted to the public via websites like FracFocus Chemical Disclosure Registry. Other states give parties the option to submit information to state agencies or public websites. Several states do not mandate public disclosure of fracturing chemicals, allowing parties to submit details to state agencies for potential posting on public websites. The entities responsible for disclosing chemical information vary by state, with some laws requiring operators or owners of wells to divulge this information. States like Idaho, Montana, North Dakota, Wyoming, and Arkansas have specific requirements for chemical disclosure before or after fracturing a well. State laws require disclosure of chemical information before and after well fracturing, with varying levels of detail. Some states protect trade secrets, allowing parties to withhold information. Decision makers like state attorney generals may shield information from public disclosure. Different states have different disclosure requirements, but trade secret protections are not considered in this section. Some states require detailed disclosure of fracturing fluid composition, while others only require a list of additives. Trade secret protections vary by state. Some states mandate disclosure of hazardous ingredients in fracturing fluid, with variations in pre and post-treatment requirements. MSDS are required for chemical additives, offering limited disclosure as they focus on OSHA-regulated hazardous chemicals. CASRNs or chemical names must be included, unless protected as trade secrets. Under regulations, CASRNs or ingredient concentrations in additives do not need to be listed for trade secret protection. Some parties may voluntarily provide more information. Certain states exempt specific information from disclosure, such as chemicals not intentionally added to fracturing fluid or occurring incidentally in trace amounts. Pennsylvania and Texas laws have similar provisions. The disclosure laws in various states, including Pennsylvania and Texas, provide protections for trade secrets. These laws may require detailed chemical information disclosure but also offer high levels of protection for trade secrets. The definition of a trade secret may vary, but generally, it is valuable information that is kept confidential and protected from disclosure. Whether a law requires the public disclosure of trade secrets can impact property rights. The disclosure laws in various states, such as Pennsylvania and Texas, provide protections for trade secrets by requiring detailed chemical information disclosure while offering high levels of protection. Some states, like Michigan and West Virginia, lack trade secret protections due to insufficient information detail. Trade secret protections may be provided in other state laws, such as exemptions in open records laws to prevent disclosure of confidential information. New Mexico allows parties to withhold details of fracturing additives deemed trade secrets. Some states require alternative information disclosure, like chemical family names, when trade secrets are withheld. Regulators in Montana, Colorado, and Louisiana lack authority to compel detailed disclosure when information is withheld. Some states have exceptions to disclosure laws for chemical additives in special circumstances like spills or emergencies. State attorney generals or agencies can approve or deny exemptions for trade secrets, with varying procedures for withholding information and submitting claims for exemption. In Wyoming, the state oil and gas commission decides if information is exempt from public disclosure under the Wyoming Public Records Act. Several disclosure laws have exceptions for trade secret protections when needed for medical care, requiring a confidentiality agreement. For example, Colorado mandates disclosing chemical identities to health professionals upon request. Colorado's rule mandates disclosing chemical identities to health professionals upon request, with a written statement of need and confidentiality agreement required. In immediate medical emergencies, trade secret information must be provided upon verbal acknowledgment by the health professional. In Colorado, a written confidentiality agreement may be requested for disclosing chemical identities to health professionals in non-emergencies. Other states like Arkansas, Idaho, Louisiana, Montana, Pennsylvania, and Texas also have similar confidentiality requirements. Some states have exceptions for disclosures to state agency employees in emergencies, with provisions for confidentiality. In states like Wyoming, Arkansas, Idaho, and Montana, disclosures before and after fracturing treatments differ in detail. Prior disclosures include proposed chemical additives, while post-treatment disclosures reveal actual chemicals used. Pre-fracturing disclosures allow baseline water testing near drilling sites for comparison with post-treatment results. Pre-fracturing disclosure allows for baseline water testing near drilling sites to compare with post-treatment results for potential groundwater contamination. Arguments exist for and against this practice, with proponents citing benefits for landowners and emergency responders, while industry members question its value due to the continual adjustment of fracturing fluid composition. Some states require disclosure of chemicals used in well fracturing after completion, with varying timeframes such as within 20 days in Louisiana, 45 days in New Mexico, and 60 days in Ohio. Other states like Colorado, North Dakota, Oklahoma, and Pennsylvania also mandate disclosure within 60 days after a fracturing treatment. Concerns include the accuracy of pre-fracturing disclosures and potential delays in production. Some states like Dakota, Oklahoma, and Pennsylvania require disclosure within 60 days after a fracturing treatment ends. Federal and state legislators are considering new disclosure requirements for hydraulic fracturing, a technique used in natural gas recovery from shale formations. The Shale Gas Production Subcommittee recommends public disclosure of all chemical ingredients in fracturing fluids, including those not meeting OSHA standards. Existing federal laws require some disclosure of chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing, but detailed information disclosure is not mandatory. The BLM has proposed disclosure requirements for hydraulic fracturing on all lands managed by the agency, while legislation in the 112th Congress aimed to create national disclosure requirements. State chemical disclosure laws vary, with fewer than half mandating direct public disclosure on the FracFocus website. Trade secret protections may allow parties to withhold information or submit limited details about proprietary chemicals. Some state laws allow for limited disclosure of proprietary chemicals in emergencies, with MSDS providing basic information on hazardous ingredients. Timing of disclosure varies, with some states requiring information before fracturing, but with less detail than afterward."
