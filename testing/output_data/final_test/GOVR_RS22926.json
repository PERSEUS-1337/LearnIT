    "content": "Since 9/11, Congress has allocated over a trillion dollars for military operations in Afghanistan, Iraq, and globally. A $33 billion supplemental funding request for FY2010 and a $159 billion request for FY2011 are being considered. Comparisons of current war costs to past conflicts are being made, with estimates provided in both current and constant dollars. Wars costs over a 230-year period are difficult to compare due to challenges in separating military operation costs from peacetime costs and adjusting for inflation. The Department of Defense now identifies incremental expenses of military operations, but this approach was not used before the Vietnam conflict. Technological advancements have made wars appear more expensive over time. The War of 1812 cost about $1.6 billion in today's prices, equivalent to over $300 billion today, consuming more than 2% of the nation's economic output. The data in the attached table should be viewed as snapshots of vastly different periods of U.S. history, not truly comparable figures on a continuum. The figures for the Vietnam War and the 1990-1991 Persian Gulf War are DOD estimates of the \"incremental\" costs of military operations. Estimates of post-9/11 war-related expenses in Afghanistan, Iraq, and other areas through FY2009 are based on Congressional appropriations and DOD reports. These costs reflect a broader definition compared to earlier conflicts like Vietnam and the Persian Gulf. Prior to the Vietnam War, there were no attempts to calculate incremental war-related expenses. During earlier wars, the costs were estimated by comparing war-time expenditures with average outlays for the years before and after the war. For the Korean conflict, costs were compared with a trend line from pre-war to post-war expenditures. This method was used for conflicts from the War of 1812 to the Korean War. The estimated costs of wars from the War of 1812 to the Korean War are based on official reports of Army, Navy, and Air Force budgets. Official budget figures are not available for the Revolution or Confederate states during the Civil War. Estimates for the American Revolution and Confederate Civil War costs are from historical publications. Data on Army and Navy outlays before 1940 are from historical statistics, and GDP estimates are from economic history sources. The cost estimates for wars from the War of 1812 to the Korean War were converted into constant FY2011 dollars using inflation indices. Different indices were used depending on the time period, including an index based on the Consumer Price Index (CPI) maintained by the U.S. Department of Labor. Inflation adjustments for cost estimates of wars over 200 years are challenging due to changes in relative costs of goods and advancements in weaponry. Comparing costs of the American Revolution to modern military operations is complex, as technology and prices have significantly evolved. The complexity and cost of modern technology make today's conflicts more expensive than yesterday's wars. Inflation indices used for adjusting figures since 1940 differ from earlier years, capturing the differences in cost trends between defense and civilian economy."
