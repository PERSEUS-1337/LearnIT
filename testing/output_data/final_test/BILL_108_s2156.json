    "content": "The Act titled \"Community College Teacher Preparation Enhancement Act of 2004\" is cited as the short title. The findings section follows. Congress acknowledges the importance of well-qualified teachers and paraprofessionals for student success. Access to high-quality teacher training is crucial to meet the demands of the No Child Left Behind Act. Community colleges, with over 1,200 in the US, play a significant role in training teachers and enrolling a large percentage of undergraduates, with 25% of teaching degree recipients starting at a community college. The Nation faces a shortage of 2.4 million teachers in the next decade, especially in subjects like math, science, special education, and bilingual education. Community colleges provide accessibility to education opportunities but lack resources to transition students into teaching careers at 4-year institutions. To address the teacher shortage, collaboration between community colleges and 4-year institutions of higher education for teacher training is crucial. This partnership aims to enhance the community college role in preparing highly qualified teachers to meet the nation's needs. The Act aims to foster collaboration between 4-year institutions and community colleges to enhance teacher preparation, provide opportunities for community college students in teacher training programs to earn a baccalaureate degree, develop best practices for coordinating teacher training, and expand community college teaching infrastructure to offer professional development for existing teachers. Title II of the Higher Education Act of 1965 is amended to include a new section on teacher training enhancement, focusing on defining key terms related to teacher training programs. The new section of Title II of the Higher Education Act of 1965 focuses on defining key terms related to teacher training programs, including terms like '4-year institution of higher education', 'community college', and 'eligible entity'. The new section of Title II of the Higher Education Act of 1965 defines key terms related to teacher training programs, including eligible entities such as governing boards, partnerships between community colleges and 4-year institutions, and community colleges offering teacher preparation programs. The new section of Title II of the Higher Education Act of 1965 defines key terms related to teacher training programs, including eligible entities such as governing boards, partnerships between community colleges and 4-year institutions, and community colleges offering teacher preparation programs. Clauses (i) and (ii) of subparagraph (A) may include other institutions with responsibility for teacher preparation or teacher standards. The terms 'highly qualified' and 'professional development' are defined in section 9101 of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. The Secretary can award grants to eligible entities for teacher training programs. Eligible entities must submit an application to receive a grant. The Secretary prioritizes grants for teacher preparation in areas with shortages, K-12 subject content areas lacking qualified teachers, innovative teacher training programs, outreach to secondary schools, and information dissemination. Grants are awarded in a geographically diverse manner. Grants awarded under this part shall be for 5 years in duration. \"SEC. 235. USES OF FUNDS.\" An eligible entity receiving a grant must use the funds for collaboration in teacher training between community colleges and 4-year institutions, developing programs for community college students to complete a baccalaureate degree in education, establishing partnerships in teacher training, creating programs at community colleges for students to enter teacher preparation programs, and developing pathways for secondary education. The grant funds can be used for creating teacher education programs, coordinating curricula for teacher training, and establishing professional development programs for teachers. The eligible entity receiving a grant must submit an annual report on progress, activities, students served, placement of graduates, and teacher qualifications. The Secretary will review and evaluate these reports. Additionally, there is a matching requirement for the grant. The Federal share of costs for a teacher training program decreases over five years, starting at 65% and decreasing to 45%. The non-Federal share can be in cash or in-kind contributions. The Secretary is required to submit a report on the program. The Secretary is mandated to submit an annual report to Congress on the impact of the teacher training program in producing qualified teachers, addressing shortages, and enhancing diversity. $25,000,000 is authorized for fiscal year 2005, with additional funding for the following years."
