    "content": "Recently, attention has been focused on U.S. rules governing imports from North Korea due to the debate over the South Korea-U.S. Free Trade Agreement (KORUS FTA). Some argue that the agreement could increase U.S. imports of goods from North Korea, but historically, the U.S. imports very few finished goods from North Korea due to trade restrictions and the country's economic isolation. U.S. bilateral imports of finished North Korean goods are minimal, totaling only $335,700, with stamps and women's clothing making up the majority. Since 2005, only $8,363 worth of stamps have been imported. Imports of finished North Korean goods have been zero in four of the past five years. Critics are concerned that the KORUS FTA could lead to an increase in imports from North Korea, particularly from the Kaesong Industrial Complex. The report examines U.S. rules on imports from North Korea, the KIC and China as economic portals, and the potential impact of the KORUS FTA on U.S. imports of North Korean content. The United States loosened restrictions on imports from North Korea in 1999, with President Clinton easing regulations except for national security concerns. President Bush further relaxed restrictions in 2008 by terminating the Trading With the Enemy Act authorities and removing North Korea from the list of state sponsors of terrorism. The United States lifted import restrictions on North Korea in 1999 under President Clinton, with President Bush further easing restrictions in 2008. Despite these changes, North Korea remained subject to import restrictions due to missile proliferation activities. President Obama invoked emergency powers in 2010 to block assets related to luxury item imports into North Korea. The President expanded import restrictions on North Korea in 2011 to block assets of individuals engaged in illicit activities. Direct and indirect imports from North Korea are prohibited unless authorized. North Korea's provocative actions from 2008 to 2010 led to these measures. In 2010, a group found North Korea responsible for sinking a South Korean naval vessel and launching artillery at a South Korean island. Importing goods from North Korea into the United States requires approval from OFAC, and the President's executive order in 2011 expanded import restrictions on North Korea to block assets of individuals engaged in illicit activities. The importation of goods, services, or technology from North Korea into the United States is prohibited by Executive Orders 13466, 13551, and 13570. OFAC can issue licenses for transactions, including imports from North Korea, with regulations implemented by the Secretary of the Treasury in consultation with the State Department. The President retains the authority to revise these regulations. The President has the authority to revise or revoke executive orders related to the importation of goods from North Korea if national emergency conditions no longer exist. Importers must have OFAC approval to bring North Korean goods into the US through a third country. Importation of goods, services, or technology from North Korea is prohibited, including finished goods made with North Korean components. The importation of goods from North Korea into the United States is prohibited without a license from OFAC, including components used in finished products from third countries. OFAC plans to issue more comprehensive regulations to address related issues. The isolated nature of North Korea's economy, with limited commercial and financial relations with other nations, is reflected in its export markets primarily consisting of South Korea and China. Despite a slight increase in exports to South Korea since 2006, totaling $1 billion in 2010, North Korea remains heavily reliant on these two countries for the majority of its export shipments. In 2010, North Korea's exports to South Korea increased due to activities at the Kaesong Industrial Complex. Following the Cheonan's sinking, South Korea halted non-KIC trade with North Korea. By February 2011, almost all exports to South Korea were from KIC. Over 120 South Korean manufacturing companies operated in Kaesong, producing $323 million in output. Most manufactured clothing and textiles, with some producing kitchen utensils, auto parts, semiconductor parts, and toner cartridges. The Kaesong Industrial Complex in North Korea attracts low-level technology products like textiles, apparel, machinery, electronics, and furniture. Around 10% of the production is exported to countries like Australia, the EU, Russia, and China. The complex's future depends on inter-Korean relations and South Korean leaders' policies. President Lee Myung-bak's government has been hesitant about expanding the complex but has allowed incremental growth. The Kaesong Industrial Complex in North Korea, under President Lee Myung-bak's government, has seen incremental growth despite political tensions. Lee's reluctance to shut down the complex is due to financial costs and political support within South Korea. The future of the complex remains uncertain as Lee's term ends in 2013, leaving the decision to a future South Korean leader. The complex poses a dilemma for U.S. and South Korean policymakers as it provides revenue to the North Korean regime. The Kaesong Industrial Complex in North Korea generates around $20 million per year for the North Korean government. It also serves as a potential gateway for market reforms in North Korea, exposing thousands to outside influences. China plays a significant role in North Korea's economic relations, with over half of its imports coming from China by the end of the decade. North Korean exports to China have significantly increased, with commercial shipments totaling $1.2 billion in 2010, accounting for over 40% of its total annual exports. Major export items include mineral fuels, ores, apparel, iron, steel, fish, seafood, and zinc. North Korea has also expanded exports of primary and mineral products, importing aquaculture technology and agricultural equipment from China to boost production. Collaboration with Chinese firms has facilitated coal and mineral exports. The Chinese side provides modern equipment in exchange for North Korean products. North Korean content in the global marketplace likely comes from energy inputs or mineral deposits. China aims to create an integrated industrial region with North Korea, including building roads and a free trade zone. They are exploring building an industrial park similar to the Kaesong Industrial Complex. Chinese companies are looking to engage in manufacturing Chinese brand-name products in North Korea, potentially exporting them to the U.S. market. Of the 86 Chinese trading companies in North Korea, 35 are in mining, 11 in agriculture/timber, 17 in industrial parts, 7 in apparel, and others in various sectors. North Korean exports like apparel, automotive parts, and industrial materials could enter a Chinese supply chain and end up in products sold in the United States. During the KORUS FTA negotiations, concerns were raised about the potential for North Korean goods to enter the U.S. market through preferential treatment, constraints on import restrictions, and insufficient rules of origin. During the KORUS FTA negotiations, concerns were raised about North Korean goods entering the U.S. market through preferential treatment. The final agreement included a special committee, Annex 22-B, to address the issue of incorporating the Kaesong Industrial Complex into the FTA. This would require approval from the U.S. executive branch and Congress. The committee would review conditions on the Korean Peninsula for further economic development through outward processing zones. The United States and South Korea would establish a Committee on Outward Processing Zones on the Korean Peninsula to determine areas for manufacturing or processing goods to be deemed \"originating\" under the agreement. The committee will set criteria, including labor and environmental standards, for goods to be considered originating for FTA purposes. Meetings will occur annually or as mutually agreed upon. The Committee on Outward Processing Zones on the Korean Peninsula will determine if goods from any outward processing zone can be considered originating for FTA purposes. They will establish criteria and a maximum threshold for the value of input for the final goods. Decisions made by the committee will be recommended to the United States and South Korea for legislative approval. The USTR stated that any extension of KORUS tariff benefits to products made in Kaesong or OPZ would require Congressional approval. The United States must first deem goods from the Outward Processing Zones (OPZ) admissible before determining applicable tariff treatment. Congress has the authority to impose duties and must authorize specific tariff rates or grant the President the authority to proclaim them. Goods from countries subject to Title IV of the Trade Act, like North Korea, can only receive Normal Trade Relations (NTR) treatment under specific requirements of that title. The President must abide by Title IV requirements unless Congress removes a country from the regime. The President must follow Title IV requirements to grant NTR tariff status to a Title IV country. Preferential tariff rates to imports must be expressly authorized by Congress. Presidential proclamation authority in KORUS FTA legislation likely applies only to goods from South Korea. Critics have raised concerns about Annex 22-B in the agreement. U.S. critics of the KORUS FTA want Annex 22-B removed and products from Kaesong Industrial Complex excluded. South Korea made modifications before but supporters argue against further changes. Concerns have been raised about the agreement's impact on U.S. ability to restrict imports with North Korean components. The KORUS FTA includes provisions that prevent the US from restricting imports of South Korean goods, even those with North Korean components. This obligation is in line with WTO agreements and covers measures like quotas or import licenses. The KORUS FTA prohibits the US from restricting imports of South Korean goods, even if they contain components from North Korea. This obligation aligns with WTO agreements and includes measures like quotas or import licenses. Additionally, Article 2.8.4(a) allows for exceptions to this rule, permitting a country to impose or maintain import embargoes on goods from non-signatory countries without violating the agreement. The KORUS FTA allows the US to restrict imports from non-signatory countries without violating the agreement, including goods with components from North Korea. This provision also applies to US import embargoes with countries like Cuba and Iran. The US can restrict imports from non-signatory countries under the KORUS FTA, including goods with components from North Korea, Cuba, and Iran. The CFTA did not override Cuban sanctions, allowing restrictions on third-country products. The KORUS FTA allows the US to restrict imports from non-signatory countries like North Korea, Cuba, and Iran. The agreement separates admissibility from tariff treatment, meaning that goods with North Korean content may qualify as \"originating goods\" without being admitted into the US or South Korea. The KORUS FTA allows the US to restrict imports from non-signatory countries like North Korea, Cuba, and Iran, citing national security concerns. The security exception clause in the agreement permits measures for maintaining international peace or security and protecting essential security interests. The US has considered such clauses as self-judging and not subject to third-party scrutiny. The KORUS FTA allows the US to restrict imports from non-signatory countries like North Korea, Cuba, and Iran, citing national security concerns. The security exception clause in the agreement permits measures for maintaining international peace or security and protecting essential security interests, which are self-judging and not subject to third-party scrutiny. In disputes, if the essential security exception is invoked, the tribunal or panel must find that the exception applies. Under the KORUS FTA, the US can restrict imports from countries like North Korea, Cuba, and Iran for national security reasons. The agreement's security exception clause allows measures to protect essential security interests, which are self-judging and not subject to third-party scrutiny. In disputes, if the security exception is invoked, the tribunal must find that it applies. Critics argue that South Korean manufacturers could use North Korean components in exports to the US under the agreement's rules of origin. Rules of Origin (ROO) are crucial for determining the country of origin of imported products for various governmental purposes, including enforcing trade restrictions, assessing tariffs, and collecting statistics. In today's global trading environment, determining origin can be complex, especially for products with components from multiple countries. The automotive sector, with its extensive global supply chain, exemplifies this complexity. The KORUS FTA's ROO are relevant for imports from North Korea, particularly in cases where an importer uses North Korean components. The KORUS FTA's rules of origin are crucial for determining the origin of imported products, especially for goods with components from multiple countries. The ROO are relevant for imports from North Korea, where North Korean content is considered non-originating and does not qualify for FTA benefits. Preferential ROO are used to determine product eligibility for preferential treatment under the FTA, aiming to exclude non-signatory countries and limit impact on import-sensitive industries. The KORUS FTA's preferential rules of origin require a percentage of inputs to be sourced from the United States or South Korea, incentivizing manufacturers to use components from these countries. The strength of these incentives depends on the external tariffs, with lower tariffs resulting in smaller costs for not meeting the rules of origin. Under the KORUS FTA, meeting the rules of origin is crucial for manufacturers to benefit from lower tariffs. For example, cars imported from South Korea can avoid the 2.5% U.S. NTR duty if the ROO requirements are satisfied. This gives South Korean manufacturers a price advantage over those from China, Japan, or Europe, who would face higher tariff rates. Other industrial sectors may also see similar benefits under the FTA. Chapter 7 of the KORUS FTA enhances customs administration and trade facilitation. The KORUS FTA Chapter 7 enhances customs administration and trade facilitation by mandating information sharing, intelligence cooperation, joint training programs, and enforcement of regulations between U.S. and South Korean customs officials. This promotes rules-based trade, deepens economic relationship, and fosters ongoing dialogue for efficient enforcement of the mutual trading relationship. The proposed KORUS FTA may limit North Korean-manufactured inputs entering the US. Congress could direct CBP to require additional certification from South Korean exporters. The FTA's preferential terms would not apply to finished goods made in the KIC, providing opportunities for the US to block such imports. The KORUS FTA agreement includes provisions to block North Korean-manufactured inputs from entering the US. US sanctions on North Korean imports must remain in place and be enforced for the FTA's rules of origin to apply. The issue of handling imports from North Korea focuses on customs controls, cooperation, and enforcement. The possibility of circumventing U.S. import restrictions against North Korea could become a bigger problem if North Korean industry revives and integrates into the global economy through increased economic ties with China or expansion of the Kaesong Industrial Complex. There is no way to guarantee that goods or components from North Korea are not entering the U.S. without proper authorization, such as in the automobile supply chain. The automobile supply chain poses a challenge as Chinese or South Korean producers could source components from North Korea and evade U.S. customs by not reporting to OFAC or CBP. U.S. enforcement depends on customs cooperation with South Korea and penalties for non-compliance."
