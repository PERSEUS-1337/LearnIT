    "content": "The table shows federal child welfare funding available for services from FY2001-FY2004 by state. Program funding amounts are the actual awards reported by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Some states were not eligible for grants due to not meeting required assurances. The table displays federal child welfare funding available for services from FY2001-FY2004 by state. Funds are distributed among eligible states by formula, with unclaimed funds being re-allotted. New York did not receive Promoting Safe and Stable Families funds in FY2001-FY2003, resulting in $20.9 million being returned to the federal treasury. Tribes eligible for Child Welfare Services funding receive an amount based on their population drawn from the state's initial allotment. The program authorizations allocate funds for tribes before distributing the remaining funds to states. Tribes are not eligible for CAPTA's state grants. Territories like American Samoa and Puerto Rico also receive funding. Other funds are set aside for technical assistance and Court Improvement grants. The federal funding for Child Welfare Services and CAPTA state grants is detailed in Table C-2, showing dedicated funding for the Foster Care Program from FY2001-FY2003 by state. Tribes are not authorized to receive direct Foster Care funding from the federal government under Title IV-E of the Social Security Act. Title IV-E funds are available for tribes through agreements with states. Territories like American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands can operate Title IV-E Foster Care programs. Puerto Rico is the only territory currently running such a program. Child support monies collected for children in foster care are reimbursed to the federal government. Demonstration projects must be cost neutral to the federal government. Demonstration projects must be cost neutral to the federal government, with claims previously made under foster care maintenance or foster care administration categories. SACWIS claims are included in total administration costs. Puerto Rico started making Title IV-E Foster Care claims in FY1999 but lacks a cost allocation plan for program administrative and training claims. The federal government provides dedicated funding for the Adoption Assistance Program, with states receiving federal funds for claims made under Title IV-E. Tribes must seek funds through agreements with states, as tribes are not directly authorized to receive Adoption Assistance funding. Territories like American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands are permitted to receive Title IV-E funds. Title IV-E permits territories like American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands to operate Adoption Assistance programs. Puerto Rico is the only territory currently running such a program. Demonstration projects must be cost neutral to the federal government, with Puerto Rico starting claims for Title IV-E Adoption Assistance in FY1999. Rico began claiming Title IV-E Adoption Assistance in FY1999 but had not developed the necessary cost allocation plan by FY2003 to receive administrative and training claims. Federal child welfare funding for independent living in FY2001-FY2003 by state is detailed in Table C-4. Title IV-E does not authorize tribes to receive federal funding, but territories like American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands can receive Title IV-E funds directly. Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands currently receive Title IV-E funds, but the Northern Mariana Islands do not have this authority. Education and Training Vouchers were established in FY2002 and received funding starting in FY2003. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services must reserve 1.5% of funds for evaluation and technical assistance. The curr_chunk discusses the distribution of Title IV-E Foster Care funds for FY1999-FY2003, including actual funding levels and hypothetical distributions. The purpose is to illustrate the factors used to distribute funds and the significance of the selected years. The data shows the federal funding level for FY2003 and how it is distributed based on a state's relative share of certain child populations. The distribution of Title IV-E Foster Care funds is based on certain child populations, including children in the nation from the 1990 and 2000 census, children in foster care in FY2001 and FY2003, and the average number of foster care children for FY2001-FY2003. The actual distribution for FY2003 and hypothetical distributions are shown in Table D-3, illustrating the factors used to determine funding allocation. The distribution of federal Title IV-E Foster Care funds is based on the state's share of all federal foster care claims in various fiscal years. The data is sourced from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and includes federal expenditures under the program. The variation in claims made by states from year to year highlights the importance of the selected time period for fund distribution. The federal expenditures under the Title IV-E foster care program include the federal share of child support collections, ranging from $25 million to $32 million. Tables show the actual and hypothetical distribution of funds based on a state's share of certain child populations. Source: Congressional Research Service."
