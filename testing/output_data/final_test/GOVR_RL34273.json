Four federal agencies administer about 95% of these lands, with varying authorities to acquire and dispose of land. Congress has provided acquisition and disposal authorities through laws enacted over more than a century. The federal government owns 640 million acres of land in the US, mainly in 12 western states. Four agencies, including BLM, NPS, FS, and FWS, have varying authorities to acquire and dispose of land. BLM has broad authority, while NPS has no general authority for acquisitions or disposals. FS can acquire lands within or contiguous to national forests, with limited disposal authority. FWS can acquire lands but lacks general disposal authority. Acquisition and disposal authorities differ among agencies. The federal government agencies have varying authorities for acquiring and disposing of land. Acquisition authorities allow agencies to acquire lands for federal management purposes, such as improving management of federal lands, conserving species, and protecting natural resources. Disposal authorities enable agencies to dispose of land that is no longer needed for federal purposes or is more valuable for another purpose. The federal government agencies have varying authorities for acquiring and disposing of land. Disposal may be authorized for purposes like agriculture, community development, mineral extraction, or education. Exchanges of federal land are governed by specific laws, with broader authority under the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976. Congress often evaluates the adequacy of acquisition and disposal authorities, federal land ownership, and funding sources for land acquisition. The 115th Congress is considering measures to establish, modify, or eliminate land acquisition authorities, including proposals to authorize states to exchange land grant parcels for federal lands and to allow the BLM and FS to convey small tracts to adjacent landowners. Other measures include reauthorizing and amending BLM authority to sell or exchange land under the Federal Land Transaction Facilitation Act and amending the Small Tracts Act regarding FS lands. The 115th Congress is considering measures to establish, modify, or eliminate land acquisition authorities, including proposals to authorize states to exchange land grant parcels for federal lands and to allow the BLM and FS to convey small tracts to adjacent landowners. Congress may consider legislation to provide an agency with acquisition or disposal authority in specific instances. Congress is considering legislation to expedite land acquisition processes, potentially allowing for the conveyance of land at reduced or no cost. The debate over federal land ownership remains contentious, with some advocating for divestment while others support retaining lands for public benefit and protection. Recent Congresses have considered bills related to federal land ownership, including measures authorizing the sale of a certain percentage of land and requiring an equal number of acres to be offered for sale when land is acquired. The Land and Water Conservation Fund is a key financing mechanism for land acquisition, with provisions for $900 million in annual revenues that expired in 2018. The Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) provisions for $900 million annually expired in 2018. Congress determines appropriations for federal land acquisition from the LWCF, with varying amounts allocated to federal land management agencies since 1965. Proposed measures in the 115th Congress include permanent reauthorization and mandatory appropriations at authorized levels. Advocates seek stable funding for federal resource management. Other proposals aim to allocate funds for specific purposes like restricted access areas or non-acquisition purposes. The federal land management agencies have different funding sources for land acquisition, including mandatory spending authorities and specific funds like the Migratory Bird Conservation Fund. Congressional debate surrounds the application of these authorities and the uses of proceeds from land sales. Various laws govern specific land acquisitions, and each agency has standing authorities for acquiring lands. The four federal land management agencies have different authorities for acquiring lands. They can accept land as gifts, use eminent domain in rare cases, and have specific acquisition authorities. The National Park Service (NPS) has limited authority to acquire lands, with most units created by Congress with specific NPS authority. The NPS has specific authority from Congress to acquire nonfederal inholdings within park boundaries. The Secretary of the Interior can adjust park boundaries for preservation purposes and acquire nonfederal lands within the adjusted boundary. The President can create national monuments on federal lands under the Antiquities Act. The NPS has the authority to acquire nonfederal inholdings within park boundaries, with the Secretary of the Interior able to adjust boundaries for preservation purposes. The Secretary is responsible for investigating potential additions to the National Park System and submitting reports to Congress. Additionally, a systematic review of the system is required every three years, including a list of authorized but unacquired lands within park boundaries. The Secretary of Agriculture has authorities to acquire lands for the National Forest System (NFS), which consists of 284 units covering 232.4 million acres of federal and nonfederal land. NFS units contain substantial acreage of nonfederal lands within their boundaries, particularly in the east. The FS has limited regulatory authority over lands within NFS units. The FS has limited regulatory authority over the 39.5 million acres of nonfederal land within the NFS. The primary land acquisition authority is the Weeks Act of 1911, which allows for acquisitions within or adjacent to established NFS unit boundaries. Other laws also authorize the FS to acquire lands for national forests, such as access corridors across nonfederal lands. The FS has various acquisition authorities for national forests, including easements for access corridors across nonfederal lands. These authorities are specified in different laws, such as the Act of August 3, 1956, which allows land acquisitions without geographical limitations. Proceeds from land sales can also be used for acquisitions, limited to specific states where NFS land was previously conveyed. Specific acquisition authorities apply to certain national forests, like the Act of June 11, 1940 for the Angeles National Forest in California. The FS has acquisition authorities for national forests, including easements for access corridors across nonfederal lands. The Secretary of Agriculture can acquire privately owned lands within or adjacent to designated wilderness areas, Wild and Scenic River corridors, and certain segments of designated National Trails. Lands can be added to the National Wildlife Refuge System through congressional and administrative actions, donations, and the Migratory Bird Conservation Act of 1929. The Migratory Bird Conservation Act allows the Secretary of the Interior to recommend areas for bird conservation to the Migratory Bird Conservation Commission. The Secretary can purchase or rent approved areas using funds from the Migratory Bird Conservation Fund, which is supported by various sources of funding. The Migratory Bird Conservation Act allows the Secretary of the Interior to recommend areas for bird conservation to the Migratory Bird Conservation Commission. The Migratory Bird Conservation Fund, supported by import duties on arms and ammunition and refuge entrance fees, is permanently appropriated for acquiring suitable areas for migratory bird refuges. Other laws also provide authority for expanding the National Wildlife Refuge System. The Migratory Bird Conservation Act allows the Secretary of the Interior to recommend areas for bird conservation to the Migratory Bird Conservation Commission. The Migratory Bird Conservation Fund, supported by import duties on arms and ammunition and refuge entrance fees, is permanently appropriated for acquiring suitable areas for migratory bird refuges. FLPMA authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to acquire land or interests through donated funds or exchange. The FWS can acquire new lands to create or expand refuges under various authorities, including specific acts of Congress or executive orders. The BLM has authority to acquire lands under FLPMA, allowing the Secretary of the Interior to acquire lands by purchase, exchange, donation, or eminent domain. Lands are acquired to protect natural and cultural resources, increase public access, and improve land management. Different federal land management agencies have varying authorities for disposing of lands, with NPS having the narrowest authorities. The NPS has limited authority to dispose of National Park System lands, which can only be done by acts of Congress. The Secretary of the Interior can make boundary changes within park boundaries, but minor revisions to remove NPS acreage require Congressional approval. Additionally, the Secretary cannot dispose of NPS land to acquire adjacent lands. Presidents have modified national monument boundaries but have not terminated any. The FWS cannot dispose of its lands without Congressional approval. Disposal of refuge lands is allowed only through authorized land exchanges or if the lands are no longer needed and approved by the Migratory Bird Conservation Commission. The Commission approves disposal of lands, ensuring recovery of acquisition cost or fair market value. The Secretary of Agriculture has authorities to convey lands out of federal ownership through sale or exchange, with constraints based on geographical area or property type. Requirements include obtaining fair market value for federal land sales and exchanging nonfederal land within the same state. The General Exchange Act of 1922 authorizes the exchange of NFS land or timber reserved from the public domain if it's in the public interest. The nonfederal land must be within the same state and chiefly valuable for national forest purposes. The Weeks Act of 1911 allows for similar exchanges for acquired NFS lands. The 1983 Small Tracts Act authorizes the Secretary to dispose of NFS land by sale or exchange, improving management efficiencies. The Small Tracts Act of 1983 allows for the disposal of NFS land for various reasons, such as relieving encroachments or disposing of unneeded federal rights-of-way. The conveyance must be in the public interest and the tracts may not be valued at more than $500,000. The land can be disposed of for cash, lands, interests in land, or any combination. The Small Tracts Act of 1983 allows for the disposal of NFS land for various reasons, such as relieving encroachments or disposing of unneeded federal rights-of-way. The conveyance must be in the public interest and the tracts may not be valued at more than $500,000. Proceeds can be used for specified land acquisition purposes. The 1958 Townsites Act authorizes the Secretary to transfer up to 640 acres of NFS land adjacent to communities in Alaska or the 11 western states for townsites, if the \"indigenous community objectives ... outweigh the public objectives and values which would be served by maintaining such tract in Federal ownership\". Public notice of the application for such transfer is required, and upon a \"satisfactory showing of need,\" the Secretary may offer the land to a local governmental entity at \"not less than the fair market value.\" The Education Land Grant Act, also known as the Sisk Act, allows for the transfer of up to 80 acres of NFS land to public school districts at a nominal cost. If the land is not used for educational purposes, the title reverts to the federal government. Other authorities like the 1911 Weeks Act and the Bankhead-Jones Farm Tenant Act also permit the disposal of NFS lands for specific purposes. The BLM has various authorities for disposing of land, including exchanges and sales under FLPMA, transfers to other entities for public purposes, patents under the General Mining Law of 1872, and geographically limited sale authorities. Exchanges under FLPMA must serve the public interest and involve lands of equal value in the same state. Sales under FLPMA are authorized for certain tracts identified through land-use planning. The BLM has the authority to sell certain tracts of public land identified through land-use planning if they meet specific criteria, such as being difficult to manage, no longer needed for federal purposes, or serving important public objectives like community expansion and economic development. The size of the tracts for sale is determined by land use capabilities and development. The size of tracts for sale is determined by land use capabilities and development requirements. Tracts over 2,500 acres require approval from Congress and must be sold at fair market value through competitive bidding. Proceeds from sales go into a Treasury account for use by the Secretaries of the Interior and Agriculture. Funds can be used to acquire nonfederal lands, inholdings, lands with exceptional resources, and areas open to recreation. Up to 20% of the funds can be used for certain purposes. The Recreation and Public Purposes Act allows for the disposal of public lands for various purposes, including recreation and public use. The price of the land depends on the type of entity acquiring it, such as a state government or nonprofit organization. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) can dispose of lands through patents under the General Mining Law of 1872, but annual moratoria have prevented this means of federal land disposal since FY1995. The Mining Law allows access to and development of hardrock minerals on federal lands, with mining claims being patented upon payment of the appropriate fee. Patented lands may be used for associated milling or processing operations. The BLM can patent lands for purposes other than mineral development, with the largest revenue stream coming from the Southern Nevada Public Land Management Act of 1998. 85% of proceeds go towards land acquisition and development in Nevada, while 15% is allocated for state or local purposes. The BLM continues to dispose of land in Alaska as required by law, transferring about 150 million acres from federal to state and private ownership."
