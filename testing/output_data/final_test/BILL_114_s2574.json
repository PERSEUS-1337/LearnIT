    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Modernizing the Interstate Placement of Children in Foster Care Act.\" The Congress recognizes the need for efficient placement of children in foster care across state lines through the Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children (ICPC), aiming to prioritize the best interests of the child without unnecessary delays. The National Electronic Interstate Compact Enterprise (NEICE) was launched to streamline the process of placing children in foster care across State lines, reducing administrative costs and staff time. Since its inception, placement time has decreased significantly. Since NEICE was launched, placement time has decreased by 30 percent for interstate foster care placements. States using this system have reduced the time to identify a family for a child and start the ICPC process from 24 days to 13 days on average. The State Plan Requirement is outlined in Section 3. The Social Security Act is amended to include a centralized electronic interstate case processing system by October 1, 2022. The amendments will take effect on the 1st day of the 1st calendar quarter after the enactment of the Act, applying to payments under part E of title IV for calendar quarters after that date. Legislation is required for a State plan under part E of title IV of the Social Security Act to meet additional requirements. The plan will not be considered failing to meet the requirements until after the first regular session of the State legislature following the enactment of the Act. If the State has a 2-year legislative session, each year is considered a separate regular session. SEC. 4. Grants for developing a centralized electronic system to expedite interstate placement of children in foster care, guardianship, or adoption. Grants for the development of a centralized electronic system to expedite interstate placement of children in foster care, guardianship, or adoption are available under Section 437 of the Social Security Act. The purpose is to facilitate the exchange of data and documents to speed up placements across state lines. States seeking a grant must submit an application outlining goals and outcomes to be achieved. The grant application must outline goals such as reducing time for interstate placements, improving administrative processes, and facilitating timely communication and placement decisions for children in foster care. Activities to be funded with the grant must be described, including their sequencing. The Secretary may grant funds to a State for developing a centralized electronic system for interstate placements of children in foster care. The State must comply with outlined strategies and use the grant as specified. Evaluations of the grant program must be submitted to Congress and made public within a year of the final grant awards. The centralized electronic system for interstate placements of children in foster care has led to changes in placement times, the processing of cases under the Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children, progress in system implementation, and impacts on child safety and well-being metrics. The centralized electronic system for interstate placements of children in foster care has led to changes in placement times, administrative costs, and caseworker time spent on placing children across State lines. The system is being assessed for better serving and protecting children in the child welfare system by integrating with other data systems. The text chunk discusses improving reporting related to sex trafficking victims and missing children in foster care, as well as enhancing States' ability to comply with background check requirements for child welfare. Section 437(a) of the Social Security Act is amended to change the year from 2016 to 2017. Section 437(b) is also amended to reserve $5,000,000 for improving the interstate placement of children, with the funds available through fiscal year 2021."
