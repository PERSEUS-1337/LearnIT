    "content": "Congress uses an annual appropriations process to fund discretionary spending for federal government agencies. If regular appropriations bills are not enacted by the start of the fiscal year, continuing resolutions (CRs) may be used to provide funding. In FY2014, four CRs were enacted as no regular appropriations acts were passed. A \"narrow\" CR, the Pay Our Military Act, provided funds for certain Department of Defense and Department of Homeland Security activities. The Pay Our Military Act (H.R. 3210; P.L. 113-39, 113th Congress) became law, causing a funding gap for projects and activities on October 1. A CR was enacted to provide appropriations for military death gratuities. The funding gap ended on October 17 with a \"broad\" CR funding projects from the previous fiscal year. This funding was extended to January 18, 2014, to allow time for the annual appropriations process. The report summarizes the components of the four FY2014 continuing resolutions (CRs) and provides information on their coverage, expiration, formula, anomalies, and estimated annualized amount of discretionary spending. It also references other reports for historical data on CRs enacted between FY1977 and FY2014. Supplemental appropriations acts from the previous fiscal year are often covered by a CR, providing funds for projects and activities. The duration of a CR is limited by an expiration date, which may be temporary or full-year. A formula is used to provide budget authority without specifying a specific amount, calculating an annualized rate for each project and activity. The Congressional Budget Office estimates annual discretionary spending for FY2014 under continuing appropriations acts using two measures: \"total regular appropriations\" and \"total spending.\" Total regular appropriations only include annualized discretionary budget authority subject to the Budget Control Act limits, while total spending includes budget authority not subject to these limits. Anomalies in a CR may designate exceptions to funding duration, formula, or purpose for covered projects and activities. The first CR enacted for FY2014 was an \"automatic\" CR, providing funding for specified activities during a funding gap, expiring when a regular appropriations act or CR was enacted. It covered pay and allowances for Armed Forces members and civilian personnel of the Department of Defense. The budget authority provided by the mechanism for FY2014 began on October 1, 2013, and ended on October 17, 2013, with the enactment of the Continuing Appropriations Act of 2014 (P.L. 113-46). It covered pay and allowances for contractors providing support to members of the Armed Forces. No anomalies were reported in this CR, and no CBO cost estimate was issued. The second CR for FY2014, the Department of Defense Survivor Benefits Continuing Appropriations Resolution, 2014 (H.J.Res. 91; P.L. 113-44), provided funds for various activities in the Department of Defense related to death gratuity, funeral expenses, funeral travel, and housing allowance for dependents of members dying on active duty. The CR provided housing allowance for dependents of members dying on active duty, funded at the previous year's rate. Funds began on October 10, 2013, and were to end on December 15, 2013, but were superseded by P.L. 113-46 on October 17, 2013. Funding formula included effects of FY2013 budget reductions and sequestration order. The FY2014 CR, enacted on October 17, 2013, provided budget authority for projects and activities funded in FY2013, totaling $150 million when including spending designated under Section 251(b) of the BBEDCA. The FY2014 CR, enacted on October 17, 2013, provided budget authority for projects and activities funded in FY2013, totaling $150 million. The CR extended provisions from the FY2013 Consolidated Act, exempting certain budget authority from discretionary spending limits and prohibiting the initiation or resumption of activities without available budget authority from FY2013. The FY2014 CR, enacted on October 17, 2013, provided budget authority for projects and activities funded in FY2013, totaling $150 million. The CR aimed to protect Congress's ability to provide annual funding as it chooses in final appropriations measures. Funding in the FY2014 CR was effective from October 1, 2013, to January 15, 2014, with provisions for budget authority to be superseded by regular appropriations acts. The FY2014 CR provided budget authority for projects and activities funded in FY2013 at the same rate, taking into account previous appropriations acts and sequestration orders. Anomalies in the CR affected funding levels, such as for \"The Judiciary\u2014Courts of Appeals, District Courts, and Other Judicial Services\u2014Salaries and Expenses.\" The FY2014 CR provided budget authority for projects and activities funded in FY2013 at the same rate, with anomalies affecting funding levels for \"District Courts, and Other Judicial Services\u2014Salaries and Expenses.\" An alternative amount of annualized funding is provided for specified projects or activities, with provisions for transfer between accounts to maintain minimum operating levels. The FY2014 CR allowed the District of Columbia to spend local funds for different purposes and amounts than originally specified. It also extended expiring statutory authorities, such as sections 1205 and 1206 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012. The FY2014 CR extended statutory authorities, including subsection (h) of section 1206, until the enactment of an Act authorizing appropriations for fiscal year 2014 for military activities of the Department of Defense. The total annualized budget authority in the CR was $986.3 billion for regular appropriations subject to BCA limits, and $1.088 trillion when including designated spending for OCO/GWOT, continuing disability reviews, health care fraud abuse control, or disaster relief. The FY2014 CR exceeded statutory discretionary spending limits with nondefense spending at $468.3 billion and defense spending at $518 billion. The Bipartisan Budget Act amended the limits to $520.5 billion for defense and $491.8 billion for nondefense. The FY2014 CR spending was below the amended limits. The fourth CR for FY2014 extended the expiration date of the previous CR to January 18, 2014 without any other amendments."
