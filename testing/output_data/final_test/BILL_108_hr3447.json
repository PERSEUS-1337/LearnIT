    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Social Investment and Economic Development Fund for the Americas Act of 2003\". It includes findings and a statement of policy. Congress finds that the economic, political, cultural, and geographic relationships among Western Hemisphere countries are significant to the United States. The interests of these countries are interconnected, and progress in one benefits others. The heads of state have accepted the challenge of economic and social integration following historic Summits of the Americas. Investment in social development in the Americas, focusing on education, health, housing, and labor markets, aims to combat social exclusion and promote economic integration, democracy, and the rule of law in the region. Latin America faces challenges in social and economic development due to highly unequal distribution of wealth, with one-third of the population living in poverty. Efforts are needed to promote social equality, develop skills, and modernize infrastructure to maximize benefits from economic integration. One-third of the population in Latin America lives in poverty, with increasing numbers in extreme poverty. Marginalized groups, including indigenous populations, people of African descent, women, people with disabilities, and rural populations, suffer from poverty, stigma, and discrimination. Despite democratic values being dominant in the Americas, existing governments face challenges in maintaining effective civilian authority over institutions. The prosperity, security, and well-being of the United States are directly linked to peace, prosperity, and democracy in the Americas. Strengthening the middle class, reducing poverty, and promoting the rule of law in the region will benefit the entire region and create a better environment for investment by US businesses. The United States supports developing countries in acquiring knowledge and resources for development, improving economic and political institutions, and achieving equitable economic growth in the Western Hemisphere. The Summit of the Americas has tasked multilateral institutions to mobilize private-public partnerships for this purpose. The United States promotes market-based principles, economic integration, social development, and trade in the Americas to achieve equitable development objectives. A Social Investment and Economic Development Fund for the Americas can advance national interests, improve the lives of the poor, encourage economic growth, protect the environment, build human capital, support democracy, and promote peace and justice in the region. The United States aims to promote equitable development in the Americas through public-private partnerships, microenterprise development, improving quality of life, investing in human capital, strengthening the rule of law, reducing poverty, and eliminating exclusion of marginalized populations. Additionally, there is a proposal to establish an investment fund for the Western Hemisphere to advance national interests and improve the lives of the poor. The United States aims to promote equitable development in the Americas through various initiatives such as public-private partnerships, microenterprise development, investing in human capital, strengthening the rule of law, reducing poverty, and eliminating exclusion of marginalized populations. This includes efforts to directly improve the lives of the poor and marginalized, encourage economic growth, protect the environment, build knowledge, support democratic participation, and promote peace and justice in the region. The Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 is amended to include a new chapter on the Social Investment and Economic Development Fund for the Americas, authorizing assistance for promoting equitable development in the region. The President, through the Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development, will provide assistance to reduce poverty and foster economic opportunity in the Western Hemisphere by nurturing partnerships, improving quality of life, strengthening the rule of law, and reducing poverty for marginalized populations. Assistance under this chapter may be provided on terms and conditions determined by the President. The Technical Review Committee is established under SEC. 499I. The Technical Review Committee, established under SEC. 499I, consists of individuals with technical expertise in Latin America and the Caribbean, as well as U.S. citizens with experience in development projects and business. The committee reviews projects for funding under section 499H(a) and provides recommendations to the President on project evaluation guidelines. The Technical Review Committee evaluates project proposals for funding and follows guidelines to assess project suitability. Members are prohibited from reviewing applications from organizations they are affiliated with to avoid conflicts of interest. The President is required to submit an annual report to congressional committees on the programs and activities conducted under this chapter, along with an evaluation of their results. Authorization of appropriations is also included. Authorization of appropriations is set at $250,000,000 for each fiscal year from 2005 to 2009 for the United States Social Investment and Economic Development Fund for the Americas. These funds are in addition to existing amounts and can be used until expended. Administrative expenses are limited to 7 percent of the total appropriation. Additionally, the Inter-American Development Bank Act is amended to include these provisions. SEC. 39. SOCIAL INVESTMENT AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT FUND FOR THE AMERICAS.
