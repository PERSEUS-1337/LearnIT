    "content": "The title of the act is the \"Social Security Surplus Preservation and Debt Reduction Act.\" Congress finds that the unified budget surplus in fiscal year 1998 and projected surpluses are primarily due to social security trust funds. Balancing the budget excluding these surpluses will reduce public debt by $1,859,500,000,000 by 2009. Social security surpluses should be used for reform or debt reduction. The Social Security surpluses should not be used for other programs but for security reform or debt reduction to improve the future viability of the system. Protection of the Social Security Trust Funds is emphasized to ensure the funds are used for security reform or debt reduction, improving the system's future viability. Congress reaffirms its support for protecting the social security trust funds from budget calculations and prioritizing the payment of social security benefits when there are sufficient balances in the trust funds. Amendments are made to the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 to enforce these protections. Amendments to the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 prioritize protecting the social security trust funds and ensuring payment of benefits. It includes provisions prohibiting deficits in the budget related to social security, except in cases of social security reform legislation. Amendments to the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 include provisions related to emergency requirements and supermajority waiver and appeal. Amendments to the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 include changes to the President's budget process and a Senate resolution on the Medicare reserve fund. The Senate finds that the Congressional budget plan has unallocated budget surpluses that could be used for long-term medicare reform, other priorities, or debt reduction. The budget resolution for fiscal year 2000 has already set aside funds for medicare reform, including prescription drug coverage. The President's medicare proposal is estimated to cost over 10 years, but the Congressional budget resolution provides more than enough resources for medicare reform, including prescription drugs. It is the sense of the Senate that the Congressional budget resolution for fiscal year 2000 provides a sound foundation. The Congressional budget resolution for fiscal year 2000 sets aside funds to modernize medicare benefits, improve solvency, and expand prescription drug coverage."
