    "content": "The Act is titled the \"National Strategic and Critical Minerals Production Act\". Congress recognizes the importance of minerals for various technologies, infrastructure projects, economic growth, national security, and the well-being of the United States. The United States is increasingly dependent on foreign mineral resources despite having vast domestic reserves. 25 years ago, the US relied on foreign sources for 45 nonfuel mineral materials, with 8 fulfilling 100% of requirements and 19 fulfilling over 50%. By 2015, the United States increased import dependence for nonfuel mineral materials from 45 to 47, with 19 fulfilling 100% of requirements and 22 fulfilling over 50%. The United States imports over 50% of 41 metals and minerals crucial for clean energy. In 2015, the US share of global mineral exploration dollars dropped to 7% from 19% in the 1990s. A 2014 ranking of mining investment countries highlighted 7- to 10-year permitting delays as a major risk. In late 2016, the Government Accountability Office criticized the federal government's handling of critical materials supply issues. The Federal government's approach to addressing critical materials supply issues has not consistently followed key practices for interagency collaboration. This includes unclear roles and responsibilities among agencies and limitations such as data constraints, focus on only a subset of critical materials, limited emphasis on domestic production, and minimal engagement with industry. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, the term \"agency\" refers to any government unit or Alaska Native Corporation. An \"Alaska Native Corporation\" is defined as per the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act. The term \"lead agency\" is the primary agency responsible for issuing mineral exploration or mine permits. \"Mineral exploration or mine permit\" includes authorizations for premining activities from the Bureau of Land Management or Forest Service. The curr_chunk discusses premining activities that require environmental impact statements or similar analyses under the National Environmental Policy Act. It also mentions plans of operations issued by the Bureau of Land Management or the Forest Service, as well as permits issued under specific authorities. The term \"project\" is defined as a project for mining activities. The term \"project\" refers to activities related to mineral exploration, mining, processing, or reclamation on mining claims or Federal mineral leases. SEC. 4. IMPROVING DEVELOPMENT OF STRATEGIC AND CRITICAL MINERALS. The term \"strategic and critical minerals\" refers to minerals essential for national defense, energy infrastructure, domestic manufacturing, economic security, and trade balance in the United States. Domestic mines meeting certain criteria may be considered infrastructure projects. Projects involving domestic mines that provide strategic and critical minerals are considered infrastructure projects under Executive Order 13604. SEC. 5. RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE LEAD AGENCY. The lead agency appoints a project lead to coordinate with cooperating agencies, project proponents, and contractors to minimize delays, adhere to timelines, set clear goals, and track progress. The National Environmental Policy Act requirements are considered satisfied for mineral exploration permits if the lead agency determines so. The lead agency determines if State or Federal agencies have addressed key environmental factors for actions under the permit, including impact assessment, alternatives, and public participation. The lead agency must ensure public participation in the decision-making process for authorizing actions under the permit. Within 90 days of receiving an application, the agency must provide a written record of decision explaining the rationale, stating facts, and demonstrating that a reasonable person could reach the same determination. Coordination on the permitting process is required to enhance government actions. The lead agency must enhance government coordination for the permitting process by avoiding duplicative reviews, minimizing paperwork, and engaging other agencies and stakeholders early. They should consider deferring to baseline data from State agencies and conducting consultations concurrently to expedite the process. The lead agency can establish memoranda of agreement with relevant entities to coordinate environmental review processes. Additionally, time limits can be set for projects where the lead agency cannot make a determination. The lead agency can establish agreements with project proponents to set time limits for each part of the permitting process, including decisions on environmental impact statements, scope determinations, and baseline studies required under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. The permitting process includes preparation of environmental impact statements, consultations, review of comments, publication of public notices, and final or interim decisions. Time limits can be set for each part of the process. The time limit for the permitting process is 30 months, with the lead agency not required to address comments not submitted during the public comment period. The lead agency also determines the financial assurance needed for reclamation of mining sites. The lead agency may contract with a third party to reclaim operations, including construction and maintenance costs for treatment facilities to meet environmental standards. Projects on National Forest System land are exempt from certain regulations for identified mineral resources and necessary construction routes. The lead agency can contract with a third party for reclamation of operations, including construction and maintenance costs for treatment facilities. Projects on National Forest System land are exempt from regulations for identified mineral resources and construction routes. This section applies to existing mineral exploration or mine permits if the applicant submits a written request to the lead agency. The lead agency must begin implementing this section within 30 days of receiving the request. The lead agency must begin implementing this section within 30 days of receiving the written request for the permit. SEC. 6. FEDERAL REGISTER PROCESS FOR MINERAL EXPLORATION AND MINING PROJECTS. (a) Departmental Review.--The Secretary of the Interior or Agriculture must ensure that all Federal Register notices for mineral exploration or mine permits undergo required reviews and are published within 45 days. (b) Preparation of notices is delegated to the lead agency's organizational level. (c) Transmission of all Federal Register notices must be done as required. Transmission of Federal Register notices for official document availability, meetings, or intent to take action must originate from the office where the documents or meetings are held or the activity is initiated within the lead agency. This Act does not apply to minerals listed in Secretarial Order 3324 issued on December 3, 2012, in the specified areas."
