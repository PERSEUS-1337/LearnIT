    "title": "AB 1929",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 17052 of the Revenue and Taxation Code is amended to allow an earned income tax credit against the \"net tax\" for taxable years starting January 1, 2015. The credit amount is determined based on Section 32 of the Internal Revenue Code, adjusted by a factor specified in the annual Budget Act. The earned income tax credit is only available when resources are allocated in the annual Budget Act for oversight and auditing. The credit percentage and phaseout percentage vary based on the number of qualifying children. The earned income amount and phaseout amount also differ depending on the number of qualifying children. The phaseout amounts for the earned income tax credit vary based on the number of qualifying children: $3,290 for no qualifying children, $4,940 for one qualifying child, and $6,935 for two or more qualifying children. Certain sections of the Internal Revenue Code are modified to adjust the credit and phaseout percentages. Section 32 of the Internal Revenue Code is modified to adjust the earned income tax credit amounts and phaseout thresholds. The credit amounts are recomputed annually, and any excess credit will be refunded to the taxpayer. The Franchise Tax Board can create rules for this section, refunds will be treated like federal earned income refunds for benefit eligibility, and exemptions apply for implementing the credit for the 2015 taxable year. The Franchise Tax Board must include scope, costs, and schedule changes for the California Earned Income Tax Credit in its next Special Project Report. The purpose of the credit is to reduce poverty among working families, and an annual report on the number of claims must be prepared. The Franchise Tax Board must report on the California Earned Income Tax Credit, including the number of false claims, individuals claiming the credit, average credit amount, distribution by dependents and income ranges, and estimates of families lifted out of deep poverty by the credit. The Franchise Tax Board will report on the California Earned Income Tax Credit, including the number of reduced and denied claims, and provide the report to various Senate and Assembly committees. The tax credit allowed by this section will be known as the California Earned Income Tax Credit."
