    "content": "The \"Better On-line Ticket Sales Act of 2016\" or the \"BOTS Act\" addresses unfair practices related to ticket access circumvention software. The BOTS Act prohibits the sale and use of software designed to circumvent technological measures limiting purchases made via computerized event ticketing systems. The section prohibits purchasing event tickets in violation of system limits, and reselling tickets acquired unlawfully. The term \"computerized event ticketing system\" refers to online ticket selling systems. The section prohibits unauthorized purchase and resale of event tickets through an online system, limiting transactions and ticket quantities. \"Event ticket\" refers to tickets for specific events. Circumventing system measures is also prohibited. The section allows the creation and use of computer software to investigate violations or analyze vulnerabilities in event ticketing systems for research purposes. Violations of the section are considered unfair and deceptive acts by the Federal Trade Commission. States also have enforcement authority. States have enforcement authority under the section to bring civil actions on behalf of residents in federal court for violations of subsections (a), (b), or (c). The attorney general must notify the Federal Trade Commission before taking action. The attorney general must notify the Federal Trade Commission before bringing a civil action for violations of subsections (a), (b), or (c), including providing a copy of the complaint to be filed. If immediate notification is not feasible, the attorney general must inform the Commission upon initiating the action. The Federal Trade Commission may intervene in civil actions brought by state attorney generals and file petitions for appeal. If the FTC initiates a civil or administrative action for violations, state attorney generals cannot bring civil actions during that time. During the FTC's action, state attorney generals cannot bring civil actions against defendants named in the complaint. The House of Representatives passed the bill on September 12, 2016. Karen L. Haas is the Clerk."
