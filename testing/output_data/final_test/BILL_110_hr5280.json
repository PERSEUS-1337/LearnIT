    "content": "The Act titled \"Stop Unfair Practices in Credit Cards Act of 2007\" aims to address unfair interest rates and fees in credit card practices. Section 163 of the Truth in Lending Act is amended to include provisions regarding billing periods and finance charges. If an open end consumer credit plan allows repayment without interest within a specified time period, the creditor cannot impose an interest charge on the repaid amount. In an open end consumer credit plan, if a billing statement requests repayment within a specified time period and the obligor pays in full within that time, no additional interest can be imposed. Additionally, limits are placed on interest rate increases for credit card accounts under such plans. Limits are placed on interest rate increases for credit card accounts under an open end consumer credit plan. Increases can only occur if disclosed or with the obligor's written consent. If an obligor fails to repay, a penalty rate can be applied with specific conditions. The interest rate on a credit card account cannot exceed 7 percentage points above the previous rate while the account is open. Any increase in the interest rate only applies to future credit extensions, not to existing balances. With an open end consumer credit plan, creditors cannot charge interest on transaction fees. They must offer the option of a fixed credit limit that cannot be exceeded, without imposing over-the-limit fees. The fee described in section 127(c)(1)(B)(iii) can only be imposed on an account when the credit limit is exceeded due to an extension of credit, not due to penalty fees like late fees. This fee can only be charged once during a billing cycle if the credit limit is exceeded, and no additional over-the-limit fee can be imposed in the next cycle unless additional credit is obtained. The creditor cannot charge a separate fee for repaying credit or finance charges on a credit card account. They can impose a reasonable currency exchange fee if it reflects actual costs and is disclosed publicly. The primary Federal regulator of a card issuer must audit credit card operations annually to ensure compliance with regulations, including reviewing billing statements and credit card accounts for timely payments and finance charge application. The regulator can require corrective action for non-compliance. SEC. 3. STOP UNFAIR APPLICATION OF CARD PAYMENTS. Section 164 of the Truth in Lending Act is amended to ensure prompt and fair crediting of payments. Payments must be applied first to the balance with the highest interest rate, followed by the next highest rate, and so on. The card issuer must then apply the payment in a way that minimizes finance charges. The Truth in Lending Act is amended to prevent card issuers from imposing late fees or finance charges if a material change in address or procedures causes a delay in crediting a cardholder payment. SEC. 4. STOP DECEPTIVE DISCLOSURE. Amends the Truth in Lending Act to require disclosure and definition of the referenced prime rate for variable interest rates on credit cards. Prohibits card issuers from using the term 'prime rate' for any other type of interest rate. SEC. 5. DEFINITIONS. Amends the Truth in Lending Act to define 'primary Federal regulator' for card issuers that are depository institutions. The regulator is responsible for overseeing credit card operations, ensuring compliance with the Act, and enforcing prohibitions against unfair practices. Section 136(b) of the Truth in Lending Act is amended to include information on different types of transactions and events where card issuers have imposed separate interest rates on cardholders. The amendment to Section 136(b) of the Truth in Lending Act requires card issuers to provide details on interest rates charged to cardholders and the number of cardholders affected, as well as a list of fees imposed on cardholders. The amendment to Section 136(b) of the Truth in Lending Act mandates card issuers to disclose details on interest rates and fees charged to cardholders, including the number of cardholders affected by each fee. The amendment requires card issuers to disclose interest rates, fees, and charges to cardholders. The Board must report annually to Congress on the profitability of credit card operations, including income derived from interest rates on cardholders. The amendment mandates card issuers to disclose interest rates, fees, and charges to cardholders, including separate estimates for interest rates below 25 percent and those equal to or above 25 percent. It also requires disclosure of fees on cardholders and merchants, as well as any other significant sources of income. The Fair Credit and Charge Card Disclosure Act of 1988 is being amended to repeal Section 8. The effective date for this Act and its amendments will be 180 days after enactment."
