    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"BPA-Free Kids Act of 2009\" and includes definitions. The \"BPA-Free Kids Act of 2009\" defines terms such as bisphenol A and children's food or beverage containers. The factors considered in determining if a product is designed for children 3 years or younger include manufacturer's statement, packaging representation, and consumer recognition. The term \"metal can\" refers to a single-walled container made of metal substrate for food or beverages. The term \"plastic resin\" is a polymer in pellet form. \"Sold or distributed at retail\" means sold to consumers. The term \"supplier\" refers to any person providing plastic resin to manufacturers of children's food or beverage containers. SEC. 3. BAN ON CERTAIN PRODUCTS MADE WITH BISPHENOL A. The ban on children's food or beverage containers containing bisphenol A is treated as a banned hazardous substance under the Federal Hazardous Substances Act. The Consumer Product Safety Commission has jurisdiction to enforce this regulation. The Safety Commission has authority to enforce regulations despite exclusions in other acts related to food safety and regulation. The Memorandum of Understanding (MOU number 225-76-2003) outlines jurisdiction for enforcing the Consumer Product Safety Act and the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act regarding food, food containers, and related items. SEC. 4. CERTIFICATION AND TESTING REQUIREMENTS. Testing requirements for plastic resins must be prescribed by the Commission within 150 days of the Act's enactment. This is to ensure that plastic resins used in children's food or beverage containers do not contain bisphenol A. The requirements will include a schedule for testing, with consideration for phasing out testing after a period of years, and methodologies for testing plastic resins. The Commission will prescribe testing requirements for plastic resins within 150 days of the Act's enactment. This will include a schedule for testing, methodologies, record-keeping standards, public access to data, and other necessary requirements. Suppliers of plastic resins must meet certification requirements once the testing requirements are established. The supplier must certify that plastic resin used in children's food or beverage containers has been tested and does not contain bisphenol A. Manufacturers must implement a testing program to ensure compliance with the requirements. The Consumer Product Safety Act exempts bisphenol A in children's food or beverage containers. SEC. 5. LABELING AND ADVERTISING REQUIREMENTS. Children's food or beverage containers must bear a \"BPA-Free Product\" compliance statement if they are made of plastic resin certified and tested under specific regulations and do not contain bisphenol A. Any advertisement for children's food or beverage containers must display or be accompanied by a compliance statement indicating that the product is BPA-free. SEC. 6. ENFORCEMENT. The Commission will conduct random audits of suppliers and manufacturers of plastic resins for children's food containers to ensure compliance with regulations. They will also test children's food containers to prevent hazardous substances from entering the market. Regulations for these actions must be established within 150 days of the Act's enactment. The Commission will enforce regulations for suppliers and manufacturers of plastic resins for children's food containers. Non-compliance will result in penalties under the Federal Hazardous Substances Act. The Commission will submit annual reports to Congress detailing audits, testing results, and penalties imposed. SEC. 7. EFFECT ON FEDERAL AND STATE LAW.\n\nNothing in this Act or section 18(b)(1)(B) of the Federal Hazardous Substances Act shall affect the authority of any State to regulate products containing bisphenol A, except when compliance with both State and Federal law is impossible. This section does not impact enforcement actions or liabilities under State law. Additionally, this Act does not preempt any warning requirements established by State law before August 31, 2003.\n\nSEC. 8. RESEARCH ON HEALTH EFFECTS OF EXPOSURE TO BISPHENOL A. The Secretary of Health and Human Services must submit a research plan within 180 days to study the health effects of bisphenol A on all age groups and pregnant women. Research must begin within a year and can be conducted through various methods. Reports on the research must be provided to Congress. The Secretary of Health and Human Services is required to submit interim and final reports to Congress on the research status and results regarding bisphenol A within specified timeframes. The Secretary of Health and Human Services is authorized to appropriate $5,000,000 annually from 2010 to 2014 for research on bisphenol A. The Act will be effective on the date of enactment and will apply to children's food or beverage containers manufactured 180 days after the enactment date."
