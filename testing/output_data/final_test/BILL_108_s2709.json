    "content": "The Act is titled the \"National Reforestation Act of 2004\" and its purpose is outlined in the findings and purposes section. Congress finds that forest land derived from the public domain should be maintained with appropriate forest cover to maximize benefits of multiple use sustained yield management. Recent wildfires and natural disasters have destroyed forest ecosystems, delaying reestablishment of appropriate forest cover on millions of acres. Reforestation treatments after disturbances restore the desired forest cover. Disturbance events should be quickly followed by reforestation to restore forest cover, providing benefits such as protecting soil and water resources, wildlife habitat, aesthetics, recreational opportunities, wood fiber source, and ecosystem health for present and future generations. Reforestation after fires and natural disasters should align with forest management plans to minimize impact on other renewable resources like wildlife habitat. The Act aims to increase funding for reforestation on public forest land to address issues like habitat loss, soil erosion, and water quality degradation. It also seeks to address challenges such as wildfire damage, declining revenues, and a backlog of reforestation needs accumulating each year. The goal is to promote timely reforestation treatment to restore forest cover and protect resources for present and future generations. SEC. 3. TRANSFERS TO TRUST FUND amended to increase funding from $30,000,000 to $90,000,000. SEC. 4. OBLIGATIONS FROM TRUST FUND. Section 303(d) of Public Law 96-451 (16 U.S.C. 1606a(d)) is amended to include definitions for \"appropriate forest cover\" and \"moderate fire intensity area\" in relation to reforestation and timber stand improvements by the Secretary of Agriculture. The Secretary of Agriculture has defined \"moderate fire intensity area\" as a burned area where high intensity burn has occurred on less than 40 percent of the area, which may pose flood risks, have water-repellent soils, or yield high overland runoff. The Secretary of Agriculture has defined a \"nonfire natural disturbance event\" as an event resulting from insect or disease infestation, storm damage, or other natural occurrences that require reforestation treatment to restore appropriate forest cover. The Secretary of Agriculture has defined a \"nonfire natural disturbance event\" as an event resulting from insect or disease infestation, storm damage, or other natural occurrences that require reforestation treatment to restore appropriate forest cover. In paragraph (2), subparagraph (A) is amended to include reforestation treatment subject to subparagraph (B), and subparagraph (B) is redesignated as subparagraph (C). Additionally, a new subparagraph (B) is added for reforestation treatment on forest land from the public domain affected by fire or severe damage. Reforestation treatment is required for areas severely affected by nonfire natural disturbance events, as identified in a report to Congress. Treatment must occur within 5 years of the disturbance event. The Secretary of Agriculture may allocate up to 10% of annual Trust Fund expenditures to supplement Forest Service expenses for cooperative agreements with colleges and universities. The Secretary of Agriculture may allocate up to 10% of annual Trust Fund expenditures for cooperative agreements with colleges and universities, including grant colleges, 1890 Institutions, and Tuskegee University, to conduct research on reforestation. Technical Amendment: Section 3 of the Forest and Rangeland Renewable Resources Planning Act of 1974 is amended to redesignate subsections (e) and (d) as subsections (f) and (e) respectively."
