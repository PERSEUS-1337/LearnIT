This section amends the Social Security Act to include items and services provided under an intensive lifestyle treatment program for eligible beneficiaries. The intensive lifestyle treatment program is covered under the Social Security Act for eligible beneficiaries. The intensive lifestyle treatment program, defined as a physician-supervised program delivering services to affect chronic diseases, is covered under the Social Security Act for eligible beneficiaries. The intensive lifestyle treatment program covered under the Social Security Act includes individualized treatment furnished under a written plan established by a physician, with items and services provided in a series of sessions over 18 weeks. The intensive lifestyle treatment program under the Social Security Act includes group sessions with up to 15 beneficiaries, provided by an intensive lifestyle team or under a physician's direction. Services may also be offered in underserved areas by physician assistants, nurse practitioners, or clinical nurse specialists. The program includes exercise and risk factor modification through education, counseling, and behavioral intervention. The intensive lifestyle treatment program under the Social Security Act includes various services such as psychosocial assessment, provider consultation, care coordination, medication management, medical nutritional therapy, tobacco cessation, outcomes assessment, and other necessary items and services determined by the Secretary. These services are tailored to the individual's needs and aimed at improving or maintaining their condition and functional level. The Secretary establishes guidelines for frequency and duration of items and services for eligible beneficiaries with specific conditions like coronary heart disease, type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome, prostate cancer, and breast cancer under the Social Security Act. The Social Security Act is amended to include an intensive lifestyle treatment program with payment not exceeding the cost of hospitalization for eligible beneficiaries with specific conditions. The Secretary shall make payments to an eligible beneficiary program, equal to 50% of the established amount upon initial consultation, and the remaining balance after completion of treatment, subject to limitations. An intensive lifestyle treatment program must show documented beneficial effects on the progression of chronic diseases in a beneficiary to receive payment. The Secretary will determine the beneficial progression of chronic diseases in eligible beneficiaries through various biomarkers such as high density lipoprotein, hemoglobin A1C, C-reactive protein, waist size, elimination of cotinine level, prostate specific antigen, and prognostic biomarkers of prostate and breast cancer. The Secretary will assess the improvement in chronic diseases by measuring specific biomarkers before and after treatment, including a 10 percent reduction in certain measures. The program offers a refund for eligible beneficiaries who receive other treatments within 1 year of the initial consultation, related to the initial diagnosis. The program offers refunds for eligible beneficiaries who receive other treatments within 1 year of the initial consultation. It covers a series of 72 one-hour sessions over 18 days.

The Secretary will establish a Lifestyle Rewards Program for eligible beneficiaries who have completed an intensive lifestyle treatment program and meet specific requirements. To receive an award, beneficiaries must show improvement in chronic diseases as measured by specific criteria within a year of the initial consultation. The Lifestyle Rewards Program offers a $200 award to eligible beneficiaries who complete the intensive lifestyle treatment program and show improvement in chronic diseases. The award is given in the form and manner prescribed by the Secretary, with amendments effective from January 1, 2010. The Congress believes that intensive lifestyle treatment programs should benefit individuals with chronic diseases not enrolled in Medicare and should be covered by all public and private payers."
