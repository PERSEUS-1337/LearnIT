    "content": "Under the Clean Air Act, the EPA sets national outdoor air quality standards for pollutants that may endanger public health. These standards are reviewed every five years, with criteria pollutants including particulate matter, ozone, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur oxides, carbon monoxide, and lead. EPA establishes short-term and long-term standards for particulate matter. EPA established standards for particulate matter based on size, including PM 2.5 and PM 10. The agency revised the PM NAAQS in 2013 to protect against health effects from short- and long-term exposure to particulates. These changes are referred to as the 2013 PM NAAQS. The EPA's 2013 PM NAAQS revisions tightened standards for fine particulate matter PM 2.5 but did not change the 24-hour PM 2.5 standard or the PM 10 standards. NAAQS does not directly limit emissions but sets guidelines for protecting public health. States and EPA identify nonattainment areas for the 2013 PM 2.5 NAAQS based on air quality data. States submit SIPs with regulations to bring areas into compliance. EPA published amendments to final designations on April 7, 2015, based on 2014 air quality data. 20 counties in four states were designated as nonattainment for the 2013 PM 2.5 standard. In April 2015, EPA designated nine areas in four states as nonattainment for the 2013 PM 2.5 standard. Five areas in Georgia were classified as unclassifiable. EPA also deferred initial designation for 10 areas in three states due to insufficient data. Three areas, including all of Illinois, were labeled as \"unclassifiable\" due to monitoring data insufficiencies. The April 2015 modifications by EPA did not change the designation determinations for areas in Indian country made in January 2015. Twelve areas in Indian country near nonattainment counties in California were designated nonattainment for the 2013 annual PM 2.5 standard. All other state areas and Indian country areas were classified as \"unclassifiable/attainment\" for the 2013 PM 2.5 standard. EPA specified initial area designations for 2013 PM 2.5 nonattainment areas as \"moderate\" under the Clean Air Act. The EPA was required to implement the PM 2.5 NAAQS under Subpart 4 of Part D of the CAA. This report focuses on the NAAQS implementation process for designating nonattainment areas for the 2013 PM 2.5 standard, comparing it to previous revisions. EPA is not mandating new nonattainment designations for PM 2.5. The EPA is not requiring new nonattainment designations for the PM 2.5 24-hour standard or the PM 10 standard in the 2013 revisions. The report includes states' obligations for developing SIPs to comply with NAAQS. Appendices provide a chronology of PM NAAQS regulations and implementation timelines for different standards. The Clean Air Act (CAA) establishes two types of National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS): primary standards for public health protection and secondary standards for public welfare. EPA's 1997 revisions introduced standards for fine particles smaller than 2.5 microns (PM 2.5) in addition to particles smaller than 10 microns (PM 10). The 2013 revisions did not require new nonattainment designations for PM 2.5 or PM 10 standards. States are responsible for developing State Implementation Plans (SIPs) to comply with NAAQS. The primary NAAQS as revised included daily and annual limits for PM 2.5 and PM 10. Attainment of the annual standard requires that the three-year average of the weighted annual arithmetic mean PM concentration at each monitor within an area must not exceed the maximum limit set by the agency. The 24-hour standards indicate the percentage of time a monitoring station can exceed the standard. EPA set the secondary NAAQS the same as the primary standards for PM 2.5 and PM 10. EPA revised the annual standard for PM 2.5 in the final rule. In the final rule, EPA revised the annual standard for PM 2.5 from 15 to 12 \u00b5g/m3. The daily standard remains at 35 \u00b5g/m3. For PM 10, EPA kept the daily standard of 150 \u00b5g/m3 with no annual standard. EPA also retained the secondary annual PM 2.5 standard. The EPA established a maximum concentration standard of 50 \u00b5g/m3 in 2006 for PM 2.5. Designating areas as nonattainment based on air quality data is a critical step in NAAQS implementation. The governor of each state must submit designations for NAAQS within 1 year of promulgation. EPA has discretion in determining the boundaries of nonattainment areas. The EPA must promulgate final designations for NAAQS within two years of promulgation, with a possible one-year extension if insufficient information is available. States and tribes provide initial designation recommendations to EPA, with past processes often extending beyond deadlines. For the 2013 NAAQS, state submissions were due by December 13, 2013, and final designations were to be made by December 12, 2014. Section 107(d)(1)(A) of the CAA requires states to submit lists of areas designated as nonattainment for air quality standards. Tribes are encouraged to make recommendations for NAAQS designations, and EPA follows a similar process for tribes as for states. EPA's designation process for tribes is outlined in the 1988 Tribal Authority Rule. The EPA Administrator has discretion to modify state and tribal designation submissions for nonattainment areas under the CAA. The agency must notify states and tribes of any modifications and allow them to provide input, but the final decision rests with the EPA. Designations are based on three years of monitoring data, with a focus on measuring air quality to determine NAAQS compliance. Monitoring methods for fine particles were developed in 1997, with the network of monitors phased in from 1999 to 2000. EPA's final designations for the 2013 particulates NAAQS were based on this process. The EPA modified the network of monitors for the 2013 particulates NAAQS based on monitoring data from 2011-2013. Changes were made to air quality monitoring requirements to adopt improvements in technology. Factors like population density and urbanization are considered when designating nonattainment areas. EPA recommends states to use these factors along with technical guidance for their determinations. Factors considered when designating nonattainment areas include population density, urbanization, location of sources, existing emission controls, traffic patterns, weather, geography, and jurisdictional boundaries. States and tribes can provide additional relevant information. Entire metropolitan areas may be designated nonattainment based on monitoring data. Boundary recommendations must show no violations in excluded areas. The CAA does not specify. The Clean Air Act (CAA) does not require combining neighboring counties within the same nonattainment area, but it does mandate the use of metropolitan statistical area boundaries in more polluted areas. Unlike the 1997 PM 2.5 standards, the 2013 PM 2.5 standards do not generally use Metropolitan Statistical Areas or Consolidated Metropolitan Statistical Areas as the \"presumptive boundary\" for nonattainment areas. Instead, EPA instructed states and tribes to evaluate each area on a case-by-case basis for the 2006 PM 2.5 standards. Nonattainment areas for the 2006 24-hour PM 2.5 are expected to include counties with monitors violating the standard and nearby counties contributing to the violation. In November 2013, four states - California, Idaho, Ohio, and Pennsylvania - provided EPA with recommended nonattainment boundaries for the 2013 revised primary annual PM 2.5 standard. States used EPA guidance and air quality data to determine designated areas for nonattainment. In 2013, EPA finalized the area designations for the 2013 PM 2.5 NAAQS based on recommendations from states, tribes, and territories. Modifications were made to the final designations in January 2015 and further amended in April 2015 based on updated air quality data. The final area designations for the 2013 PM 2.5 NAAQS were published in April 2015, encompassing 20 counties in four states as nonattainment areas. The remaining counties in the US were classified as unclassified for the standard. EPA's designations for nonattainment of previous standards included 242 counties in 28 states and DC. Initial designations for 2013 PM 2.5 NAAQS areas were classified as \"Moderate\" as per EPA guidance. EPA reclassified some PM 2.5 NAAQS nonattainment areas from \"Moderate\" to \"serious\" due to inability to meet standards. This triggered additional implementation requirements for affected states. After reviewing 2014 air quality data, EPA's re-designations resulted in fewer areas, counties, and states designated as nonattainment. In Kentucky, Indiana, Ohio, and Pennsylvania, several counties were re-designated as unclassifiable or nonattainment for PM 2.5 NAAQS. EPA also designated areas in Georgia as unclassifiable. EPA made technical corrections for Allegheny County in Pennsylvania. Allegheny County in Pennsylvania was designated nonattainment for the 2013 PM 2.5 NAAQS. The amended final nonattainment area designations also included 12 areas in Indian country adjacent to counties in California. The nonattainment areas for the 2013 NAAQS may seem small compared to the total number of counties in the US, but they tend to have larger populations. Roughly 28 million people reside in the 39 counties designated as nonattainment by the EPA. Roughly 28 million people reside in the 39 counties EPA designated as nonattainment for the 2013 annual PM 2.5 NAAQS. Comparably, at the time of EPA's final designation for the 2006 PM NAAQS, more than 70 million people lived in the 120 counties designated as nonattainment for the 2006 24-hour PM 2.5 NAAQS. For the areas designated for 1997 PM NAAQS, nearly 90 million people lived in the 205 counties designated as nonattainment. EPA designated 14 areas in six states as nonattainment for the 2013 revised annual PM 2.5 standard. EPA designated 38 counties or portions of counties as nonattainment areas for the 2013 annual PM 2.5 NAAQS. Additionally, 12 areas in Indian country adjacent to nonattainment areas in California were designated. Initial designation for 10 areas in three states was deferred due to data validity issues. Florida, Tennessee (except for three counties), and eight areas in Georgia were included in the deferral. EPA had previously proposed to designate some areas as unclassifiable. The EPA designated nonattainment areas for the 2013 annual PM 2.5 NAAQS in 38 counties. Three areas were designated as unclassifiable: Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and all of Illinois. California, Idaho, Ohio, and Pennsylvania identified 12 areas with 25 counties as nonattainment. Designations were based on monitoring data from 2010-2012 and guidance from the EPA. States revised determinations for 2013 PM 2.5 NAAQS based on monitoring data. EPA responded with modifications to proposed area designations, designating areas as nonattainment and expanding nonattainment areas. EPA also combined nonattainment counties across state lines. In August 2014, EPA proposed 14 areas. In August 2014, EPA proposed 14 nonattainment areas for the revised 2013 primary annual PM 2.5 standard, including counties in six states. Additional counties in Kentucky, Indiana, Pennsylvania, and Ohio were designated as nonattainment for the PM 2.5 NAAQS. EPA expanded nonattainment areas and combined counties across state lines. EPA extended the designation period for 10 counties in Alabama, Georgia, and South Carolina due to data validity issues. They also planned to designate certain areas as \"unclassifiable\" due to data quality assurance problems, including territories, Indian country, counties in Illinois and Indiana, areas in Georgia, Missouri, and Tennessee. EPA intended to designate all remaining areas in the United States for the 2013 PM 2.5 NAAQS. EPA intended to designate all remaining areas in the United States, including Indian country and territories, as unclassifiable/attainment for the 2013 PM 2.5 NAAQS. States and tribes had the opportunity to submit additional information to challenge EPA's modifications before final designations. EPA urged states to submit additional information by October 29, 2014, with some states challenging EPA's proposed designations. EPA's final designations for nonattainment of the 2006 and 1997 PM 2.5 NAAQS included 242 counties in 28 states and the District of Columbia. Over 2,900 counties in 30 states were designated as attainment/unclassifiable. Two counties were designated nonattainment for the first time under the 2013 PM 2.5 annual standard, with the majority overlapping with previous nonattainment designations. For the 2013 revised annual PM 2.5 standard, some counties were designated as nonattainment for the 24-hour standard, while others were designated for both the annual and 24-hour standards. The map shows the overlap of nonattainment designations for the 2013 standard with previous standards. EPA's final designations in 2009 did not include new counties violating the annual standard. The EPA's designations for the 1997 PM 2.5 NAAQS included 204 counties in 20 states and the District of Columbia. Most counties exceeded only the annual standard, with 12 counties exceeding both the 24-hour and annual standards. Table 1 compares the geographic distribution of nonattainment areas for the 2013 PM 2.5 NAAQS with previous standards. It is uncertain how the EPA's final designations for the 2013 standard will impact current control measures in these areas. The impacts of EPA's final designations for the 2013 PM 2.5 standard on current control measures in nonattainment areas may require modifications to ensure compliance with stricter standards. These measures will be established by states in their SIPs and govern subsequent regulatory actions to reduce fine particle pollution. Under the Clean Air Act (CAA), EPA sets nationwide standards for criteria pollutants and states are responsible for limiting emissions that contribute to pollution. Areas designated as nonattainment must outline control requirements in state implementation plans to meet the 2013 PM 2.5 standard. EPA has classified all initial nonattainment areas in response to a court decision. In 2013, the D.C. Circuit Court decision required EPA to classify initial nonattainment areas for the PM 2.5 annual standard as moderate. Subpart 4 of the Clean Air Act mandates classification based on pollution severity, while Subpart 1 allows EPA to establish classifications if necessary. States have 18 months under Subpart 4 to submit SIPs for compliance, compared to three years under Subpart 1. Under Subpart 4 of the Clean Air Act, EPA may reclassify nonattainment areas for PM 2.5 as \"serious\" if they cannot meet the NAAQS by the attainment date. Serious areas have additional SIP planning requirements and must achieve attainment within 10 years. Moderate areas must attain within six years, while areas under Subpart 1 must attain within five years. The Clean Air Act requires attainment of air quality standards within specific timeframes. States may need local controls to achieve attainment, regardless of classification. Emission inventories are necessary for analyzing sources of nonattainment. EPA recommends identifying existing emission reduction programs and evaluating additional control measures for expeditious attainment. The Clean Air Act requires states to implement control measures like RACM and RACT to achieve air quality standards. Concerns about economic impact from nonattainment designation are debated, with EPA arguing that benefits outweigh costs. Historical evidence suggests that environmental regulations like the CAA have minimal impact on overall economic growth. Based on EPA's final designations for the 2013 PM 2.5 annual standard, some counties may be designated nonattainment for the first time. Compliance with new standards may require modifications to existing SIPs, varying by area. States must submit new or revised SIPs to meet NAAQS requirements under the Clean Air Act. States must submit new or revised SIPs to meet NAAQS requirements under the Clean Air Act, including demonstrating the capacity to attain, maintain, and enforce revisions associated with the PM 2.5 NAAQS. These submissions must address elements such as air quality monitoring, enforcement programs, resources for plan implementation, and prohibition of interstate pollution transport. Revised SIPs must also address provisions for prohibiting air emissions that contribute significantly to another state's nonattainment of the NAAQS or interfere with another state's maintenance of the NAAQS. The specific provisions for requirements in nonattainment areas designated as moderate under the Clean Air Act include nonattainment new source review permit program, attainment demonstration, assurance of RACM and RACT implementation, quantitative milestones for progress, and control requirements for major stationary sources precursors. The EPA publishes an \"implementation rule\" outlining state and tribal requirements for achieving and maintaining attainment, including guidance on establishing controls. The EPA published a proposed implementation rule for the PM 2.5 NAAQS on March 23, 2015, with a public comment period extended to May 29, 2015. The proposal includes requirements for areas designated nonattainment for PM 2.5 NAAQS and details on how air agencies are to meet statutory SIP requirements. EPA also proposed revocation of the 1997 primary annual PM 2.5 standard. The proposed PM 2.5 NAAQS implementation rule would replace EPA's 2007 PM 2.5 Implementation Rule and portions of the 2008 PM 2.5 New Source Review (NSR) Rule. In June 2014, EPA reclassified 1997 and 2006 nonattainment areas as \"moderate\" with a deadline for states to submit outstanding SIP requirements by December 31, 2014. The implementation rule for the 1997 PM 2.5 NAAQS published in April 2007 outlined requirements for states and tribes to achieve and maintain attainment of the 2006 standards. EPA outlined implementation guidance for states to demonstrate attainment with the 2006 PM 2.5 NAAQS in a 2012 memorandum to regional air directors. The memorandum was withdrawn in 2013 following a court decision. EPA expects emission reductions from national regulations to help states achieve attainment with the PM 2.5 NAAQS. The Clean Air Nonroad Diesel Rule, Regional Haze Regulations, NOx Emission Standard for New Commercial Aircraft Engines, and other emissions standards are part of the 1977 Clean Air Act amendments. New source review requirements apply to areas designated nonattainment or unclassifiable for NAAQS. The NSR program ensures new facilities or modifications comply with air quality standards. It includes permitting requirements for new major pollution sources and modifications to existing sources, with specific requirements based on PSD or nonattainment provisions. EPA has established rules for sources emitting PM 2.5 and its precursors, including SIP modifications for PM 2.5 emissions. The January 2013 final PM NAAQS includes revisions to the PSD permitting program to avoid delays and provide a grandfather provision for permit applications. The EPA established rules for sources emitting PM 2.5 and its precursors, including SIP modifications for PM 2.5 emissions. The January 2013 final PM NAAQS includes revisions to the PSD permitting program to avoid delays and provide a grandfather provision for permit applications. Permits with a \"grandfather\" provision are granted if the application was deemed complete by December 14, 2012, or if a draft permit was issued before the revised 2013 PM NAAQS went into effect. Transportation conformity is required to ensure federal funding for highway and transit projects align with air quality goals set by SIPs. EPA published a final rule amending these regulations on March 24, 2010. The EPA published a final rule on March 24, 2010, amending transportation conformity regulations to incorporate changes in PM 2.5 and PM 10 air quality standards. This rule also addresses hot-spot analyses for various pollutants in nonattainment areas. Additionally, a final rule was published on March 14, 2012, restructuring sections of the conformity rule to apply to new or revised NAAQS without the need for frequent amendments. States have 18 months from April 15, 2015, to comply with these changes. States have 18 months from April 15, 2015, to submit SIPs for the 2013 PM 2.5 NAAQS, with implementation required by December 2021. NAAQS decisions have historically been a significant concern for Congress due to health and cost implications. EPA's oversight of PM NAAQS regulations has faced scrutiny, with concerns raised by Congress and stakeholders regarding timely review and revision. The 2013 PM 2.5 NAAQS revisions prompted conflicting views, with some urging delay and others advocating for a stricter standard. Changes to NAAQS often lead to litigation and implementation delays. The final designations of nonattainment areas and implementation of the 2013 PM 2.5 NAAQS are expected to generate further interest and oversight. EPA has a chronology of NAAQS regulations for Total Suspended Particulates (TSP) and Particulate Matter (PM) from 1971 to 2013, with milestones driven by statutory requirements. The EPA outlined a schedule in a 2003 memorandum for implementing PM 2.5 standards. The agency follows the same process for tribes as for states, encouraging tribal input on NAAQS designations. EPA designated 12 tribal land areas adjacent to two areas in California as nonattainment for the 2013 annual PM 2.5 standard. The remaining 20 participating tribes, including the Pechanga Band of the Luiseno Mission Indians, were designated unclassified/nonattainment. EPA identified tribal lands areas in Indiana country as nonattainment based on their proximity to state counties in nonattainment areas. EPA designated tribal lands areas adjacent to two areas in California as nonattainment for the 2013 annual PM 2.5 standard. The final nonattainment area designations were published in January 2015 and subsequently amended in April 2015 based on more current air quality data. Three counties (or portions) out of 38 were designated nonattainment for the 2013 PM 2.5 annual standard. Five counties designated as nonattainment for the 2013 revised annual PM 2.5 standard were previously designated for the 24-hour standard. The remaining 30 counties were previously designated for the annual standard or both the annual and 24-hour PM 2.5 standards. EPA's final designations for the 2013 PM NAAQS do not identify areas violating the 24-hour PM 2.5 standard. The map shows areas violating the 24-hour PM 2.5 standard, with counties designated as nonattainment for the 1997 PM 2.5 NAAQS. No counties were designated nonattainment only for the 24-hour PM 2.5 standard."
