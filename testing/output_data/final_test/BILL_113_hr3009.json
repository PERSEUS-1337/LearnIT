    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Futures Investor Protection Act\" and establishes the Futures Investors Protection Fund. The Futures Investor Protection Corporation (FIPC) is a nonprofit corporation established under the Futures Investor Protection Act. It is a membership corporation for persons registered under the Commodity Exchange Act as futures commission merchants. The Futures Investor Protection Corporation (FIPC) conducts its business outside the United States and its territories. Commission reviews and additional members are determined in a similar way to the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC). Disclosure requirements for futures commission merchants are aligned with brokers and dealers under SIPA. The FIPC, similar to the SIPC, has all powers conferred on the SIPC. It has a Board of Directors responsible for determining policies governing its operations, consisting of 7 members appointed by the Secretary of the Treasury and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve. The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System appoints directors, with 5 directors chosen by the President with Senate approval. Three directors represent the futures industry, while two are selected from the general public. The President appoints a Chairman and Vice Chairman from directors selected from the general public who are not associated with the futures industry. Terms of appointment are specified. Each director is appointed for a 3-year term, with initial appointees serving staggered terms expiring in 2014, 2015, and 2016 as designated by the President. The Board members are appointed for staggered 3-year terms to avoid simultaneous expiration. Vacancies are filled in the same manner as the original appointment, with the new director serving until the successor takes office. The successor of the director has taken office. Compensation matters for directors are as provided in the bylaws of the FIPC. Meetings of the board and bylaws/rules follow SIPA guidelines. The FIPC establishes and manages an \"FIPC fund\" similar to the SIPC fund, including assessments on its members. The FIPC imposes assessments on its members following rules similar to the SIPC. Sections 5 through 16 of the SIPA apply to the FIPC, its members, directors, officers, and employees, as well as futures commission merchants and their affiliates, in the same way they apply to the SIPC and related entities. In this section, definitions are provided for terms such as Commission, contract market, futures contract, futures commission merchant, SIPA, and SIPC. The term \"SIPC fund\" refers to the fund established under section 4(a)(1) of the SIPA by the Protection Corporation. SEC. 4U. SUITABILITY RULES. The Commodity Exchange Act is amended to include new suitability rules. The Commodity Exchange Act is amended to include new suitability rules for futures commission merchants. Recommendations must be suitable for the customer based on their investment profile, including age, financial situation, investment objectives, and risk tolerance. The Commodity Exchange Act now includes suitability rules for futures commission merchants, requiring recommendations to align with the customer's investment profile, including age, financial situation, investment objectives, liquidity needs, and risk tolerance. A safe harbor provision applies to institutional accounts if the merchant believes the customer can assess investment risks independently and confirms they are using independent judgment. The term 'institutional account' is defined as an account held by a bank, insurance company, registered investment company, or investment adviser. If a customer with an institutional account delegates decision-making authority to an agent, the agent must exercise independent judgment in evaluating recommendations from the futures commission merchant. The Commission may impose sanctions on a person found to have violated the section, including censure, fines, expulsion, suspension, or cease and desist orders. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission may impose sanctions on a person found to have violated the section, including censure, fines, expulsion, suspension, or cease and desist orders. Additionally, the Commission may issue regulations within 6 months for the implementation of the sanctions. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission will review proof of claims rules, including account classes, pro rata shares, and valuation dates. A report will be submitted to Congress within a year with any recommended regulatory changes."
