    "content": "The National Bureau of Economic Research confirmed the recession started in December 2007, with a peak in December 2008. Economists identify recession phases to understand the economy better. Arthur Burns and Wesley Mitchell studied business cycles in 1946. Business cycles are fluctuations in aggregate economic activity of nations, consisting of expansions and recessions occurring at the same time in many economic activities. The National Bureau of Economic Research defines a recession as a significant decline in economic activity spread across the economy, lasting more than a few months. A recession is a significant decline in economic activity spread across the economy, lasting more than a few months. It begins after the economy reaches a peak and ends at the trough. Most recessions are brief and rare in recent decades. The generally accepted view among economists is that a recession is characterized by two consecutive quarterly declines in real GDP, although this rule does not always apply. The National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) is the authoritative organization for determining business cycle turning points. Founded in 1920, it focuses on macroeconomics, business cycles, and long-term growth. A separate business cycle dating committee, appointed by the NBER president, now determines the dates of economic swings. The NBER is responsible for determining recession dates, with members including Robert Hall, Martin Feldstein, Jeffrey Frankel, Robert J. Gordon, James Poterba, David Romer, and Victor Zarnowitz. GDP growth is a key economic indicator with quarterly statistics compiled. The NBER determines recession dates, with GDP growth as a key indicator. GDP data releases have a time lag, with revisions possible. Business cycle turning points are associated with months, not quarters, so the dating committee relies on monthly economic indicators. The dating committee determines recession dates using monthly economic indicators like personal income, employment, and industrial production. Different indicators may show changes at different times, with some, like housing starts and the stock market, slowing before a recession. Data compilation and volatility in indicators require time to establish trends accurately. The dating committee identifies recession dates using economic indicators like personal income, employment, and industrial production. Delays in data revision make it challenging to determine the start of a recession or expansion. The announcement of a recession ending can be delayed, with the longest delay being 21 months in March 1991. Economists study recessions individually and collectively to understand their unique characteristics and common aspects. Economists study recessions to advise policymakers on how to avoid them, but policymakers are more focused on the present and immediate future. There can be a significant delay between the onset of a recession and the official declaration, making timely policy measures crucial for mitigation. Policymakers may not adhere strictly to the definition of a recession as economic analysts do."
