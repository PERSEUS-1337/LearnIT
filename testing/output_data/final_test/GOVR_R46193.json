    "content": "The federal tax treatment of families is influenced by key elements of the income tax code, such as deductions, marginal tax rates, tax credits, and the alternative minimum tax. These provisions impact tax burdens based on family structure, including marital status, presence of children, and the number of children. The 2017 tax revision, known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, made significant changes to these provisions, but they are set to expire after 2025. The report examines temporary changes in the tax code affecting families, specifically those set to expire after 2025. It discusses structural changes made in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, equity issues, and the marriage penalty. The report does not cover other tax provisions like special treatment for certain types of income or additional benefits for specific groups. Taxes are determined by subtracting deductions and personal exemptions from income to calculate taxable income. The marginal rate structure is then applied, followed by subtracting tax credits to determine tax liability. Major credits include the earned income tax credit (EITC) and the child tax credit. The new law expanded the child credit but did not change the EITC. The law also adjusted exemption levels for the alternative minimum tax. The tax changes implemented in 2018 included revisions to the indexing for inflation using the chained consumer price index (CPI). This change mainly affected the EITC. Taxpayers can deduct either the standard deduction or itemized deductions based on their filing status. The standard deduction is beneficial for taxpayers, especially when itemized deductions are smaller. Under prior law, taxpayers could claim personal exemptions and child credits for children under 17. The child credit is partially refundable, limited to 15% of earned income over $3,000. The 2017 tax revision increased the standard deduction and maximum child credit amount while eliminating personal exemptions. It also raised the refundable portion of the child credit by increasing the maximum amount of the ACTC and reducing the earned income amount used to calculate it. Additionally, the revision increased the level at which the child credit is phased out, resulting in more income being exempt from tax for many taxpayers. The 2017 tax revision increased the standard deduction and child credit amounts, eliminated personal exemptions, and raised the phaseout level for the child credit. Higher-income families with children also benefited from these changes. The 2017 tax revision increased the standard deduction and child credit amounts, eliminated personal exemptions, and raised the phaseout level for the child credit. The child credit will not be adjusted for inflation, leading to a decline in real value over time. The tax change also restricted itemized deductions, including limiting the deduction for state and local taxes to $10,000 and reducing the cap on eligible mortgage interest. These amounts are not indexed for inflation. The 2017 tax revision increased the standard deduction and child credit amounts, restricted itemized deductions, and raised the phaseout level for the child credit. About 13% of taxpayers are expected to itemize deductions, with most being higher income. The earned income tax credit (EITC) is aimed at helping lower-income workers and is fully refundable, with the majority of benefits going to families with children. The EITC varies based on earnings and remains at its maximum level over a subsequent range. The Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) reaches its maximum level and remains constant over a range of earned income. It gradually phases out to zero at a fixed rate for each additional dollar of adjusted gross income above the phaseout amount threshold. The credit amount, earned income threshold, maximum credit, and phaseout threshold vary by number of children, with higher amounts for families with more children. In 2018, maximum credit amounts ranged from $519 to $6,431 based on the number of children. Married couples have a higher phaseout threshold than unmarried recipients. The 2017 tax revision slightly lowered the Earned Income Tax Credit's value, with the maximum credit for a family with three or more children reduced to $6,431. Taxpayers with no qualifying children must be between 25 and 64 years old to be eligible for the EITC. The revision also changed the statutory marginal tax rates and income ranges for different filing statuses. Married joint filers have a higher phaseout threshold for the EITC compared to unmarried filers. The tax revision changed the statutory marginal tax rates and income ranges for different filing statuses. Singles and heads of households are subject to higher tax rates at lower income levels compared to married couples. The 15% tax rate was reduced to 12%, with bracket widths for singles being less than half of those for married couples. The 2017 tax revisions reduced the top tax rate from 39.6% to 37% for joint returns with taxable income over $600,000. For singles, the top rate of 39.6% now applies to taxable income over $500,000. The alternative minimum tax rates and income thresholds were also revised. The 2017 tax revisions reduced the top tax rate and revised the alternative minimum tax rates and income thresholds. The AMT exemption amounts were increased for married couples and singles, with a higher rate applying to taxable income above certain thresholds. The AMT's basic structure remained unchanged, but other elements of the tax revision affected whether a taxpayer would be subject to the AMT. The 2017 tax revisions lowered the top tax rate and adjusted the alternative minimum tax (AMT) rates and income thresholds. Factors like lower regular tax rates, higher standard deductions, and AMT exemptions impact whether a taxpayer is subject to the AMT. Tax liabilities are reduced for higher income levels due to the reduction in marginal tax rates under the 2017 tax revision. The new income tax code is progressive, with tax rates rising as income increases. Higher-income groups tend to have the largest percentage increase in after-tax income under the 2017 tax revision. The new income tax is less progressive compared to the prior-law income tax, and the relative tax burden on low-income families is expected to increase over time. The new income tax code is less progressive, with higher-income individuals benefiting more from the 2017 tax revision. Low-income families will face an increased tax burden due to changes in inflation indexing and health care subsidies. High-income individuals will see decreased tax burdens, mainly due to lower taxes on capital income. The new income tax code is less progressive, benefiting higher-income individuals more. Low-income families will face increased tax burdens due to changes in inflation indexing and health care subsidies. Families with children will benefit more, primarily due to the expanded child credit. Comparing prior- and current-law breakeven levels shows varying impacts on different family types. For example, singles with no children saw a $750 increase in the income level at which taxes begin to be owed. Under the new income tax code, higher-income individuals benefit more while low-income families face increased tax burdens. Families with children benefit from the expanded child credit. For singles with no children, the income level at which taxes begin to be owed increased by $750. Married couples without children now start paying taxes at $24,000 compared to $21,300 under prior law, due to changes in personal exemptions and standard deductions. Under current law, the first $24,000 for families is tax-exempt due to the increased standard deduction. Families with children benefit from the expanded child credit, but may lose earned income tax credits as income rises. The increased standard deduction and child credits help offset the loss of earned income tax credits, but the benefit decreases as income rises. The child credit provides significant benefits for lower-income families, with the value increasing for families with three children. As income rises, the child credit continues to lower taxes, with the most significant impact seen at moderate income levels where tax rates are reduced. At higher income levels, lower tax rates also contribute to tax savings. Lower tax rates for different income levels result in lower taxes, especially for joint returns with taxable incomes over $300,000. Rates increase at higher levels before declining again, with larger rate reductions for joint returns between $156,150 and $316,000 and at incomes of $480,050 to $600,000. Taxpayers are less likely to pay the alternative minimum tax due to lower regular tax rates and increased AMT exemption. Itemized deductions for state and local taxes are smaller for taxpayers at the upper end of the distribution. At higher income levels, losing the full state and local tax deduction can increase tax burdens. The average state and local tax deduction is about 5% of income, equivalent to a two percentage point change in marginal tax rates. The increase in phaseout levels benefits high-income families with children, but the benefit diminishes as income rises. Overall, data on distributional effects show larger impacts at high income levels due to reductions in the tax burden on capital income. The tax change raised rates for certain portions of taxable income and lowered them for others, while also capping the state and local tax deduction. This section analyzes vertical and horizontal equity in tax rates across different types of families. The report analyzes vertical (tax rates based on income rise) and horizontal equity (tax rate changes for families with the same ability to pay) using effective tax rate calculations. An equivalency scale is used to determine income needed for the same standard of living across different family sizes. Adjustments are made based on research studies to ensure fairness, with smaller adjustments for children. The scale also considers common resource usage in families. The equivalency scale adjusts income needed for the same standard of living across different family sizes, considering common resource usage. Provisions in the calculations include tax deductions, exemptions, credits, and the alternative minimum tax. Table 6 and Table 7 report effective tax rates for low- and middle-income taxpayers at different income levels and family sizes. The rates reflect the taxes paid by families with the same standard of living. For example, a married couple with no children earning $25,000 pays 0.4% in taxes, while a couple with one child earning $30,844 receives a subsidy of 12.1%. Low-income families with children receive significant benefits from the income tax, with a subsidy of 12.1% of their income. Single individuals pay 2.2% of income in taxes. Effective tax rates are progressive, increasing as income increases. Tax rates change relatively little at the lowest income level. These calculations assume eligibility for the child credit and EITC. The tax burden varies across income levels, with significant reductions for families with children due to the child credit increase. Rates fall slightly for families without children as incomes rise. The pattern of tax burden by family size reflects interactions of earned income credit, child credit, and graduated rates. None of the examples in the tables are subject to the AMT. The tax burden varies across income levels, with significant reductions for families with children due to the EITC and child credit. Larger families receive the largest subsidies, but may eventually be penalized as their income increases. The new tax system retains and expands favorable treatment for families with children through most income levels. Larger families may be penalized as their income increases due to the declining value of child credit and personal exemptions. At very high income levels, tax rates converge towards a flat tax. Itemized deductions are assumed to be a constant fraction of income. The EITC has an inappropriate adjustment for family size, with the credit rate not being the same for all families. The child credit also favors families with children, especially in middle- and upper-middle-income levels. The tax system favors families with children by providing significant benefits, such as the child care credit and lower tax rates for married couples with children. Childless singles often face higher tax rates, reflecting efforts to eliminate marriage penalties. Additionally, married couples with one spouse staying at home benefit from imputed income, which is not included in measured economic transactions. The tax system favors families with children by providing benefits like the child care credit and lower tax rates for married couples with children. Imputed income, not taxed, benefits married couples with one spouse staying at home. Tax laws have shifted to reduce marriage penalties and expand bonuses, favoring marriage with significant bonuses. The new tax law addresses marriage penalties by adjusting rate structures and income levels, but introduces potential penalties at high income levels. This impacts incentives and equitable treatment of singles and married couples, with singles in middle-income brackets facing higher taxes compared to married couples. Singles with the same ability to pay face higher taxes than married couples, benefiting at lower income levels due to the earned income credit. Lower-income married taxpayers may experience marriage penalties. The new tax law addresses marriage penalties but introduces potential penalties at high income levels, impacting incentives and equitable treatment of singles and married couples. Single individuals living together have the same ability to pay as married couples but may face higher tax liabilities if one earns most of the income. Remaining single can result in higher tax burdens due to smaller deductions and narrower tax brackets. However, if income is evenly split, there can be a tax benefit from remaining single. Married couples have to combine their income, and while joint return brackets are wider, they are not twice as wide as those for single individuals. The earned income credit contains marriage penalties and bonuses, affecting tax rates for married and unmarried couples. Tables 8 and 9 compare average tax rates for different income splits, showing extremes of marriage penalties and bonuses. The earned income credit can result in marriage penalties and bonuses, impacting tax rates for couples. Uneven income splits for families with children can lead to different outcomes depending on claiming benefits. Marriage penalties and bonuses persist, with penalties absent in middle-income ranges for childless families. Lower income levels see both bonuses and penalties due to the earned income tax credit. Marriage penalties can occur due to unequal income splits in partnerships, leading to higher taxes for individuals with lower income. The tax rates are affected by smaller deductions and narrower rate brackets, especially in middle-income brackets. At high income levels, marriage penalties can also arise from not doubling rate brackets after the 12% bracket. Additionally, the deduction limit for state and local taxes is the same for married couples and individual taxpayers, potentially resulting in a loss of deductions for high-income couples. AMT exemptions for joint returns can retain marriage penalties. Penalties for marriage can vary at higher income levels due to factors such as the extension of rate brackets for singles versus joint returns, lower tax rates, and limits on state and local tax deductions. The impact on families with children is more complex, with some cases showing lower penalties for singles and higher penalties for married couples. The combination of factors can result in different tax rates for individuals and couples with children. The tax implications of marriage can result in a marriage bonus or penalty, depending on factors like the child credit and income split. The marriage penalty can be influenced by the head-of-household standard deduction, rate structure, and state/local tax deduction cap. Joint returns are generally favored, but the advantage diminishes if one partner cannot claim the child for tax benefits. When couples divorce, the mother usually has the child, resulting in a potential marriage bonus. If a couple never married and the child is only related to one parent, the mother, more likely to have low income, would claim the child. Low-income couples could benefit from the earned income credit, with the most common effect being a bonus. The potential marriage bonus is often seen when couples divorce, with the mother typically having custody of the child. Low-income couples may benefit from the earned income credit, resulting in a bonus. The size of the marriage penalty or bonus is difficult to determine in many cases, especially when considering factors like child custody and tax deductions. The 2017 tax revision continued to provide favorable treatment for families with children in lower and middle income levels. This treatment was maintained at the lowest incomes due to the effects of the EITC, and the refundable child tax credit further added to this favorable treatment. The child tax credit amount was increased, and the income level at which the credit is phased out was also increased, extending the favorable treatment to higher income classes. The 2017 tax revision favored joint returns over singles and heads of household at higher income levels due to the rate structure. Marriage bonuses were common across most income brackets, but penalties could occur at lower incomes, especially for families with children where the lower earner has custody. The rate structure also led to a potential marriage penalty at high income levels, exacerbated by the $10,000 limit on itemized deductions for state and local taxes for both married and single individuals."
