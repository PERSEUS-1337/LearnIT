The \"Lake Traverse Reservation Heirship Act of 2007\" defines a small fractional interest as an undivided trust or restricted interest in a parcel of land within the reservation that represents less than 5 percent of the total ownership and does not exceed 2.5 acres. Small fractional interests do not pass by intestate succession under the Act unless specified in subsection (c). The \"Lake Traverse Reservation Heirship Act of 2007\" specifies that small fractional interests can only be devised to eligible devisees, including the Tribe or enrolled members prior to final probate order. If not devised, the interest passes to the Tribe to be held in trust by the United States. The small fractional interest of a decedent without a surviving spouse passes to an enrolled member of the Tribe before final probate order. A devise of a small fractional interest is only valid if the devisee is eligible and the will is approved by the Secretary of the Interior. The Act of June 25, 1910 governs the descent of small fractional interests, passing to surviving children or grandchildren of the decedent based on eligibility.
