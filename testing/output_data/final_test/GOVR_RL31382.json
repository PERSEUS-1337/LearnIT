    "content": "Expulsion is a disciplinary action taken by the House of Representatives to remove a Member from membership by a two-thirds vote. It is different from exclusion, which denies a Member-elect their seat for failing to meet constitutional qualifications or being duly elected. Expulsion from the United States Congress is not a disciplinary procedure but a process for misconduct, requiring a two-thirds vote. Unlike impeachment for executive and judicial officers, expulsion is a simplified legislative process done by either the House or Senate alone, without trial or conviction. The Constitution and Framers did not impose limitations on Congress's power to expel a Member, requiring only a two-thirds vote. Justice Joseph Story noted the difficulty in distinguishing expulsion from other punishments for misconduct. The Supreme Court of the United States has found expansive authority within each house of Congress for expulsion of a Member for misconduct inconsistent with their duty, even if not a statutory offense. Expulsion is generally reserved for the most serious cases. Expulsion in the House of Representatives is a disciplinary action reserved for serious violations, typically involving disloyalty to the Union or criminal conduct. Only five Members have been expelled in history, with the most recent being Representative James A. Traficant, Jr., in 2002 for bribery. Representative James A. Traficant, Jr., of Ohio, was expelled from the House on July 24, 2002, due to a 10-count federal conviction for receiving favors, gifts, and money in exchange for official acts, as well as salary kickbacks from staff. Some Members facing serious misconduct allegations choose to resign before expulsion, as House committees have recommended. Some Members facing misconduct allegations either resign before committee recommendations or lose their next election. The framers of the Constitution believed reelection was the best way to regulate Representatives' conduct. Madison emphasized the importance of Members' dependence on the people through frequent elections. The power of Congress to expel Members is within their discretion. While Congress has the authority to expel members, policy considerations have generally restrained the House from doing so for past misconduct, questioning the wisdom of such actions rather than a lack of constitutional power. The House's reluctance to expel a Member for past misconduct, even after reelection by constituents, reflects deference to the popular will. Justice Story and Cushing emphasized the need for caution in using the power to expel, as it can be seen as subversive of the people's rights. The House's power to expel a Member is essential to remove corrupt individuals, but it must be used judiciously to respect the will of the constituents. The House's power to expel a Member should be used judiciously and with caution, especially in cases where misconduct was public knowledge before the Member's election. The power of expulsion from the House of Representatives should be used cautiously to avoid undermining representative government by supplanting the electorate's judgment. Expulsion carries no automatic penalties beyond removal from Congress. Expulsion from Congress carries no further penalties beyond removal from office. The United States Constitution sets the qualifications for congressional office as age, citizenship, and inhabitancy in the state, which cannot be altered by Congress or individual states. Expelled members can run for reelection and cannot be excluded from being seated in Congress based solely on past misconduct. Expelled members of Congress do not lose their federal government pension automatically. Pensions are forfeited only upon conviction of certain federal offenses related to espionage, treason, or national security. Members convicted of these offenses lose their pensions under the \"Hiss Act.\" Members of Congress convicted of specific criminal offenses related to public corruption, campaign finance laws, or fraud during their public service will lose credit for their congressional service towards a federal pension. The Supreme Court has granted Congress broad discretion to discipline its Members without judicial review, carried out through House rulemaking authority. The disciplinary process lacks the protective shields of a criminal case, as noted in United States v. Brewster. The House of Representatives has a process for expelling Members, overseen by the House Committee on Ethics, which can receive complaints and initiate investigations into a Member's conduct. The process lacks the protective shields of a criminal case, with no established right of review for the accused Member. The House of Representatives has a process overseen by the House Committee on Ethics to investigate Members' conduct. In 2008, an independent Office of Congressional Ethics was established to look into misconduct allegations. This office can refer matters to the House Committee on Ethics for further investigation and recommendations. The committee can investigate allegations with the authority of the chairman and ranking Member or through an investigative subcommittee. The House no longer waits for all appeals to be exhausted in a criminal conviction before proceeding on a matter concerning a Member. The House Committee on Ethics can investigate Members' conduct based on factual findings of criminal convictions, even before all legal appeals are exhausted. Automatic jurisdiction is granted when a Member is convicted of a felony, and disciplinary proceedings can begin even if a trial ends in a hung jury. The committee is authorized to investigate violations of any applicable laws or standards of conduct. The House Committee on Ethics can investigate Members' conduct based on factual findings of criminal convictions, even before all legal appeals are exhausted. Automatic jurisdiction is granted when a Member is convicted of a felony, and disciplinary proceedings can begin even if a trial ends in a hung jury. The committee is authorized to investigate violations of any applicable laws or standards of conduct, and after investigation, the committee reports its findings and recommendations. Detailed procedural rules ensure fairness in the disciplinary process, including notice, specification of charges, and opportunities for the charged Member to be heard and present evidence. If the Member is found guilty by the majority of committee members, appropriate discipline, including expulsion, may be recommended. The House Committee on Ethics can investigate Members' conduct based on factual findings of criminal convictions. If the committee finds that expulsion is warranted, a recommendation is made to the full House of Representatives. Censure, reprimand, or admonition are traditional ways in which parliamentary bodies discipline their members. A \"censure\" in the House of Representatives is a formal vote disapproving a Member's conduct, often followed by a verbal rebuke. The House of Representatives can discipline its Members through censure, reprimand, or admonition for misconduct that reflects discredit on the institution, even if it occurs outside of Congress. The Constitution allows for expulsion of a Member for disorderly behavior, but the authority to discipline through censure has been accepted in congressional practice. The House of Representatives has the authority to discipline its Members through censure for misconduct that reflects discredit on the institution. This power is discretionary and can be enforced by summary proceedings, with the requirement of a two-thirds vote for expulsion. Censure has been deemed appropriate in cases of breaching the privileges of the House, affecting its safety, dignity, and integrity of proceedings. The House of Representatives has the authority to discipline its Members through censure for misconduct that reflects discredit on the institution. Censure cases have involved unparliamentary language, assaults, insults, offensive resolutions, and corrupt acts. The House's discretionary power to punish disorderly behavior is appropriate for misconduct related to official duties, noncooperation with committees, or acts bringing the House into disrepute. The House has shown reticence to expel Members for misconduct in previous Congresses. The House of Representatives has the authority to discipline its Members through censure for misconduct that reflects discredit on the institution. In past instances, the House has censured Members for various offenses, with a statute of limitations restricting investigations to the last three Congresses unless directly related to more recent violations. There have been 23 censures of Members, including former Members, in the history of the House. In the history of the House of Representatives, there have been 23 censures of Members, including former Members, for various offenses such as financial misconduct, assault, supporting the Confederacy, bribery, and payroll fraud. The majority of censures occurred in the 19th century and involved issues of decorum or violence towards other Members. The House of Representatives has censured Members for offenses like financial improprieties, improper gifts, sexual misconduct, and misuse of campaign funds. There are no specific consequences outlined in House Rules for censure, but the political shame often leads Members to resign before facing formal discipline. The two political parties in the House have their own internal rules regarding censure. The House of Representatives has internal party rules that bar censured Members from certain leadership positions. Before the 1970s, \"reprimand\" and \"censure\" were often used interchangeably in resolutions. The distinction now is that a \"reprimand\" implies a lesser disapproval than a \"censure.\" The term \"reprimand\" is a less severe rebuke than a \"censure\" in the House of Representatives. It involves a verbal admonition by the Speaker of the House or adoption of a resolution by a vote of the House. Ten House Members have been reprimanded for various misconducts. Members have been reprimanded by the full House for a range of misconduct, including failure to disclose personal interests, misrepresentations to committees, misuse of political influence, and misuse of official resources. The House of Representatives can issue a \"reprimand\" or \"censure\" for misconduct, which may also include additional actions like fines or loss of privileges. The House of Representatives has the authority to levy fines against its Members for disciplinary matters, in addition to other sanctions like expulsion, censure, or loss of privileges. This authority is derived from the House's constitutional power to determine its rules and punish misconduct. The Supreme Court recognized Congress's power to fine its Members in cases of misconduct, citing the Constitution's grant of authority to punish disorderly behavior. Fines for disciplinary purposes in the House and Senate are rare, with examples including a $25,000 fine imposed on a Member in 1969 for various offenses. In 1979, a censured House Member was required to repay unjustly obtained amounts. The House has imposed monetary penalties on Members for misconduct, such as a $40,031.66 demand promissory note, a $10,000 fine, and repayment of $59,063 for improper gifts and campaign fund misuse. These actions were not always labeled as \"fines\" but were disciplinary measures. In disciplinary cases, Members of Congress were required to make restitution for misused funds, not necessarily labeled as \"fines.\" The penalties imposed were for repayment or restitution, not solely for punishment purposes. This aligns with current House Committee on Ethics Rules guidance on recommending fines. The House Committee on Ethics Rules recommends fines for violations related to personal financial benefit, but it is not required to be connected to unjust enrichment. The Committee's guidance allows for other sanctions besides fines, and there is debate over the authority to suspend or disqualify members by a simple majority vote. The House Committee on Ethics Rules recommends fines for violations related to personal financial benefit, but there is debate over the authority to suspend or disqualify members by a simple majority vote. The House's authority to require a Member to disqualify themselves from voting has traditionally been questioned, and such \"recusal\" has been left to the discretion of the Member. Jefferson's Manual and Rules of the House of Representatives state that there is no authority in the House to deprive a Member of the right to vote. The House of Representatives traditionally leaves the decision for a Member to disqualify themselves from voting to the Member's discretion. The Speaker has denied the authority to deprive a Member of the right to vote, stating that it is the Member's responsibility to determine. In the 94th Congress, a rule was adopted suggesting that Members convicted of certain crimes should refrain from participation in voting and committee work. In the 94th Congress, a rule was adopted suggesting that Members convicted of certain crimes should refrain from voting and committee work until there has been a judicial or administrative reinstatement of their presumption of innocence, or until they are reelected. The provision was worded in a discretionary manner to avoid being unconstitutional and depriving the district of representation. Members are advised to adhere to the Rules of the House and the Code of Official Conduct. Members of the House are expected to adhere to the Rules of the House, including the abstention provision. A \"Letter of Reproval\" issued by the House Committee on Ethics enforces standards of conduct and is publicly disclosed as part of an investigation report. This administrative action can be issued by the committee without full House approval, distinguishing it from legislative discipline or sanctions. A \"Letter of Reproval\" from the House Committee on Ethics enforces conduct standards and is an alternative to sanctions by the full House for infractions that do not warrant legislative action. It can be issued by the committee without full House approval. The House Ethics Committee may issue a \"Letter of Reproval\" as a form of rebuke for misconduct by a member. This letter is issued by the committee on behalf of the House of Representatives and is given after a violation has been proven. Examples of misconduct that have resulted in Letters of Reproval include improper use of campaign funds for personal loans and borrowing campaign funds for personal use without adequate disclosure. The House Ethics Committee issued a Letter of Reproval for misconduct involving borrowing campaign funds for personal use and inadequate disclosure. The Member was found to have brought discredit to the House by misusing official resources, staff for campaign purposes, and improperly benefiting businesses with campaign funds. In 2014, the Ethics Committee issued Letters of Reproval to three Members of the House for various misconduct, including improper expenditure of campaign funds for personal benefit, interference with investigations, and receiving improper gifts. The Ethics Committee issued a \"Letter of Reproval\" for receiving improper gifts, misusing campaign funds, and failing to disclose gifts. Other actions taken included advising corrective action and noting violations of House Rules. In 1990, the committee publicly disapproved of a Member's behavior. In 2004, the committee issued a public admonishment of three Members. In 2006, a Member's actions regarding intercepted phone recordings were criticized. In 2010, a Member was admonished for accepting gifts in violation of House rules. In 2012, the Ethics Committee found a violation of House Rules by a Member who used her official position for her husband's medical practice. The investigative subcommittee recommended a reproval of the Member. The Ethics Committee has previously publicly admonished Members for similar conduct. The Ethics Committee has taken various administrative actions, including issuing a \"letter of admonition\" to a Member based on a complaint filed by another Member. This action was different from a formal \"Letter of Reproval\" and was a method of resolving the complaint without a full investigation. The Ethics Committee resolved a complaint by sending a letter to the Member without further investigation."
