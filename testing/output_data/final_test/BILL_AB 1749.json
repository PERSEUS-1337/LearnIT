    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 21080.06 of the Public Resources Code exempts the City of Porterville from certain regulations for a water project chosen as the best option after a feasibility study. The project could involve building water treatment facilities, advanced recycling facilities, or upgrading existing wastewater treatment facilities. Section 21168.11 is added to the Public Resources Code, defining the terms \"lead agency\" as the City of Porterville and \"water treatment project\" as a project chosen after a feasibility study to address water scarcity in East Porterville. The project may involve constructing satellite water treatment facilities near existing water distribution lines. This section will be in effect until January 1, 2021, unless extended or repealed by a later statute enacted before that date. The City of Porterville plans to construct an advanced water recycling treatment facility either adjacent to the existing wastewater treatment facility or at a preferred location determined by a feasibility study. Upgrades to the city's wastewater treatment facility will allow for tertiary treatment. The environmental impact report for the project must include a notice in not less than 12-point type. The EIR for the water recycling treatment facility project is subject to Section 21168.11 of the Public Resources Code, which states that the lead agency is not required to consider comments filed after the public comment period. Approval of the project is subject to the procedures outlined in the Public Resources Code. Section 21168.11 is included in the EIR's appendix. The draft and final environmental impact reports must include the full text of this section. Within 10 days of releasing the draft report, the lead agency must hold an informational workshop. A public hearing must be held within 10 days before the end of the comment period, with a transcript included in the final report. Within five days after the public comment period, a commenter on the draft environmental impact report can request nonbinding mediation. The lead agency must participate in mediation with all timely commenters who requested it, and mediation must end within 35 days. Mediators must be retired judges or experts with experience in land use and environmental law or science. Each area of dispute raised in comments must be mediated separately. The lead agency must adopt agreed-upon measures as a condition of approval, and commenters cannot challenge the decision based on those measures. Written comments after the public comment period will only be considered if they address new issues or information released by the public agency. The lead agency must adopt agreed-upon measures as a condition of approval, and commenters cannot challenge the decision based on those measures. Changes made to the project after the public comment period, proposed conditions for approval, new information not known during the public comment period, and the filing of required notices are all part of the process. The lead agency is responsible for preparing and certifying the record of the proceedings. The lead agency must make the draft environmental impact report and related documents available to the public in an electronic format within three business days of release. Any new documents prepared after the draft report's release must also be accessible within five business days. The lead agency is required to make the draft environmental impact report and related documents available electronically within three business days of release. Copyright protected documents not prepared specifically for the project do not need to be electronically accessible, but an index of these documents must be available electronically by the release of the draft report or within five business days if received later. This index should specify where hardcopies of the copyrighted materials can be reviewed by the public. The lead agency must convert non-electronic comments into electronic format within seven days and make them available to the public. Comments not considered by the lead agency do not need to be included in the record of proceedings. Within five days of filing the notice, the lead agency must certify and provide an electronic copy of the proceedings record to a party upon request. A reasonable fee may be charged for the copy. Within 10 days of receiving a complaint or petition, the lead agency must lodge a copy of the certified record with the superior court. Any disputes over the record content will be resolved by the superior court, with parties required to file a motion to augment the record if necessary. The Legislature declares the necessity of a special law due to drought conditions in Porterville, with over 600 homes lacking water. An urgency statute is enacted to expedite the construction of water treatment facilities and pipelines to address the state of emergency declared by the Governor."
