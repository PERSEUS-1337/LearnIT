    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Protecting Consumers' Access to Credit Act of 2017\". Congress recognizes the contractual doctrine of valid when made in lending agreements, stating that a loan valid at inception cannot become usurious upon subsequent sale. This principle has been a cornerstone of US banking law for nearly 200 years, as established in the case Nichols v. Fearson. In 2016, the Solicitor General, in consultation with Federal banking regulators, filed an amicus brief on this matter. The amicus brief filed by Federal banking regulators in the case of Midland Funding, LLC v. Madden criticized the Second Circuit's analysis as incorrect and reflecting a misunderstanding of the National Bank Act. The brief highlighted the importance of the valid-when-made doctrine in enhancing liquidity in credit markets and reducing the cost of credit to borrowers. The Madden v. Midland decision disproportionately affects low- and moderate-income individuals with lower FICO scores. Without reaffirming the valid-when-made doctrine, access to safe and affordable financial services will decrease, leading to households seeking nontransparent and noncompliant financial products. SEC. 3. RATE OF INTEREST AFTER TRANSFER OF LOAN. Amendments to the Revised Statutes and the Home Owners' Loan Act state that a loan's maximum interest rate remains valid even if the loan is sold or transferred to a third party, allowing enforcement by the third party despite any conflicting state laws. Amendments to various federal acts ensure that a loan's maximum interest rate remains valid when sold or transferred to a third party, allowing enforcement by the third party regardless of conflicting state laws. Amendments to federal acts ensure that a loan's maximum interest rate remains valid when sold or transferred to a third party, allowing enforcement by the third party regardless of conflicting state laws. The Act does not limit the authority of various financial regulatory agencies."
