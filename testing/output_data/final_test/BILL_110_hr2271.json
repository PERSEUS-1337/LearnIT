    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Unlawful Employers Accountability and Illegal Alien State Reimbursement Act of 2007\" and focuses on compliance regarding the unlawful employment of aliens. The paragraph discusses an amendment to the Immigration and Nationality Act regarding civil penalties for hiring, recruiting, and referral violations related to unauthorized aliens. The Secretary of Homeland Security can require violators to cease and desist from violations and pay a civil penalty based on the number of unauthorized aliens involved. The amendment to the Immigration and Nationality Act imposes civil penalties for violations related to unauthorized aliens. The penalty varies based on the number of unauthorized aliens involved, ranging from $5,000 for one alien to $15,000 for 11 to 25 aliens. For violations involving unauthorized aliens, civil penalties range from $15,000 for 25 aliens to $50,000 for over 75 aliens. The costs of removal for aliens based on findings from penalties incurred will be added to the penalty amount specified. In cases where distinct subdivisions of a person or entity independently handle hiring, recruiting, or referring for employment, each subdivision is considered separate. Section 274A of the Act is amended to deny agricultural assistance to violators of certain subsections. The Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural Worker Protection Act states that entities violating certain subsections will be ineligible for agricultural assistance for up to 5 years. Section 274A of the Immigration and Nationality Act is amended to remove subsections (a)(3) and (b)(6), with conforming amendments made to subsection (a)(5) and (b). The Secretary of Homeland Security must maintain a public website listing entities violating immigration laws in the past 5 years. The Secretary of Homeland Security must provide information on entities violating immigration laws, including names, addresses, owners, number of unauthorized aliens employed, and federal contract amounts received in the past 5 years. Effective date for amendments is 30 days after enactment. The Secretary of Homeland Security can debar repeat violators of immigration laws from receiving federal contracts for 5 years. This amendment applies to contracts entered into after 90 days from the enactment of the Act. SEC. 4. REIMBURSING STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS FOR COSTS OF SERVING ILLEGAL ALIENS. The Secretary will make payments to eligible States from the Illegal Alien State Reimbursement Fund within 30 days after the fiscal year ends. This Fund is established in the Treasury of the United States for reimbursing States for costs related to serving illegal aliens. The Secretary will credit eligible States' separate accounts within the Fund with amounts received from employers of unauthorized aliens for violations of immigration laws. The allocation method varies based on whether the violation occurred in a single eligible State or multiple eligible States. The Secretary will divide the amount among eligible States where the violation occurred and credit each State equally. Payments received must be used for assisting State and local governments with costs related to serving unlawfully present aliens. An eligible State must redistribute 66 percent of the payment received to counties and local governments within 60 days. The State must develop a system for input from all counties and units of local government to target areas of greatest need. Eligible State is defined as a State that agrees to use the payment received for assisting with costs related to serving unlawfully present aliens. The State receiving payment must use it for specified purposes, redistribute it to counties and local governments, ensure recipients use it as intended, and provide required information to the Secretary. The term \"State\" includes various regions such as states, territories, and the District of Columbia. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of the Treasury. This section will take effect at the beginning of the next fiscal year after the enactment of this Act in Samoa, Guam, and the United States Virgin Islands."
