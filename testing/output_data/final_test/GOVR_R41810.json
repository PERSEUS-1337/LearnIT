Lawsuits have challenged agencies' decisions to insource functions, raising concerns about compliance with civil service, ethics, and small business laws. This report outlines key legal issues related to insourcing initiatives. The federal government has consistently promoted the use of the private sector for commercial products and services since 1955. The George W. Bush Administration emphasized this policy through \"competitive sourcing,\" which raised concerns about shifting work to contractors. In response, the 109th Congress directed the Secretary of Defense to address these concerns. The 109th Congress enacted legislation directing the Secretary of Defense to prescribe guidelines for considering using government employees for work currently performed under DOD contracts. This includes functions closely associated with inherently governmental tasks, non-competitively awarded contracts, or poorly performed tasks by contractors. Subsequent Congresses expanded these requirements to include consideration for new functions as well. The 111th Congress imposed requirements on civilian agencies to consider using government employees for functions that had been contracted out. President Obama's initiatives and memorandum on government contracting promoted insourcing of certain functions previously outsourced. DOD and OMB issued guidance on insourcing following these actions. The OMB and DOD issued guidance on insourcing following President Obama's initiatives to promote the use of government employees for functions previously outsourced. This included developing insourcing plans, conducting human capital analyses, and being alert to excessive reliance on contractors. The President's FY2011 budget submissions reiterated the need for agencies to control their operations and accomplish missions without excessive contractor reliance. The Secretary of the Army testified in February 2010 about the Army's intentions to address this issue. The Secretary of the Army testified in February 2010 about insourcing initiatives to bring back positions to the Army. Some critics viewed the initiatives as quota-driven, leading to lawsuits alleging non-compliance with policies. While federal agencies have discretion in determining their requirements, legal constraints may affect insourcing decisions. The provisions in place limit activities of former contractor employees hired by the federal government, including adherence to the Administrative Procedure Act, contract law, civil service law, and ethics law. Small business law is not implicated in these restrictions. The Obama Administration has implemented policies to give small businesses special consideration in insourcing decisions, prioritizing them for work that remains in the private sector. Agency personnel ceilings do not limit insourcing decisions, as they pertain to personnel, not functions. The Obama Administration prioritizes small businesses for work remaining in the private sector, while agency personnel ceilings do not restrict insourcing decisions. Insourcing functions can be returned in-house without hiring new personnel, potentially constrained by the Administrative Procedure Act. The Obama Administration prioritizes small businesses for work remaining in the private sector, while agency personnel ceilings do not restrict insourcing decisions. Insourcing functions can be returned in-house without hiring new personnel, potentially constrained by the Administrative Procedure Act. Guidelines not based in statutes or regulations may be legally binding if the agency intended to be bound or employed the guidelines in a binding manner. No court has directly addressed the legality of non-statutory guidelines used in insourcing initiatives. The litigation surrounding challenges to insourcing determinations has focused on jurisdictional issues and standing requirements. Early cases debated whether the Court of Federal Claims or federal district courts had jurisdiction over such challenges. Additionally, questions arose regarding whether challenges to insourcing determinations are moot after a vendor's contract expires. The APA's waiver of sovereign immunity for suits in federal district courts was a key point of contention. The government's sovereign immunity in federal district courts is limited and does not apply if another statute grants consent to suit. The Tucker Act, amended by the ADRA of 1996, gives the U.S. Court of Federal Claims exclusive jurisdiction over challenges to federal agency solicitations or contract awards. Key questions include whether plaintiffs challenging insourcing determinations are \"interested parties.\" The Court of Federal Claims has exclusive jurisdiction over challenges to insourcing determinations if plaintiffs are \"interested parties\" and determinations are made in connection with procurements or proposed procurements. Most courts have found that challenges fall within this jurisdiction because some contractors are interested parties and determinations are related to proposed procurements. In Rothe Development, Inc. v. Department of Defense, the Fifth Circuit upheld a district court decision that a contractor was an interested party due to its direct economic interest in potential contracts. The court relied on the definition of \"interested party\" from the Competition in Contracting Act, which applies for Tucker Act purposes. The Fifth Circuit also affirmed that insourcing determinations are crucial in procurement decisions. The Fifth Circuit affirmed that insourcing determinations are considered part of the procurement process under the Tucker Act. This decision highlights the jurisdiction of the Court of Federal Claims over challenges to insourcing determinations. The Court of Federal Claims has exclusive jurisdiction over challenges to insourcing determinations, as affirmed by the Fifth Circuit. In a recent case, Dellew Corporation v. United States, the court found that incumbent contractors have a direct economic interest in insourcing decisions, making them interested parties under the Competition in Contracting Act. The Dellew court found that insourcing determinations are considered a \"procurement\" under the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act. One federal district court has jurisdiction over challenges to insourcing determinations, as they are not within the Court of Federal Claim's jurisdiction under the Administrative Dispute Resolution Act. The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma ruled that a contractor challenging an insourcing determination is not an \"interested party\" under the Competition in Contracting Act. The court found that an insourcing determination is not considered a procurement under the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act, as it begins with determining a need for property or services, not whether there is a need. The term \"acquisition\" was highlighted as a critical concept within the definition of procurement. The U.S. District Court ruled that challenges to agency insourcing determinations are not within its jurisdiction, as insourcing is not considered a procurement under the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act. The court emphasized that waivers of sovereign immunity are construed narrowly. The U.S. District Court ruled that challenges to agency insourcing determinations are not within its jurisdiction, as insourcing is not considered a procurement under the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act. The Court of Federal Claims has exclusive jurisdiction over challenges to insourcing determinations, with differing opinions on whether contractors must meet prudential standing requirements. The Court of Federal Claims has exclusive jurisdiction over challenges to insourcing determinations, with differing opinions on whether contractors must meet prudential standing requirements to determine if they are within the zone of interests protected by statutes pertaining to insourcing. The Court of Federal Claims has exclusive jurisdiction over challenges to insourcing determinations. The government argued that contractors must meet prudential standing requirements to challenge insourcing decisions, citing statutes from the Ike Skelton National Defense Authorization Act. However, the court disagreed, stating that prudential standing is not required in bid protests under the Administrative Dispute Resolution Act. The Court of Federal Claims has exclusive jurisdiction over challenges to insourcing determinations. Contractors challenging insourcing decisions may possess standing as the Ike Skelton NDAA was enacted for the benefit of the contracting community. However, in Hallmark-Phoenix 3, LLC v. United States, the court dismissed a contractor's challenge to the Air Force's insourcing determination on prudential standing grounds, citing Supreme Court precedents and earlier bid protest decisions. The contractor was found not to be within the \"zone of interests\" protected by relevant statutes. The Court of Federal Claims dismissed a contractor's challenge to an insourcing determination on prudential standing grounds, stating that the contractor was not within the \"zone of interests\" protected by relevant statutes. The court noted that the statutes were intended to be enforced by Congress, not the courts, and did not confer a right to judicial review upon contractors. The Triad Logistics court had reservations about the plaintiff contractor's standing within the zone of interests protected by statutes in bid protests. The Elmendorf Support Services Joint Venture case viewed prudential standing requirements as applicable but found the plaintiffs satisfied them. The Elmendorf court found that a contractor had standing in a bid protest lawsuit because the procurement process was flawed, and the contractor's interests aligned with the purposes of the statute. The court noted that Congress enacted laws to compare costs of work between government personnel and contractors, limiting the government's ability to bring services in-house. This created a competitive incentive for contractors to ensure proper calculations. The competitive incentive for contractors to ensure proper calculations creates an impulse to expose government actions. The Court of Federal Claims has addressed questions regarding standing for vendors challenging insourcing determinations, framing it as a mootness issue. This doctrine stems from the \"case or controversy\" requirement of the U.S. Constitution. The court found that if contracts are expired or parties lack a legal interest, the case is moot. In Triad Logistics, the court distinguished between vendors with current contracts and those whose contracts had expired, ruling that the plaintiff lacked standing. The situation in Santa Barbara was different as the vendor had an ongoing contract, while in Triad Logistics, the contract had expired before insourcing. In Elmendorf Support Services, incumbency was deemed necessary. In Elmendorf Support Services, incumbency was found to be necessary for standing, with the court noting that vendors with expired contracts cannot claim damages for improper insourcing. The court also stated that a declaration of agency wrongdoing without an injunction would not benefit the vendor, especially after the work has been absorbed by the agency. The recent decision from the Court of Federal Claims in Dellew Corporation limits agencies' ability to terminate contracts to avoid challenges to insourcing determinations. This case arose from the Air Force's decision to insource services previously provided by the plaintiff. The Court of Federal Claims found that the plaintiff had standing to challenge the termination of their contract by the Air Force for convenience, despite the contract being terminated in the middle of an option period. The court also mentioned the possibility of ordering a return to the pre-termination status quo in certain circumstances. However, the contractor was not entitled to such an order in this case due to key statutory provisions. The court found that cost savings were not a factor in the insourcing determination, which required DOD employees to be the most cost-effective provider. Despite errors in cost calculations, considerable savings were still evident. Jurisdictional questions remain unresolved, and courts may need to determine which insourcing guidelines constrain agency actions. Some guidelines are binding, while others may not be. Courts may need to determine if agency guidelines are legally binding, especially those not based in statutes or regulations. The issue of whether agencies intended to be bound by guidelines or used them in a binding manner is crucial in enforcing agency statements and policies under the APA. While one court assumed DOD's guidance on cost estimation was legally binding, other courts may find certain guidelines non-binding or not requiring specific procedures. In Labat-Anderson, Inc. v. United States, the contractor claimed that DOD improperly insourced functions without following required procedures for cost comparison. The Court found that OMB Circular A-76 requirements were only binding if incorporated into agency regulations, and DOD regulations did not specify procedures for cost comparisons. The agency was found to have complied with the requirements in 10 U.S.C. Section 2462. The court found that the agency complied with 10 U.S.C. Section 2462 requirements, but not with OMB Circular A-76 requirements. Executive Order 12615 did not bind the executive branch, and courts may have differing opinions on insourcing guidelines. The government may need to delay insourcing to allow current contracts to expire. The government may need to delay insourcing to allow current contracts to expire, or face liability for breach of contract. This issue is likely with \"requirements contracts,\" where the buyer promises to purchase all requirements from the seller. Developing in-house capacity can help fulfill these contracts. Developing additional in-house capacity to perform functions specified in a contract could raise legal issues depending on the contract terms. If the contract allows the contractor to supply goods or services required by the government, in-house capacity can be developed. However, if the contract limits the contractor to supplying goods or services beyond the activity's capabilities at the time of contracting, developing in-house capacity may be precluded during the contract term. The Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals found that a contractor was entitled to an equitable adjustment under its contract when the procuring activity developed additional in-house capacity, leading to the contractor's services not being used. Similarly, in another case, the Board granted recovery to a contractor for painting work when the government started using its own personnel due to cost reasons. The government cannot arbitrarily develop and use capabilities at the expense of a contractor. Civil service laws may also limit agencies from implementing insourcing. The government implements insourcing through competitive processes based on merit, limiting the ability to hire contractors on the spot. Direct hire authority is required for certain positions, such as Federal Acquisition positions, under the National Defense Authorization Act. Other positions generally lack this authority. Government agencies generally lack direct hire authority for positions other than Federal Acquisition positions, limiting their ability to hire contractor employees. Civil service laws protect the government hiring process and applicants, not employers concerned about losing employees to government positions. No-solicitation clauses in federal contracts could prevent one party from hiring the employees of its vendors. The federal government lacks direct hire authority for positions other than Federal Acquisition positions, limiting their ability to hire contractor employees. No-solicitation clauses in federal contracts could prevent one party from hiring the employees of its vendors. Federal ethics and conflict of interest laws do not necessarily prevent the employment of individuals from the private sector by a federal agency, as long as certain limitations are observed. Federal employees and officials are subject to ethics and conflict of interest laws to prevent personal conflicts of interest and ensure loyalty to the public interest. The main method to address conflicts of interest is through disqualification or recusal requirements, prohibiting officials from participating in matters where they have a financial interest. The interest provision criminal statute targets current financial interests, not past affiliations or previous representations. Regulatory recusal requirements may apply to certain past affiliations in specific circumstances. Recusals are necessary for matters involving parties previously affiliated with the official. The one-year recusal requirement applies to matters involving a person for whom the employee has served in various capacities within the last year. This requirement applies to any officer or employee of the executive branch and is narrowly focused on specific parties in a particular matter. It includes contracts, investigations, or prosecutions involving specifically identified individuals or parties. The Office of Government Ethics regulations impose a two-year recusal requirement on executive branch officials who have received an \"extraordinary payment\" exceeding $10,000 from a former employer before entering government. This restriction applies to participating in matters where the former employer is involved. The Office of Government Ethics regulations require a two-year recusal for executive branch officials who receive an extraordinary payment exceeding $10,000 from a former employer before entering government service. This restriction applies to involvement in matters related to the former employer. Additionally, there are further restrictions on presidential appointees, including the signing of an ethics pledge by all appointees to full-time, non-career positions in the executive branch. The \"ethics pledge\" imposes additional restrictions on presidential appointees entering the executive branch, particularly those with confidential or policy-making roles. They must recuse themselves for two years from matters involving their former employers or clients. Former lobbyists turned appointees face further limitations, including a two-year ban on participating in certain activities. The \"ethics pledge\" imposes restrictions on presidential appointees entering the executive branch, including a two-year ban on former lobbyists participating in certain activities. Small businesses receive special consideration under federal law and policy, with contracting preferences in place. Under federal law, small businesses receive preferences in contracting. However, these protections may not apply to challenging insourcing decisions, even if they disproportionately affect small businesses. Regulations regarding the Small Business Act and the 8(a) Program do not require agencies to seek permission from the Small Business Administration to insource functions previously contracted out. The Obama Administration's Interagency Taskforce on Federal Contracting Opportunities for Small Business recommends clarifying the relationship between agency policies on contractors and small business contracting. Their policy letter emphasizes insourcing functions performed by small business contractors, prioritizing inherently governmental work over non-inherently governmental work by small businesses. Agencies are directed to give preference to small businesses for private-sector work remaining after insourcing reviews. The 112th Congress enacted legislation for OMB to establish procedures for agencies to decide on insourcing functions performed by small businesses, including identifying contracts for conversion, determining if functions are inherently governmental, and comparing costs of contractor vs. government personnel. Agency OSDBUs are also required to prioritize small businesses for private-sector work post-insourcing reviews. The 112th Congress enacted legislation for OMB to establish procedures for agencies to decide on insourcing functions performed by small businesses. This legislation also requires agency Offices of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization (OSDBUs) to review and advise on insourcing determinations. Congress could restrict or broaden the scope of insourcing through various legislative options. The 112th Congress enacted legislation for OMB to establish procedures for agencies to decide on insourcing functions performed by small businesses. Congress could expand or limit the jurisdiction of courts over contractors' challenges to insourcing determinations, require agency insourcing guidelines to be legally binding, and protect small businesses from insourcing effects. Some Members introduced legislation to include objections to converting private sector functions to federal employee performance in protests. The legislation would amend the Small Business Act to prohibit agencies from converting functions performed by small businesses to federal employees without publicly sharing their insourcing procedures after a notice and comment period. This could help clarify agency guidelines and address questions about their binding nature. However, concerns about prudential standing may still exist despite the legislation's enactment."
