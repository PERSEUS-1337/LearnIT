The Act \"Cosmetology Tax Fairness and Compliance Act of 2003\" expands the credit for employee tips in certain lines of business, such as food and beverage services and cosmetology services at licensed facilities. The Cosmetology Tax Fairness and Compliance Act of 2003 defines a cosmetology service as hairdressing, haircutting, manicures, pedicures, body waxing, facials, and other beauty-related services provided at a facility where the majority of services offered fall under these categories. The amendments apply to tips received for services performed after December 31, 2003. The Cosmetology Tax Fairness and Compliance Act of 2003 introduces a new section, SEC. 6050U, requiring information reporting and taxpayer education for providers of cosmetology services. The Cosmetology Tax Fairness and Compliance Act of 2003, under SEC. 6050U, mandates reporting persons employing cosmetologists to comply with return and taxpayer education requirements. This includes those renting chairs to cosmetologists or receiving/paying compensation for cosmetology services. Reporting persons employing cosmetologists must meet specific requirements for employees and independent contractors providing cosmetology services. This includes compliance with tax reporting regulations for employees and third-party service providers. Reporting persons who receive rent or compensation from cosmetologists for chair rental or cosmetology services must comply with tax reporting regulations, including filing returns with the Secretary detailing relevant information. Reporting persons receiving rent or compensation from cosmetologists must file returns with the Secretary, providing details such as the cosmetologist's name, address, TIN, and amount received. They must also give each cosmetologist a written statement with contact information, amount received, and a notice of IRS reporting requirements. The IRS requires reporting persons who received rent or compensation from cosmetologists to provide written statements to the cosmetologists by January 31 of the following year, detailing the amount received and IRS reporting requirements. The IRS requires reporting persons to provide annual publications to cosmetologists, detailing tax and tip reporting obligations for employees and tax obligations for independent contractors or proprietorships. Publications must be delivered in person or by first-class mail with adequate notice. The Secretary can expand the definition of 'cosmetologist' to prevent circumvention of reporting requirements. 'Cosmetology service' is defined by section 45B(c). The term 'chair' includes furniture used for providing cosmetology services. Exceptions exist for certain employees under subsection (c). Exceptions exist for certain employees under subsection (c) with respect to tipping or sharing tips. Conforming amendments are made to the definition of information returns in the Code. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to include new subsections for cosmetology service providers, regardless of payee status. Additionally, a new item is added to the table of sections for subpart B of part III of subchapter A of chapter 61. The amendments made by this section apply to calendar years after 2003 for cosmetology services."
