    "content": "The Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) is a refundable tax credit for low-wage workers, especially those with children. It has evolved into a significant antipoverty program over the past 40 years. Researchers have studied how the EITC impacts recipients' decision to work, poverty rates, and compliance issues. This report reviews current economic research on the EITC to inform potential legislative changes. The report outlines the history and evaluation of the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), focusing on its evolution into a major antipoverty program. It reviews how the credit affects taxpayers' decisions to work, education and health outcomes, tax burdens, and administrative complexity. For more detailed information on eligibility and calculation of the EITC, refer to CRS Report R43805. Before the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) was enacted in 1975, cash welfare payments were the main federal support for poor families with children. Policymakers in the 1960s and 1970s explored alternative aid options, including Milton Friedman's negative income tax proposal and President Nixon's family assistance plan. Senator Russell Long showed interest in Nixon's plan, which aimed to benefit both working and nonworking poor families with children. Senator Russell Long proposed a \"work bonus\" plan as an alternative to the Negative Income Tax (NIT) to encourage the poor to work by providing a supplement to their wages. The work-bonus plan aimed to help reduce increasing payroll tax burdens and was seen as a dignified way to support poor Americans. This plan was favored over the NIT because it rewarded those who worked, unlike the NIT which provided benefits to those without earnings. Senator Russell Long proposed a \"work bonus\" plan to alleviate the tax burden on the working poor and prevent Social Security refinancing from further encumbering them. The plan, enacted as the Earned Income Tax Credit in 1975, aimed to encourage work, reduce reliance on welfare, and stimulate economic growth during the 1974 recession. The Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) was initially targeted at single mothers with children as an alternative to cash welfare. It was made permanent in 1978 to provide work incentives and relief from taxes to low-income families. In the late 1980s and 1990s, the EITC gained popularity as an antipoverty program among policymakers. President Bill Clinton championed the EITC as a poverty-reduction tool, expanding the credit to reward the work of millions of working poor Americans. The EITC evolved from a modest 'work bonus' to a major antipoverty initiative under his administration. Before the 1990s, the EITC's structure limited its effectiveness in reducing poverty among families of different sizes, as it did not vary by family size. The EITC was restructured to vary based on family size, starting with the Omnibus Reconciliation Act. The EITC was restructured to vary based on family size, with the Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1990 and greatly expanded by the Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1993. The credit was now calculated differently for taxpayers with one child versus those with two or more children, with maximum credits of $2,152 and $3,556 in 1996, respectively. Additionally, the 1993 bill introduced a credit for childless workers to offset a gasoline tax increase. The EITC was restructured in 1990 and expanded in 1993 to vary based on family size. The credit for childless workers was introduced in 1993 to offset a gasoline tax increase. In 2000, there was interest in reducing marriage penalties, and in 2001, the EITC structure was identified as a primary cause of the marriage penalty among low-income taxpayers. In 2001, Congress reduced the marriage penalty in the EITC by increasing the income level at which the credit phased out for married couples. The EITC marriage penalty relief was temporarily increased to $5,000 in 2009, extended until 2017, and made permanent by the PATH Act. The EITC marriage penalty relief was made permanent by the PATH Act, with eight formulas in effect to calculate the credit for unmarried individuals and married couples. The credit has three value ranges based on income, with a phase-in range, plateau, and phase-out threshold. The Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) has different value ranges based on income, including a phase-in range, plateau, and phase-out threshold. Economists evaluate tax policies like the EITC based on efficiency, equity, and administration. Research examines how the EITC impacts work, health, and education outcomes. The Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) has been studied for its impact on work decisions, particularly among unmarried mothers who are the majority of recipients. Recent research also looks at how the credit affects labor force decisions of married couples, specifically secondary earners assumed to be women. Studies analyze the EITC's influence on workforce participation and hours worked. The EITC has a positive effect on single mothers' labor force participation, with studies showing that legislative expansions of the credit led to a significant increase in employment among this group. For example, one study found that a larger credit for unmarried individuals with two or more children in the early-1990s resulted in a sharp rise in employment among single mothers. Another study attributed 34% of the increase in employment among single mothers between 1993 and 1999 to EITC expansions. Additionally, research indicates that 60% of the increase in annual employment of single mothers between 1984 and 1996 can be attributed to the EITC and its expansion. The EITC encouraged single mothers to enter the workforce and reduced welfare caseloads in the 1990s. It had a substantial effect on reducing new entries into the cash welfare program. Research is less conclusive on the impact of the EITC on married secondary earners' decisions to start working, with some evidence suggesting a small percentage of married mothers stayed out of the labor force due to the EITC expansion. The EITC expansion led to some married women choosing not to work to raise children, as it could lower their disposable income. However, recent research shows a negligible effect on labor force participation among married women. Policymakers must consider whether subsidizing the lower-earning partner to stay home is desirable for married couples with children. The EITC increases compensation per hour worked, impacting unmarried workers' behavior. The income effect allows workers to work less to achieve the same income target, while the substitution effect increases the marginal return to work. The EITC increases compensation per hour worked, impacting unmarried workers' behavior by influencing the income and substitution effects. The income effect allows workers to work less to reach the same income target, while the substitution effect increases the marginal return to work. In the plateau or phase-out region of the credit, workers are encouraged to reduce their hours worked. In the plateau region of the EITC, workers receive the same credit regardless of hours worked, leading to a decrease in hours worked due to the income effect. In the phase-out region, the credit decreases for each additional hour worked, further encouraging workers to reduce their hours due to both income and substitution effects. The EITC has had little effect on the number of hours worked by workers, despite theoretical predictions. Recent evidence shows that hours worked by eligible individuals have not decreased, possibly due to the complexity and timing of the credit limiting its work incentive effect. The Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) has not significantly impacted the number of hours worked by low-wage workers. Recent research suggests that workers may base their decision on how much to work on their average tax rate rather than the EITC's marginal impact. Limited flexibility in low-wage jobs may also contribute to the EITC's limited effect on hours worked. Recent research has shown that workers may adjust their income levels to maximize their Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) by earning the exact amount needed to receive the largest credit, particularly around the inflection points of the EITC schedule. Recent research has shown that workers may adjust their income levels to maximize their Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) by earning the exact amount needed to receive the largest credit, particularly around the inflection points of the EITC schedule. Bunching was observed among self-employed individuals, indicating a high level of knowledge about the EITC formula. Recent research has shown that low-income workers may adjust their hours worked to maximize their Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) around the refund-maximizing plateau of the EITC schedule. The majority of the clustering effect in the plateau region was from workers in the phase-in region working more hours. This suggests that workers respond to the EITC by increasing hours worked. The EITC does not lead to a reduction in hours worked among workers in the phase-out range, which is puzzling. One theory is that part-time workers in the phase-in range can increase their hours in response to the EITC, while full-time workers in the phase-out range may not have the option to cut back. Research on married couples shows a slight reduction in hours worked for the secondary earner with EITC expansions. The EITC expansions led to a reduction in hours worked among married women, ranging from 0.57% to 4.37%. Studies have not focused on the labor supply effects of the EITC for childless workers, as the EITC for childless workers has remained unchanged since 1993 and is too small to significantly impact their labor force decisions. The Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) encourages low-wage workers to work full-time, with significant credits for single parents compared to childless workers. Research shows the EITC reduces poverty among recipients with children but has little impact on childless individuals. It may also improve health and education outcomes for some recipients but increases tax code inequity between those with and without children. The EITC is a major federal antipoverty program. The Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) is a significant federal antipoverty program that aims to reduce poverty through the tax code. While the official poverty measure does not fully capture the impact of the EITC, new experimental poverty measures that include government benefits like the EITC show evidence of its antipoverty effects. Refundable tax credits, such as those provided by the EITC, are estimated to reduce poverty by three when included in a broader measure of poverty that considers government tax and transfer programs. Refundable tax credits, including the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), are estimated to reduce poverty by three percentage points, compared to 1.6 percentage points for food assistance (SNAP) and 0.2 percentage points for welfare (TANF). The EITC is the largest refundable tax credit targeted to the poor, with most of the antipoverty impact attributed to it. The effects of the EITC vary across different types of households and tax filers. The Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) is a significant factor in reducing poverty rates, especially for unmarried households with children. Without the EITC, many poor tax filers, particularly those with children, would remain below the poverty line after taxation. However, with the EITC, post-tax income for workers with children at the Federal Poverty Level (FPL) is above the FPL, as the EITC exceeds their payroll tax liability. In 2016, the EITC helped reduce deep poverty among unmarried households with three children, illustrating its impact on poverty reduction. The Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) significantly reduces poverty rates, especially for unmarried households with children. The credit has a smaller impact on families in deep poverty compared to those with incomes between 50% and 100% of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL). This could be due to the credit not being large enough to lift deep poverty families above the poverty threshold. Additionally, those in deep poverty may be less likely to work and therefore not eligible for work-based credits like the EITC. The Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) has a smaller impact on childless workers compared to workers with children in reducing poverty rates. For unmarried childless individuals, the EITC results in a 1.5% reduction in poverty, while for unmarried households with three children, there is a 20.5% reduction in poverty. Research suggests that the EITC may also improve the health of some poor Americans, particularly infants and children affected by poverty. Recent research suggests that the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) could improve health outcomes for infants and children born to low-income mothers. Studies show that the EITC is associated with increases in birth weight and a reduction in the incidence of low birth weight (LBW) babies. One study found that a $1,000 increase in the EITC was linked to a 3% decrease in LBW incidence and an increase in mean birth weight. Additionally, the EITC was found to be associated with improvements in maternal health for eligible mothers. The EITC is linked to improvements in maternal health, with eligible mothers having lower risky biomarker levels. Possible mechanisms for higher birthweight and reduced maternal smoking have been suggested. The impact of EITC on health outcomes is unclear, as researchers cannot separate income effects from labor effects. The EITC has unclear effects on adult health outcomes, with some studies showing improvements in health for working-age populations. Researchers have also found that children in families receiving larger EITCs tend to score higher on English and math tests in elementary school. The EITC has been linked to higher scores on English and math tests for children in families receiving larger credits. Researchers are unsure of the exact mechanism behind this improvement, but suggest that it may be related to increased spending on school resources or moving to neighborhoods with better schools. The EITC may contribute to academic achievement among low-income children. The Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) has been found to improve academic achievement among low-income children and increase college attendance rates for low-income high school students. A study showed that a $1,000 increase in a family's EITC raised the chances of enrolling in college by 1.3 percentage points for low-income high school seniors. The timing of when the credit is received, around the time college enrollment decisions are made, plays a significant role in influencing enrollment decisions. The Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) has been shown to have a significant impact on children's academic achievement and attainment, with potential long-term benefits. Recent research suggests that the EITC may also improve health and educational outcomes for low-income populations. Tax burdens represent the percentage of income paid in taxes. Tax burdens, effective average tax rates, and average tax rates are used interchangeably in this report. The EITC changes the distribution of tax burdens across taxpayers at different income levels. Data from the Tax Policy Center show that in 2017, the EITC lowered average tax rates for tax units with income below $100,000, benefiting those with income between $20,000 and $40,000 the most. The EITC does not necessarily result in the poorest tax units paying the lowest average tax rates, as many in the lowest income class are ineligible or only eligible for a small EITC. Economists evaluate how tax provisions affect the tax burdens of different families. Economists evaluate tax provisions' impact on different families' tax burdens by assessing the tax burdens of equivalent families with the same ability-to-pay. Family size and composition affect ability-to-pay, with larger families needing more income to maintain the same standard of living. Adjusting for family size using an equivalence scale can help determine equivalent standard of living for different family compositions. The Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) was found to result in horizontally inequitable tax rates among low-income tax filers, with effective tax rates ranging from -1.47% to -39.21% for families with incomes equivalent to $10,000. This disparity in tax rates was calculated using equivalence scales developed by the Census Bureau. Recent analysis shows horizontal inequity exists at higher income levels, with differences in effective average tax rates among families with and without children. As incomes increase, fewer tax filers qualify for the EITC, leading to a smaller variation in tax rates. Researchers suggest increasing the EITC for single workers and childless couples to improve horizontal equity. The EITC is a concern due to its complex rules and formulas, leading to high error rates in taxpayer claims. Monitoring compliance remains a challenge for the IRS, with evidence suggesting that eligibility rules may result in incorrect claims. Taxpayer error, whether intentional or unintentional, can lead to significant incorrect claims of the EITC. Noncompliance with the EITC is typically measured through improper payments and overclaims, which represent the amount of the credit claimed incorrectly. EITC improper payments are the annual measure of erroneously claimed credits, net of any amounts recovered by the IRS through enforcement activities. The IRS estimates that between $14.9 billion and $17.6 billion in EITC payments were issued improperly in FY2017, representing 21.9% to 25.8% of payments. EITC improper payments are higher compared to traditional spending programs. Overclaims, which are discussed in research studies on tax filer noncompliance, have been reported less frequently by the IRS. The IRS released a study on EITC compliance, estimating $14.0 billion to $19.3 billion in overclaims from 2006-2008. The study found that 79% to 85% of incorrect EITC claims were made by ineligible filers due to claiming children incorrectly, misreporting income, or using the wrong filing status. The study on EITC compliance from 2006-2008 found that the most common errors were incorrectly reporting income, claiming a child for the credit, and filing status errors. Unenrolled tax preparers were identified as the most common type prone to erroneous claims of the credit. Unenrolled tax preparers are more prone to erroneous EITC claims compared to enrolled preparers. The IRS lacks sufficient data to determine the capability or integrity of unenrolled preparers. Detecting errors in EITC claims poses challenges for the IRS, and their methods are not disclosed to prevent circumvention. The IRS faces challenges in detecting errors in EITC claims, especially related to qualifying child errors like residency requirements. They lack a database with accurate information on children, relying on databases like the FCR which may not always be reliable. The IRS may struggle to detect errors in EITC claims, particularly regarding residency requirements for qualifying children. When auditing flagged tax returns, 23% showed no tax adjustments, indicating some taxpayers were compliant despite being flagged as noncompliant by the FCR. Suggestions include comparing income reported on tax returns to third-party forms for verification, as self-employed individuals may have incomplete income information due to deducting business expenses from reported compensation. Taxpayers can deduct business expenses to calculate self-employment income, but the IRS lacks third-party verification for these deductions. Wage income is directly reported on Form W-2, reducing overclaims. The IRS can penalize taxpayers who claim the EITC in error by imposing financial penalties and disallowing future claims. If the IRS denies part or all of a taxpayer's EITC upon examination, the taxpayer must repay. Upon examination by the IRS, if a taxpayer's EITC is denied, they must repay the amount with interest, file Form 8862, and may face a ban from claiming EITC for two to ten years based on the reason for the error. Tax return preparers who erroneously claim the credit may also face penalties and disciplinary actions. The challenges in administering the EITC and the high improper payment rate are significant issues for the IRS. The EITC is considered a \"high-error program\" by the Office of Management and Budget, with the second-highest improper payments in terms of total dollar amount. Unlike traditional spending programs, the EITC is administered as a tax benefit, which may impact error rates. Experts suggest that spending programs have lower improper payment rates because they screen participants before benefits are claimed. The EITC has low administrative costs compared to other non-tax benefit programs. The IRS uses tax returns as the \"application\" for EITC benefits, resulting in high participation with minimal costs. Pre-filing eligibility verification is minimal, reducing administrative costs but also increasing the risk of improper payments. The EITC has low administrative costs but may result in substantial credit errors. The IRS reported a gross tax gap of $458 billion for tax years 2008 to 2010, with $319 billion associated with individual income tax noncompliance. Underreporting of business income and self-employment tax were major contributors to the tax gap. The Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) was enacted in the 1970s to encourage the nonworking poor with children to enter the workforce and reduce the tax burdens of working poor families. EITC overclaims contribute to 6% of the tax gap, while underreported business income by individuals accounts for 51.9%. The Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) was expanded in the 1990s to reduce poverty by encouraging welfare recipients, particularly single mothers, to work. Research shows that the EITC has successfully increased workforce participation among single mothers, reduced poverty in families with children, and improved health and education outcomes for low-income populations. However, there are also limitations and unintended consequences, such as potentially discouraging married women from working and exacerbating inequities in the tax code. The Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) has been shown to exacerbate inequities in the tax code and has a high rate of improper payments. It is ineffective at reducing poverty for workers without children and does not encourage childless individuals to enter the workforce. The EITC theoretically affects both unmarried and married workers' decisions to work and the number of hours worked. The EITC increases workforce participation for single workers by providing a credit for working. For married couples, the impact on labor force participation may vary due to income and substitution effects. Overall, the EITC increases the returns to work, encouraging more individuals to enter the workforce. The EITC increases workforce participation by raising the marginal returns to work, leading to both income and substitution effects. Economists assume the primary earner in a married couple decides on labor force participation first, influencing the secondary earner's decision. In a model of sequential family labor supply decisions, the primary earner's labor force participation is crucial as it determines eligibility for the EITC. The secondary earner's decision to work depends on the income distribution between spouses, especially if the primary earner's income qualifies the family for the credit. The secondary earner's choice to work can increase the marginal returns to work for the couple, leading to ambiguous decision-making. The EITC can impact the labor force participation of secondary earners in married couples. The substitution effect may encourage them to work, while the income effect may lead them to stay out of the labor force. Empirical research suggests that the substitution effect is dominant, leading secondary earners to start working. However, if the combined family income places them in the phase-out range of the credit, both income and substitution effects suggest that the secondary earner's decision to work may be uncertain. The income and substitution effects on the labor force participation of secondary earners in married couples are influenced by the EITC. If the family's income is in the plateau region, the EITC remains constant regardless of hours worked, discouraging entry into the workforce. In the phase-out region, the credit value may decrease, creating uncertainty about working. The EITC affects the labor force participation of secondary earners in married couples. In the phase-out region, the credit value decreases for each additional hour worked, discouraging work. The decision to work depends on income and substitution effects. For unmarried workers, it depends on individual income, while for married workers, it depends on combined family income. The EITC increases the marginal return to work for workers, leading to conflicting income and substitution effects. In the phase-in range, one dollar of wages pre-EITC leads to $1.34 post-EITC. In the plateau region, workers receive the same EITC regardless of hours worked, potentially leading to reduced work hours. The Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) increases the marginal return to work for workers, leading to conflicting income and substitution effects. In the plateau region, workers may choose to work fewer hours to receive the same EITC amount, reducing their marginal return to work. This results in workers consuming more leisure as the cost of leisure declines. According to economic theory, workers in the phase-out region of the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) will work less and consume more leisure due to the income effect."
