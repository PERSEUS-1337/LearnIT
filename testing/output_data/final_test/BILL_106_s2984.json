    "content": "The Act titled \"Long-Term Caregivers Assistance Act of 2000\" introduces a refundable credit for long-term care under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. This credit is designated as the \"Long-Term Care Tax Credit\" in Section 35. The Long-Term Care Tax Credit allows a credit against the tax for eligible caregivers, based on the number of applicable individuals. The credit is reduced based on the taxpayer's modified adjusted gross income exceeding a threshold amount. The term 'threshold amount' for the Long-Term Care Tax Credit is $110,000 for joint returns, $75,000 for unmarried individuals, and $55,000 for married individuals filing separately. Marital status is determined under section 7703. An 'applicable individual' is someone certified by a physician as needing long-term care before the tax return due date. Individuals with long-term care needs must meet specific requirements, including a period of at least 180 consecutive days within the taxable year. A physician must certify that the individual meets these requirements within a specified timeframe. Individuals aged 6 or older who are unable to perform at least 3 activities of daily living without substantial assistance, or require supervision due to severe cognitive impairment and cannot perform at least 1 activity of daily living, may qualify for long-term care needs. A physician must certify these requirements within a specified timeframe. Individuals aged 6 or older who are unable to perform daily living activities or require supervision due to severe cognitive impairment may qualify for long-term care needs. This includes those who need substantial supervision to protect from health and safety threats due to psychological disabilities, mental retardation, or related developmental disabilities. Individuals aged 6 or older with severe cognitive impairment may qualify for long-term care if they require supervision for daily living activities. This includes those who need assistance with eating, transferring, or mobility. Younger individuals under 2 years old may also qualify for specific durable medical needs. The term 'psychological disability' refers to diagnosable clinical conditions on Axis I or Axis II of the current edition of the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, requiring substantial supervision or residence in a psychiatric hospital. In this section, the term 'mental retardation' is defined as 'developmental disabilities' consistent with the Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act. An eligible caregiver for tax purposes is defined as someone responsible for individuals requiring substantial supervision or residence in specific approved facilities. The individuals eligible for certain tax deductions include the taxpayer, their spouse, and individuals for whom the taxpayer can claim a deduction under section 151. An individual may qualify for certain tax deductions if they meet the residency test by having their principal place of abode at the taxpayer's home and meet specific requirements outlined in the tax code. An individual may qualify for tax deductions if they meet residency requirements by living in the taxpayer's home for over half the taxable year or the entire year if they are not a relative. If multiple caregivers qualify, the taxpayer is considered the eligible caregiver. The eligible caregiver can be determined by written declarations from individuals stating they will not claim the applicable individual for the tax credit. If no agreement is reached, the individual with the highest modified adjusted gross income will be considered the eligible caregiver. In the case of married individuals filing separately, specific rules apply. In the case of married individuals filing separately, the determination of the eligible caregiver is based on specific rules, regardless of written declarations. Taxpayers must include the name, taxpayer identification number, and physician's identification number for the applicable individual to claim the credit. The tax credit is only allowable for a full taxable year, except in cases of a taxpayer's death. Amendments include adding an omission of a correct TIN or physician identification for the family care credit. Amendments to tax credit regulations include adding a correct TIN or physician identification for the family care credit and expanding eligibility to include section 35. Section 35 introduces a long-term care tax credit, while section 36 addresses overpayments of tax. The amendments apply to taxable years starting after December 31, 2000."
