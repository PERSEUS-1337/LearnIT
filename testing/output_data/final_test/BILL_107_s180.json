    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Sudan Peace Act\". The Government of Sudan's intensified prosecution of the war outside its control has resulted in over 2,000,000 deaths and 4,000,000 displacements. A comprehensive peace process, protected from manipulation, is crucial for a permanent resolution, human rights protection, and a self-sustaining Sudan. Strengthening humanitarian relief operations is essential, with continued US leadership being critical. Regardless of Sudan's political status, efforts to end the war must persist. The Government of Sudan's manipulation of traditional rivalries and use of militias in areas outside its control hinder self-sustenance and peace efforts. International reconciliation efforts have helped reduce human suffering caused by divide and conquer tactics. The Government of Sudan is using tactics to disrupt populations' ability to sustain themselves, including banning relief flights to prosecute the war and increase lethality. They manipulate food aid receipt through veto power over air transport plans, impacting the Sudanese people's access to aid from the United States and other donor countries. The United States and other donor countries are providing relief and assistance outside of the Government of Sudan's control to address deficiencies in aid delivery. While immediate needs in selected areas have been met, populations in other areas are still at risk of extreme disruption. The Nuba Mountains and Bahr al Ghazal are particularly affected. The Nuba Mountains, Bahr al Ghazal, Upper Nile, and Blue Nile regions are excluded from relief distribution by OLS, increasing the risk of famine. International relief operations are costly and unsustainable, focusing only on immediate food needs. Populations' ability to defend themselves in areas outside the Government of Sudan's control has been compromised. The United States should use various means of pressure to facilitate a comprehensive solution to the war in Sudan, including multilateralizing economic and diplomatic tools, supporting democratic civil authority, promoting reconciliation mechanisms, strengthening humanitarian relief mechanisms, and cooperating with trading partners. Cooperation among trading partners and multilateral institutions is essential for addressing the war in Sudan. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. The term \"Government of Sudan\" refers to the National Islamic Front government in Khartoum, Sudan. The term \"OLS\" refers to the United Nations relief operation known as \"Operation Lifeline Sudan\". SEC. 4. CONDEMNATION OF SLAVERY, OTHER HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES, AND TACTICS OF THE GOVERNMENT OF SUDAN. Congress condemns violations of human rights in Sudan, including the Government's role in the ongoing slave trade and organization of raiding parties in various regions. Congress condemns violations of human rights in Sudan, including the Government's role in the ongoing slave trade and organization of raiding parties in various regions, particularly in the Blue Nile regions. It recognizes that the use of raiding and slaving parties is a tool for creating food shortages and is used as a systematic means to destroy the societies, culture, and economies of the Dinka, Nuer, and Nuba peoples in a policy of low-intensity ethnic cleansing. Support for an internationally sanctioned peace process in Sudan is crucial for a peaceful settlement to the conflict. The Secretary of State is authorized to use Department of State personnel to support negotiations, peace settlement planning, and other diplomatic efforts in Sudan. SEC. 6. MULTILATERAL PRESSURE ON COMBATANTS. The sense of Congress is that the United Nations should be used to facilitate peace and recovery in Sudan. The President should work to revise Operation Lifeline Sudan, investigate slavery in Sudan, and condemn the Government of Sudan. The United Nations should facilitate peace and recovery in Sudan. The President should revise Operation Lifeline Sudan, investigate slavery in Sudan, and sponsor condemnations of the Government of Sudan for aerial bombardment of civilians. SEC. 7. REPORTING REQUIREMENT. Section 116 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 is amended to include additional reporting requirements related to Sudan's oil infrastructure financing, aerial bombardment, and the involvement of United States citizens in securing such financing. The amendment to Section 116 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 includes reporting requirements on Sudan's oil infrastructure financing, aerial bombardment, and the involvement of US citizens. It also requires a report on the control, targets, frequency, and damage estimates of aerial bombardment in Sudan, as well as the obstruction of humanitarian relief by the Sudanese government or other forces. SEC. 8. Congress urges increased use of non-OLS agencies for relief efforts in southern Sudan. President to submit progress report within 90 days. SEC. 9. Contingency plan required for any ban on air transport relief flights. SEC. 9. The President must create a contingency plan to ensure the delivery of relief aid to Sudan, including areas like the Nuba Mountains, Upper Nile, and Blue Nile, in case of a ban on OLS air transport relief flights. The President is authorized to reprogram funds for this plan. The President is authorized to conduct pilot project activities through USAID to provide humanitarian assistance to vulnerable populations in exclusionary \"no go\" areas of Sudan. A study will be conducted to examine the adverse impact of OLS policies on indigenous Sudan communities in these areas. The Senate passed a bill on July 19, 2001. Jeri Thomson attested as Secretary."
