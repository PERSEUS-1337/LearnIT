    "content": "Commercial truck driving is one of the most dangerous occupations in the country, with a high fatality rate for both drivers and others on the road. In 2018, 28.3 out of 100,000 truck transportation workers died on the job, significantly higher than the average across all occupations. The fatality rate for occupants of large trucks has also increased in recent years. Driver fatigue is a major concern due to long hours, irregular schedules, and variable sleeping conditions in the industry. Automated driver-assistance safety systems are being introduced in the commercial truck and bus industries to address driver fatigue. Congress has regulated the hours of service (HOS rule) for commercial drivers since 1935, affecting millions of drivers and carriers. In 2012, Congress mandated the recording of hours of service for most commercial drivers to address concerns about fatigue and highway safety. The ELD mandate for commercial drivers of trucks and buses went into effect in December 2017 to address fatigue issues. The commercial motor vehicle industry operates 24/7, leading to fatigue among drivers. Fatigue can increase the risk of accidents due to impaired decision-making. The National Transportation Safety Board has highlighted managing fatigue among transportation workers as a key safety improvement since 1990. Measuring fatigue-related crashes is challenging due to the lack of a convenient marker, leading to an underestimation of fatigue's role in accidents. The prevailing theory of crash investigators is that crashes are usually caused by multiple factors, not just one. In commercial motor vehicle crashes, investigators struggle to determine if driver fatigue played a role due to the lack of a biological marker for fatigue. Federal regulations can limit driver hours but cannot enforce rest. The regulations can limit driver hours but cannot enforce rest. Factors like obstructive sleep apnea contribute to fatigue among commercial truck drivers. Fatigue is most likely between 2 a.m. and 6 a.m. due to circadian rhythms. Factors contributing to fatigue among commercial truck drivers include the length of time working without a break, duration of wakefulness, amount of sleep in the previous 24 hours, cumulative effects of insufficient sleep over several days, and individual variations in response. These factors manifest as long driving hours, erratic work schedules, disruption of circadian cycles, fatigue from non-driving tasks, and challenges in finding a safe place to rest. Factors contributing to fatigue among commercial truck drivers include prolonged experience of whole body vibration, noise, carbon monoxide exposure, extreme temperatures, and working in high-pressure situations with little autonomy and control over one's time. Safety practices such as establishing a strong safety culture, considering fatigue when setting schedules, and providing assistance with fatiguing behaviors can help offset fatigue-inducing factors. Directly studying the elements that affect driver fatigue is challenging due to unreliable reports of sleep quality and duration. Biomathematical models are used to estimate alertness based on sleep-wake schedules and work timing to address difficulties in directly measuring sleep quality. These models are utilized by the Department of Defense and Department of Transportation to improve safety and reduce fatigue risk. However, current models do not consider individual differences in response to fatigue-inducing factors. The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine report on fatigue among truck drivers advises caution in using biomathematical models to address irregular work schedules. The diversity of driver groups leads to inconsistent use of these models and other fatigue management approaches. Drivers with carriers having large fleets may have more scheduling flexibility and access to health programs, unlike drivers with small firms or independent owner-operators. Managing fatigue among drivers has mainly focused on limiting work hours due to the lack of a measurable fatigue marker. The \"hours of service\" regulations, established for the interstate trucking industry in 1935, limit daily and weekly work periods to ensure driver safety. These regulations are part of Congress's safety standards for commercial motor vehicle safety, addressing vehicle maintenance, driver physical condition, and preventing coercion to violate safety regulations. Commercial long-haul truck and over-the-road bus drivers face challenging conditions for maintaining health, including long work hours, variable schedules, sitting for long periods, and difficulties in getting adequate sleep. Lack of exercise and insufficient sleep can lead to obesity, diabetes, high blood pressure, and premature death. Night shift work has been classified as \"probably carcinogenic to humans\" due to its disruption of circadian rhythms. Many commercial drivers sleep less than seven hours per night, with some getting less than six hours on average. Studies show that commercial drivers are getting more sleep after the 2003 changes to the Hours of Service (HOS) rule, with an average of 6.28 hours. However, this is still below the recommended seven to eight hours. Fatigue remains a significant safety issue, as fatal crashes involving large trucks and buses increased by 40% between 2009 and 2017. The Hours of Service (HOS) rule, last revised in 2011, applies to drivers in passenger and freight operations. The rule affects drivers differently based on their work nature, ranging from independent owner-operators to large corporations. Drivers carry various types of freight, including hazardous materials. Some drivers work all day, while others have breaks in between routes. Local delivery drivers can sleep at home, while over-the-road truckers may be away for extended periods. The Hours of Service (HOS) rule primarily impacts long-haul truck drivers who transport multiple loads over extended periods away from home, driving at all hours. These drivers, representing half of those affected by the rule, are most susceptible to fatigue due to their pay structure and work nature. Many drivers violate the HOS rule to increase income by driving more hours, especially before the ELD mandate. Penalties can be imposed by federal, state, and local officials for violations found during roadside inspections. The HOS rule violations can lead to drivers being placed \"out of service\" until they have enough off-duty time. Penalties can be imposed by officials for violations, affecting both the driver and the employer's safety scores. Changes to the rule are contentious, such as the 2011 revision that impacted the 34-hour restart rule. The 2011 revision of the HOS rule required drivers to take a 34-hour rest period that included two consecutive 1 a.m. to 5 a.m. periods to align with circadian rhythms. This change was met with protests for limiting flexibility, leading to Congress suspending enforcement in 2014 pending further study on safety and fatigue outcomes. The study submitted to Congress in March 2017 found that the change in the HOS rule did not meet all required areas of improvement, leading to the previous restart rule being reinstated. Fatigue management programs aim to reduce fatigue among employees and promote operational safety and employee health. These programs include fatigue risk management plans and systems, with initiatives such as fatigue awareness training and reporting processes for instances of fatigued driving. The North American Fatigue Management Program educates commercial drivers and employers on the causes and consequences of driver fatigue, as well as measures to manage it. The program includes fatigue risk management systems with monitoring and measuring of workers' schedules. The effectiveness of the program has not been properly assessed according to a recent report. The report highlights positive results from integrating health and wellness and fatigue management programs, but questions the efficacy and scalability of these initiatives. Little is known about the use of such programs by independent owner-operators. Evaluation of the North American Fatigue Management Program is ongoing, with results expected in 2022 or later. The ELD requirement aims to improve compliance with commercial motor vehicle hours of service rules. An ELD is a hardware device connected to a vehicle's engine control module to automatically record driving time and ensure compliance with the motor vehicle hours of service rule. It is more reliable than paper log books and is expected to reduce crashes caused by fatigued drivers. FMCSA estimated that 1,844 crashes would be avoided annually due to the ELD mandate. FMCSA estimated that the ELD mandate would avoid 1,844 crashes annually, preventing injuries to 562 persons and 26 fatalities, with a financial benefit of $575 million. However, it is too early to determine if ELDs have reduced crashes as anticipated. A study showed a decrease in HOS violations, especially for owner-operators and small fleets. The study found that violations by drivers for carriers with larger fleets were already low, and the average number of crashes per week slightly increased after the HOS mandate. For larger fleets, the crash rate decreased slightly. The study concluded that changes in freight shipment activity did not explain the increase in crashes. Unsafe driving violations by individual owner-operators and drivers for very small fleets increased significantly after the ELD mandate, while violations did not increase among drivers for larger carriers. The study suggests that independent owner-operators and drivers for small fleets reduced driving time but drove faster after the ELD mandate to maintain income. This behavior may lead to higher risk among self-employed or small fleet drivers compared to those in larger fleets. FMCSA estimated $2.4 billion in annual savings from reduced paperwork. The FMCSA estimated $2.4 billion in annual savings from reduced paperwork for drivers and carriers. Critics, like the Owner-Operator Independent Drivers Association (OOIDA), argue that the costs are underestimated and benefits are overestimated. OOIDA represents operators responsible for ELD costs. Some trucking operators view ELDs as intrusive, while larger carriers see benefits beyond FMCSA estimates. Carriers use driver relays to comply with HOS rules, offering health and lifestyle benefits to drivers. The Government Accountability Office has noted limited data availability for evaluating the impact of commercial motor vehicle HOS regulations. The ELD regulation aims to simplify data collection by requiring carriers to store information electronically. The ELD regulation requires carriers to collect and store data electronically to simplify the task of gathering driver schedules. This data could help evaluate the impact of the HOS rule and proposed changes. However, obstacles include limitations on data use, privacy concerns, and costs. Congress may explore making ELD data available for regulatory analysis. The direct costs of the ELD mandate are estimated at $1 billion annually, with an average cost of around $495 per truck or bus. Prices for ELDs vary, with some available for less than the estimated average cost, potentially reducing the economic impact of the mandate. Many truck drivers are concerned about stricter enforcement of the HOS rule as it limits their driving hours and earnings, leading to potential delays and economic impacts. Studies show a link between drivers being paid by the mile, driving time limits, speeding, and longer working hours, all of which increase crash risks. The HOS regulation aims to address these safety concerns. The HOS regulation aims to address fatigued driving and crash risks by giving drivers flexibility with up to 14 duty hours per day, including 11 hours of driving. However, drivers paid by the mile may work up to three hours without pay. A proposal to require payment for on-duty time for mile-paid drivers was not enacted in 2015. The use of ELDs may help quantify challenges faced by drivers. The use of ELDs may help quantify challenges faced by drivers, such as delays in loading and unloading cargo causing unpaid \"driver detention time\" costing drivers $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion annually. This detention time increases crash risks and is more common for drivers working for smaller carriers. When reaching the HOS driving time limit, drivers must find parking, which can be challenging due to various factors like weather and traffic. A shortage of truck parking facilities can pose public safety hazards as tired drivers may continue driving in search of a place to park, increasing crash risks. Congress directed DOT to create a pilot program in 2005 to address this issue, and Jason's Law was passed in 2009 after a driver was robbed and murdered at an unsafe parking location. Jason's Law, passed by Congress, prioritizes safe parking for truck drivers and requires periodic surveys of truck parking facilities. The demand for truck parking exceeds supply, especially in the Mid-Atlantic region, due to various factors such as truck drivers' reluctance to pay for parking and restrictions on commercial facilities at rest areas. Few studies have been conducted on the causes and effects of driver fatigue. There is a lack of research on fatigue among bus drivers compared to truck drivers. The limited number of fatal bus crashes makes it challenging to gather data for analysis. It is not appropriate to generalize truck driver fatigue research to bus drivers due to differences in demographics. On August 22, 2018, FMCSA proposed changes to the Hours of Service rule for commercial drivers to provide more flexibility. The changes aim to address complaints about enforcement through electronic logging, particularly for drivers with short driving periods and long on-duty periods. This includes exemptions for short haul operations within a 100 air-mile radius. FMCSA is considering expanding the exemption for short-haul drivers to 14 hours on duty, matching other truck drivers, without recording driving time. Adverse driving conditions allow two extra hours of driving time, totaling up to 13 hours. FMCSA is considering adding 2 hours to the 14-hour on-duty period for adverse conditions, allowing a maximum of 16 consecutive hours on duty. They are also seeking information on alternatives to, and the impact of eliminating, the required 30-minute rest break after 8 hours. Additionally, drivers with sleeper berths can split the minimum 10 off-duty hours into 2 separate periods totaling at least 10 hours. FMCSA canceled a pilot program for sleeper berth flexibility, citing sufficient data and a desire to expedite changes to the HOS rule. Livestock haulers have strongly opposed stricter HOS compliance due to the ELD mandate. Livestock haulers face increased stress and risk during transport, with federal law mandating a maximum of 28 consecutive hours in a vehicle before unloading for feeding, watering, and rest. However, enforcement by the U.S. Department of Agriculture is lacking. The livestock hauling industry had HOS exemptions prior to the ELD mandate, including for private transportation of agricultural commodities. Livestock haulers within a 150 air-mile radius of the source of agricultural commodities are exempt from HOS regulations. This exemption was expanded from 100 to 150 air miles in 2012. Once drivers go beyond the 150 air-mile radius, HOS rules apply, and they must record driving and on-duty time. Time spent within the radius does not count towards HOS limits. The ELD mandate enforces HOS limits for livestock haulers, reducing transport distances within the 28-hour limit. This may lead to additional stress for drivers who reach the 11-hour driving limit, requiring them to unload and reload livestock or leave them. Data are lacking on whether stricter compliance with the HOS rule increases the cost of shipping livestock and reduces crashes involving livestock haulers. Congress has prohibited FMCSA from enforcing the ELD mandate on livestock haulers until September 30, 2020."
