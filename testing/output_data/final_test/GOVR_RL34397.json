    "content": "Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs) are tax-advantaged accounts established for retirement savings. Contributions can be made on a pretax or post-tax basis, with investment earnings being tax-deferred or tax-free. IRAs were authorized by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 and expanded to include all workers and spouses by the Economic Recovery Act of 1981. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 limited tax-deductible contributions to certain individuals, and the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 allowed penalty-free withdrawals and introduced the Roth IRA for tax-free growth. The Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 significantly impacted contribution limits in IRAs by increasing them, indexing them to inflation, and allowing catch-up contributions for individuals aged 50 and older. The Pension Protection Act of 2006 allowed for tax-free distributions for charitable contributions, indexed contribution limits to inflation permanently, and enabled taxpayers to direct tax refunds into an IRA. This report explains traditional and Roth IRAs, including eligibility, contributions, withdrawals, and a tax credit. Traditional IRAs are funded by workers' contributions, which may be tax-deductible and accrue investment earnings. Two key benefits include pretax contributions for larger investment earnings and taxes paid upon distribution. The rules also cover penalty-free distributions for natural disaster victims and a tax credit for retirement savings contributions. Individuals under 70\u00bd years old with taxable compensation can contribute to traditional IRAs, with a $5,500 annual limit in 2018. Contributions are taxed upon distribution, usually at a lower rate than during working years. Those aged 50 and older can make additional catch-up contributions. In 2018, individuals aged 50 and older can make additional $1,000 catch-up contributions to traditional IRAs. For joint filers, spouses can contribute an amount equal to the couple's total compensation or the contribution limit, whichever is lower. Excess contributions are subject to a 6% tax if not withdrawn by the tax return due date. Contributions between January 1 and April 15 can be designated for the current or previous year, and must come from work income. Individuals can contribute to IRAs using work income like wages and tips. Noncompensation sources like property earnings, interest, or dividends cannot be used. IRAs can be set up through various financial institutions with investment choices. Certain transactions like borrowing from IRAs or investing in collectibles can result in taxes or loss of IRA status. Individuals can contribute to IRAs using work income like wages and tips, but not noncompensation sources. IRAs can be set up through financial institutions with investment choices. IRA contributions may be tax-deductible based on pension coverage and adjusted gross income. Those without employer-sponsored pensions can deduct up to the contribution limit from their income. Individuals covered by a pension plan at work may deduct IRA contributions based on income levels. Nondeductible contributions are made from post-tax income, with investment earnings taxed upon distribution. Excess contributions are those exceeding the limits. Worksheets for partial deductions are available in IRS Publication 590-A. IRA withdrawals are taxable. Withdrawals from Individual Retirement Arrangements (IRAs) are subject to income tax in the year received. Early distributions, before age 59\u00bd, may incur an additional 10% penalty. IRA holders must start withdrawals by April 1 after reaching age 70\u00bd. The required minimum distribution is calculated based on the account balance and the IRA owner's life expectancy. Failure to take the required minimum distribution by December 31 results in penalties. Beginning in 2007, distributions from IRAs after the age of 70\u00bd could be made directly to qualified charities and excluded from gross income. Early distributions before age 59\u00bd are subject to federal income tax and a 10% penalty, except for specific circumstances such as being a beneficiary of a deceased IRA owner or being disabled. Early withdrawals from IRAs may be exempt from the 10% penalty if the individual is disabled, receives substantially equal payments over their life expectancy, separates from employment after age 55, incurs unreimbursed medical expenses exceeding 7.5% of AGI, pays medical insurance premiums during unemployment, uses funds for higher education, buys a first home (up to $10,000 withdrawal limit), is a reservist called to active duty after 9/11, or resides in areas affected by specific natural disasters. Individuals can make early withdrawals from IRAs without a reason but will face a 10% tax penalty unless they meet specific conditions. Rollovers allow transfers of assets between retirement plans without penalties or contribution limits, including traditional IRAs, 401(k) plans, and other qualified retirement plans. Rollovers can be direct transfers or issued to individuals for deposit into traditional IRAs within 60 days. Individuals have 60 days to complete rollover contributions into traditional IRAs, or face taxable distributions and potential penalties. Direct trustee-to-trustee transfers avoid withholding taxes. A U.S. Tax Court decision in January 2014 limited individuals to one rollover per year between IRAs under certain circumstances. The one-rollover-per-year limit applies to rollovers between two traditional IRAs or two Roth IRAs, not from a traditional IRA to a Roth IRA. It does not apply to trustee-to-trustee transfers or rollovers from qualified pension plans. Distribution rules vary depending on the new owner's relationship to the former owner. The distribution rules for inherited IRAs depend on the IRA owner's age at the time of death. Failure to take the required minimum distribution (RMD) incurs a 50% excise tax. Spouses can roll over inherited IRAs into traditional IRAs or qualified employer plans, while nonspouse beneficiaries cannot perform rollovers. Some IRAs have more stringent distribution requirements than others. Roth IRAs, authorized by the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997, differ from traditional IRAs as contributions are made with after-tax funds and qualified distributions are tax-free. Beneficiaries of IRAs may have more stringent distribution requirements than summarized in Table 3, with options to distribute assets faster or over a longer period. Roth IRAs offer tax-free investment earnings and have income limits for eligibility. Individuals can make maximum contributions based on adjusted gross incomes, with limits reducing for higher incomes. Those aged 50 and older can make additional catch-up contributions. AGI limits for eligibility and contribution limits have been adjusted for inflation since 2007. IRS Publication 590-A provides a worksheet for computing reduced Roth IRA contribution limits. The IRS Publication 590-A provides guidelines for Roth IRA contributions and conversions. Roth IRAs must be designated as such when set up and have similar rules to traditional IRAs. Conversions from traditional IRAs to Roth IRAs are allowed, with the amount included in taxable income. Inherited IRAs cannot be converted. A provision in P.L. 115-97 repealed a rule allowing IRA contributions to be recharacterized. Recharacterization of IRA contributions for the 2017 tax year can be completed by October 15, 2018. Rules for rollovers from traditional IRAs apply, including completing within 60 days. Withdrawals from a converted IRA before five years are subject to a 10% penalty. Tax-free withdrawals from one Roth IRA transferred to another Roth IRA are allowed within 60 days. Rollovers from Roth IRAs to other types of IRAs or employer-sponsored plans are permitted. Distributions from Roth IRAs can be classified into three types: return of regular contributions, qualified distributions, and nonqualified distributions. Returns of regular contributions and qualified distributions are not taxable. Qualified distributions must meet specific criteria such as being made after a five-year period and after the age of 59\u00bd. Nonqualified distributions may be subject to penalties. Nonqualified distributions from Roth IRAs are subject to a $10,000 lifetime limit and are considered in a specific order for tax purposes. They may need to be included as part of income and are subject to a 10% penalty unless exceptions apply. Distribution rules upon the death of the Roth IRA owner depend on the beneficiary. Upon the death of a Roth IRA owner, distribution rules vary based on whether the beneficiary is a spouse or nonspouse. If the spouse is the beneficiary, they can choose to inherit the Roth IRA or distribute it over their life expectancy. Nonspouse beneficiaries have the option to distribute the IRA within five years or over their life expectancy. Distributions from inherited Roth IRAs are typically tax-free, but taxes may apply if the owner dies within a specific timeframe. The Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 authorized a nonrefundable tax credit for eligible individuals contributing to IRAs or employer-sponsored retirement plans. The Retirement Savings Contribution Credit, also known as the Saver's Credit, is in addition to tax deductions for contributions to traditional IRAs or employer-sponsored pension plans. Taxpayers must meet certain criteria to receive the credit, such as being at least 18 years old, not a full-time student, not an exemption on someone else's tax return, and having AGI below certain limits. The Saver's Credit, authorized by the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001, provides a tax credit for eligible individuals contributing to IRAs or employer-sponsored retirement plans. Taxpayers can reduce their tax liability by up to $1,000 by making a $2,000 IRA contribution in 2018. Form 1040, 1040A, or 1040NR must be filed to claim the credit. Traditional IRAs held significantly more assets than Roth IRAs, with $6.7 trillion in traditional IRAs and $660 billion in Roth IRAs by the end of 2016. Contributions to traditional IRAs mainly came from rollovers from employer-sponsored pensions rather than regular contributions. In 2014, more funds flowed into Roth IRAs from contributions ($21.9 billion) than from rollovers ($5.7 billion). Data from the 2016 Survey of Consumer Finances show that 61.1% of households with IRAs have balances of less than $100,000, while 4.4% have balances of $1 million or more. The SCF provides detailed information on U.S. household finances and demographics. In 2016, 29.8% of U.S. households had an IRA. The median account balance was $52,000, smaller than the average of $201,240, indicating some households had large balances. Ownership of IRAs increased with age and income of the household head. In 2016, 29.8% of U.S. households had an IRA with a median account balance of $52,000. Higher income households are more likely to save for retirement and participate in a DC plan. Married households have larger IRA balances, possibly due to dual incomes. Congress exempted storm-affected individuals from early IRA withdrawal penalties in 2005 and 2008. In response to natural disasters like Hurricane Sandy, California wildfires, and hurricanes in 2017, the IRS eased requirements for hardship distributions from defined contribution plans. However, congressional authorization is needed to exempt retirement plan distributions from the 10% early withdrawal penalty. After Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, and Wilma, the Gulf Opportunity Zone Act of 2005 allowed penalty-free distributions up to $100,000 for storm-affected residents from their retirement plans. Residents in specified Midwest areas affected by severe storms, tornados, and flooding were allowed penalty-free distributions up to $100,000 from their retirement plans under the Heartland Disaster Tax Relief Act of 2008. The distributions had to be received after specific dates in 2005 and before January 1, 2007, and could be reported as taxable income or repaid to the retirement plan within three years without being taxed. Residents in specified Midwest areas affected by severe storms, tornados, and flooding were allowed penalty-free distributions up to $100,000 from their retirement plans under the Heartland Disaster Tax Relief Act of 2008. The distributions had to be received after specific dates in 2005 and before January 1, 2007. In response to Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria, Congress approved the Disaster Tax Relief and Airport and Airway Extension Act of 2017, allowing residents in affected areas to make qualified distributions. Residents affected by Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria can take penalty-free distributions up to $100,000 from their retirement plans. The distributions must have been made on specific dates in 2017 and are taxable income. Alternatively, the distribution can be repaid within three years without being considered taxable income. No legislation was passed for Hurricane Sandy in 2012 and California wildfires in 2017 to exempt individuals from the 10% penalty for early withdrawals from retirement plans. The IRS eased requirements for hardship distributions in areas affected by Hurricane Sandy in 2012 and the California wildfires in 2017, allowing plan administrators to rely on employee representations for the need and amount of distributions. However, exemptions from the 10% penalty for early withdrawals before the age of 59\u00bd require congressional authorization. Additionally, the provision to suspend contributions to 401(K) and 403(b) plans for six months following a disaster was suspended by the IRS. The IRS allowed individuals to suspend contributions to 401(K) and 403(b) plans for six months following a hardship distribution."
