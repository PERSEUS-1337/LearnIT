    "content": "Title VI of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 is amended to include a new section on class size reduction under Part E. This new section establishes a grant program for class size reduction. The purpose of this section is to reduce class size by hiring qualified teachers, training 100,000 teachers to reduce class sizes nationally in grades 1 through 3, and improve teaching to ensure all students can read well by the end of 3rd grade. The Secretary reserves 1 percent of funds for activities in the Bureau of Indian Affairs and outlying areas. The Secretary shall allot to each State an amount equal to the amount received for the preceding fiscal year under this section or section 306 of the Department of Education Appropriations Act, 2001, for activities in accordance with this section. If the amount available for a fiscal year is insufficient to pay all States, the Secretary will reduce the amounts for that year. Additional funds may be allotted for the next fiscal year if the amount exceeds the previous year's allocation. The Secretary shall allot to each State a percentage of the excess amount for the fiscal year, based on the greater of the percentage received in the previous year under section 1122 or section 2202(b). If the excess amount is insufficient, ratable reductions will be made for all eligible States. The Secretary will ratably reduce the full amounts that States are eligible to receive under clause (i) for the fiscal year. Each State receiving funds must allocate 100 percent to local educational agencies, with 80 percent based on the number of children from families below the poverty line. The Services Block Grant Act allocates funds to local educational agencies based on the number of children from families below the poverty line and the relative enrollments of children in public and private schools. The Services Block Grant Act allocates funds to local educational agencies based on poverty levels and school enrollments. Funds can be used to hire qualified teachers to reduce class sizes or for activities related to teaching in smaller classes. Local educational agencies receiving funds under this section must use them to reduce class size by hiring fully qualified teachers, especially in early elementary grades where research shows this is most effective. Funds can be used for recruiting, hiring, and training regular and special education teachers. The curr_chunk discusses the importance of hiring special education teachers to team-teach with regular teachers, testing new teachers for academic knowledge, and providing professional development for teachers, including special education teachers. The curr_chunk emphasizes the need for all teachers, including special education teachers, to have the necessary knowledge and skills to teach effectively in their content areas, in line with the Higher Education Act of 1965. It also limits the use of funds for testing and professional development activities by local educational agencies. A local educational agency can use more than 25 percent of funds for helping teachers attain full qualification if a certain percentage of classes are taught by unqualified teachers. A local educational agency that has already reduced class size in early elementary grades may use funds to further reduce class size, improve teacher quality, or carry out activities to enhance teaching standards. The local educational agency must use funds to supplement, not replace, state and local funds for activities like professional development. Funds cannot be used to increase salaries, except for participation in professional development programs. The funds allocated under this section can be used to pay teachers' salaries hired under specific acts. States must submit biennial reports on activities funded under this section, while State and local educational agencies must report annually on progress in reducing class size. The local educational agency must report on progress in reducing class size and increasing qualified teachers. Parents must be notified if their child is taught by a substitute or unqualified teacher for 2 or more weeks. Private schools must have equitable participation in professional development activities funded under this section. A local educational agency can use up to 3% of funds for administrative costs. Agencies must include a plan to reduce class size by hiring qualified teachers in their funding application. No funds can be used to pay salaries for uncertified or unqualified teachers. The funds available under this section can only be used to pay the salary of fully qualified teachers, who have obtained certification or passed the State licensing exam and hold a license. The term 'certified' includes certification through State or local alternative routes. A fully qualified teacher at the elementary or secondary school level must hold a bachelor's degree and demonstrate high competency in all subject areas through performance on a test or completion of an academic major in each subject area. Authorization of appropriations for this part includes $2 billion for fiscal year 2002 and necessary funds for fiscal years 2003 through 2006."
