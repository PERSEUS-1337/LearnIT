    "title": "SB 445",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 48852.7 of the Education Code states that homeless children have the right to continue their education in their school of origin even if they change residences. If a homeless child's status changes during the academic year, they can still attend their original school until graduation if in high school, or until the end of the school year if in kindergarten to 8th grade. To ensure homeless children can continue their education in their original school district, they can matriculate with their peers according to feeder patterns. If transitioning between grade levels, they can stay in the same attendance area. If moving to a middle or high school in a different district, they can attend the designated school for matriculation. The new school must enroll homeless children immediately, even if they have outstanding fees or are missing required documents like academic records or proof of immunization. This section does not override laws for special education services. The federal McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act governs transportation and dispute resolution for homeless children and their school of origin. This section clarifies that a school district is not required to provide transportation for a former homeless child with an individualized education program that does not necessitate transportation, unless deemed necessary by the program team or mandated by the McKinney-Vento Act. The district may choose to offer transportation for homeless children to attend school, but it is not mandatory under this section. The definition of \"homeless child\" and \"school of origin\" is provided in this section, with the school of origin being determined in the best interests of the child by the educational liaison and the person making educational decisions for the child. Section 48859 of the Education Code is amended to define terms like \"county placing agency,\" \"educational authority,\" and \"local educational agency.\" If the Commission on State Mandates finds this act imposes state-mandated costs, reimbursement to local agencies and school districts will follow government guidelines."
