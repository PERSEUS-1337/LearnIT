    "content": "Intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) systems are crucial for defense planning and arms control negotiations. They provide policymakers with information on foreign military capabilities, defense sites, weapons of mass destruction, and terrorist activities. Military commanders rely on ISR for enemy positions and precise targeting in counterterrorism operations. Major ISR systems, including reconnaissance satellites and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, are used by both military commanders and policymakers to monitor combat areas closely. Acquisition of ISR systems, including reconnaissance satellites, Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS), and manned aircraft, presents challenges to the intelligence community, Department of Defense (DOD), and Congress. Different acquisition approaches are needed due to costs, technology changes, and the complexity of linking systems together. ISR satellites rely on launch platforms for deployment. ISR satellites, including UAS, require coordination with national space efforts managed by federal agencies outside DOD and the intelligence community. UAS acquisition efforts have faced challenges with introducing new capabilities, causing delays and cost growth. Centralizing UAS acquisition under an executive agent has been proposed but not implemented, as each service has unique requirements for UAS procurement. Acquisition of UAS has led to excessive costs due to duplicative capabilities. Manned aircraft also compete for funding, leading to piecemeal acquisition efforts and cost overruns. Congressional oversight further complicates ISR programs, resulting in production delays and an inability to effectively link disparate systems for comprehensive intelligence. Observers and key Members of Congress suggest the need for a multi-year plan for ISR acquisition to address production delays and cost overruns. Advocates believe a structured plan could control costs, consider all requirements, and optimize the mix of satellites and unmanned systems. However, skeptics argue that dynamic technologies and changing international environments may limit the effectiveness of multi-year procurement efforts. The need for a multi-year plan for ISR acquisition is suggested to address production delays and cost overruns. Efforts to acquire, deploy, and operate ISR systems were driven by the need to gain insights into Soviet military capabilities during the Cold War. National organizations like the NRO, NSA, and CIA were established to gather and analyze information for senior policymakers. The ability to gauge Soviet strategic capabilities was crucial for defense planning and arms control negotiations. Beginning in 1991 with Desert Shield, national-level intelligence systems were adapted for tactical use in combat operations in Iraq, Bosnia, Kosovo, Afghanistan, and other locations. These systems were originally intended for arms control negotiations but have since been utilized for intensive intelligence support in combat and peacekeeping operations. The need for precise target data has led to the successful employment of newer ISR systems, including unmanned aerial systems (UAS), which have proven to be valuable for ground commanders due to their relatively low cost. Unmanned aerial systems (UAS) have been used since the early 1990s for tactical intelligence, ranging from small systems for short-range operations to high-altitude Global Hawk. The potential coordination between UAS and national satellites has raised concerns about organizational and congressional oversight. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates highlighted the shift in U.S. strategic planning in 2009, influencing budget proposals for FY2010. The budget proposals for FY2010 were influenced by Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, who emphasized the need to reevaluate the equipment and capabilities necessary for future military operations. This included considering the specialized equipment required for stability and counterinsurgency missions. Secretary Gates emphasized the need to reevaluate equipment for future military operations, including specialized capabilities for stability and counterinsurgency missions. He sees ISR support as a significant challenge for policymakers, with military operations increasingly reliant on real-time ISR data due to commitments in Iraq and Afghanistan. Military priorities have shaped the types of intelligence collection systems needed. The February 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) Report emphasized the need for a whole-of-government capability to succeed in counterinsurgency, stability, and counterterrorism operations in various environments. These operations require a range of capabilities from America's Armed Forces and other departments, not just a single Military Department. The QDR emphasizes the need for capabilities in counterinsurgency, stability, and counterterrorism operations. DOD focuses on key enablers like unmanned aircraft systems and manned aircraft systems. ISR systems are acquired separately and requests come to Congress in different ways. The National Intelligence Program (NIP) and Military Intelligence Program (MIP) are separate systems with disjointed funding and acquisition processes. NIP is for national policymakers, while MIP is for military commanders. Both can support each other's operations. Satellites traditionally fall under NIP, but some are now part of MIP. Most unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) and manned aircraft are under MIP. The most expensive ISR system has been surveillance satellites, developed by the NRO in secret with minimal oversight, contributing significantly to U.S. defense policies during the Cold War. The end of the Cold War reduced the need for satellite reconnaissance, leading to a decrease in intelligence budgets in the 1990s. There is tension between acquiring new satellite technologies and maintaining existing capabilities. Trying to push technological boundaries can be disruptive, and large Cold War-era systems have drawbacks. Satellite acquisition is complex due to the outdated approach of buying one-size-fits-all systems that do not meet the diverse needs of different operational tempos. Deploying small satellite constellations leaves the nation vulnerable to adversaries targeting the systems. There is overlap between satellite and airborne reconnaissance systems. The acquisition and operations of reconnaissance satellites overlap with other satellite systems used for meteorology and communications. The U.S. space sector plays a crucial role in the economy by supporting commercial, scientific, and military applications. The global Positioning System (GPS) is a leading example of space technology that impacts everyday life. Other common space-based services include weather services, data, communications, and television broadcasts. The U.S. commercial satellite service and space infrastructure sector is a $170 billion annual business. High-altitude UAS have potential to meet satellite requirements, suggesting a shift in funds. The Space Based Infrared System (SBIRS) shows cost risks in satellite acquisition. The SBIRS program, focused on a space-based missile warning satellite, has exceeded its original $3 billion cost estimate by $7.5 billion, now totaling around $10 billion. National satellites are expensive, costing over $1 billion each, not including associated ground support and analytical efforts. The pursuit of new technologies leads to costly satellite systems, with some arguing that costs are unnecessarily inflated. Since the passage of the Land Remote Sensing Policy Act of 1992 (P.L. 102-555), commercial imaging satellites have been launched, with federal agencies as major customers. Commercial imagery can save the government money by meeting specific requirements, but imagery companies heavily rely on government contracts. Changes in imagery procurement can have significant implications. The government heavily relies on commercial imagery for contracts, with changes in procurement having significant implications. The Future Imagery Architecture (FIA) project faced funding cancellation in 2005 due to delivery and budget issues, attributed to inexperienced contractors and tight controls without proper oversight. Dennis Blair, the newly appointed DNI in April 2009, announced a plan to modernize satellite imagery architecture by increasing acquisition from U.S. commercial providers and utilizing less-complex satellites to avoid past issues. Some members, like Senator Christopher Bond, criticized the plan for potential missed opportunities. The Administration proposed a plan to modernize satellite imagery architecture by using highly sophisticated satellites based on proven technologies. Senator Bond's alternative proposal included smaller, less expensive satellites with cutting-edge technologies. Funding for the acquisition of larger satellites was included in defense authorization and appropriations measures for FY2010. The National Security Space Office (NSSO) was created in 2004 to oversee space surveillance acquisition efforts, but it remains an advisory body without authority to define programs. An Executive Agent for Space was established in 2003 but was abandoned in 2005 due to ongoing acquisition problems. The Defense Appropriation Act in 2009 allocated $7 million for a Space and Intelligence Office within the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics. This new office is tasked with space architecture planning and providing a roadmap to Congress in mid-2010. Despite efforts to make information available for tactical use, collection priorities for NRO satellites are determined by the DNI, limiting combatant commanders' ability to prioritize their requirements. The Defense Appropriation Act in 2009 allocated funds for a Space and Intelligence Office to improve satellite support for combatant commanders. Efforts were made to acquire satellites independently of the NRO through Operationally Responsive Space (ORS) to provide quicker and more cost-effective satellite support. Some concerns were raised about potential duplication of existing satellite programs. The Operationally Responsive Space (ORS) program has been criticized for potentially duplicating NRO satellite capabilities and lacking clear definition and communication with key stakeholders, including the intelligence community. The GAO highlighted concerns about the program's development and communication processes. The Operationally Responsive Space (ORS) program has gained support in the Defense Department and Congress, with funding not meeting the Air Force's initial vision. The program offers a just-in-time capability tailored for missions of limited duration, using available technologies from the commercial sector. The Administration requested $112.9 million for FY2010, an increase from the previous year but less than the original ORS budget. The ORS program received less funding than originally envisioned, with Defense officials believing further satellites will be approved if the first one is successful. Despite limited funds for FY2011, support for ORS remains strong in Congress, with additional funding proposed in both the House and Senate bills. In April 2009, testimony of Josh Hartman outlined a balanced architecture for the ORS program, emphasizing a change in the business model to enable employment of a distributed architecture with multiple nodes and layers. This model would provide foundational capabilities from medium or large systems, while smaller, agile systems would be layered to augment in optimized orbits and provide additional capabilities in high demand areas or crisis situations. The evolution of capability would be a key tenet of this approach. The ORS program emphasizes the evolution of capability, with systems designed for shorter lives to reduce complexity and take advantage of advancing technology. The ORS-1 satellite, launched in June 2011, featured a modified sensor similar to that used on the U-2 Dragon Lady aircraft. It was declared operationally capable in January 2012, just 32 months after conceptualization. DOD is exploring other satellite systems for potential cost savings over NRO-led efforts. Some companies aim to provide cost-effective satellite imagery systems, potentially saving money compared to NRO-led efforts. However, the ORS program may not be fully utilizing the expertise of organizations like NRO and NGA, which could lead to wasted resources and duplication of efforts. It is important to consider innovative technologies that can support military operations at reasonable costs. Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) have become crucial in military operations, especially during conflicts like Desert Storm, Iraq, and Afghanistan. The availability of UAVs like the MQ-1 Predator and MQ-9 Reaper has made them preferred tactical weapons. Global Hawks are also used for combat operations, providing valuable information through improved communication systems. The history of UAV acquisition has been complex, with key developments during the Reagan Administration and the establishment of the Defense Airborne Reconnaissance Office (DARO) to manage UAV acquisition. Congress directed the transfer of DARO functions to separate military departments in the FY1998 Defense Authorization Act. Consideration has been given to designating one service as an executive agent for UAV. In recent years, the use of UAVs has increased significantly, especially in Iraq and Afghanistan, to identify enemies and prevent civilian casualties. The number of deployed UAS has grown from 167 in 2002 to over 6,000 in 2008, with defense investment in UAS capabilities rising from $284 million in 2000 to $2.5 billion in 2008. The FY2011 request was for $4.1 billion, reflecting the continuing need for tactical systems like UAVs. The DOD realigned budget priorities to focus on tactical ISR systems, including UAVs and manned platforms. Funding was recommended for 50 continuous orbits for Predator or Reaper-class UAVs, increasing to 65 orbits in 2012. Secretary Gates aimed to incorporate ISR programs into base budgets and emphasized research and development on systems linking warfighters and national systems. The most commonly used UAV systems, Predators and Reapers, are designed for tactical use, with the Predator flying at altitudes up to 25,000 feet and the Reaper at 50,000 feet. Some UAVs like the Global Hawk can fly higher and longer than reconnaissance satellites. Development costs of UAS have exceeded initial estimates, with the Global Hawk growing by 284%, the Reaper by 97%, the Shadow by 80%, and the Predator by 60%. The increasing use of UAS and other mobile ISR systems requires varied communications support, including reliance on communications satellites for \"reach back\" from tactical units to intelligence centers. This leads to increased requirements for acquiring communications satellites and systems for tactical communications, with a focus on Internet-based systems. The study emphasized the need for Internet-based systems for small units engaged with the enemy. UAS are procured by all four services, with efforts to encourage shared use. Despite some initiatives, the Air Force's 2007 initiative to be the executive agent for medium and high-altitude UAVs was not approved. The Marine Corps and Navy have successfully utilized existing systems from other services to meet their requirements and save costs. The GAO has urged the DOD to conduct a thorough analysis of UAS requirements to identify commonalities and develop a strategy for making systems and subsystems more common. Concerns were raised about cost growth in UAS programs, with development cost estimates for UAV programs increasing significantly. The GAO highlighted the benefits of designing compatible unmanned systems that are effectively linked together. The Air Force announced its \"Unmanned Aircraft Systems Flight Plan, 2009-2047,\" describing a family of UAS with interoperable, modular payloads. Manned surveillance aircraft are still used for various missions, while older systems are being replaced, such as the Navy acquiring P-8 Poseidon aircraft to replace aging P-3s. The Air Force is considering replacing the E-8 JSTARS aircraft with over 100 P-8 Poseidon maritime surveillance aircraft. The P-8, a modified Boeing 737-800, is reliable and can be equipped with different sensor systems. The Army is also exploring the development of intelligence-gathering airships. Acquiring manned aircraft follows established procedures, with Congressional oversight shared between the Armed Services and Intelligence committees. In April 2008, Secretary of Defense Gates established a task force to recommend solutions for increased ISR to ground forces in the U.S. Central Command area. Gates criticized the services for not providing resources needed on the battlefield and directed for more innovative ways to help troops. The Air Force's response to this directive is being considered. The Air Force's rapid response to the Secretary's demand for increased ISR capabilities led to the creation of \"Project Liberty,\" involving the modification of Beechcraft King Air 350 aircraft. By November 2008, a $171 million contract was signed with Hawker Beechcraft Corporation, and the first aircraft was delivered four months later. The MC-12 fleet became operational by December 2009, with three expeditionary squadrons deployed within 18 months. Project Liberty involved the rapid delivery of MC-12 aircraft to Iraq and Afghanistan, becoming the most heavily tasked manned airframe in the combat Air Force. Public controversy surrounds ISR acquisition efforts due to limited unclassified information, with outside reviews faulting organizational arrangements. Space systems for national purposes are currently organized across various organizations within the Office of the Secretary of Defense, including NRO and SMC. There is a lack of a lower-level coordination mechanism to resolve differences in requirements and resources. The NRO and SMC have parallel requirements and funding paths within the IC and DOD. There is no common authority below the Secretary of Defense to integrate space acquisition programs and resources within DOD. Coordination for space operations between DOD and the intelligence community is improving. The Independent Assessment Panel recommended establishing a National Security Space Authority to oversee the space budget for DOD and the intelligence community. This authority would also lead a National Security Space Organization, combining Air Force space offices with the NRO. The House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence also assessed U.S. space capabilities in 2008. The House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence conducted an assessment of U.S. space capabilities in 2008, concluding that the United States is \"losing its preeminence in space.\" The report emphasized the need for an integrated overhead roadmap or architecture based on securing prioritized national security interests, balancing financial investment against risk, and transitioning from a requirements-based acquisition approach to a capabilities-based strategy. Executive branch officials believed they had a plan, but committee members disagreed. The House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence disagreed with executive branch officials, stating that there is no comprehensive space architecture or strategic plan accommodating national security priorities. They highlighted the issue of adding requirements during acquisition, leading to increased costs and delays. The committee also raised concerns about the use of cutting-edge technologies, suggesting that uncertainty and the need for further testing complicate the acquisition process. Additionally, there were references to developing space systems solely for operational commanders, which the committee believed was not in the best interest of the country. The House report recommended prioritizing R&D as a national security measure and protecting it from diversion to immediate operational needs. Concerns were raised about jointly funded programs in the National Intelligence Program (NIP) and the Military Intelligence Program (MIP), with overlap between the two systems leading to potential misuse of funds. The report also addressed the use of commercial imagery and regulations governing space commerce. Members of the committee's minority criticized aspects of the report. The minority members of the committee criticized the report for not emphasizing the importance of integrated ground systems for intelligence gathering. A task force recommended integrating data from multiple sensors to improve ISR efforts, highlighting structural issues that complicate data integration. The task force suggested including meta-data to allow for the identification of specific information. The task force emphasized better ways to access and analyze data due to the vast expansion in available data. They favored integrating data from multiple sensors to improve performance but face challenges with inconsistent meta-data and tags. Military commanders require more intelligence, especially tactical imagery, but struggle to access data across the intelligence community. There are backlogs for translators and image analysts due to the overwhelming amount of data. The task force highlighted challenges in accessing and analyzing vast amounts of data, including backlogs for translators and image interpreters. They emphasized the need for better ways for tactical commanders to access information on the move, pointing out the advantages of the Global Information Grid for communication and data sharing. The task force emphasized the importance of accessible communications for tactical commanders, advocating for interoperable systems to support joint and international operations. They stressed the need for sufficient communications capabilities to match the proliferation of platforms and sensors. The task force highlighted the imbalance between airborne ISR collection capabilities and supporting communications, expressing concerns about decision-making processes affecting space programs. There is a perception that intelligence officials may not have the authority to balance national and tactical requirements effectively. The report criticized the lack of trained government program managers for acquisition initiatives, citing short tours of duty and over-reliance on advisory contractors. This lack of expertise contributes to delays and costly changes in specifications. Additionally, there is a decline in students pursuing engineering degrees and reluctance to enter the satellite industry due to repetitive work. The focus on current missions may deter students interested in cutting-edge R&D. Government Accountability Office (GAO) emphasized the importance of a formal space plan based on a national security space strategy to manage space systems acquisitions effectively. Without a strategy, the defense and intelligence communities may make independent decisions not aligned with national priorities, leading to gaps and redundancies in space operations. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) highlighted issues in DOD's space programs, including optimistic scheduling, overpromising, and starting programs too early without assurance of success. DOD also tends to favor fewer but larger satellites over constellations of smaller satellites, leading to problems with requirements creep and poor contractor performance. GAO recommended best practices for commercial space programs. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) highlighted poor contractor performance in DOD's space programs and recommended best practices from the commercial sector to improve acquisition processes and coordination of military and intelligence space efforts. The GAO expressed concerns about information sharing within combat theaters and recommended DOD establish a concept of operations for intelligence sharing. The Obama Administration's approach to ISR acquisition involves acquiring reconnaissance platforms based on existing technologies. Defense Secretary Gates was frustrated by reports in April 2008. In April 2008, Defense Secretary Gates established an ISR Task Force to address inadequate numbers of UAVs in the field. The Task Force made recommendations to maximize system availability and acquire additional systems. In April 2009, Secretary Gates forwarded plans for ISR programs in the FY2010 budget to enhance capabilities for current and future scenarios, including increasing ISR support by $2 billion. The Administration's proposal includes increasing ISR support by $2 billion, which will involve fielding and sustaining 65 continuous RPA orbits with the ability to increase to 85. This represents a 62% increase in capability over the current level and 127% from over a year ago. Efforts will focus on increasing manned ISR capabilities, maintaining existing aircraft projects, and initiating research and development on ISR enhancements optimized for today's battlefield. The proposal does not include acquiring \"exquisite\" satellite technologies that are still in the research and development stage. In FY2010, the Obama Administration ordered a review of national space policy and the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO). A new charter for the NRO was deemed necessary, with organizing principles endorsed by the DNI and Secretary of Defense in March 2010. Director of National Intelligence Jim Clapper made announcements on September 21, 2010 regarding national intelligence assets. The newest NRO charter, signed in 2010, formalizes the Director's role in managing NRO programs and advising the Secretary of Defense and DNI. It grants direct access to the Director for both officials. Additional funding of $2.6 billion was allocated for contingency operations in Afghanistan and Iraq, with a focus on doubling procurement of MQ-9 Reapers. ISR funding for combat operations increased from $5.9 billion in FY2010 to $7.0 billion in FY2011. The oversight of surveillance systems acquisition poses challenges, with ISR systems overseen by various committees. Differences among committees exist regarding satellite and UAS programs. Frustration exists over cost growth, duplication of effort, and potential inadequate collection in ISR systems. The absence of intelligence authorization legislation for over five years has led to congressional oversight primarily by the appropriations and armed services committees, rather than the intelligence committees. Congress has emphasized the need for a more comprehensive approach to ISR systems, with a lack of an integrated architecture being a key concern. Members of Congress have repeatedly requested an architectural plan from the Administration. The lack of an integrated architecture for ISR systems has been a key concern for Congress. The HPSCI majority recommended developing a common architecture for all space-related systems to prioritize national and military needs. The goal is to have a clearly defined plan that takes budgetary constraints into consideration. Some suggest a \"dynamic architecture\" for judicious investment in existing technologies while allowing for new technology introductions and adaptations to military or diplomatic needs. The Duncan Hunter Defense Authorization Act for FY2009 directed a comprehensive review of U.S. space policy, including space-based intelligence and surveillance programs. This review was to describe current and planned space acquisition programs, to be conducted in conjunction with a national-level space policy review. The DOD's Space Posture Review will be issued, with plans for an interim report detailing current posture and programs. The FY2009 Defense Authorization Act required the Secretary of Defense to establish a policy and acquisition strategy for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance payloads for aerial vehicle systems. Additionally, DOD was directed to provide a classified report on deploying additional ISR capabilities to support combat operations in Afghanistan. The House Appropriations Committee directed the DOD and the DNI to prepare a long-range plan for space system investment, including research, development, and procurement for national security space systems. This led to the mandate for DOD to deliver a 15-Year Space System Investment Strategy by May 2010, raising questions about using space platforms to support national security goals. The House Intelligence Committee recommended developing a common architecture for space-related systems and urged organizations to align new satellite proposals with this architecture. The Senate Appropriations Committee expressed concern about temporary acquisition initiatives evolving into bureaucratic structures with unclear mandates. Section 911 of the FY2011 Defense Authorization bill addressed deficiencies in the acquisitions process. The FY2011 Defense Authorization bill, P.L. 111-383, mandates the development of an integrated process for national security space architecture planning by the Secretary of Defense and the DNI. This effort aims to provide recommendations for defense and intelligence acquisitions, coordinating with military departments and intelligence agencies to avoid isolated efforts. The House Armed Services Committee emphasizes the need for integrated space architecture planning to prevent stove-piped initiatives. The committee endorses efforts to expand user access to Operationally Responsive Space (ORS) capabilities and data, providing benchmarks for Congress to consider in annual legislation. Concerns about ISR issues, particularly expensive space systems, persist in Congress. The House version of the FY2012 defense appropriations bill includes a provision mandating the establishment of a major program category for space in future defense programs. Various alternative systems have been suggested and funded over the past decade. Several alternative systems were developed but ultimately terminated due to cost or complexity. Congressional approval was indicated for block buys of satellites based on previous designs. Concerns were raised about the delay in developing a 15-year space strategic plan by the Department of Defense. Sequestration of defense spending was a concern at the end of 2011. Sequestration of defense spending in 2011 led to concerns about major space initiatives being delayed or terminated, including space protection and ISR systems. Congressional reports highlighted the lack of a strategy guiding ISR acquisition and called for a strategic review of current capabilities. Increased demand for persistent ISR resources was also noted. The Department of Defense has faced challenges in acquiring and allocating ISR resources due to fiscal constraints. Congress has not received a formal report on the long-term investment strategy for ISR platforms. Sequestration may further impact major systems acquisition and maintenance of older reconnaissance systems. The President's FY2014 budget request acknowledged the impact of budget constraints on the intelligence community, leading to the termination or reduction of lower priority programs. Efforts are being made to protect the intelligence community workforce, with a focus on ISR systems and expensive collection platforms. The need for a long-range plan for surveillance asset deployment is recognized, although it may be challenging to achieve. Future intelligence requirements may evolve, with a potential shift towards prioritizing the policies and military capabilities of sophisticated nation states. The intelligence community may shift focus towards the capabilities of sophisticated nation states as the highest collection priorities, rather than terrorist groups. Future plans for ISR systems should not be based solely on current technologies. Congress can influence ISR programs through altering roles, missions, and funding allocation. Some observers suggest internal steps within Congress to improve ISR system acquisition, such as giving intelligence committees authorization and appropriations responsibilities. Recommendations include a separate intelligence appropriations act and subcommittees within appropriations committees. Special panels could be set up to oversee ISR programs with representatives from various committees. Complications in ISR systems often stem from executive organization. Many complications in ISR systems arise from executive organization and current policies. The ODNI and DOD play a key role in establishing acquisition plans, with oversight from the National Security Council and Office of Management and Budget. There is a need for an adaptable overhead surveillance architecture, including collection platforms, communications, and data processing systems. The executive and legislative branches face challenges in designing and funding systems that can adapt to new missions within cost constraints. The need for an adaptable overhead surveillance architecture, including collection platforms, communications, and data processing systems, is crucial for maximizing adaptability to new missions within cost constraints. Interagency and inter-branch coordination, along with congressional oversight, are essential in minimizing unnecessary costs and ensuring maximum collection contributions in ISR systems. The unique perspectives of armed services, intelligence, and appropriations committees could provide comprehensive oversight that the executive branch may sometimes lack. Acquiring and using ISR systems is a significant challenge for the U.S. government, requiring effective cooperation among the intelligence community, the Defense Department, and Congress."
