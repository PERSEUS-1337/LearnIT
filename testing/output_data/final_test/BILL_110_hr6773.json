    "content": "The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to include a new section, 25E, which pertains to the Fuel Economy Tax Credit. The Fuel Economy Tax Credit allows individuals to claim a credit against their tax for the taxable year based on the fuel efficiency of a qualified vehicle they placed in service. The credit is calculated by multiplying $100 by each mile per gallon exceeding the CAFE standard. There are limitations based on fuel efficiency, with a maximum rating of 50 miles per gallon, and adjusted gross income. The credit allowed for a qualified vehicle is reduced by 5% for each $1,000 by which the taxpayer's income exceeds $150,000. Definitions for highway rating and qualified vehicle are provided. The CAFE standard refers to the average fuel economy level set under US law. Terms like 'motor vehicle', 'passenger automobile', 'light truck', and 'manufacturer' are defined by the EPA for Clean Air Act purposes. Special rules apply to reduce the basis of property for which a credit is allowed. The subsection (a) credit is reduced by the amount allowed, no double benefit is allowed for deductions or credits, no credit is allowed for property used outside the US, and recapture rules apply for credits on property that ceases. The subsection (a) credit is reduced for property no longer eligible, including recapture for leases. Taxpayers can elect not to take the credit. A clerical amendment is made to the table of sections. The Fuel economy tax credit is terminated for vehicles purchased after the enactment of the subsection. The amendments apply to vehicles placed in service after the enactment of the Act in taxable years ending after that date."
