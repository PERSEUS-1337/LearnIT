    "content": "The \"Transition-to-Success Mentoring Act\" authorizes appropriations for a mentoring program to support educational activities. $50,000,000 is allocated for fiscal year 2018 with additional funding for future years. This program aims to provide mentoring support for successful transitions in education. The Secretary will award grants to eligible entities to establish or support school-based mentoring programs for students transitioning from middle school to high school. Eligible entities must submit an application containing required information. Grant funds must be used to establish or expand mentoring programs in all middle schools served by the entity, assigning each eligible student to a success coach. The student is assigned to a success coach who creates a personalized plan for academic, personal, and career goals in collaboration with teachers, mentors, and parents. The coach also enters into a written agreement with parents to support the student's success and meets with the student regularly. The student's success coach meets monthly to assist in achieving academic goals, identifying weaknesses, providing necessary tools for improvement, ensuring a successful transition to high school, and assisting with behavior management for students with behavioral issues. The success coach meets monthly with students, parents, teachers, or counselors to evaluate progress, set new goals, and advocate for the student. Funding can be used for training programs. The grant program covers training costs for success coaches, materials used in mentoring, and staff hiring. Grants are awarded for up to 5 years, and reporting requirements include submitting annual reports on student participation. The school-based mentoring program funded by the grant includes data on academic achievement, contact hours between students and success coaches, and any other information required by the Secretary for evaluation. The Secretary must submit an interim report to Congress after the third fiscal year to assess the success of the mentoring programs. The Secretary will submit a final report to Congress after the fifth fiscal year, detailing the success of school-based mentoring programs funded under this section. The report will include information on at-risk students, defined as those with below a 2.0 GPA or at risk of academic failure or dropping out of school. The eligible students for the mentoring program may have expressed interest in dropping out of school, show signs of drug or alcohol problems, be pregnant or a parent, have a history with the juvenile justice system, have limited English proficiency, be a gang member, or have high absenteeism rates. Eligible entities include local educational agencies receiving funds under part A of the title or high-need local educational agencies. The mentoring program targets at-risk students in middle schools served by eligible entities, which are partnerships between local educational agencies and nonprofit organizations. High-need local educational agencies serve high-need schools, as defined in section 2211(b)(2), providing middle school education. The curr_chunk discusses the definitions of \"school-based mentoring\" and \"success coach\" in the context of a public charter school providing middle school education. School-based mentoring involves activities coordinated with school staff to assist at-risk students, while a success coach is an individual who supports students in various ways. The curr_chunk discusses the requirements for individuals to become success coaches in mentoring programs, including receiving training and support from eligible entities. The curr_chunk outlines the screening process for individuals becoming success coaches in mentoring programs, including job reference checks, child and domestic abuse record checks, and criminal background checks. The table of contents in the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 is amended to include a new section for the transition-to-success mentoring program."
