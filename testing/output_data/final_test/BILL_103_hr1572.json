    "content": "SEC. 101. GRANTS TO STATES. The Secretary will provide grants to States for implementing and evaluating alternative dispute resolution systems. States must submit an application with details of their intended system, compliance with data gathering requirements, and qualifications for the system to be eligible for the grant. The Secretary will award a minimum of 10 grants each fiscal year for alternative dispute resolution systems that meet qualification standards. The Secretary may award fewer grants if there are not enough eligible applications. States receiving grants will be designated as model alternative dispute resolution States. Upon application, a State designated under paragraph (1) can receive a 2-year extension of the grant. The Secretary will share information on the alternative dispute resolution systems of designated States with other States, healthcare professionals, providers, and interested parties. SEC. 102. ADMINISTRATION. Standards and regulations for Alternative Dispute Resolution Grant Program will be developed by the Secretary in consultation with the Director of the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research. This includes qualification standards for states to receive grants and data gathering requirements. The effectiveness of alternative dispute resolution systems will be considered in developing these standards. The effectiveness of alternative dispute resolution systems in supporting access to healthcare, improving quality, enhancing the physician-patient relationship, encouraging innovation, compensating for avoidable medical injury, resolving claims promptly and fairly, providing predictable outcomes, and operating efficiently in terms of costs and processes will be considered in developing standards and regulations for the Alternative Dispute Resolution Grant Program. The Secretary will provide technical assistance to States for grant applications under section 101, including information on alternative dispute resolution systems. A report evaluating the impact of these systems on healthcare costs and access must be submitted to Congress within 4 years of awarding the first grant. The curr_chunk discusses the impact of alternative dispute resolution systems on individuals' access to healthcare and the quality of healthcare provided within a State. It also includes an analysis of the feasibility and desirability of establishing a national alternative dispute resolution system. TITLE II--UNIFORM STANDARDS FOR MALPRACTICE CLAIMS\n\nSEC. 201. APPLICABILITY.\n\n    Applies to health care liability actions in Federal or State courts and medical malpractice or product liability claims under alternative dispute resolution systems.\n\nSEC. 202. CALCULATION AND PAYMENT OF DAMAGES. (a) Periodic Payments for Future Losses.--Damages for future expenses are limited to $100,000 per payment and can be made periodically. The court determines payment periods based on expense projections.\n(b) Limitation on Noneconomic Losses.--Damages for noneconomic losses cannot exceed $250,000 for an individual and their family members, regardless of the number of parties involved.\n(c) Mandatory Offsets for Damages Paid by a Collateral Source. (c) Mandatory Offsets for Damages Paid by a Collateral Source. The total amount of damages received by an individual shall be reduced by any other payment made to compensate for the injury, minus the amount paid by the individual. Attorney's fees for a claimant may not exceed 25 percent of the first $150,000 of any award or settlement, or 15 percent of any additional amounts. Punitive damages are limited to twice the total compensatory damages awarded, regardless of the number of parties involved in the claim. The curr_chunk discusses the party bringing the action or claim and the number of actions or claims related to the injury. SEC. 203 states that liability for noneconomic losses is several only, not joint, with each defendant liable for their allocated percentage of responsibility. SEC. 204 discusses a uniform statute of limitations. SEC. 204 establishes a uniform statute of limitations for medical malpractice and medical product liability claims. Claims must be initiated within 2 years of discovering the injury or when it should have been reasonably discovered, with a maximum limit of 4 years from the date of the injury. Minors have a special provision where claims must be filed within 2 years of discovering the injury or by the time the minor turns 10 years old. Special provision for obstetric services: In cases of medical malpractice or product liability claims related to labor or delivery, if the defendant did not previously treat the plaintiff for pregnancy, malpractice must be proven by clear and convincing evidence for damages to be assessed. Health care professionals in group practices or agreements are considered to have treated the individual for pregnancy. SEC. 206 establishes a standard of reasonableness for determining negligence in malpractice cases, with an exception for actions under strict liability. SEC. 207 imposes restrictions on punitive damages in medical product liability claims. Restrictions on punitive damages for medical product liability claims apply if the drug or device was approved by the FDA regarding safety or packaging. The FDA approval of a medical product determines the adequacy of packaging and labeling. If clear evidence shows that information was withheld or misrepresented to the FDA, punitive damages restrictions do not apply. The FDA approval of a medical product determines packaging and labeling adequacy. In a health care liability action, the trier of fact may consider punitive damages separately, including illegal payments to FDA officials for drug approval. In a health care liability action, punitive damages can be considered separately, with evidence relevant only to punitive damages being inadmissible in proceedings for compensatory damages. The amount of punitive damages assessed for a medical product liability claim is determined by factors such as the financial condition of the producer and the severity of harm caused. The factors considered for determining punitive damages in a medical product liability claim include the duration and profitability of the conduct, number of products sold, awards to others, criminal penalties, and civil fines imposed on the producer. SEC. 208 states that federal courts do not have jurisdiction over health care liability actions based on specific sections of the United States Code. SEC. 209 addresses preemption. This title supersedes State laws if they allow for greater damages, attorneys' fees, longer claim initiation periods, or less strict proof standards than this title. It does not affect sovereign immunity defenses or choice of law/venue. The Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 preempts State choice-of-law rules for claims by foreign nations or citizens, and does not affect court venue transfer or application of foreign law for claims by foreign nations or citizens. HR 1572 IH is a bill related to foreign sovereign immunities."
