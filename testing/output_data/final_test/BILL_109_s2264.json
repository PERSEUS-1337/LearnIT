    "content": "The \"Consumer Phone Record Security Act of 2006\" includes provisions for fraud and related activities in connection with obtaining customer proprietary network information. Enforcement is carried out by the Federal Trade Commission, Federal Communications Commission, and States, with provisions for consumer redress and protection of customer information. Unauthorized access or use of customer proprietary network information is prohibited, including obtaining it through false means or causing its disclosure without authorization. This is enforced by various agencies under the \"Consumer Phone Record Security Act of 2006.\" Unauthorized sale or solicitation of customer proprietary network information is prohibited without written authorization. Law enforcement officers are exempt from this restriction when obtaining such information from a telecommunications carrier. In this section, law enforcement officers are allowed to obtain customer proprietary network information from a telecommunications carrier if they are authorized by law and acting within their scope of employment. Definitions for terms like customer proprietary network information, law enforcement officer, and telecommunications carrier are provided. The term \"telecommunications carrier\" is defined in section 222(i)(8) of the Communications Act of 1947. SEC. 3. ENFORCEMENT BY FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION. The Federal Trade Commission enforces the Act, treating violations as unfair or deceptive acts. The Commission has the authority to prevent violations and impose penalties as outlined in the Federal Trade Commission Act. The Act empowers the Commission to enforce penalties for violations, including a civil penalty of up to $11,000 for each violation of section 2. Violations involving customer network proprietary information are treated as separate violations. The Federal Communications Commission will enforce section 2 of the Act, treating violations as violations of the Communications Act of 1934. States are also empowered to enforce the Act. A State can bring a civil action in federal court to enforce the Act or impose civil penalties if it believes its residents' interests are being threatened. The State must notify the FTC and FCC before taking legal action, providing a copy of the complaint if possible. If prior notice is not feasible, the State must notify them immediately upon initiating the action. Upon receiving notice, either Commission may intervene in the civil action, be heard on all matters, and file petitions for appeal. The chief legal officer of a State can still conduct investigations and compel witnesses in bringing a civil action. The action must be brought in a US district court. In a civil action brought in a US district court, process can be served without territorial limits, and individuals involved in the alleged violation can be joined in the action regardless of their residence. SEC. 6. CONSUMER REDRESS. An individual can file a civil action against a violator of customer proprietary network information laws, seeking penalties and additional relief as deemed appropriate by the court. No civil action can be brought against a telecommunications carrier. SEC. 7. PROTECTION OF CUSTOMER PROPRIETARY NETWORK INFORMATION. Section 222 of the Communications Act of 1934 is amended to include protection of Customer Proprietary Network Information. Telecommunications carriers must implement a system to determine authorized access to customer information and ensure personnel are trained on proper use of such information. Telecommunications carriers must maintain records of sales campaigns using customer proprietary network information and disclose instances of information sharing with customers or third parties for at least 1 year. Telecommunications carriers must describe sales or marketing campaigns using customer proprietary network information, establish a supervisory review process for compliance, and require an annual compliance certificate from an officer or agent. Telecommunications carriers must provide a compliance certificate annually to the Commission, along with a plan reflecting their adherence to regulations. The Commission is required to report annually to relevant committees on carriers' compliance with these requirements. The Communications Act of 1934 is amended to include definitions for \"telecommunications carrier\" and \"IP-enabled voice service,\" which refers to real-time voice communications transmitted through customer equipment using TCP/IP protocol for a fee. The Federal Communications Commission will promulgate regulations within 90 days to implement section 222(i)(8) of the Communications Act of 1934, including the application of section 222 with the expanded definition of a telecommunications carrier."
