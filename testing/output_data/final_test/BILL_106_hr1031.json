    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"White Bluffs Protection Act\". The White Bluffs, located on the Columbia River in Washington, are eroding due to the Columbia Basin Project. Federal and local officials have identified the Columbia River and project return flows as factors contributing to the movement of ancient landslide masses in the area. This movement may change the river's course, causing damage to the south shore. The White Bluffs on the Columbia River in Washington are eroding due to the Columbia Basin Project, which is causing damage to the south shore and degrading the quality of the river water. The largest source of water to the White Bluffs is from two canal wasteways, which can be modified to reduce standing water above the bluffs. The Secretary of the Interior, through the Bureau of Reclamation, is authorized to construct a channel for the Wahluke Branch 10 Wasteway and eliminate the White Bluffs Wasteway in Washington to protect the White Bluffs. $4,000,000 is authorized for the construction of the channel and $1,000,000 for eliminating the White Bluffs Wasteway. Additionally, a study of the Wahluke Slope is authorized. The Secretary of the Interior will conduct a study with the National Academy of Sciences to analyze land use options for the Wahluke Slope in Washington, including environmental, economic, and cultural impacts. This study will review existing land use plans and scientific literature. The National Academy of Sciences will assess impacts on water rights, habitat, White Bluffs, local economy, and archeological resources for land use options on the Wahluke Slope in Washington. A report will be submitted to the House of Representatives Committee on Resources within 2 years. The report to be submitted to the House of Representatives and the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources may be based on previous studies including the Hanford Reach conservation study, Hanford Reach protection plan, the \"Red Zone\" study, Hanford remedial action, Wahluke 2000 proposal, and Nature Conservancy inventories. The report to be submitted to Congress by the National Academy of Sciences will include findings, conclusions, and recommendations on future land use options, potentially requiring congressional action. Changes in the management or use of the Wahluke Slope are suspended for one year after the report is submitted. $600,000 is authorized for the study by the Secretary of the Interior."
