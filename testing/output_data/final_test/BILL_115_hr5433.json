    "content": "The \"Hack Your State Department Act\" establishes a bug bounty program for the Department of State to identify and report vulnerabilities in exchange for compensation. It defines key terms like bug bounty program, Department, information technology, and Secretary. The Secretary must establish a Vulnerability Disclosure Process (VDP) within 180 days to improve Department cybersecurity by providing guidelines for security researchers to discover and report vulnerabilities in Department IT systems. This process will include identifying which IT systems are included and creating procedures to fix any vulnerabilities found. The Vulnerability Disclosure Process (VDP) must differentiate security vulnerabilities, provide means for reporting, assign responsibilities for addressing reports, consult with the Attorney General for legal protection, and collaborate with relevant Department offices. The VDP will consult with relevant Department of Defense offices, engage with interested parties, and award a contract to manage and remediate security vulnerabilities. Annual reports will be submitted to congressional committees. The Senate's Committee on Foreign Relations will receive a report on the number and severity of security vulnerabilities reported through the VDP, the remediation of previously unidentified vulnerabilities, current outstanding vulnerabilities, average time to remediate, cost savings, and resources utilized. The report to the Senate's Committee on Foreign Relations will include details on resources, surge staffing, roles, and responsibilities for implementing the VDP and addressing security vulnerabilities, as well as any other relevant information determined by the Secretary. The Department of State Bug Bounty Pilot Program is established. The Secretary will establish a bug bounty pilot program within one year to address security vulnerabilities in the Department's internet-facing technology. The program will provide compensation for reports of security flaws and may involve contracting with an entity for remediation. The bug bounty pilot program will address security vulnerabilities in the Department's technology by identifying which information technology should be included, consulting with the Attorney General to protect approved individuals, and collaborating with relevant Department of Defense offices. The bug bounty pilot program aims to address security vulnerabilities in the Department's technology by developing a registration process for approved participants, engaging with interested parties, and consulting with relevant government officials to complement network and vulnerability scans. The bug bounty pilot program for the Department of State's internet-accessible systems will be short-term, lasting no longer than one year. A report on the program, including information on approved participants, will be submitted to the Senate and House committees within 180 days of completion. The bug bounty pilot program for the Department of State's internet-accessible systems will provide information on the number of approved participants, security vulnerabilities reported, remediated vulnerabilities, outstanding vulnerabilities, and average time for remediation. The bug bounty pilot program for the Department of State's internet-accessible systems will focus on security vulnerabilities, compensation types, and lessons learned. The House of Representatives passed the bill on September 25, 2018. Karen L. Haas attested to it as the Clerk."
