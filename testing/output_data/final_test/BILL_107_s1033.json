    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Great Lakes Water Protection Act\". Congress finds that the Great Lakes contain 1/5 of the world's fresh water supply, are home to over 33 million people, support fragile coastal habitats with endangered species, and are crucial for the economies of the Great Lakes States. Oil and gas development in the Great Lakes could threaten the valuable fresh water supply. Oil and gas development in the Great Lakes could expose the valuable fresh water supply of the United States to serious contamination and cause environmental damage to the water and shoreline. The Federal Water Pollution Control Act is amended to address the effects of oil and gas development on the Great Lakes. The section defines key terms related to drilling activity in the Great Lakes, including the National Academy of Sciences, types of drilling activities, and the Great Lakes themselves. The term 'Great Lakes State' refers to states bordering the Great Lakes, and to prevent drilling activity, these states are eligible for incentive grants but must not issue oil or gas permits. The Secretary of the Interior will provide grants to Great Lakes States for conservation activities, including parkland conservation and shore protection. The amount of the grant is determined by multiplying the available funds by a specific ratio. The Secretary of the Interior may provide grants to Great Lakes States for conservation activities, with a maximum aggregate amount of $50,000,000 per fiscal year. The Administrator will conduct a study within 1 year to examine environmental effects of drilling activity on the Great Lakes, including water quality, sediments, wildlife, and public health. The Administrator will consult with various stakeholders and enter into an agreement with the Academy for an independent review of the study results within 180 days of enactment. A report must be submitted to the Academy within 1 year of the study submission. After the study is submitted to the Academy, they will submit the study and a report to the Administrator and Congress. Congress should review the study, conduct hearings on drilling impact, and decide whether to remove certain conditions. Authorization of appropriations is provided for carrying out this section."
