    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"United States Cruise Tourism Act of 1997\". Congress finds it important to maximize economic return from pleasure cruises by promoting new cruise itineraries between coastal cities in the United States and using American goods, labor, and services. There is a need to protect existing employment and economic activity associated with U.S.-flag vessels and to support the reemergence of a U.S.-flag cruise vessel industry. The pleasure cruise industry is rapidly growing, expected to increase by 5% annually. The US-flag ocean cruise fleet only has one vessel touring Hawaii, with all other vessels being foreign-flagged. Prohibiting foreign-flag vessels from cruising between US ports results in lost tourist revenue and disadvantages US ports and coastal communities. SEC. 3. FOREIGN-FLAG CRUISE VESSELS. In this Act, \"coastwise trade\" refers to trade in the Great Lakes and cruise vessels are defined as vessels with luxury accommodations. \"Foreign-flag cruise vessel\" excludes vessels providing ferry services or carrying passengers and cargo for hire. The Secretary of Transportation may approve the transportation of passengers on foreign-flag cruise vessels between United States ports, with exceptions. Repair and maintenance services include alterations and upgrades. The Secretary of Transportation may approve the transportation of passengers on foreign-flag cruise vessels between United States ports, with exceptions, for coastwise trade. United States-flag service can be initiated after approval of a foreign-flag vessel, with a showing to the Secretary by the owner or charterer of a United States-flag cruise vessel. The Secretary may terminate coastwise trade privileges for a foreign-flag cruise vessel within 3 years of notification to the owner or charterer. The termination order is issued in reverse order of notification. The Secretary may terminate coastwise trade privileges for a foreign-flag cruise vessel within 3 years of notification to the owner or charterer, in reverse order of notification based on the vessel's first coastwise sailing date. Passenger-carrying capacity must exceed that of the entering US-flag cruise vessel. Foreign-flag cruise vessels providing coastwise trade service must have repairs and maintenance done in US shipyards, except when necessary at a distant foreign port. Termination of service for these vessels is delayed by 180 days after entering coastwise trade. If the owner or charterer of a foreign-flag cruise vessel fails to meet the repair and maintenance service requirement in US shipyards, their coastwise trade privileges will be terminated by the Secretary, unless waived due to unavailability of services in the US or emergencies. An immigration officer may extend a conditional permit to land for up to 6 months to an alien crewman employed on a vessel if the owner or charterer requests the extension. An immigration officer may extend a conditional permit to land for up to 6 months to an alien crewman employed on a vessel if the owner or charterer requests the extension. The extension is necessary to maintain the vessel in coastwise trade between ports in the United States or via a foreign port. Nothing in this Act affects the authority for transportation of passengers and merchandise in Canadian vessels between ports in Alaska and the United States, or for passenger transportation between Puerto Rico and other U.S. ports. The Jones Act does not affect the Merchant Marine Act, 1920, regarding transportation between Puerto Rico and other U.S. ports."
