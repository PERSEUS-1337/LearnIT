    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Reducing Exposure to Asbestos Database Act of 2015\" or the \"READ Act\". The findings of the Act are also outlined. Congress acknowledges that asbestos is classified as a category A human carcinogen and a class 1 human carcinogen by reputable agencies. Despite efforts to increase transparency about asbestos, misconceptions still exist in the United States regarding its ban and the risk of exposure through new commercial products. Asbestos is still being imported and used in some consumer and industrial products in the United States, including cement corrugated sheet, clothing, roofing felt, and vinyl floor tile. The manufacture and distribution of many asbestos-containing products are not banned in the United States. Consumers and workers are at risk of asbestos exposure from various products such as clutch facings, friction materials, brake pads, gaskets, and coatings. Families of workers are also at risk due to asbestos brought home on their shoes, clothes, skin, and hair. Mesothelioma and other asbestos-related diseases cause an estimated 10,000 deaths in the US annually, with the disease being difficult to detect, diagnose, and treat. Mesothelioma, a cancer caused by asbestos exposure, has poor response to chemotherapy. New treatments show some benefits, but the median survival period is only 1 year after diagnosis, with most patients dying within 2 years. Transparent information on asbestos locations in the US is crucial for consumer and worker protection until a complete ban on asbestos is implemented. SEC. 3. ESTABLISHMENT OF ASBESTOS-CONTAINING PRODUCT DATABASE. The Asbestos Information Act of 1988 is amended to define asbestos-containing product and establish an asbestos-containing product database. The Administrator is required to establish and maintain a public, searchable, and accessible database of asbestos-containing products using available funds. Within 180 days of enactment, a detailed plan for the database's operation, content, maintenance, and functionality must be submitted to Congress. Integration of the database into the overall system is also required. The plan for the database must detail its integration into IT improvement objectives and include an implementation schedule. A public awareness campaign will be conducted to increase awareness. The database must be established within 180 days of submitting the plan. Information on asbestos-containing products must be submitted regularly starting 270 days after enactment. Any person involved in asbestos-containing products must submit a report annually to the Administrator with details like product type, manufacturer, import history, and location. The Administrator requires annual reports from individuals involved in asbestos-containing products, including product details, manufacturer, import history, and locations where the product has been present. Additional information may be requested to help consumers and workers avoid exposure. The database will be organized in a user-friendly manner to serve the public interest. The database for asbestos-containing products must be sortable and accessible by various criteria such as submission date, product name, model name, manufacturer, importer, reporting person, location details, and any other relevant information deemed necessary by the Administrator. SEC. 6. PENALTIES. Any person who knowingly violates reporting requirements regarding asbestos-containing products may be subject to civil penalties of $10,000 per day for non-compliance. Additionally, providing false information or failing to provide required information in reports can result in a civil penalty of $10,000 per violation. The Comptroller General of the United States will submit a report to congressional committees within 2 years of the establishment of the asbestos-containing products database. The report will analyze the database's utility, including consumer usage and effectiveness, as well as efforts to inform the public about the database. The Comptroller General will submit a report to congressional committees within 2 years of the asbestos-containing products database's establishment. The report will analyze the database's utility, consumer usage, effectiveness, and efforts to inform the public. Recommendations will be made to increase consumer use of the database and reduce harm from asbestos exposure, including bans on asbestos-containing products."
