    "title": "SB 1375",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature finds that Title IX aims to promote gender equity in schools, leading to benefits like higher enrollment, increased graduate degrees in science and math, fairer treatment in cases of harassment, and improved career success. Despite being approved in 1972, noncompliance with Title IX remains an issue. Title IX addresses 10 key areas including access to higher education, athletics, career education, and technology. During an informational hearing on Title IX compliance in California's secondary schools, the Senate Judiciary Committee learned that school districts need to appoint Title IX coordinators at both district and school levels. These coordinators should have no conflicts of interest and must establish rules for handling complaints under Title IX. A 2015 ACLU report highlighted the lack of awareness among pupils and school administrators regarding the rights of pregnant and parenting students under Title IX, including access to services for temporary medical conditions. The ACLU report revealed that only 4 percent of school districts included parenting status in their nondiscrimination policies, with 25 percent of students being restricted from extracurricular activities due to pregnancy. Despite Title IX protections, 13 percent of students were forced to move to alternative schools. Title IX has undergone numerous amendments and court cases in its 44-year history, benefiting many women and girls. Public schools, private schools receiving federal funds, school districts, county offices of education, and charter schools must post Title IX coordinator's contact information on their websites by July 1, 2017. The responsibilities of public and private schools under Title IX include providing Internet links to information on rights and responsibilities, as well as details on how to file a complaint, including the statute of limitations. The Superintendent must annually inform schools and education offices about their responsibilities under Title IX, including providing Internet links to complaint procedures and contact information for the Office for Civil Rights. The act allows public schools without a website to post required information on the district or county website. Schools are not required to create a website if they do not already have one. If the act imposes state-mandated costs, reimbursement will be provided to local agencies and school districts."
