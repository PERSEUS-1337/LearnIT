    "content": "The Administration's proposal to reduce the size of the Marine Corps has national security implications that Congress may consider in its oversight and funding roles. Congress determines the force size and funding for the Marine Corps, impacting bases, communities, and defense-related industries. Marines and their families are also affected by downsizing and force structure changes. The Marine Corps is a crisis response expeditionary force that fills the void in the nation's defense structure between light Special Operations Forces and heavier conventional units. They provide scalable and adaptive forces that complement lighter and heavier units, serving as America's amphibious force with missions codified in U.S. Code. The Marine Corps, as outlined in U.S. Code, Title 10, Section 5063, is organized to provide fleet marine forces for naval base operations and land campaigns. They also support naval vessels, protect naval property, and carry out additional duties as directed by the President. The Marine Corps, in coordination with other branches, focuses on amphibious operations, assuring littoral access, crisis response, and security for diplomatic missions. They also handle nuclear, chemical, biological incident response, security cooperation, and presidential security missions. The Marine Corps Reserve, established in 1916, provides trained units and individual Marines for active duty. The Marine Corps Reserve, with an endstrength of 39,600 Marines, consists of various units including infantry regiments, aircraft wing, logistics group, tank units, force reconnaissance, and civil affairs units. They have participated in operations worldwide, including Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom. The Marine Air-Ground Task Force (MAGTF) is the primary organizational construct for military operations, ranging in size from hundreds to thousands of Marines and can be deployed by various means. The Marine Corps Reserve consists of various units including infantry regiments, aircraft wing, logistics group, tank units, force reconnaissance, and civil affairs units. The Marine Air-Ground Task Force (MAGTF) is organized for specific tasks and comprised of four deployable elements: The Command Element (CE), Ground Combat Element (GCE), Aviation Combat Element (ACE), and Logistics Combat Element. The ACE provides support for MAGTF operations including humanitarian and disaster relief missions. The Logistics Combat Element (LCE) is organized to provide combat logistics functions for the Marine Air-Ground Task Force (MAGTF), which consists of four types: Marine Expeditionary Force (MEF), Marine Expeditionary Brigade (MEB), Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU), and Special Purpose MAGTF. The MEF, commanded by a lieutenant general, is the principal warfighting organization for large crises and contingencies, with a personnel range of 40,000 to 80,000 and can vary in size. The Marine Expeditionary Brigade (MEB) is a mid-sized MAGTF commanded by a brigadier general, consisting of 14,000 to 17,000 personnel. It is scalable and can respond to various contingencies, typically deployed on 17 amphibious ships with 30 days of supplies. The MEB includes a reinforced infantry regiment, a composite Marine Aircraft Group, and a Combat Logistics Regiment. A Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU) is a smaller unit compared to a Marine Expeditionary Brigade (MEB), consisting of up to about 2,200 Marines commanded by a Colonel. MEUs deploy with 15 days of supplies after undergoing a six-month training program and certification process. They are trained for various operations including amphibious assault, raid, humanitarian assistance, and more. A Special Purpose Marine Air-Ground Task Force (SPMAGTF) is organized for specific missions such as humanitarian assistance, stability operations, and tactical recovery. They can conduct various operations based on unique mission requirements, with no set size or structure. In 2011, decisions were made by Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Mike Mullen in response to fiscal pressures. In response to fiscal pressures, decisions were made to consolidate and eliminate headquarters, modify weapon systems programs, and reduce force size. The Marines planned to drawdown between 15,000 and 20,000 Marines, aiming to eventually reduce the Marine Corps to 175,000. This was part of a force structure review focused on post-Afghanistan capabilities, crisis response, and power projection while accepting some risk by reducing active component capacity. The Marines planned to reduce the active component capacity from 202,000 to approximately 186,800 after operations in Afghanistan. Key recommendations included reducing infantry battalions, artillery battalions, and flying squadrons, reorganizing Marine logistics groups, and increasing Marine Corps Special Operations Command by over 1,000 Marines. This was part of a new defense strategy unveiled by senior DOD leaders in response to budgetary constraints. The new defense strategy aimed for a smaller, agile military with advanced technology, focusing on key regions like the Asia-Pacific and Middle East. The Marine Corps would become a middleweight expeditionary force with enhanced amphibious capabilities. Key investments in technology and partnerships were prioritized for quick response to aggression. The new defense strategy focused on a smaller, agile military with advanced technology, prioritizing key regions like the Asia-Pacific and Middle East. The Marine Corps would transition to a middleweight expeditionary force with reinvigorated amphibious capabilities. Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel announced a Strategic Choices and Management Review (SCMR) to address budget uncertainty and prepare for potential sequestration in FY2014. The SCMR provided fiscal guidance for FY2015-FY2019 budgets and set the stage for the upcoming Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) to reassess defense strategy amidst new fiscal realities and threats. Secretary Hagel outlined strategic approaches to balance force structure and modernization in the face of sequester-level cuts, including trading off capacity and capability. This could result in a reduction of active Marines from 182,000 to 150,000-175,000. The Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) is currently underway, with specific guidance expected for Marine Corps force size and organization. Results from the 2013 SCMR will heavily influence decisions in the 2014 QDR. Congress is required to conduct an independent review of the QDR's force structure and resource requirements by May 2014. General James Amos testified on the effects of sequestration on the Marine Corps force size optimization. General Amos testified that the Marine Corps' optimal force size of 186.8K was reduced to 182.1K due to budget constraints. After examination, it was determined that an end strength of 174K would best address operational requirements while maintaining readiness. This figure will be used as the basis for the Marine Corps' contribution to national defense, with any decrease posing significant risks to security posture and combat operations. The 174,000 endstrength will guide planning as the QDR process continues. The Marines are considering reducing their force structure to reach an endstrength of 174,000 active Marines by 2017. This could involve eliminating five infantry battalions and limiting their ability to respond to major contingencies. There are concerns that a force size of 150,000 would be too small and unviable for their current missions. Secretary Hagel has suggested a drawdown to between 175,000 - 150,000 active Marines. Secretary of Defense Hagel announced recommendations for the Marine Corps' budget in FY2015, highlighting their agility and crisis response capabilities. The current plan is to reduce the Marines' numbers from 190,000 to 182,000, with a potential further reduction to 175,000 if sequestration-level cuts are reinstated. Additional Marines will be allocated for enhanced embassy security worldwide. Analysts note that the Department of Defense has chosen a higher active endstrength for the Marine Corps at 182,000, compared to the anticipated 174,000. The Marines aim to achieve active duty cuts through attrition and incentives, reducing personnel by about 5,000 per year. To maintain key capabilities, cuts will primarily come from infantry, artillery, and aviation units. Marine officials suggest that if force cuts are accelerated, they may need to reduce to 150,000 active personnel. If force cuts are accelerated, involuntary measures may be needed for the Marines to reach an active endstrength of 150,000. These measures include ending service guarantees for enlisted staff sergeants, convening early retirement boards for senior enlisted Marines, using retention boards to cut Marines early, and implementing selective early retirement boards for lieutenant colonels and colonels. These initiatives are in response to budget constraints and the changing post-Afghanistan world. In response to budget constraints, a new 550-person Marine crisis-response force was created after the Benghazi attack. The force includes a reinforced Marine rifle company, Ospreys, and tanker planes, based in Spain and Italy. This unit can quickly fly for missions like embassy reinforcement and humanitarian assistance. It was put on alert in 2013 during tensions in Egypt and may be expanded to other regions. Additional SPMAGTF-CRs may be established for South America and the Middle East, with uncertain size, location, or timeline. These units are meant to support combatant commanders in crisis response, not as replacements for existing Marine forces. Following the Benghazi attack, Congress authorized 1,000 more Marine security guards starting in FY2014. The National Defense Authorization Act for FY2013 directed the growth of the Marine Security Guard Program to increase detachments at diplomatic posts. The National Defense Authorization Act for FY2013 directed the growth of the Marine Security Guard Program to increase detachments at diplomatic posts by up to 1,000 Marines during fiscal years 2014 through 2017. These additional guards will be assigned to the Marine Corps Embassy Security Group in Quantico, Virginia to augment the current Marine security guards at U.S. diplomatic facilities in over 130 countries, focusing on high threat countries. Additional Marines may be sent to U.S. diplomatic facilities in Africa and the Middle East due to unrest in some countries in the USAFRICOM and USCENTCOM regions. Three posts identified for enhanced Marine presence are Juba, South Sudan; Casablanca, Morocco; and Freetown, Sierra Leone. The Marine Special Operations Command (MARSOC) is realigning its operational battalions to better support geographical combatant commanders, with the 1st MSOB aligning to USPACOM, and the 2nd and 3rd MSOBs aligning with USCENTCOM and USAFRICOM respectively. The Marine Special Operations Command (MARSOC) is realigning its operational battalions to better support geographical combatant commanders. The 1st MSOB will align with USPACOM, and the 2nd and 3rd MSOBs will align with USCENTCOM and USAFRICOM respectively. Language and cultural training will be provided to these units for better operational readiness. MARSOC is also training with the 11th MEU to enable future deployments with Marine expeditionary forces, although a specific integration timeline has not been disclosed yet. The relationship with Marine Force Reconnaissance units, who have been handling special operations missions in the absence of Navy SEALs, is still being established. Marines Corps and other institutions are reevaluating their roles, missions, and force structure. The Marine Corps and other institutions are reevaluating their roles, missions, and force structure. Proposals include U.S. SOF and Marine MAGTFs leading land engagement operations with other countries through training and military exercises. The U.S. Army is focusing on world-wide engagement activities, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region. The article argues that U.S. SOF and Marine MAGTFs should lead engagement activities on land to prevent conflicts or shape their outcomes. They believe that both SOF and Marines have the capabilities for successful ground engagement in complex environments. The Marines are seen as ideal for rapid response to engagement opportunities, humanitarian crises, power projection, and forced entry operations. The Marines are recommended to improve their ability to operate with smaller, highly mobile units for conducting various operations, including low-signature amphibious landings, target designation for airstrikes, naval gunfire, and missile strikes. These units could effectively deal with pirates, non-state terrorist organizations, conduct raids, and train-and-advise friendly military forces in remote environments, aligning with the U.S. strategic intent of \"light footprint\" operations. The Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments study and the Naval War College article support the Marines' need to focus on smaller, highly mobile units at the company to battalion level. This approach aligns with the U.S. strategic intent of \"light footprint\" operations and could be more cost-efficient in a budget-constrained era. The recent creation of SPMAGTF-CRs built around a reinforced Marine rifle company could be a model for lower-level focus in Marine forces. The Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments suggests a littoral operations MAGTF with a reinforced Marine rifle company on an LPD-17 amphibious transport and LCS ships, which would be well-suited for future operational challenges. The contentious issue of Marine Aviation and the need for a dedicated air arm have been debated since the post-World War II unification movement. The Marines argue for their own tactical air force due to the uniqueness of their combined arms team. Suggestions include eliminating high-end fixed-wing aircraft like the F-35B and relying on Navy aircraft for close air support. A more affordable mix of tactical air support using rotary-wing, unmanned platforms, and modified cargo aircraft could be pursued. The Marine Corps is considering a new mix of aircraft, such as Harvest Hawk gunships or modified MV-22 Ospreys, to better align with future contingency operations. Analysts believe the Marines are balancing their identities as a forward-deployed amphibious force, a small-wars force, and a force for major land wars. After years of conflict in Iraq and Afghanistan, the Marines may shift capabilities for major land wars to the reserve component if they focus on a more expeditionary, crisis response force. The Marine Corps is considering shifting major warfighting capabilities to the reserve component, including tank, artillery, and aviation units. This move could be prompted by declining defense budgets and the need to address redundancies between the Marines and the Army during the era of sequestration. The Administration's 2012 strategic shift to the Pacific region could help focus resources and eliminate redundancies between the Marines and the Army. Lt. Gen. George Trautman emphasized the Marines' traditional role in the Pacific for peace and prosperity. The Marines plan to keep a force deployed to Darwin, Australia, as part of the renewed interest in the region. The Marines are deploying forces to Darwin, Australia, and redistributing from Okinawa to Guam and Hawaii. Training is reopening in Thailand and the Philippines. Marines will be used in small packets across the Pacific for various contingencies. Strong partnerships exist with Singapore and South Korea's Marine Corps. The U.S. Army is also asserting itself in the region post Iraq and Afghanistan. The Army is focusing on engagement in the Asia-Pacific region as a priority, aiming to develop a strategic narrative to prevent future personnel cuts. There is a perceived \"turf war\" between the Army and Marines in the Pacific, with the Army asserting its long history in the region. The Marines could be allocated the lead role in the Pacific region, while the Army could focus on another region better suited to its land-centric focus. This reallocation could help avoid redundancy, reduce costs, and allow the Army to allocate resources to areas such as training and maintenance. Assigning the crisis response role to the Marines could lead to cost savings for both the Army and Marine Corps. The Marines have already established a SPMAGTF-CR for the USAFRICOM region and could potentially create additional units. The Chief of Staff of the Army has directed the creation of company-sized unit quick-response forces for each geographic combatant commander, similar to the Marines SPMAGT-CRs. These Army units would need to respond within 18 to 24 hours, but the majority of the Active Army will be based in the continental United States after 2014. In contrast, the Marines plan to station their crisis response units forward in theater for better response time, with their own aircraft for self-deployment. The Marines may \"slim down\" their force to focus on crisis response, natural disasters, protection of diplomatic facilities, and limited combat operations. This could allow the Army to eliminate some crisis response structures and focus on post-crisis operations and land combat. The Army currently has a requirement for 49,000 paratroopers, with the 82nd Airborne Division primarily dedicated to crisis response. The need for an Army airborne assault capability for crisis response may no longer be appropriate given future security challenges. Designating the Marines as the lead service for crisis response could allow both services to focus resources and increase effectiveness. Specialization in crisis response capabilities could be more cost-efficient over time. Marines require forces, ships, and equipment for two MEBs' assault echelons. The Marine Corps published a study on naval amphibious capability, emphasizing the importance of a two brigade amphibious force for ensuring access for the joint force. U.S. Code requires the Marines and Navy to maintain an amphibious assault capability, but the extent of this capability is discretionary. If the Marines focus on smaller operations based on future threats analysis, they may need to adjust their approach. If the Marine Corps reduces its active endstrength to 182,000 or lower, there may be opportunities to adjust force structure to align with future threats. With a strategic shift to the Pacific and a focus on smaller, localized threats, reevaluating the traditional Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU) may be necessary. Marine leadership is considering modifications to adapt to a smaller force and changing security environment. Marine leadership is considering adjustments to the traditional MEU structure to align with future threats and a strategic shift to the Pacific. They are exploring the creation of forward-deployed, land-based SPMAGTF-CRs and a ship-based littoral operations MAGTF with a reinforced Marine rifle company. This smaller MEU construct could allow for more global coverage and focus on company and battalion-sized units for crisis response and security assistance operations. The Marines are considering adjustments to their traditional MEU structure to align with future threats and a strategic shift to the Pacific. One potential benefit could be the elimination or reduction of higher echelon headquarters and support units, facilitating decentralized and distributed operations. This shift also acknowledges the increased capability of smaller units due to technological innovations. One proposed course of action is to place a greater portion of forces and weapons systems suited for major regional conflicts into the Marine Corps Reserve, allowing the Marines to focus on crisis response. The realignment of the Marine Corps could involve placing more expensive systems like tanks and artillery in the Marine Corps Reserves, which would be more cost-effective when not deployed. This rebalancing could potentially prevent cuts in infantry and aviation units if the active endstrength is reduced below 182,000."
