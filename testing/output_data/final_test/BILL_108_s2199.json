    "content": "The \"Family Abduction Prevention Act of 2004\" is the short title of this Act. It includes findings related to family abductions. Congress findings reveal that over 203,000 children in the US are abducted by family members annually, with motives often driven by revenge rather than child safety. These children suffer emotional, psychological, and physical abuse, forced to leave behind everything familiar to them. Children who are victims of family abductions are often manipulated with false information about the non-abducting parent, forced to live in fear of discovery and hide their true identity. They are also denied access to education and healthcare. Family abduction is now recognized as a form of child abuse, yet many law enforcement agencies lack guidelines for handling such cases. The recovery of an abducted child is crucial in the first few hours of a family abduction. Counseling and education for parents can reduce the incidence of family abductions. Flagging school records has proven to be effective in helping law enforcement find abducted children. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, \"family abduction\" refers to the taking, keeping, or concealing of a child by a parent or family member, preventing lawful custody or visitation rights. \"Flagging\" is the process of notifying law enforcement about anyone requesting school records of an abducted child. \"Indian tribe\" includes any organized group or community, including Alaska Native entities. The Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (43 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.) is eligible for special programs and services for Indians. The term \"State\" includes several States, territories, and Indian tribes. Grants to States for projects involving family abduction cases, including extradition, investigation, training of law enforcement, outreach campaigns, and flagging school records. Matching grants require at least 50% non-Federal funding. Authorization of appropriations for the Attorney General: $500,000 for fiscal year 2004 and necessary sums for fiscal years 2005 and 2006."
