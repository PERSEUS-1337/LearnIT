    "content": "The Act titled \"American Automobile Industry Promotion Act of 2007\" includes an Advanced Energy Initiative for Vehicles. The section aims to promote the development and commercialization of electric drive technologies in partnership with industry, make public investments to support innovation and job growth, and expand the electric infrastructure for various vehicles. The section aims to accelerate the commercialization of electric drive vehicle technology, reduce dependence on imported oil, enhance energy security, and improve energy efficiency in transportation. The curr_chunk defines \"battery\" as an energy storage device used in vehicles powered by electricity. It also explains \"electric drive transportation technology\" as vehicles using electric motors for propulsion and may include various types of electric vehicles. The curr_chunk defines an \"engine dominant hybrid electric vehicle\" as a vehicle propelled by an internal combustion engine using combustible fuel and an on-board rechargeable storage device, with no means of using an off-board source of electricity. The curr_chunk defines terms related to different types of vehicles, such as fuel cell vehicle, Initiative, nonroad vehicle, and plug-in hybrid electric vehicle. The curr_chunk defines terms related to different types of vehicles, such as fuel cell vehicle, plug-in hybrid fuel cell vehicle, Industry Alliance, and institution of higher education. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 defines the term \"Secretary\" as the Secretary of Energy. The goals of the electric drive transportation technology program include developing innovative electric drive technology, increasing employment in the US in electric drive design and manufacturing, validating plug-in hybrid potential through fleet demonstrations, and accelerating fuel cell commercialization. The Secretary of Energy is required to assess state-of-the-art battery technologies for electric drive transportation in cooperation with industry and other entities. This assessment will identify knowledge gaps, research areas, and recommend steps to accelerate battery technology development. The Secretary of Energy conducts a program for research and development of battery technologies for electric drive transportation, including high-capacity batteries, charging components, drive train systems, and control system development for hybrid vehicles. The program includes research on clean diesel engines in plug-in hybrid systems, development of control systems for battery optimization, nanomaterial technology for batteries and fuel cells, and large-scale testing of plug-in hybrid vehicles in various applications. The curr_chunk discusses a nationwide education strategy for electric drive transportation technologies and the development of testing procedures for light-, medium-, and heavy-duty vehicle applications. It includes support for education at secondary and high school levels and certification of criteria pollutants, fuel economy, and petroleum use. The curr_chunk discusses the advancement of battery and corded electric transportation technologies in mobile source applications through research, development, and collaboration with industry and the Environmental Protection Agency. The Secretary will establish an Advanced Battery Initiative to support these efforts. The Secretary will establish an Advanced Battery Initiative to support research, development, and commercial application of battery technologies through competitively-selected Industry Alliance representation. Research activities will be conducted through grants to researchers, small businesses, National Laboratories, and institutions of higher education. The Secretary will establish an Advanced Battery Initiative to support research, development, and commercial application of battery technologies through Industry Alliance representation. The Industry Alliance will provide comments on advanced battery technology needs, assess research progress, and update technology roadmaps annually. Information and roadmaps developed will be available to the public, with preference given to Industry Alliance participants in award selection. The Secretary will give preference to Industry Alliance participants. Cost sharing is required as per the Energy Policy Act of 2005. $100,000,000 is authorized for fiscal years 2008 through 2012. SEC. 3. Amends the definition of new advanced lean burn technology motor vehicle credit in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Effective for property purchased after the enactment of this Act. SEC. 4. Addresses biodiesel standards. Section 211 of the Clean Air Act is amended to include biodiesel standards for fuels derived from plant or animal matter. The Environmental Protection Agency established biodiesel standards under the Clean Air Act, including requirements from the American Society of Testing and Materials D6751. Biodiesel includes esters derived from animal waste and municipal solid waste. The term 'biodiesel blend' refers to a mixture of biodiesel and diesel fuel, including blends with approximately 5% biodiesel (B5) and 20% biodiesel content. The Administrator will establish standards for biodiesel blends like B20 within 180 days of the American Automobile Industry Promotion Act of 2007."
