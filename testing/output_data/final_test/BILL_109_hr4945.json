    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Expand and Rebuild America's Schools Act of 2006\". The Congress finds that public school enrollment is projected to reach 53,000,000 in 2010, leading to the need for new school construction. Many districts are using temporary structures and year-round schedules due to increased enrollment. Research shows a link between school facilities' condition and student achievement. Research has indicated that students in schools with poor conditions fall behind by 10.9 percentage points compared to those in excellent buildings. Moving students to new facilities can lead to a 20 percent increase in test scores. States and communities struggle to provide acceptable school facilities, especially in the poorest areas. Difficulty in securing financing for school construction and renovation is common, particularly in states requiring a 2/3 majority for voter approval on bond initiatives. The Federal Government can lower costs for local school infrastructure investment, incentivizing businesses to support improvement efforts. America's global competitiveness relies on properly educating its workforce in 21st-century equipped schools. The Act aims to promote public-private partnerships for school construction financing and to upgrade school facilities to accommodate the increasing student population. It introduces a tax credit for holders of school construction bonds. The Act introduces a tax credit for eligible taxpayers holding school construction bonds, allowing a credit against the tax imposed for the taxable year. The credit amount is determined by the credit rate and the face amount of the bond held by the taxpayer. The credit allowed for any taxable year is limited by the regular tax liability. The tax credit for school construction bonds is determined by the regular tax liability and the face amount of the bond held by the taxpayer. The bond must be issued by a State or local government for a qualified purpose related to a new qualified school. The issuer must designate the bond for this section, certify meeting the private business contribution requirement, have approval from the local education agency, and ensure the bond term does not exceed the maximum allowed. The private business contribution requirement is necessary for the bond issuance. The private business contribution requirement for bond issuance is met if the eligible local education agency has commitments from private entities for contributions worth at least 10% of the bond proceeds, including equipment for the qualified school. The eligible local education agency must provide state-of-the-art technology, vocational equipment, technical assistance for curriculum development, teacher training, mentorship, internships, field trips, and other educational opportunities for students in order to qualify as a \"qualified school\" for bond issuance. The term 'qualified school' refers to a public school established and supervised by an eligible local education agency to provide education below the postsecondary level. The school must be designed in cooperation with businesses to enhance the academic curriculum, increase graduation and employment rates, and better prepare students for college and the workforce. Students in the school must meet the same academic standards and assessments as other students in the local education agency. The Secretary of Education must approve a program to alleviate overcrowding and improve education in a local education agency. Additionally, at least 35% of students attending the public school must be eligible for free or reduced-cost lunches. The lunch program established under the National School Lunch Act requires a 10% student growth rate over the next 5 years and a student-teacher ratio of at least 28 to 1 in the school district. Eligible local education agency refers to any local education agency meeting these criteria. The term 'eligible local education agency' refers to any local educational agency meeting specific criteria outlined in the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. The term 'qualified purpose' pertains to constructing new school facilities and providing equipment for such facilities, excluding athletic stadiums. The national school construction bond limitation is $400,000,000 for 2007 and 2008, allocated among states based on their populations below the poverty line. The national school construction bond limitation is allocated to states based on their populations below the poverty line. The Secretary of Education allocates the limitation amount to qualified schools within each state, with a maximum limit on bonds that can be issued for each school in a calendar year. Unused limitations can be carried over to the following year. The limitation amount for qualified schools in each state is increased by any excess amount for the following year. Definitions from section 1397E apply, and the credit allowed under this section is included in gross income. A conforming amendment is made to the table of sections for subpart B of part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1 of the Code. The amendments made by this section apply to obligations issued after December 31, 2006."
