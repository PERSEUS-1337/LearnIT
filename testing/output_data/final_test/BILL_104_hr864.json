    "content": "The \"American Farm Protection Act of 1995\" is the short title of this Act. It addresses the treatment of land under a qualified conservation easement. The \"American Farm Protection Act of 1995\" addresses the estate tax treatment of land subject to a qualified conservation easement. If the executor elects, the value of such land (minus any debt) can be excluded from the gross estate. This exclusion does not apply to retained development rights. The tax on any retained development right in a qualified conservation easement is only imposed upon property disposition, not gifts or devises. The tax is due on the 15th day of the 4th month after the disposition occurs. The term 'development right' refers to the right to establish or use a structure and surrounding land for commercial purposes not directly supporting conservation or farming activities. The election under this subsection must be made. The election under this subsection must be made on the tax return, and once made, it is irrevocable. The executor must calculate the estate tax on any development right retained in a qualified conservation easement and file a Notice of Potential Estate Tax Due.

This amendment applies to contributions made and easements granted after December 31, 1994."
