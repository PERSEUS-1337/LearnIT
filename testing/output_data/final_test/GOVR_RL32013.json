However, the policy has been modified to require both home-state Senators to return negative blue slips in order to stop a nomination, only if the President has not consulted with them. The report provides a history of the Judiciary Committee's blue-slip custom, related to senatorial courtesy. It describes the creation and modifications of the blue-slip procedure, profiles the committee's policies over 43 Congresses, includes case studies, FAQs, and a concluding analysis on the blue-slip process. Currently, there are two types of blue slips used by Congress. The blue slip is a tool used by Congress, with different versions in the Senate and House of Representatives. It is related to senatorial courtesy, showing deference between Senators. The House version enforces the Origination Clause of the U.S. Constitution. Senatorial courtesy is a Senate tradition where a senator can block a presidential nominee if they find them objectionable. This practice is not always followed, but the Senate usually complies with a senator's request for a temporary delay, known as a hold. The concept extends beyond the Senate and reflects the courtesy a President should show to Senators. Senators must maintain political support to secure additional terms in office. They have a stake in federal appointments and can reward supporters with good posts. Ignoring a senator for appointments damages their prestige. Senators can protect their interests by joining together against the president in appointments. The custom of senatorial courtesy allows Senators to influence presidential appointments to protect their individual interests. While the practice of declaring nominees as \"personally objectionable\" has declined, the blue-slip practice still allows Senators to formally object to nominations. Research in the National Archives and Records Administration reveals the history of the blue slip, based on executive nominations and Senate Judiciary Committee files from the late 19th to mid-20th centuries. The research focused on locating blue slips for each Congress from the 65th to the 83rd, with no slips found for the 64th Congress. Research was also conducted back to the 56th Congress. The research conducted back to the 56th Congress revealed no mention of blue slips. Blue slips are an informal practice unique to the Judiciary Committee, historically used for various nominations. They can block nominations by a negative return or non-return of the slip. Various modifications have been made over the years. The Judiciary Committee uses blue slips for U.S. district court and circuit court nominations. Senators from the nominee's home state receive blue slips to provide feedback. This tradition ensures proportional state representation in circuit court positions. The Judiciary Committee uses blue slips for circuit court nominations, requiring the President to select a nominee from the retiring judge's state. If a negative blue slip is received, the committee can either stop proceedings, give weight to the unfavorable review, or proceed without notice. The blue-slip procedure began in the mid- to late 1910s under Senator Charles A. Culberson's chairmanship. The blue slip procedure for circuit court nominations began in the late 1910s under Senator Charles A. Culberson's chairmanship. Senator Culberson may have created the blue slip, as almost every judicial nominee's file from the 65th Congress onward includes one. The early history of the blue slip is not clearly explained in Judiciary Committee materials at the National Archives. The blue slip procedure for circuit court nominations began in the late 1910s under Senator Charles A. Culberson's chairmanship. The creation of blue slips coincided with the adoption of Senate Rule XXII in 1917, but there was no direct link between the two as cloture did not apply to judicial nominations until 1949. Therefore, the Judiciary Committee did not need to create a blue-slip policy in response to the 1917 Senate rule. The blue slip procedure for circuit court nominations began in the late 1910s under Senator Charles A. Culberson's chairmanship. The basic structure of the blue slip has remained largely unchanged since its creation 86 years ago. Initially, the blue slip was a folded blue paper handed to senators, containing the nomination details and a request for their opinion. This format remained until 1922 when additional instructions were added by Chairman Knute Nelson. The blue slip procedure for circuit court nominations has evolved over time. Initially, there was no time limit for senators to return the blue slip. Senator Strom Thurmond later modified the blue slip to include a one-week deadline for response. Chairman Thurmond also added checkboxes for approval or opposition. In 1998, Chairman Orrin G. Hatch replaced the response deadline with a statement assuming no objection if no reply is received.

Hatch replaced the response deadline with a statement assuming no objection if no reply is received. Shortly after the 2000 elections, Senator Patrick Leahy modified the blue slip procedure by changing the return address and dropping the statement about no further proceedings until both slips are returned. Chairman Leahy modified the blue slip introduction, changing the wording to request opinions on pending nominations. The current blue slip form retains Leahy's phrasing with minor changes. The first instance of a Senator using a blue slip to oppose a judicial nomination was in 1917 when Senator Hardwick objected to President Wilson's nomination of U. V. Whipple. The blue slip process allows Senators to object to judicial nominations, as seen in the case of Senator Hardwick opposing U.V. Whipple's nomination in 1917. The Judiciary Committee's policies on blue slips have varied over the years, making it challenging to determine the exact policy at any given time. The blue-slip policy allows Senators to object to judicial nominations, with variations in practice over the years. A table in the report details the Senate Judiciary Committee's blue slip policy from 1956 onwards, showing changes in policy and the role of home-state Senators. Culberson's blue-slip policy sought the opinion of home-state Senators on judicial nominations. The rule limiting the time to return a blue slip was added in 1922 by Chairman Knute Nelson. Despite negative blue slips, nominations were not automatically vetoed, as seen with U. V. Whipple's case. Senators did not have absolute power to block nominations. The blue-slip policy allowed Senators to express objections to judicial nominations, as seen in examples from Senators Bilbo and Hickenlooper. Despite objections, nominations were not automatically vetoed, showing that Senators did not have absolute power to block nominations. During this time, Senators could express objections to judicial nominations through the blue-slip policy, allowing them to present their case against nominees to the Judiciary Committee. The policy indicated that a negative blue slip did not necessarily prevent committee action but served to inform the chairman of the Senator's views on the nominee for better handling of the nomination review process. During the 84th Congress, Senator James O. Eastland changed the Judiciary Committee's use of blue slips, treating them as absolute vetoes. If a Senator submitted a negative blue slip or failed to return one, all action on the nominee would stop. This policy led to no rejected nominations with negative blue slips being reported to the Senate during Eastland's tenure. During the 96th Congress, Senator Edward M. Kennedy implemented significant changes to the Judiciary Committee's blue-slip policy for judicial nominations. He allowed the full committee to vote on proceeding with a nomination if a Senator failed to return a blue slip, deviating from the previous practice of treating blue slips as absolute vetoes. In 1979, Chairman Kennedy modified the Judiciary Committee's blue-slip policy for judicial nominations. He required both Senators from a nominee's State to return a blue slip with their opinion and information. If a blue slip was not returned, he would allow the full committee to vote on proceeding with the nomination. This change reduced the power of a home-state Senator's objection to automatically stop committee action. Chairman Kennedy made changes to the blue-slip policy for judicial nominations in 1979, requiring both Senators from a nominee's State to return a blue slip. Despite objections from Senator Byrd, the Judiciary Committee proceeded with the nomination of James E. Sheffield to the U.S. District Court for eastern Virginia in 1980, marking the first instance since 1951 of moving forward on a blue-slipped nomination. This decision by Chairman Kennedy signaled a shift in the blue-slip system. Chairman Kennedy modified the blue-slip policy for judicial nominations in 1979, allowing the committee to act on a nomination without a home-state Senator's blue slip. Senator Strom Thurmond considered changing the policy but ultimately maintained it during a Judiciary Committee meeting in 1981. Kennedy's goal was to make the Federal courts more representative of the nation's people while acknowledging the tradition of senatorial courtesy. Chairman Thurmond followed Senator Kennedy's modified blue-slip policy for judicial nominations, allowing a single home-state Senator to stop committee action by returning a negative blue slip. If no objection was raised within seven days, the committee assumed no objection. However, Thurmond emphasized that if either Senator objected, the nomination would not proceed. In 1983, despite Senator Cranston's objection, Chairman Thurmond proceeded with John P. Vukasin Jr.'s nomination for U.S. District judge for northern California, marking the first time since 1951 that the Judiciary Committee voted to report out a nomination despite a home-state Senator's blue slip objection. Vukasin was eventually confirmed by the Senate. In 1985, President Reagan nominated Albert I. Moon Jr. to be a U.S. District judge for Hawaii. Despite opposition from both Hawaii Senators, the Judiciary Committee proceeded with the nomination, marking the first instance of moving forward despite two negative blue slips. The committee held a hearing but took no further action, leading to the Senate returning the nomination on December 20, 1985. Chairman Thurmond changed the blue-slip policy, allowing committee action even with negative blue slips. The Moon nomination was an exception where the chairman moved forward despite two negative blue slips. This shows that the chairman has discretion to change the policy as needed, leading to potential confusion and contradictions in blue-slip policies. Under Biden's chairmanship, the Judiciary Committee continued to follow modified blue-slip policies. Chairman Biden made changes to the blue-slip policy during the 101st Congress, issuing a public statement and sending a letter to President George H.W. Bush outlining the committee's policy. The return of a negative blue slip would be considered in evaluating a judicial nominee, but it would not prevent consideration unless the Administration had not consulted with both home state Senators. This marked the first formal, written statement by a Judiciary Committee chairman on the blue-slip procedure. Chairman Biden changed the blue-slip policy during the 101st Congress, stating that a negative blue slip would not automatically stop committee action. Presidential consultation with home-state Senators could override a negative blue slip. This policy was tested with the 1989 nomination of Vaughn R. Walker, where Senator Cranston returned a negative blue slip but Chairman Biden emphasized the importance of prior consultation in evaluating it. Chairman Biden modified the blue-slip policy during the 101st Congress, indicating that a negative blue slip would not automatically halt committee action. This change was demonstrated during the nomination of Vaughn R. Walker in 1989 when Senator Cranston submitted a negative blue slip. Despite this, Chairman Biden proceeded with the nomination, which was eventually approved by a vote of 11 to 2. Walker was confirmed shortly after on November 22, 1989. Biden also outlined the Judiciary Committee's standards for considering negative blue slips, highlighting the importance of prior consultation with home-state Senators. Chairman Biden and Chairman Hatch both publicly stated the blue-slip policy for pre-nomination selection process, emphasizing the importance of consulting with home-state Senators before considering a nominee. Biden modified the policy during the 101st Congress, indicating that a negative blue slip would not automatically halt committee action. Hatch followed Biden's practice and emphasized the need for consultation with home-state Senators in the appointment process. Chairman Hatch articulated a more detailed account of his blue-slip policy in a 1997 press release, emphasizing the importance of meaningful consultation with the Senate before making significant nominations to avoid confrontations between the Senate and the White House. He highlighted the necessity of cooperation over confrontation in nominations and expressed confidence in the possibility of meaningful consultation. Chairman Hatch outlined five circumstances that could lead the Judiciary Committee to delay or hold up a nomination, emphasizing the importance of consultation and cooperation between the Senate and the White House. After outlining circumstances for delaying nominations, Chairman Hatch faced reports of modifying his blue-slip policy three months into President George W. Bush's administration. This was based on Judiciary Committee meetings in April. During Judiciary Committee meetings in April 2001, Chairman Hatch discussed his blue-slip policy under President Bush, referencing letters from Senator Biden and his own correspondence with White House Counsel Abner Mikva. Senator Biden emphasized the importance of pre-nomination consultation with home state Senators for judicial nominees. Chairman Hatch stressed the need for genuine consultation by the administration before a nomination is made, stating that failure to consult in good faith could result in a negative blue slip from a Senator. Chairman Hatch emphasized the need for genuine pre-nomination consultation with home state Senators for judicial nominees. Failure to consult in good faith could lead to a negative blue slip, which would prevent Committee consideration of a nominee. Senator Durbin questioned this policy, stating that in his experience, one Senator could veto a nomination. Chairman Hatch and Senator Durbin discussed the Senate Judiciary Committee's blue-slip policy, with concerns raised about one Senator being able to stop a nomination. The committee planned to further discuss the blue-slip policy in an upcoming meeting but did not reach an agreement on the policy for the 107th Congress. Chairman Hatch's blue-slip policy in the 107th Congress caused alarm among Democratic Senators, who viewed it as unfair. They criticized Hatch for allowing individual Senators to block nominees during the Clinton Administration. Democratic members of the Judiciary Committee walked out of a meeting scheduled by Chairman Hatch on May 3, 2001. Democratic members of the Judiciary Committee walked out of a meeting because they felt shut out of the judicial nominations process. Senator Leahy criticized Chairman Hatch for changing the blue-slip policy from the Clinton Administration, arguing for consistency regardless of the president's party. Chairman Hatch defended his actions at a Republican news conference. Chairman Hatch defended his actions regarding the blue-slip policy, stating that he continued the policy of his predecessor, Joe Biden, but made changes in 1998 due to conflicts with Republican senators and lack of consultations with the Clinton White House. Chairman Hatch defended the 1998 change in the blue-slip policy, citing conflicts with Republican senators and lack of consultation with the Clinton White House. Senator Leahy took over as Judiciary chairman in 2001 and emphasized the need for Senate consultation in pre-nomination reviews. The letter endorsed the 1997 blue-slip policy statement made by Chairman Hatch, emphasizing the need for the Administration to consider nominees proposed by home state Senators and consult with them and the Judiciary Committee before initiating formal clearance processes. The Administration must notify home state Senators and the Judiciary Committee before clearing a nominee despite objections. Home state Senators and the Judiciary Committee must be given one week's notice before a formal nomination is made. Supporting documentation for the nomination must be sent to the Senate simultaneously. The nominee must cooperate with Senators seeking information. Senator Leahy's policy on blue slips differs from Senator Hatch's. Chairman Leahy's blue-slip policy requires approval from both home state senators before moving forward with a nomination. He allowed Michigan Senators to block all nominations to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals. During the 107th Congress, Senators Levin and Stabenow used their blue slips to block the confirmation of two Sixth Circuit nominations. Chairman Leahy and Ranking Member Hatch agreed to make blue slips public information, believing that transparency would benefit the Judiciary Committee and the Senate. This policy of openness with blue slips will continue in the future. The blue slip process will continue in the future, regardless of the Chairman or party in the Senate. Senator Hatch reinstated a policy where a single negative blue slip won't block a confirmation hearing. Only one home-state Senator needs to return a positive blue slip for the Judiciary Committee to move forward with a nomination. The Administration engages in pre-nomination consultation with home-state Senators. Chairman Hatch granted a hearing for Carolyn Kuhl to be a U.S. Circuit Court judge for the Ninth Circuit, despite only one home-state Senator supporting the nomination. This represents a change in blue slip policies between Chairman Leahy and Chairman Hatch. In the 108th Congress, Chairman Hatch proceeded with the nomination of Henry Saad for U.S. Circuit Court judge for the Sixth Circuit, despite objections from Michigan Senators Levin and Stabenow who had returned negative blue slips. This was a rare occurrence as nominations with two negative blue slips rarely see committee action. The Judiciary Committee's blue-slip policy has varied under different chairmen. The blue slip policy in the Senate Judiciary Committee involves seeking approval or disapproval from both home-state Senators for a nomination. The chairman sends a blue slip form to the Senators, but there are questions about the process, consultation requirements, and variations in chairman policies. The blue slip policy in the Senate Judiciary Committee allows home-state Senators to approve or disapprove of a nomination, giving them a role in selecting individuals who may impact their state. The Senate Committee on the Judiciary is the only committee that currently uses the blue slip, while other committees with review functions on nominations also practice it to varying degrees. The blue-slip policy in the Senate Judiciary Committee allows home-state Senators to approve or disapprove of nominations, giving them a role in selecting individuals who may impact their state. The chairman sets the blue-slip policy at the beginning of each Congress, with the ability to make changes as needed. The current policy states that a negative blue slip will be considered but will not prevent committee action unless the President has not consulted with both home-state Senators. The blue-slip policy in the Senate Judiciary Committee allows home-state Senators to approve or disapprove of nominations. Important dates related to blue slips include: 1917 - first appearance, 1922 - time limit placed, 1956 - first formal change, 1979 - second alteration, 1989 - first public statement, 1998 - time limit removed, 2001 - first time made public. The postponement of a nominee depends on the chairman's policy, either by a negative blue slip return or failure to return a blue slip. Blue slips were made public in the 107th Congress as part of a reorganization agreement. The blue slip policy has evolved over its 86-year history, starting as a way for the Judiciary Committee chairman to gather information on judicial nominations. It transitioned into a tool for home-state Senators to object to nominees they found objectionable. The blue slip eventually became a crucial device for checking the executive branch in the appointment process. Since 1979, it has played a significant role in the nomination process. Since 1979, the impact of negative blue slips in the Senate Committee on the Judiciary has varied with changing leadership. Some chairmen require positive blue slips from both home-state Senators for committee action on a nomination, while others proceed with just one positive blue slip. Recent chairmen emphasize pre-nomination consultation with both Senators and expect the President to involve them in the selection process. Without White House consultation, chairmen give more weight to negative blue slips. The Senate Judiciary Committee chairmen value negative blue slips from non-consulted home-state Senators. While the chairman can control the impact of a negative blue slip, individual Senators can still influence the fate of a judicial nomination. Senators can place holds or filibuster nominations, delaying a vote indefinitely. A negative blue slip is not the only way for a Senator to block a nomination. The report will be updated to reflect policy changes regarding blue slips. Federal Judges: Merit System v. Pork Bench, Washington Post, November 7, 1978, p. A4; and W. Dale Nelson and Fred S.
