    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Arbitration Fairness Act of 2018\". The Federal Arbitration Act, originally intended for disputes between commercial entities, has been expanded by Supreme Court decisions to cover consumer and employment disputes. This extension limits consumer and employee choice, often without their awareness, and undermines public law development due to lack of transparency and judicial review in arbitration. Inadequate judicial review of arbitrators' decisions can be a concern. Arbitration is acceptable when consent is voluntary and occurs after the dispute arises. SEC. 3. ARBITRATION OF EMPLOYMENT, CONSUMER, ANTITRUST, AND CIVIL RIGHTS DISPUTES. Title 9 of the United States Code is amended to include a new chapter on arbitration of various disputes. The new chapter in Title 9 of the United States Code covers arbitration of antitrust and civil rights disputes, defining terms like 'antitrust dispute' and 'civil rights dispute' based on specific criteria. The new chapter in Title 9 of the United States Code covers arbitration of antitrust and civil rights disputes, including statutes prohibiting discrimination based on race, sex, disability, religion, national origin, or any invidious basis in various areas such as education, employment, housing, and voting. It also includes statutes enforced by the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice and those enumerated in section 62(e) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The term 'consumer dispute' refers to a disagreement between an individual seeking property, services, or credit for personal use and the seller or provider. The term 'employment dispute' pertains to conflicts between an employer and employee as defined by the Fair Labor Standards Act. A 'predispute arbitration agreement' is any agreement to arbitrate a future dispute. The agreement to arbitrate a dispute that had not yet arisen at the time of the making of the agreement is not valid or enforceable if it involves an employment dispute, consumer dispute, antitrust dispute, or civil rights dispute. The applicability of this chapter to an agreement to arbitrate and its validity and enforceability shall be determined by a court under Federal law. The chapter does not apply to arbitration provisions in collective bargaining agreements, but employees retain the right to seek judicial enforcement of their rights under the Constitution or statutes. Title 9 of the United States Code is amended to remove certain language. In Title 9 of the United States Code, amendments are made to sections related to interstate commerce, application, and conflict with chapter 4. Amendments are made to Title 9 of the United States Code, specifically in Chapter 2, by adding a provision that applies unless in conflict with Chapter 4. The table of sections for Chapter 2 is also updated accordingly. Amendments to Title 9 of the United States Code include adding a new section on arbitration of employment, consumer, antitrust, and civil rights disputes. The effective date for this Act and its amendments is the date of enactment, applying to disputes or claims arising thereafter."
