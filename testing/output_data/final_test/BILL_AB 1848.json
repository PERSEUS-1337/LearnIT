    "content": "The people of California enact the following. Section 680.1 of the Penal Code is added to address the need for tracking and analyzing rape kit biological samples for DNA profiling. The Legislature aims to establish a mandatory statewide tracking system to report on the analysis of these kits. The Department of Justice's SAFE-T database was created in 2015 to track sexual assault evidence kits, and participation in this database is now required by law. Each law enforcement agency must report data on sexual assault kit evidence collection to the Department of Justice through the SAFE-T database. This data includes the number of kits collected, biological samples submitted for DNA analysis, generated DNA profiles, and reasons for not processing evidence from a rape kit. After 120 days, if a public DNA lab has not tested rape kit evidence, they must provide reasons in the SAFE-T database. If a private lab is used, the submitting agency must update every 120 days until testing is done. Upon expiration of the statute of limitations for a sexual assault case or if law enforcement decides not to analyze DNA evidence, they must provide a written explanation in the SAFE-T database. This database does not contain any identifying information about victims or suspects, DNA profiles, or details that could hinder an ongoing criminal investigation. The Department of Justice must annually report data from the SAFE-T database to the Legislature while maintaining confidentiality. The database contents are confidential to protect information and cannot be disclosed in legal proceedings, except as required by law. The Legislature adds Section 680.1 to the Penal Code to limit public access to meetings and writings of public officials. This is to protect the privacy of crime victims by keeping information in the SAFE-T database confidential. If the Commission on State Mandates determines costs mandated by the state, reimbursement to local agencies and school districts will be made."
