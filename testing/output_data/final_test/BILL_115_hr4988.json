    "content": "The \"Conservation Assistance Loan Act of 2018\" allows for nonrecourse conservation assistance loans for loan commodities. The Secretary will provide nonrecourse conservation assistance loans to qualified producers for loan commodities produced on the farm for the 2018-2022 crops. Eligible producers can apply for a conservation assistance loan for any quantity of a loan commodity produced on the farm. Loan rates for these loans will be determined. Loan rates for nonrecourse conservation assistance loans for the 2018-2022 crop years will be 75% of the national average price for beginning farmers and ranchers, and 60% for other producers, excluding the highest and lowest price years. Loan rates for nonrecourse conservation assistance loans are set at 60 percent of the national average price received by producers during the 12-month marketing year for the loan commodity, excluding the highest and lowest price years. Additionally, a special rule applies for cover crops, where the loan rate can be increased by $0.20 per bushel. The loan term for each loan commodity is 9 months. The Secretary cannot extend the term of a conservation assistance loan for any loan commodity. Producers can repay the loan at a rate based on the loan rate or the expected market price for the commodity. The Secretary will make necessary adjustments to avoid potential loan forfeitures. The Secretary may take necessary actions to avoid forfeiture or stock accumulation, minimize costs, promote competitive marketing, reduce loan discrepancies, and forgive loans for producers affected by natural events. The Secretary may forgive a portion of the loan under certain conditions, including compliance with conservation requirements and planting cover crops. The Farm Service Agency must submit an annual report to the Secretary detailing compliance with conservation requirements for fully repaid conservation assistance loans."
