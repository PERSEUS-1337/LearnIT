    "content": "Congress uses an annual appropriations process to fund discretionary spending for federal government agencies through 12 regular appropriations bills each fiscal year. If these bills are not enacted by October 1, continuing resolutions (CRs) provide temporary funding until the process is completed. CRs can be extended until all regular appropriations bills are passed or the fiscal year ends. For FY2016, none of the regular appropriations bills were enacted by October 1, 2015, leading to the enactment of H.R. 719, a CR for FY2016. H.R. 719, a CR for FY2016, was enacted on September 30, 2015 (P.L. 114-53) to provide funds for projects and activities from October 1, 2015, through December 11, 2015. This report analyzes the appropriations in H.R. 719, including funding coverage, budget enforcement issues, and agency-specific provisions organized by appropriations act title. The CR for FY2016, H.R. 719, was enacted on September 30, 2015 to provide funds for projects and activities until December 11, 2015. The report discusses the components of a CR that establish the purpose, duration, and amount of funds provided, including coverage related to the purposes for which funds are provided. The CR for FY2016 provides funds for projects and activities based on appropriations acts, with a funding rate determined by the total budget authority available annually. It covers all 12 regular appropriations bills by continuing budget authority for projects funded in FY2015. The CR for FY2016 provides budget authority based on FY2015 appropriations acts, with some exceptions. Statutory limits on discretionary spending are in effect, with budget authority exempt from those limits for certain purposes. Budget authority is provided under the same terms and conditions as FY2015 appropriations acts. The FY2016 CR extends provisions from FY2015 appropriations acts, aiming to protect Congress's funding authority. It covers budget authority from October 1 to December 11, allowing for potential superseding by regular appropriations acts or another CR. The FY2016 CR extends provisions from FY2015 appropriations acts to maintain funding levels until December 11. Budget authority for projects not funded by subsequent appropriations acts would cease immediately upon enactment. The CR also includes a slight across-the-board decrease for most projects and activities funded. The FY2016 CR includes a slight across-the-board decrease for most projects and activities funded, except for certain appropriations. Appropriations for FY2016 are subject to statutory discretionary spending limits on defense and nondefense spending. If spending exceeds these limits, sequestration may be required, leading to across-the-board cuts in the breached category. The FY2016 CR includes discretionary spending limits on defense and nondefense categories. OMB evaluates spending against these limits and may implement sequestration if breached. CBO estimates budget effects of interim CRs on an annualized basis. The FY2016 CR includes discretionary spending limits on defense and nondefense categories. The total appropriations in the CR subject to the BCA limits is $1,016.582 billion, with defense spending estimated at $520.385 billion and nondefense spending at $496.197 billion. The CR is estimated to exceed one of the statutory discretionary spending limits, but enforcement may not occur until after the CR expires on December 11, 2015. The FY2016 CR includes discretionary spending limits on defense and nondefense categories. The total amount of annualized budget authority in the CR is $1,099.962 billion, with provisions specific to certain agencies, accounts, or programs. These provisions may designate exceptions or create new laws. The FY2016 CR includes discretionary spending limits on defense and nondefense categories totaling $1,099.962 billion. Provisions in the CR may create new laws or renew expiring ones, with the possibility of including major new policies. These provisions are temporary and may be requested by the President, subject to acceptance, rejection, or modification by Congress. Anomalies and provisions changing law may be identified by Congress for inclusion in the CR, organized alphabetically by appropriations act title. The FY2016 CR includes discretionary spending limits on defense and nondefense categories totaling $1,099.962 billion. Provisions in the CR may create new laws or renew expiring ones, with the possibility of including major new policies. Anomalies and provisions changing law may be identified by Congress for inclusion in the CR, organized alphabetically by appropriations act title. The summaries generally provide brief explanations of the provisions, including additional information like whether a provision was requested by the President or included in prior year CRs. For the duration of the CR, Section 116 increases funding for the Commodity Supplemental Food Program to approximately $221 million, serving low-income elderly individuals. Contact CRS appropriations experts for more details on specific provisions in the CR. The CR provision for the Rural Rental Assistance program would allow higher funding to account for increased costs in FY2016. The anomaly is needed due to higher renewal costs and timing shifts in renewals. The CR provision for the Rural Rental Assistance program in FY2016 would authorize the Secretary to waive the re-renewal prohibition for the duration of the CR, addressing funding shortages for some properties. Section 118 of the CR allows NOAA to apportion funds to maintain launch schedules for the Joint Polar Satellite System (JPSS), providing flexibility for JPSS launch schedules. JPSS is crucial for weather prediction models and is scheduled to replace current coverage with JPSS-1 in 2017 and JPSS-2 in 2021. The Joint Polar Satellite System (JPSS) is set to replace current satellite coverage with JPSS-1 in 2017 and JPSS-2 in 2021, addressing concerns about a potential gap in coverage. JPSS will provide global environmental data such as cloud imagery, sea surface temperature, and atmospheric profiles. In FY2015, $1.595 billion was appropriated for the USMS's Federal Prisoner Detention account, with $1.1 billion coming from unobligated balances from the DOJ's Assets Forfeiture Fund. Section 119 of the CR would end the required transfer of $1.1 billion from the AFF to the FPD account. The Administration requested an anomaly to allow the US Marshals Service to use funds from the Federal Prisoner Detention account at a rate of $1.454 billion, as the Assets Forfeiture Fund does not project excess unobligated balances. Without the anomaly, additional resources are needed for operational expenses related to prisoner detention. The Administration requested an anomaly to allow the US Marshals Service to use funds from the Federal Prisoner Detention account to cover projected detention costs. This provision would extend the availability of funds for closeout of NASA's space shuttle program and uncompleted Broadband Technology Opportunity Program projects. Without the extension, approximately $68 million could not be expended after September 30, 2015. The ARRA BTOP grants, administered by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration, are no longer available after September 30, 2015. Concerns have been raised in Congress over the completion of BTOP public safety grant projects, which were partially suspended due to the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012. Some projects were resumed after reaching agreements with FirstNet, but not all will be completed by the deadline. Section 102 of the interim CR would prevent the Department of Defense from increasing production rates for various weapons programs in the FY2016 budget request. This includes C-130J cargo planes, Apache attack helicopters, and the Navy's T-AO refueling tanker. The provision extends authorizations that would otherwise expire at the end of FY2015. The interim CR extends authorizations for two programs that would otherwise expire at the end of FY2015: The Office of Security Cooperation with Iraq and a program for cash rewards in counterterrorism operations. It also authorizes the Department of Energy to apportion funding for the Uranium Enrichment Decontamination and Decommissioning Fund through December 11, 2015. The interim CR extends authorizations for two programs that would otherwise expire at the end of FY2015: The Office of Security Cooperation with Iraq and a program for cash rewards in counterterrorism operations. It also authorizes the Department of Energy to apportion funding for the Uranium Enrichment Decontamination and Decommissioning Fund through December 11, 2015. This account primarily funds the decommissioning and environmental remediation of three federal uranium enrichment facilities in Kentucky, Ohio, and Tennessee. DOE would be required to notify the House and Senate Appropriations Committees within three days after each use of this authority. Section 125 provides that no funds are included in the CR for the Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board. The Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board was initially funded in FY2012 through the Financial Services and General Government appropriations bill. It received appropriations of $20 million for FY2014 and $18 million for FY2015 but is set to sunset on September 30, 2015. The House and Senate FY2016 FSGG appropriations bills do not contain funding for the board. A provision authorizes the apportionment of appropriations to allow the Small Business Administration to continue issuing general business loans under the 7(a) loan guaranty program if demand exceeds the program's authorization ceiling. The SBA suspended the consideration of 7(a) loan guaranty program applications on July 23, 2015, for the second time since its establishment in 1953. The SBA suspended 7(a) loan guaranty program applications in 1953 due to projected demand exceeding the authorization ceiling. Resumed on July 28, 2015, after the Veterans Entrepreneurship Act increased the ceiling to $23.5 billion. Previous CRs raised the ceiling to prevent exceeding commitments. Section 127 extends a moratorium. The Internet Tax Freedom Act (ITFA) was extended by the 113th Congress multiple times, preventing state and local governments from taxing Internet access.

These extensions include specialized procurement authority and certain visa programs, with no policy changes or new direction provided. Section 129 of the Act extends special procurement authorities for research and development activities at DHS. The CR for FY2010 (Division B of P.L. 111-68) included provisions for various visa programs and the E-Verify program. These provisions were not included in any CRs from FY2010 to FY2016. Additionally, the provision extends the authority for five agencies to collect recreation fees on federal lands and waters until September 30, 2017. The agencies collected $278.6 million in recreation fees in FY2014, which can be retained and spent without further appropriation. The current authority provided in P.L. 113-235 expires on September 30, 2016. Section 135 would give the Forest Service an additional $700 million for FY2016 for urgent wildland fire suppression activities, with the ability to repay amounts transferred from other accounts. Section 135 designates emergency funding for the Department of the Interior to establish higher minimum rates of pay for certain employees in engineering, geophysicist, and geologist job series to address high turnover rates in oil and gas inspection and engineering positions, identified as high risks by the Government Accountability Office. The current authority of the Secretary to raise minimum pay rates expires on September 30, 2015.

Section 138 clarifies that $37 million is to be applied to the FY2015 payment cycle, representing 97.8% of the full formula amount. Additionally, P.L. 113-235 provided $372 million in discretionary spending for FY2015. Section 139 allows CDC to use previously appropriated funds for construction of a replacement freezer building in Fort Collins, Colorado. Section 140 extends the HQT provision through the 2016-2017 school year. The Surface Transportation Extensions Act, 2011 extended the Highly Qualified Teacher provision through the 2016-2017 school year. Teachers of core academic subjects must meet the HQT definition, which includes being fully certified or participating in alternative certification programs. Various laws provided extensions to the HQT provision, with the latest extension through 2015-2016. Section 141 of the legislation would rescind $1.7 billion from the State Children's Health Insurance Program Child Enrollment Contingency Fund.

Additionally, $58.6 billion in advance FY2016 appropriations was allocated for medical services, medical support, and compliance, and medical facilities accounts. The CR's general rate for operations would fund most VA programs through a formula using the FY2015 level of appropriations minus an across-the-board rescission of 0.2108%.
