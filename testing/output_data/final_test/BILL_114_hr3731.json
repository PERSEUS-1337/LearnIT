    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Rare Disease Fund Act\" or the \"RaD Fund Act\". The Congress acknowledges the significant advancements in biomedicine but highlights the high costs and failure rates of translational research. The drug development pipeline faces low success rates, with only a small fraction of compounds progressing to become approved drugs. Traditional financing sources in biotech and life sciences are becoming less effective due to the mismatch in expectations and the increasing complexity of biomedical innovation. The \"Valley of Death\" funding gap hinders biomedical innovation by limiting potential therapies. The life sciences industry requires new approaches to early-stage drug development to manage risk, lower costs, and access diverse funding sources. One solution is to fund multiple biomedical programs through a single entity to diversify portfolios. Securitization allows a single entity to diversify its portfolio and reduce risk by issuing debt. This involves creating \"megafunds\" of biomedical products at all stages of development and structuring financing with a mix of equity and securitized debt. Diversification enables the entity to issue both debt and equity, unlike traditional venture capital investments. Research suggests that a modest megafund model could be successfully implemented. A modest megafund model for rare diseases with as few as ten compounds and $400 million in capital could be successful. A rare disease therapeutics fund could be a viable pilot project appealing to various investors. The FDA may grant orphan designation for therapies targeting rare diseases, reducing costs and providing financial incentives for development. SEC. 3. RARE DISEASE THERAPEUTICS CORPORATION. The Director of the National Institutes of Health establishes the Rare Disease Therapeutics Corporation to purchase rights, fund development, and sell ownership interests in rare disease therapeutics. The Corporation will be privatized through the sale of equity stock to investors, with the possibility of the National Institutes of Health maintaining an ownership interest. The National Institutes of Health may maintain a 25 percent ownership interest in the Corporation in exchange for providing intellectual property and assistance. The Corporation is prohibited from paying dividends and must have two board members chosen in a specific manner. The Corporation's board of directors is chosen by the Director and the Secretary of the Treasury. The Corporation can sell rare disease therapies at any time and must sell them before a phase 3 study begins. Sales must be done openly and on fair terms. The Corporation can issue bonds with a maturity of up to 12 years, guaranteed by the US or backed by the Corporation. Debt-to-equity ratio must not exceed 1 to 1 for guaranteed bonds. The Corporation must not exceed a debt-to-equity ratio of 1 to 1. A guarantee fee is paid to the Treasury based on the anticipated cost of guaranteeing bonds. Securities of the Corporation are not considered government-issued or guaranteed. The Corporation is not guaranteed by the United States, except under specific circumstances. Authorization of Appropriations: Sums are authorized for the Director to establish and complete the privatization of the Corporation. The Corporation will terminate 18 months after the last bond matures and final payment is received for the sale of rare disease therapeutics. Establishment of the Rare Disease Therapeutics Corporation Science Advisory Council within the National Institutes of Health to advise on rare disease therapeutics. Members selected by the Director must disclose any relevant affiliations. The Council will terminate when the Corporation does. The Rare Disease Therapeutics Act defines key terms such as rare disease therapeutics, Advisory Council, Corporation, Director, and securities laws. The Rare Disease Therapeutics Act defines key terms such as rare disease therapeutics, Advisory Council, Corporation, Director, and securities laws, including the meaning given to that term under section 3(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934."
