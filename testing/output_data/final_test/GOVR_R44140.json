    "content": "For decades, a Presidential Permit has been required for certain facilities crossing US borders with Canada and Mexico. Questions remain about how this authority is exercised and how applications for cross-border energy projects are reviewed. Members of Congress and stakeholders seek clarity on the process for evaluating environmental impacts and determining national interest. In the last decade, two long cross-border pipeline projects have been approved\u2014TransCanada's Keystone and Enbridge Energy's Alberta Clipper. These projects transport oil sands crude from Alberta, Canada, deep into the United States via pipelines that are hundreds of miles long and cross multiple states, leading to increased national attention on the Presidential Permit process for subsequent proposals. The Trump Administration issued a Presidential Permit for the Keystone XL pipeline on March 23, 2017. Legislative proposals in the 114th Congress aimed to expedite the permit process, including the Keystone XL Pipeline Approval Act (S. 1) which was vetoed by President Obama. Congress may propose new legislation to streamline future Presidential Permit approvals. This report focuses on the Presidential Permit review processes for cross-border energy infrastructure by the Department of State, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), and Department of Energy (DOE). It compares their practices in defining project scope, conducting environmental reviews, and making final permit decisions. The report also discusses recent Congressional efforts to change these permitting processes. The State Department, FERC, and DOE make permitting decisions for cross-border energy infrastructure based on their interpretation of executive orders. Each agency gathers project-specific information, seeks input from federal agencies, and evaluates if the project serves the national interest before issuing a Presidential Permit. The permitting agency determines if a project serves the national interest or public interest based on specific conditions. Additional federal requirements may apply depending on the project type and impacts. The permitting agency evaluates projects for national interest based on specific conditions. Natural gas pipelines must comply with requirements under the Natural Gas Act and NEPA. NEPA mandates agencies to consider environmental impacts before making decisions. Permit conditions, like mitigation measures, are identified during NEPA reviews to ensure compliance with laws like the Endangered Species Act and Clean Water Act. The permitting process involves evaluating project-specific impacts to ensure compliance with federal laws like the Endangered Species Act and Clean Water Act. While agencies rarely deny permit applications, they focus on determining how a project can meet national interest standards. In rare cases, like the denial of TransCanada's application in 2015, agencies may find a project does not meet national interest criteria. The process includes gathering information in accordance with executive orders and NEPA requirements before issuing a Presidential Permit. The Presidential Permit process requires the applicant to comply with federal requirements and maintain border-crossing facilities as specified. Modifications to the facility may need additional authorization. Each permitting agency assesses project impacts and ensures compliance with public or national interest standards, particularly regarding environmental impacts under NEPA. CEQ regulations from 1978 are applicable to all federal agencies for adopting and supplementing procedures. The CEQ regulations are adopted by federal agencies like FERC, DOE, and the State Department, with additional procedures integrated into their decision-making processes. The agency-specific NEPA review process identifies relevant issues and impacts for consideration. NEPA mandates the preparation of an environmental impact statement (EIS) for major federal actions affecting the environment, with the option of an environmental assessment (EA) for proposals with uncertain impacts. Federal agencies may determine the need for an environmental assessment (EA) or issue a finding of no significant impact (FONSI) based on the potential impacts of a project. Actions that are deemed to have no significant effect on the environment are categorized as \"categorical exclusions\" (CEs or CATEXs), which do not require an EIS or EA. The scope of project-specific information used for public interest determination depends on whether the proposal will have a significant impact on the environment, with agencies evaluating direct effects caused by the project. The proposal includes direct effects from the project, indirect effects that are later in time or farther removed in distance, and cumulative impacts on the environment. The environmental review is not limited to impacts at the border but evaluates the entire project within the United States. The evaluation of impacts for a project in the United States includes considering direct and indirect effects of new facilities, even those built in conjunction with cross-border facilities. Stakeholders may disagree on how impacts are categorized, but NEPA requires agencies to be aware of and consider all impacts in their decision-making process. The evaluation of impacts for a project in the United States includes considering direct, indirect, or cumulative impacts. Stakeholders may disagree on how impacts are categorized, such as how far \"upstream\" or \"downstream\" from the project the agency must evaluate impacts. Each agency evaluates project-specific impacts that are reasonably foreseeable, with complex factors influencing their determination. NEPA requires an agency to review a proposal's potential to affect the quality of the human environment. The CEQ regulations define what constitutes direct, indirect, or cumulative impacts. The CEQ regulations define the \"human environment\" to include the natural and physical environment, as well as the relationship of people with that environment, which may include economic or social effects. Agencies implementing NEPA for their Presidential Permit processes assess project impacts beyond just environmental impacts, including cultural or historical resources, safety, and security. Economic or social effects alone do not require an EIS, but when interrelated with natural or physical environmental effects, all impacts must be discussed in the NEPA document. The NEPA document must discuss the interrelated environmental effects on the human environment, including construction and operational issues for pipelines and electric transmission lines. It covers impacts on geology, water resources, vegetation, wildlife, air quality, noise, safety, and socioeconomics. Analyses for oil or natural gas pipelines are done in cooperation with the U.S. Department of Transportation. Projects may have wide-ranging impacts subject to various laws at local, tribal, state, and federal levels. The identification of requirements for cross-border projects ensures compliance with state and federal environmental and safety laws. The final EIS or FONSI outlines additional requirements for obtaining a Presidential Permit, such as pipeline safety regulations and approvals under laws like the Clean Water Act. This process may expedite federal approvals but could blur the distinction between NEPA compliance and other actions. The agencies involved in permitting cross-border energy facilities rarely deny permits based on project-specific impacts identified during the NEPA review process. Instead, they typically specify conditions for approval to ensure compliance with public or national interest standards. Each agency has discretion in determining whether the construction and operation of these facilities meet their respective requirements. The construction and operation of cross-border energy facilities must meet public or national interest standards, with agencies considering unique policy and commodity factors. The scope of agency review depends on project size and scope, with Executive Orders 11423 and 13337 directing the State Department to issue Presidential Permits for projects serving the national interest without specific evaluation criteria. The State Department evaluates specific factors before issuing a Presidential Permit for cross-border energy facilities. E.O. 13337 requires the State Department to consult various agencies and officials, giving it significant discretion in making a national interest determination. The State Department considers various factors when making a national interest determination for cross-border energy facilities, including impacts on energy security, environmental resources, the economy, and foreign policy. This includes assessing the diversity of supply, security of transport pathways, relations with connecting countries, stability of foreign suppliers, and collaboration on environmental and energy goals. The State Department considers factors like energy security, environmental impact, economy, and foreign policy when evaluating cross-border energy projects. This includes assessing supply diversity, transport security, relations with connecting countries, stability of suppliers, and collaboration on environmental and energy goals. The potential economic benefits, impact on climate change, bilateral relations, and reducing reliance on fossil fuels are also key considerations for the United States. Project-specific issues identified during the NEPA process may affect the evaluation scope and timeline. The State Department evaluates cross-border energy projects based on factors like energy security, environmental impact, economy, and foreign policy. Most cross-border oil pipeline projects require an Environmental Assessment (EA), with some projects necessitating an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS). Projects like TransCanada's Keystone and Keystone XL pipelines and Enbridge Energy's Alberta have required an EIS. The State Department evaluates cross-border energy projects based on factors like energy security, environmental impact, economy, and foreign policy. Projects like TransCanada's Keystone and Keystone XL pipelines and Enbridge Energy's Alberta Clipper have required an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) due to their potential direct, indirect, and cumulative impacts. The Keystone XL pipeline, as currently proposed, spans approximately 875 miles, raising new issues such as concerns about oil production in Canada, potential spills far from the border, and greenhouse gas emissions. The State Department evaluates cross-border energy projects based on factors like energy security, environmental impact, economy, and foreign policy. Presidential Permit applications for projects are evaluated on a case-by-case basis, considering project configuration, energy market conditions, technology, and environmental factors. FERC makes decisions on natural gas pipelines crossing the U.S. border, issuing permits if consistent with public interest and with favorable recommendations from the Secretaries of State and Defense. FERC is authorized to establish permit conditions for natural gas import/export facilities under the Natural Gas Act. The Department of Energy's Office of Fossil Energy issues approvals for importing/exporting natural gas to/from the United States under Section 3 of the NGA. The Office of Fossil Energy is authorized to issue approvals for natural gas import/export facilities under the Natural Gas Act. Section 3 allows for the export/import of natural gas to nations under free trade agreements without delay. FERC considers NAFTA goals when evaluating applications for Presidential Permits, noting the need for project construction to meet fuel demand in Mexico or Canada. FERC has authorized the construction of facilities to promote national economic policy by reducing barriers to foreign trade and stimulating the flow of goods and services between the United States and Mexico or Canada. This includes facilitating the transportation of natural gas imports and exports authorized by DOE. FERC may review impacts to private landowners and issue a certificate of public convenience and necessity for new interstate natural gas pipelines. When border-crossing facilities connect to interstate pipelines, FERC integrates its permitting processes. FERC's jurisdiction over cross-border facilities and associated interstate pipelines, not intrastate pipelines, may cause confusion for stakeholders during NEPA review. FERC must assess factors for projects it has siting jurisdiction over, while also considering nonjurisdictional facilities that may have environmental or safety impacts subject to state or federal law. FERC may need to evaluate impacts of construction and operation of nonjurisdictional facilities, even if it lacks siting jurisdiction. FERC regulations require the evaluation of impacts from construction and operation of nonjurisdictional facilities, even if FERC lacks approval authority. Identification of these facilities is crucial for defining project boundaries. Most Presidential Permits from FERC involve Environmental Assessments resulting in a Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) for cross-border projects. The scope of FERC's environmental review extends beyond border-crossing facilities, as seen in the example of the NET Mexico Pipeline Partners project. FERC's evaluation includes analyzing the entire U.S. segment of the project, considering factors like project footprint and site-specific issues that may lead to significant impacts. For instance, the Sierrita Pipeline Project in Arizona required an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) due to its construction of 61 miles of new natural gas pipeline. The Sierrita Pipeline Project in Arizona involved the construction of 61 miles of new natural gas pipeline. The environmental review process identified adverse impacts on cultural and natural resources, with actions proposed to minimize these impacts. The DOE is responsible for issuing Presidential Permits for certain projects under the Federal Power Act. The DOE issues Presidential Permits for projects consistent with public interest and with recommendations from State and Defense Secretaries. Permit conditions may be established as needed. Past permits were for electricity import/export facilities, with DOE expecting open access and nondiscrimination principles to be followed. The DOE issues Presidential Permits for projects consistent with public interest, considering environmental impact and impact on electric reliability. DOE relies on applicant information to assess electric reliability. Cross-border electric transmission projects are typically classified as actions requiring a CE or EA resulting in a FONSI due to minimal construction and short power line extensions. The DOE issues Presidential Permits for cross-border electric transmission projects that meet criteria for minimal environmental impact. In some cases, projects extending a short distance may not require an EA or EIS, while others may necessitate an EIS if significant impacts are identified. The DOE issued a Presidential Permit to Montana Alberta Tie Ltd. for new transmission facilities at the U.S.-Canada border, requiring authorizations from MDEQ and BLM. MDEQ's detailed assessment led to the decision to prepare an EIS, resulting in a joint EIS by DOE, MDEQ, and BLM integrating NEPA/MEPA requirements. The DOE issued a Presidential Permit for the Champlain Hudson Power Express Project in 2014, involving transmission lines crossing the U.S.-Canada border. The project required an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) due to its nature and extent. The processing time for a Presidential Permit application depends on the environmental analysis conducted. A Presidential Permit authorizes cross-border infrastructure projects, with specific conditions for the applicant. Modifications to the permitted facility may require separate authorization. Changes during construction or operation may necessitate a new permit or amendment. Modifications to a permitted cross-border facility may require a new permit or amendment, especially for substantial changes. The State Department has outlined specific modifications that would generally require an amended Presidential Permit, such as changes in ownership or conveyance. Presidential Permits are not transferable, and any changes must be explicitly requested and authorized by the permitting agency. Changes to permitted cross-border facilities may require a new permit or amendment, particularly for significant modifications. This includes alterations to the physical capacity of pipelines and transmission lines that could impact oil or gas imports/exports or U.S. electric reliability. Any modifications that would inaccurately define covered U.S. facilities in the permit must be approved by the permitting agency before implementation. Review of permits and applications from 2010 to 2015 shows a significant number of Presidential Permit applications requiring approval from FERC, DOE, and the State Department. The State Department handles Presidential Permit applications for cross-border facilities, with many requests involving amendments for existing permits. Most pending applications are for name changes due to ownership changes, and decisions on new or amended permits are made on a case-by-case basis. The State Department categorizes actions related to cross-border facilities into three categories: \"Red\" actions involve substantial modifications and require a permittee to submit a notification and an application to amend its permit, while \"Yellow\" actions may affect Canadian or Mexican government operations but do not clearly involve substantial modifications to a border crossing. The State Department categorizes actions related to cross-border facilities into three categories: \"Red\" actions involve substantial modifications and require a permittee to submit a notification and an application to amend its permit, while \"Yellow\" actions may affect Canadian or Mexican government operations but do not clearly involve substantial modifications to a border crossing. \"Green\" actions involve regular maintenance and repair work to existing structures that require no notification to the State Department and no new permit. Permit conditions must be followed, and any potential facility modifications must be notified to the permitting agency as stated in the permit itself. The need for a new permit versus an amended permit may not be immediately clear. For example, in February 2012, DOE issued a new Presidential Permit to ITC Transmission to authorize the replacement of failed transformers at an authorized facility. DOE initially began processing that authorization as an amendment to an existing permit. The Obama Administration denied TransCanada's applications for the Keystone XL pipeline project in 2008 and 2012. In 2017, the Trump Administration invited TransCanada to resubmit its permit application and expedited the review process. Congress has also influenced the State Department permitting process through legislation. In 2017, the State Department issued a final Record of Decision and National Interest Determination authorizing the issuance of a Presidential Permit for the Keystone XL project. Congress had previously required the Secretary of State to issue the permit within 60 days, leading to the denial of TransCanada's initial application. The State Department did not complete the national interest determination for the Keystone XL project within the 60-day deadline set by P.L. 112-78. Various legislative proposals imposing deadlines on the determination were rendered moot by the State Department's initial permit denial. In the 113th Congress, reintroduced proposals aimed to eliminate the Presidential Permit requirement for Keystone XL and directly approve the project under Congress's authority to regulate foreign commerce. The Northern Route Approval Act (H.R. 3) aimed to eliminate the Presidential Permit requirement for Keystone XL, while the North American Energy Infrastructure Act (H.R. 3301) sought to transfer permit authority for oil pipelines to the Department of Commerce and expedite approval processes. The Keystone XL Pipeline Approval Act (S. 2554) was another Senate proposal related to the project. After the 2014 congressional elections, Republican leaders planned to prioritize approval of the Keystone XL pipeline in the 114th Congress. Bills like the Keystone XL Pipeline Act (S. 1 and H.R. 3) and the Keystone XL Pipeline Approval Act (S. 147) aimed to authorize TransCanada to construct the pipeline and satisfy environmental requirements. The Keystone XL Pipeline Approval Act (S. 1) was passed by the Senate on January 29, 2015, and by the House on February 11, with President Obama vetoing the bill on February 24. The Act aimed to authorize the construction of the Keystone XL pipeline and included provisions related to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and the use of crude oil in the United States. President Obama vetoed the Keystone XL Pipeline Approval Act (S. 1) on February 24, stating it bypassed established processes. An attempt to override the veto failed on March 4. Some proposals in the 114th Congress sought to modify the Presidential Permit process, like the American Energy Renaissance Act of 2015, which aimed to eliminate the permit requirement for cross-border energy infrastructure. The North American Energy Infrastructure Act aimed to streamline the permitting process for cross-border energy infrastructure projects by eliminating the Presidential Permit requirement and establishing a certificate of crossing system. This would expedite the approval process, with the State Department still involved in permitting decisions. The North American Energy Infrastructure Act aimed to streamline the permitting process for cross-border energy infrastructure projects by eliminating the Presidential Permit requirement and establishing a certificate of crossing system. The bill did not seek approval of Keystone XL, but now that a Presidential Permit has been issued for the pipeline, Congress may consider legislation to address future agency decisions on such permits. This could include legislation altering federal agency authorities, defining agency review scopes, changing authorizing agencies, or specifying evaluation criteria for national interest determinations."
