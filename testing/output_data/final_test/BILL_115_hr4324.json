    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Strengthening Oversight of Iran's Access to Finance Act\" and includes findings related to Iran. The Congress finds that under the Iran nuclear deal, the Obama administration agreed to license the sale of commercial aircraft to Iran, a state sponsor of terrorism. Secretary of the Treasury Jacob Lew emphasized the use of sanctions to counter Iran's threatening behavior. In March 2016, Secretary Lew mentioned U.S. commitments under the JCPOA, stating that nuclear sanctions were lifted but sanctions for terrorism, regional destabilization, and human rights violations remain. In April 2016, he noted that the U.S. financial system remains closed to Iran despite lifting nuclear sanctions. In September 2016, OFAC issued licenses for the export of aircraft to Iran Air. In November 2016, OFAC licensed 106 aircraft for Iran Air, allowing U.S. financial institutions to provide financing. Iran Air had been sanctioned in 2011 for transporting military cargo for designated entities. Iran Air, designated under Executive Orders for proliferation activities, delivered missile components to Syria, aiding the Assad regime in a conflict causing 400,000 deaths. Despite being delisted in 2016, Iran Air continues flying weapons resupply routes. Iran Air operated 134 flights to Syria between January 2016 and May 2017, using routes to government-controlled areas. The Department of the Treasury can still designate Iranian airlines engaging in sanctionable activities, despite Iran Air being delisted under the JCPOA. In April 2017, Iran announced a deal for Aseman Airlines to purchase up to 60 commercial aircraft, a transaction that would require authorization by OFAC. Aseman Airlines' CEO, Hossein Alaei, has long been a senior member of the IRGC, engaging in activities outside the scope of the JCPOA, such as support for terrorism, human rights abuses, and ballistic missile program. SEC. 3. CERTIFICATIONS FOR AIRCRAFT-RELATED TRANSACTIONS BY UNITED STATES AND FOREIGN FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. The Secretary of the Treasury must submit a report to congressional committees every 180 days regarding transactions by financial institutions related to the export of commercial passenger aircraft to Iran. The report includes a list of financial institutions conducting authorized transactions since January 16, 2016. The Secretary of the Treasury reports every 180 days on financial institutions conducting authorized transactions for exporting commercial passenger aircraft to Iran since January 16, 2016. Transactions require a certification that ensures no money laundering or terrorism financing risks to the US financial system and no benefit to Iranian entities involved in weapons proliferation. The curr_chunk discusses the criteria for entities to be considered as engaging in prohibited activities related to weapons proliferation in Syria or providing support to designated persons under specific Executive Orders. Financial institutions falling under subsection (b)(1) are also mentioned in relation to these activities. The curr_chunk discusses the certification process for financial institutions under subsection (b)(1) to avoid sanctionable activities related to Iran. If the Secretary is unable to certify, a report on non-certification will be issued within 60 days to the appropriate congressional committees. The report on non-certification for financial institutions and transactions under subsection (a) includes a detailed explanation for the Secretary's inability to certify, along with options such as not amending, suspending, revoking, or otherwise amending the authorization. The President may waive provisions of the Act for up to 1 year at a time upon certifying progress in combating money laundering and terrorism financing from Iran, or if waiver is important to US national security interests. An explanation of reasons for any action taken must be provided. The President can waive provisions of the Act for up to 1 year at a time if it is vital to US national security interests. The section will end 30 days after the President certifies that Iran is not a primary money laundering concern and has stopped supporting international terrorism.
