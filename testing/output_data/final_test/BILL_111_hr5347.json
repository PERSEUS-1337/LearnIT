SEC. 2. Sexual assault victim advocate, victim service organization, and health care professional privileges in cases under Uniform Code of Military Justice. Privileges Established: Subchapter XI of chapter 47 of title 10, United States Code is amended to include a new section allowing communication privilege with Sexual Assault Victim Advocates, victim service organizations, and health care professionals. Definitions include 'client' as someone consulting with these advocates or professionals, and 'victim service organization' as a provider of advice. The term 'representative' refers to a person assisting an organization or professional in providing advice or assistance. 'Confidential communication' is defined as a communication intended only for those involved in providing counseling or assistance to the client. In a case arising under this chapter, a client has a privilege to refuse disclosure of confidential communications made for advice or assistance regarding their mental, physical, or emotional condition caused by sexual assault or other offenses. This privilege applies to communications with operators of the Department of Defense sexual assault reporting hotline and Sexual Assault Victim Advocates. In cases of sexual assault, clients have the privilege to refuse disclosure of confidential communications with various professionals, including Sexual Assault Victim Advocates, victim service organizations, and health care professionals. These individuals must notify clients of this privilege promptly. Additionally, clients cannot be compelled to provide testimony that would reveal the location of a safe house or abuse shelter that provided temporary emergency shelter. The privilege to refuse disclosure of confidential communications in cases of sexual assault can be claimed by the client, guardian, or conservator. The privilege may also be claimed by authorized trial or defense counsel, Sexual Assault Victim Advocates, victim service organizations, health care professionals, or representatives. There are exceptions to this privilege, such as when the client is deceased. Exceptions to the privilege of refusing disclosure of confidential communications in cases of sexual assault include situations where the communication reports child abuse, when the client is believed to be a danger to others due to a mental or emotional condition, or if the communication involves planning or committing a crime or fraud. The table of sections in the subchapter is amended by adding a new item. Section 940a of title 10, United States Code, provides privilege for communication with Sexual Assault Victim Advocate, victim service organization, or health care professional. This privilege applies to communications made after the enactment of this Act. Additionally, there is expedited consideration and priority for application for consideration of a permanent change of station or unit transfer based on humanitarian conditions for victims of sexual assault. The new section 673 of Chapter 39 of title 10, United States Code, provides expedited consideration and priority for approval of permanent change of station or unit transfer applications for active duty members who are victims of sexual assault to prevent retaliation. Regulations will be established by the Secretaries of the military departments. The Secretaries of the military departments will issue regulations within guidelines provided by the Secretary of Defense for expedited consideration and priority of permanent change of station or unit transfer applications for active duty members who are victims of sexual assault to prevent retaliation. SEC. 4. Codification of required information database on sexual assault incidents involving members of the armed forces. The Secretary of Defense is required to maintain a centralized database on sexual assault incidents involving members of the armed forces, including details about the assault, victim, offender, and legal outcomes. This database will be accessible to personnel of the Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office. The Secretary of Defense must maintain a centralized database on sexual assault incidents in the armed forces for congressional reports, as required by specific sections of the law. The Secretary of Defense is required to establish a database on sexual assault incidents in the armed forces and implement a hotline to improve reporting of such incidents. The Secretary of Defense will establish a universal hotline for reporting sexual assault within 180 days of the enactment of the Act.

Additionally, sexual assault victim advocates will be assigned and trained under Section 6 of the Act.

Members or civilian employees serving as Victim Advocates can obtain certification through the program. A clerical amendment will be made to include this new item in the table of sections. SEC. 7. Court-martial records of sexual assault cases must be provided to victims who testified, free of charge and promptly after authentication. Victims must be informed of this opportunity. SEC. 8. Judge advocates will receive legal training to enhance the investigation and prosecution of sexual assault offenses.
