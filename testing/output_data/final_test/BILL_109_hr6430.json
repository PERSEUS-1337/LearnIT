    "content": "The Act titled \"Northern Border Travel Facilitation Act\" includes a program for state driver's license and identification card enrollment. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 includes a State Driver's License and Identification Card Enrollment Program for US citizens. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 established a program for US citizens to use a driver's license or identification card meeting specific requirements to enter the US from Canada without additional documentation. The requirements include being issued by a participating state, complying with the REAL ID Act of 2005, and indicating the individual's US citizenship status. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 allows US citizens to use a driver's license or ID card from a participating state to enter the US from Canada without extra documentation. The state must have a mechanism approved by the Secretary of State to verify citizenship status without requiring it on the license. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 allows US citizens to use a Canadian government-issued identification document to enter the United States from Canada if it meets security requirements comparable to a driver's license. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 allows Canadian citizens to enter the United States from Canada using a Canadian government-issued identification document without providing additional evidence of citizenship. The document must meet technology standards similar to US identification documents. Additionally, children can enter the US without proof of citizenship under certain circumstances. Children under 16 entering the US from Canada or another country with their legal guardian do not need to provide evidence of citizenship, as long as the guardian presents a valid driver's license, identification card, or other approved document. The Program allows individuals to enter the US using evidence of citizenship other than a driver's license or identification card. The Secretary of State and Homeland Security can expand the Program to include individuals from countries other than Canada. This subsection does not create a national identification card or certification of citizenship for any purpose other than entry into the US. The term 'State' in this subsection refers to various regions within the United States and its territories. The implementation of the Program by the Secretaries of Homeland Security and State is set for December 31, 2009, with provisions for admission prior to full implementation. The Secretary of Homeland Security will allow US or Canadian citizens to enter the US from Canada by demonstrating citizenship with specific documents."
