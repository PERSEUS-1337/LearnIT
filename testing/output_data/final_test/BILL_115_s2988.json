Part I of subchapter Q of chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to include a new section on income from compensation received on account of certain unlawful employment discrimination. The tax on employment discrimination compensation in a taxable year is limited to the tax that would be imposed if the compensation was not included in gross income and no deduction was allowed for related expenses. The calculation includes the combined number of years in the backpay and foregone compensation periods. The tax on employment discrimination compensation in a taxable year is limited to the tax that would be imposed if the compensation was not included in gross income. Definitions include backpay, foregone compensation, and related expenses. The term 'backpay' refers to compensation included in gross income for the taxable year attributable to services performed as an employee, former employee, or prospective employee before the taxable year. 'Foregone compensation' is compensation included in gross income for the taxable year attributable to services that would have been performed. The term 'backpay period' refers to the period when services were performed or would have been performed if not for a violation of law. The term 'foregone compensation period' refers to the period when services would have been performed if not for the violation of law. If these periods are not whole taxable years, they are increased to the next highest number of whole taxable years. The term 'average annual net employment discrimination compensation' is defined as the excess of employment discrimination compensation over deductions, divided by the total number of years in the backpay period and the foregone compensation period. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended by inserting a new item after section 1301. Section 1302 of the Internal Revenue Code addresses income from compensation related to unlawful employment discrimination. The amendment ensures that income averaging does not increase alternative minimum tax liability. These changes apply to taxable years starting after the enactment of the Act."
