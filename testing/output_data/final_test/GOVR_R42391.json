    "content": "The Small Business Act of 1958 and other statutes encourage federal agencies to contract with small businesses. Congress has broad authority in this area, but the U.S. Constitution limits this power by guaranteeing equal protection under the law, particularly regarding contracting preferences based on race or gender. The Small Business Act of 1958 governs federal contracting with small businesses, ensuring programs are tailored to government interests. The act delegates responsibilities to the SBA for small business contracting and subcontracting. The Small Business Act of 1958 delegates responsibilities for small business contracting and subcontracting to SBA, including establishing programs for socially and economically disadvantaged individuals. This includes the Minority Small Business and Capital Ownership Development Program (8(a) Program), distinguishing it from other small business assistance programs. The Small Business Act authorizes SBA to provide assistance to small businesses and delegate authority to subcontract with 8(a) firms. SBA has unique authority over contracting with 8(a) firms and must consent to releasing requirements formerly procured through the 8(a) Program. Section 8(b) of the act allows SBA to certify elements of responsibility to Government procurement officers. The Small Business Act allows SBA to certify elements of responsibility for small businesses seeking government contracts. Contracting officers must refer matters to SBA before determining a small business contractor as nonresponsible. SBA may issue a Certificate of Competence (COC) in such cases. The Small Business Act allows SBA to issue a Certificate of Competence (COC) for small businesses seeking government contracts. SBA has broad rulemaking authority regarding firms' size and eligibility for assistance under the act. The act establishes criteria for firms to qualify as small, such as being independently owned and operated and not dominant in their field of operations. Additionally, the Administrator may specify detailed definitions or standards for determining small business status. The Small Business Act grants SBA the authority to set standards for small businesses based on various factors like number of employees, annual receipts, and net worth. The Administrator can issue regulations to enforce these standards and control the implementation of provisions allowing contracts to be set aside for small businesses. The Small Business Act grants SBA the authority to set standards for small businesses based on factors like number of employees, annual receipts, and net worth. SBA may conduct competitions for service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses under certain conditions. SBA has the authority to define terms related to service-disabled veterans and small businesses. SBA is responsible for guaranteeing bonds, providing assistance to small businesses, and ensuring fair treatment. SBA appoints Procurement Center Representatives (PCRs) to promote small business participation and conduct necessary investigations. PCRs review acquisitions to determine set-asides and maximize small business involvement. Commercial Market Representatives (CMRs) facilitate matching large prime contractors with small business subcontractors. Other provisions of the Small Business Act also apply. Other provisions of the Small Business Act apply government-wide, authorizing agencies to set aside contracts for small businesses or make sole-source awards to them. These actions vary by section, with set-aside programs for different types of small businesses. None of these provisions require agencies to set aside contracts or make sole-source awards, except possibly Section 15. Section 8(d) of the Small Business Act requires agencies to incorporate subcontracting terms in prime contracts valued over $150,000 to ensure small businesses have opportunities to participate. Contracts over $650,000 ($1.5 million for construction) must include a subcontracting plan with percentage goals. The Small Business Act requires agencies to include subcontracting terms in prime contracts over $150,000, with contracts over $650,000 ($1.5 million for construction) needing a subcontracting plan with percentage goals. The subcontracting plan must include separate percentage goals for various types of small businesses, with government-wide goals set at 23% for small businesses, 5% for women-owned small businesses, 5% for small disadvantaged businesses, 3% for HUBZone small businesses, and 3% for service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses. Agencies must develop plans to achieve these goals after consultation with the SBA. The Small Business Act requires agencies to include subcontracting terms in prime contracts over $150,000, with contracts over $650,000 ($1.5 million for construction) needing a subcontracting plan with percentage goals. Agencies must consult with the SBA to develop plans for achieving goals and make consistent efforts to expand small business participation annually. Provisions also promote contracting with small businesses by limiting bundling or consolidating requirements and requiring prime contractors to notify if subcontractors are not used or face payment issues. Agencies must appoint Small Business Specialists and Offices of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization to assist small business contractors. Subcontractors review acquisitions valued above a certain amount and make recommendations on restructuring procurements to reduce bundling. OSDBU Directors identify significant bundling acquisitions, assist small businesses with payment issues, and make recommendations to contracting officers. SBA may exercise rulemaking authority in these cases. SBA can determine firms' eligibility for set-asides and sole-source awards, but has limited authority in other aspects of contracting. Contracting authority lies with federal agencies and individual contracting officers. SBA's PCRs can appeal to agency heads on procurement issues, but ultimately SBA's role is restricted. The Small Business Administration (SBA) has limited authority in federal contracting, with contracting officers and agencies holding the primary authority. SBA can appeal to agency heads on procurement issues, but cannot overrule their determinations. Other statutes like Titles 10 and 41 grant broad contracting authority to defense and civilian agencies, including the ability to contract with small businesses. Agencies can \"favor\" small businesses in certain procurements by using small-business status as an evaluation factor in negotiated procurements. Cost or price must be considered, but it does not have to be the primary factor. Other factors may include compliance with solicitation requirements, technical excellence, and management capability. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has unique requirements for contracting with small businesses owned by serviced-disabled and other veterans, which are not subject to certain limitations on subcontracting under the Small Business Act. The Department of Veterans Affairs has specific requirements for contracting with small businesses owned by service-disabled and other veterans. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs must establish annual goals for their participation in department contracts, with a minimum of 3% for service-disabled businesses. The VA is authorized to use non-competitive procedures to meet these goals, including awarding contracts on a sole-source basis and setting aside contracts for veteran-owned businesses when certain conditions are not met. The Department of Veterans Affairs has specific requirements for contracting with small businesses owned by service-disabled and other veterans. The VA can set aside contracts for service-disabled or other veteran-owned small businesses, but retains discretion not to do so in certain circumstances. The U.S. Court of Appeals recently upheld a decision allowing VA to procure supplies and services from Federal Supply Schedules instead of through set-asides for veteran-owned small businesses. Other agency-specific statutes establish the mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 program of the Department of Defense, focusing on small business subcontractors and suppliers. The government focuses on small business subcontractors and suppliers, setting goals for contract dollars awarded to small businesses. Agencies can take actions to promote contracting with small businesses, with regulations playing a significant role. SBA regulations and agency-specific regulations may apply in federal contracting and subcontracting with small businesses. Agencies have limited power to create regulations promoting contracting with small businesses compared to Congress. Regulations must align with statutes, and if Congress has not directly addressed an issue, agencies have discretion. However, Congress can restrict agencies from certain actions related to contracting, such as establishing new set-aside programs. Establishing new set-aside programs for small businesses faces obstacles due to the Competition in Contracting Act of 1984, which requires full and open competition unless expressly authorized by statute. SBA regulations play a crucial role in federal contracting with small businesses. SBA regulations in Title 13 of the Code of Federal Regulations set requirements for small business contracting and subcontracting, including size standards, eligibility for set-aside programs, and ownership criteria for women, veterans, and disadvantaged individuals. SBA regulations set requirements for small business contracting, including eligibility for preferences under the Small Business Act, employee residency criteria for HUBZone businesses, and limitations on subcontracting. The regulations also include the nonmanufacturer rule for procurement of manufactured products. The Small Business Administration (SBA) regulations outline criteria for small business eligibility, including size standards and requirements for firms that do not manufacture products. Protests of firms' size and status can be made by various parties, with penalties for misrepresentation, including debarment or suspension from government contracting. The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) governs federal contracting with small businesses, providing additional guidance for agency contracting officers under the Small Business Act. Violations may result in penalties such as debarment, civil or criminal penalties, and suspension from government contracting. The FAR provides guidance for contracting officers on applying SBA size standards to procurements, locating small business sources, determining fair market prices, and reasons for not setting aside acquisitions for small businesses. The FAR provides guidance on applying SBA size standards, fair market prices, and reasons for not setting aside acquisitions for small businesses. It also addresses topics like calculating liquidated damages for non-compliance with subcontracting plans and using monetary incentives for subcontracting with small businesses. While the FAR and SBA regulations generally align on these topics, they can differ in certain instances. The FAR and SBA regulations may differ in certain instances, with the FAR prevailing when implementing specific acquisition-related dollar thresholds and actions regarding bundled contracts. The SBA, on the other hand, focuses on implementing provisions of the Small Business Act governing firm size, with SBA size standards prevailing over the FAR if inconsistent. SBA size standards prevail over the FAR if inconsistent. Agency-specific regulations, such as VAAR and DFARS, may also be relevant, interpreting statutes applicable only to VA and DOD respectively. These regulations may diverge from the FAR. The mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 programs developed by agencies without statutory authority generally only provide for prot\u00e9g\u00e9s to receive assistance from mentors and for mentors to have their participation counted towards subcontracting plans or future procurements. Reimbursement of advance payments made by mentors to small business subcontractors is limited due to federal regulations. The Small Business Act grants SBA broad authority over size determinations, allowing joint ventures between mentors and prot\u00e9g\u00e9s to qualify as small for federal procurements. Federal courts and tribunals interpret statutes and regulations governing contracting with small businesses, as seen in the 2008 Rothe Development Corporation v. Department of Defense case. In Rothe v. Department of Defense, the court struck down a statute allowing a 10% \"price evaluation adjustment\" for small disadvantaged businesses due to lack of evidence of discrimination. This decision delayed the implementation of a set-aside program for women-owned small businesses and re-enacted preferences for minority-serving institutions of higher education. In Rothe v. Department of Defense, a statute allowing a 10% \"price evaluation adjustment\" for small disadvantaged businesses was struck down by the district court. The Obama Administration later repealed the regulations related to this adjustment authority. Various courts and tribunals, including SBA's Office of Hearings and Appeals, have issued decisions affecting federal contracting with small businesses. These decisions address NAICS codes, small business eligibility, and participation in programs like the 8(a) Program. Decisions from SBA's Office of Hearings and Appeals often establish standards for determining size or status in small business contracting programs, such as the affiliate test. OHA does not handle protests regarding federal contract awards, which is the role of the Government Accountability Office (GAO). The Government Accountability Office (GAO) and the U.S. Court of Federal Claims have jurisdiction to hear bid protests related to federal contracts, while SBA's Office of Hearings and Appeals (OHA) establishes standards for determining size or status in small business contracting programs. OHA does not handle protests regarding federal contract awards. The Veterans Benefits Act gave HUBZone small businesses precedence in set-asides over other small businesses. GAO initially interpreted the Act to prioritize veteran-owned small businesses, potentially increasing their federal procurement dollars by $3 billion annually. However, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit upheld VA's discretion to use Federal Supply Schedules instead. The Court of Federal Claims and GAO sometimes differ in their interpretations of procurement laws. GAO can only make recommendations in bid protest decisions, while the court's decisions are legally binding on executive branch agencies. Federal district courts do not have jurisdiction over bid protests but may address small business contracting issues unrelated to procurement. Federal district and appellate courts have jurisdiction over suits related to procurement, including disclosure under FOIA, challenges to agency actions under APA, and False Claims Act liability for fraudulent subcontracting plans. One federal district court has jurisdiction over challenges to agency insourcing determinations by small businesses."
