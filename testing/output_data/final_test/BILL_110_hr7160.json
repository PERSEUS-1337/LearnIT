    "content": "The Bretton Woods Agreements Act is amended to include a new section on the Clean Technology Fund. The Secretary of the Treasury may contribute $400,000,000 to the Clean Technology Fund to promote deployment of technologies reducing greenhouse gas emissions in developing countries. The fund is administered by the Bank. The Clean Technology Fund, funded by the Secretary of the Treasury, supports projects in developing countries to reduce emissions. It must align with the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and terminate operations when an international clean technology fund begins. The Clean Technology Fund, supported by the Secretary of the Treasury, aids projects in developing nations to cut emissions. It must adhere to the UNFCCC and cease operations when an international clean technology fund is established. The fund can hold undisbursed amounts in interest-bearing accounts and has limits on country access, with a cap of around 15% of resources per country and eligibility criteria for support. The Clean Technology Fund requires countries to submit an investment plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and contribute 25% of project costs from public funds. The Clean Technology Fund requires support to cover incremental costs of deploying clean energy technologies resulting in additional reductions from baseline greenhouse gas emissions. Allocation criteria prioritize zero carbon technologies and maximizing emission reductions per dollar of support. The Clean Technology Fund aims to reduce greenhouse emissions by supporting clean energy technologies and prioritizing investments in proven privately-owned enterprises. It prohibits support for new coal-fired electricity generation facilities unless they use specific technologies like integrated gasification combined cycle or ultrasupercritical. The Clean Technology Fund supports new technologies with high efficiency ratings, not subcritical or supercritical technology, for facilities designed for future carbon capture and storage retrofitting. The Clean Technology Fund supports new technologies with high efficiency ratings for future carbon capture and storage retrofitting, ensuring incremental reductions in greenhouse gas emissions beyond business-as-usual. The Clean Technology Fund supports projects that aim to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through the use of clean energy technology, which includes technologies that significantly decrease lifecycle emissions of greenhouse gases compared to current commercial technologies. The Clean Technology Fund aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by supporting projects that use clean energy technology. Greenhouse gases include carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, sulfur hexafluoride, hydrofluorocarbons, and perfluorocarbons. Maximum transparency is required from the Bank and the governing body of the fund. The Clean Technology Fund prioritizes transparency in governance, involving stakeholders for input on strategic directions and impacts. The governing body engages in dialogue with institutions promoting investments in clean energy projects. The Clean Technology Fund emphasizes transparency in governance by involving stakeholders in decision-making processes and engaging with institutions promoting investments in clean energy projects. The Secretary of the Treasury is responsible for United States votes on fund proposals and environmental assessments. The Secretary of the Treasury directs the US representative to oppose any proposal that would not meet environmental requirements for the Clean Technology Fund. They also encourage multilateral development banks to use similar environmental assessment procedures for Clean Technology Fund proposals. The Secretary of the Treasury ensures coordination between the Clean Technology Fund and the International Clean Energy Foundation. They are required to report to Congress on fund operations and project disbursements. The Secretary of the Treasury reports to Congress on the Clean Technology Fund's impact on greenhouse gas emissions, project eligibility criteria, fund operations progress, and support for coal-related projects. The report includes justifications for funding based on project transformational nature and alignment with national low carbon strategies. The Congress acknowledges the importance of small and medium-sized enterprises in technological innovation and economic development globally. They should be supported in the dissemination and implementation of clean technologies in developing countries through any fund mentioned in the previous report on the Clean Technology Fund's impact. SEC. 1308 amends Title XIII of the International Financial Institutions Act to expand climate change mitigation activities and greenhouse gas accounting by the Multilateral Development Banks. The Secretary of the Treasury must ensure that multilateral development banks adopt greenhouse gas accounting for projects seeking funding, including calculating net GHG flows, using uniform techniques, disclosing calculations, measuring project emissions, and considering global social costs. The Secretary of the Treasury is tasked with expanding climate change mitigation activities at multilateral development banks by supporting energy efficiency and renewable energy investments, integrating energy efficiency measures into infrastructure projects, and collaborating with developing countries on low-carbon economic development policies. The Secretary of the Treasury is responsible for promoting private sector engagement in renewable energy investments and integrating low-carbon economic development objectives into multilateral development bank strategies. The Secretary must report to Congress annually on the progress of implementing these efforts."
