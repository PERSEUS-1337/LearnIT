    "content": "The text chunk is about the Community Economic Adjustment Plan for closed or realigned military installations. The Secretary of Defense must not close or realign a military installation under a base closure law without a community economic adjustment plan. The plan must meet specific requirements, and the Secretary can provide assistance if needed. The Secretary of Defense provides grants and agreements to assist State or local governments in preparing community economic adjustment plans. Grants must meet specific requirements. The Office of Economic Adjustment carries out these requirements. Each plan for a closed or realigned military installation must include a proposal for non-defense use if economically feasible. The curr_chunk discusses the specific requirements for community economic adjustment plans for closed or realigned military installations, including descriptions of utilization, public notification proposals, environmental hazard assessments, employment impact assessments, and tax base effects. The curr_chunk outlines the assessment of the tax base and expenditures of State and local governments affected by closure or realignment, including proposals for minimizing economic impact on the region, such as ensuring economic stability, job creation, and growth in personal income rates. The Secretary must notify relevant committees and local governments once a community economic adjustment plan for a military installation meets requirements. The Secretary will prescribe regulations for carrying out the section, and the term \"base closure law\" is defined to include specific laws. The provisions of this Act will apply to military installations closed or realigned after the enactment date."
