    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Social Security KidSave Accounts Act\" and it introduces KidSave Accounts as part of the Social Security Act. The Commissioner of Social Security establishes KidSave Accounts for individuals born on or after January 1, 1997. Contributions are made to these accounts from the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund. The KidSave Account program establishes contributions for individuals born after January 1, 1997, with varying amounts based on birth year. Dollar amounts are adjusted for inflation annually. Designations for investment vehicles are made on behalf of eligible individuals. The KidSave Account program allows for designating investment vehicles for contributions on behalf of eligible individuals, with regulations for changing vehicles or types of accounts. Designate a KidSave Account under subsection (c) for transferring amounts from an existing account. Minors or incompetent individuals can have a guardian or fiduciary make the designation and receive payments on their behalf. The Commissioner may allow another person to make designations and receive payments on behalf of an individual under legal disability if no guardian has been appointed. This person will be responsible for the care of the individual and any payments made to them will prevent others from claiming the annuity payment. The Commissioner may authorize someone to make designations and receive payments for an individual under legal disability to ensure their care and prevent others from claiming the annuity payment. \"A Kidsave Account is a retirement plan designated by an individual and administered by the KidSave Investment Fund Board or a bank, excluding Roth IRAs.\" The KidSave Account is treated similarly to accounts in the Thrift Savings Fund or an individual retirement plan, with exceptions like contribution limits. The KidSave Account has contribution limits, rollover restrictions, and distribution rules. Rollover contributions can only come from another KidSave Account, and distributions can only be made under certain conditions. The individual must begin receiving benefits under this title or pass away for the specified date to apply. The KidSave Investment Fund is established in the Treasury of the United States, similar to the Thrift Savings Fund. It is managed by the KidSave Investment Fund Board in the Social Security Administration, following the same structure as the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board. Appropriations are made to the federal old-age and survivors insurance trust fund from the Treasury of the United States to carry out necessary functions."
