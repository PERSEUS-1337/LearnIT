    "content": "The \"Regional Jet Air Service Improvement Act\" may be cited as the official title of this Act. It amends Title 49 of the United States Code by adding a new section called \"Part E - Regional Air Service Incentive Program.\" The purpose of the Regional Jet Air Service Improvement Act is to provide loan guarantees to air carriers purchasing regional jet aircraft to improve service in underserved markets. Definitions include terms like \"aircraft purchase loan\" and \"air carrier.\" The Regional Jet Air Service Improvement Act defines key terms such as 'air carrier,' 'commuter air carrier,' 'intrastate air carrier,' and 'nonhub airport.' The Regional Jet Air Service Improvement Act defines terms like 'nonhub airport,' 'regional jet aircraft,' 'small hub airport,' and 'underserved market.' The Regional Jet Air Service Improvement Act defines an underserved market as a passenger air transportation market served by a nonhub or small hub airport, not within a 50-mile radius of a primary airport. The Act also allows the Secretary to guarantee lenders against losses on aircraft purchase loans for air carriers providing local or feeder air service. The Regional Jet Air Service Improvement Act defines underserved markets as those not within a 50-mile radius of a primary airport. The Act allows the Secretary to guarantee lenders against losses on aircraft purchase loans for air carriers providing local or feeder air service, including commuter and intrastate carriers. The guarantee is made in a specific form and under terms and conditions determined by the Secretary. Sec. 49204 outlines limitations on funds for loan guarantees under the Regional Jet Air Service Improvement Act. These limitations include restrictions on the amount of the loan, the purchase price of the aircraft, the repayment period, and the total face amount of the loan guaranteed. The Secretary may make a loan guarantee under this part if the aircraft purchased is a regional jet needed for improving carrier operations, serving underserved markets, and showing reasonable earning potential. The applicant must provide reasonable assurances of their ability to repay the loan and protect the United States. Additionally, they must pledge security that assures their ability and intention to repay the loan and continue operations as a commuter or intrastate air carrier. The loan guarantee requires the applicant to continue operations as a commuter or intrastate air carrier on the same routes and comply with noise standards for new turbo-jet-powered aircraft. The Secretary, through the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration, issues regulations in 14 CFR part 36. No loan guarantee can be made for the purchase of a regional jet aircraft unless the carrier agrees to provide service to the underserved market for at least 12 consecutive months. The Secretary will collect a guaranty fee from lending institutions for each loan. The Secretary may use Federal facilities and assistance from other agencies to carry out the loan guarantee program. The head of each department or agency must assist in implementing the program. The Secretary will provide information to the Comptroller General for oversight. The Comptroller General may request information regarding the loan guarantee program. Amounts received will go to the Treasury, payments to lenders will come from appropriated funds, and administrative expenses will be covered by Department of Transportation appropriations. The loan guarantee program's administrative expenses will be covered by Department of Transportation appropriations. The Secretary's authority under section 49203 will terminate 5 years after the enactment of the Regional Jet Air Service Improvement Act. Authorization of appropriations for part E of subtitle VII of title 49, United States Code."
