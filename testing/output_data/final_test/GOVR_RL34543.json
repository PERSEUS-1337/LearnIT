    "content": "Illegal drugs, including cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine, ecstasy, and cannabis, are substances whose production, sale, and use are restricted by law. The illegal drug trade is a lucrative transnational criminal enterprise, with the United States particularly affected according to the Department of Justice. The trade in cocaine and heroin involves cultivation in low-income countries. The U.S. government monitors drug cultivation and production trends in key countries like Colombia, Peru, and Bolivia. Colombia has been the primary source of coca bush cultivation, but its global proportion has declined. Harvestable coca bush estimates are used to calculate potential cocaine production each year. In 2012, global cocaine production was around 620 metric tons, with Peru surpassing Colombia as the top producer. However, the majority of cocaine in the United States still comes from Colombia. Opium poppy cultivation for heroin consumption in the United States is primarily done in Latin America, including Mexico, Colombia, and Guatemala. Afghanistan has become the main global source of illicit opium poppy cultivation, with most of its opiates destined for Europe, Asia, and Africa. Laos and Pakistan also contribute to the illicit global trade in opiates. Estimates of potential opium and heroin production can be derived from opium poppy crop harvests and other factors. According to U.S. law enforcement data, heroin availability and demand in the United States are increasing, with a rise in heroin overdose deaths. Mexican transnational criminal organizations are increasingly involved in heroin production and transportation into the United States. While Afghanistan dominates global opium production, only 4% of heroin in the U.S. is sourced from Southwest Asia. Global illegal synthetic drug production is challenging to estimate due to its widespread nature. Illicit synthetic drugs like amphetamine, methamphetamine, and ecstasy are produced from legally manufactured chemicals that are diverted for illegal purposes. These chemicals are processed in clandestine labs, ranging from small kitchens to large \"superlabs.\" Methamphetamine production labs have been found in West Africa, previously known for cocaine and heroin transit. Most methamphetamine in the US is believed to come from Mexico, with sophisticated drug trafficking organizations connecting producers and consumers. Significant drug transit pathways flow through Mexico, Central America, West Africa, and countries surrounding Afghanistan. Traffickers use various methods like boats, containers, aircraft, and ground transportation. The United Nations estimated in 2012 that 162-324 million people aged 15-64 are involved in drug trafficking globally. The United Nations estimated in 2012 that 162-324 million people aged 15-64 used illicit substances, including cannabis. The global cocaine market has been stable, with consumption declining in the United States. Consumption trends may shift to regions in South America, Africa, and Asia. Synthetic drug consumption is a significant concern, especially in the Middle East and parts of Asia. Drug overdoses from heroin and opioids remain a major cause of drug-related deaths globally. The global illegal drug trade poses a multi-dimensional challenge with implications for U.S. national interests and the international community. Drug use resulted in 95,000 to 226,000 deaths worldwide in 2012, negatively impacting communities, hindering economic development, and straining public health systems. Intravenous drug users face increased risks of diseases like Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, and HIV/AIDS. Drug trafficking is seen as a threat to international security, providing traffickers with resources to evade detection, corrupt systems, and penetrate legitimate structures. Transnational criminal networks engage in extortion, money laundering, and challenge national governments. Criminal safe havens allow drug traffickers to operate freely, particularly in regions with weak governance. This exacerbates political instability, post-conflict environments, and economic vulnerability. Drug trafficking fuels corruption, undermines political stability, and perpetuates a cycle of social and political unrest. The presence of a thriving drug industry can exacerbate political instability and attract social unrest. Control of the illegal drug trade by political actors or insurgent groups can prolong conflicts. State powers controlled by criminal organizations through corruption can enhance their influence by utilizing the state's infrastructure. This situation is evident in Afghanistan, where drug proceeds support the insurgency. The international drug trade poses ongoing dangers, with Americans being targeted in counternarcotics operations. Concerns exist about DTO- and TCO-related violence spreading from Mexico to the United States. Foreign terrorist organizations involved in drug trafficking are a major threat, as highlighted in the intelligence community's annual assessment. Mexico is a significant producer of marijuana, methamphetamine, and heroin consumed in the United States. The international drug trade, including marijuana, methamphetamine, and heroin production, poses a significant threat to U.S. interests. New psychoactive substances (NPS) are emerging as a growing public health concern. Despite longstanding U.S. and multilateral efforts, tensions persist between foreign drug policy and international approaches. Policymakers argue that the political and security threats associated with drug trafficking require a comprehensive policy response. The international drug trade poses political and security threats, requiring a policy focus on disrupting criminal organizations involved in drug trafficking. International drug control policies also target health consequences of drug abuse, demand reduction, and alternative livelihood options for drug crop farmers. Current approaches have been criticized as ineffective, with the United Nations failing to meet its goal of reducing illicit drug supply by 2008. In 2010, the Obama Administration's ONDCP admitted that current counternarcotics strategy has not been successful, leading to increased pressure to reconsider international drug policies. Calls for a shift away from prohibitionist approaches have been made by advocates, including the Latin American Commission on Drugs and Democracy in 2009. The Global Commission on Drug Policy, co-led by ex-presidents from Colombia, Mexico, and Brazil, challenged the international community to reevaluate drug control policies. In 2011, they released a report expanding the Latin American Commission's debate on drug policy. Several sitting presidents also expressed interest in exploring alternatives to the existing international drug control regime, raising the topic at various summits and assemblies. In January 2013, Bolivia successfully rejoined the U.N. drug control regime with a specific reservation clause for coca leaf. Bolivia rejoined the U.N. drug control regime in January 2013 with a reservation clause exempting criminalization of coca leaf use. This move has sparked debate on the effectiveness and adaptability of the current international drug control system. The upcoming U.N. General Assembly Special Session in 2016 is seen as an opportunity to reassess global drug policy. The international community is debating potential changes to drug control policies, which could impact various foreign policy considerations for the United States. International efforts to combat drug trafficking are based on longstanding multilateral commitments dating back to the International Opium Commission of 1909. The international community has expanded drug control efforts through U.N. treaties since the 1909 International Opium Commission. Over 95% of U.N. Member States, including the U.S., are parties to these treaties, which regulate the production and trade of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances for medical and scientific purposes. Monitoring mechanisms ensure treaty adherence. The U.N. treaties establish international mechanisms, such as the INCB, to monitor drug treaty adherence and collect data on illicit drug activities. The U.N. Commission on Narcotic Drugs develops strategies for global drug control and recommends measures to combat the drug problem. UNODC provides technical assistance projects and research on drug market trends, while regional organizations like CICAD supplement multilateral efforts. The international counternarcotics initiatives include the Inter-American Drug Abuse Control Commission (CICAD) and the Drug Advisory Programme (DAP) of the Colombo Plan. Other efforts involve the U.S.-Russia Counternarcotics Working Group, the Group of Eight Roma-Lyon Group meeting, and the U.S.-Sino Joint Liaison Group on Law Enforcement Cooperation. These initiatives focus on various aspects of counternarcotics cooperation and address transnational issues like money laundering. The United States has been actively involved in international drug control efforts since the early 20th century, with a focus on combating transnational issues such as money laundering, drug trafficking-financed terrorism, corruption, organized crime, and global health. Starting in the late 1960s, U.S. counternarcotics efforts became a prominent part of policy debates, with Presidents Nixon and Reagan declaring illicit drugs as a major threat to national security. Congress has also played a significant role in shaping U.S. drug policy through key legislative provisions. The United States has been actively involved in international drug control efforts since the early 20th century, focusing on combating transnational issues like money laundering, drug trafficking-financed terrorism, corruption, organized crime, and global health. Congress established the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) in 1988 to coordinate U.S. counterdrug policy. The State Department leads international counterdrug foreign assistance, the Defense Department monitors foreign drug flows, and the DEA leads drug-related law enforcement. Multiple U.S. agencies are responsible for various aspects of the U.S. counterdrug response. The U.S. government is actively involved in international drug control efforts through various strategies and initiatives. The goal is to reduce the flow of illegal drugs into the United States by cooperating with foreign governments to disrupt the drug trade. The Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) submits an annual National Drug Control Strategy report to Congress, outlining budget allocations and strategic goals for combating drug supply and demand. The 2014 National Drug Control Strategy outlines U.S. goals to disrupt drug trade internationally, support drug control efforts in source countries, and target drug trafficking organizations. The Administration aims to protect public health and national security through counternarcotics efforts. Approximately $27.6 billion has been requested for federal drug control programs in FY2016. The Administration requested $27.6 billion from Congress for federal drug control programs in FY2016, including $1.6 billion for international programs and $3.9 billion for interdiction programs. The State Department submits an International Drug Control Strategy Report annually to Congress, providing an overview of U.S. counternarcotics policies and country-by-country analysis of progress in combating drugs and related financial crimes. The 2015 INCSR report highlighted the U.S. role in international cooperation on drug matters, emphasizing the need for long-term perseverance to reduce illegal drug use and criminal enterprises. The United States will continue to provide leadership and assistance to its partners in counterdrug efforts, primarily focusing on the Western Hemisphere, Afghanistan, West Africa, and Central Asia. The United States and Mexico initiated the M\u00e9rida Initiative in October 2007 to combat drug trafficking along the U.S.-Mexican border and in Central America. The $1.4 billion security package provided equipment, training, and technical assistance to combat drug trafficking in the region. The U.S. and Mexican governments continued cooperation after the M\u00e9rida Initiative ended in FY2010. Counterdrug support to Central America shifted to the Central American Regional Security Initiative (CARSI). U.S. security assistance to Mexico focused on institutional development and capacity building in the justice sector, with an emphasis on social reforms to combat organized crime and drug trafficking. The M\u00e9rida strategy has four pillars: disrupt and. The M\u00e9rida strategy aims to combat organized crime, drug trafficking, and strengthen border security. Congress allocated $2.4 billion in U.S. assistance to Mexico from FY2008 to FY2014 for this initiative. Cocaine trafficking through Central America has increased due to pressure in Mexico. The Central America Regional Security Initiative (CARSI) was funded by Congress in FY2010 to address security concerns in Central America, where cocaine trafficking through Mexico has increased. Corruption is widespread in the region, and CARSI aims to enhance crime prevention and rule of law institutions. President Obama announced the Central American Citizen Security Partnership in March 2011 to oversee the implementation of CARSI funds. The Central American Citizen Security Partnership and CARSI funds aim to create safe streets, disrupt criminal activities, support government institutions, enhance state presence in communities, and promote cooperation among countries for security efforts. Congress allocated $803.6 million in regional assistance through CARSI from FY2008 to FY2014. President Obama announced plans to strengthen U.S. efforts in promoting regional cooperation on crime and security issues. The Caribbean Basin Security Initiative (CBSI) was launched in June 2010 to address drug trafficking, violent crimes, and homicide rates in the Caribbean region. It aims to promote citizen safety, combat illicit activity, and transnational criminal groups through a security assistance initiative. Representatives from 15 Caribbean countries and the United States agreed on a new framework for security cooperation engagement and a plan of action during a Caribbean-U.S. Security Cooperation Dialogue meeting in May 2010. The Caribbean Basin Security Initiative (CBSI) was established in 2010 to address drug trafficking and violent crimes in the region. Congress allocated $327 million in security assistance through the CBSI from FY2010 to FY2014. Plan Colombia, a strategy implemented in 1999, aimed to end armed conflict, eliminate drug trafficking, and promote development in Colombia. The U.S. government spent over $8 billion in security and development assistance between FY2000 and FY2011 to support Plan Colombia and subsequent programs. The Colombian government has nationalized previously U.S.-funded security and development initiatives, including support for military programs like the counterdrug brigade and Colombian Army aviation. The U.S. continues to support Colombia through the U.S.-Colombia Strategic Development Initiative, which includes counternarcotics assistance and other economic and social development initiatives. In Afghanistan, drug control policy shifted in June 2009 under Ambassador Richard Holbrooke. In June 2009, Ambassador Richard Holbrooke shifted U.S. drug control policy in Afghanistan towards agricultural development and interdiction. This strategy was formalized in the January 2010 Regional Stabilization Strategy, connecting counternarcotics efforts with counterinsurgency goals. The State Department released an updated U.S. Counternarcotics Strategy for Afghanistan in March 2010, focusing on countering the narcotics-insurgency and narcotics-corruption nexus. The March 2010 Counternarcotics Strategy in Afghanistan shifted focus towards Afghan-led eradication of poppy fields and improving the connection between counternarcotics and counterinsurgency goals. In December 2012, a revised U.S. Counternarcotics Strategy emphasized building Afghan capacity to disrupt the illicit narcotics trade and break the narcotics-insurgency nexus. The State Department led the development of a $60 million program called the West Africa Cooperative Security Initiative (WACSI) in 2011 to combat transnational crime in West Africa, including drug trafficking. WACSI aims to strengthen the Afghan government's capacity to combat drugs and counter the narcotics-corruption nexus. It includes the creation of a counternarcotics unit in Ghana and a regional training center in Accra. The West Africa Cooperative Security Initiative (WACSI) in Accra, Ghana has five strategic goals: 1. Support government and civil society institutions to prevent impunity and corruption. 2. Establish effective anti-crime policies and legal frameworks. 3. Strengthen security and law enforcement operations targeting illicit networks. 4. Reinforce justice sector institutions for transnational crime cases. 5. Address socioeconomic dimensions of illicit activity. Several U.S. agencies, including the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) and the Department of State, are involved in implementing international counternarcotics activities to support the Administration's National Drug Control Strategy. ONDCP establishes U.S. counterdrug policies and goals, while the Secretary of State coordinates international counterdrug programs and foreign counternarcotics assistance. The State Department, along with other U.S. agencies, implements international counternarcotics activities, focusing on fighting illegal narcotics production and trafficking. The International Narcotics Strategy Report details efforts to combat the drug trade, including anti-money laundering. USAID provides assistance for economic and social development, including counternarcotics development programs like alternative livelihood initiatives for farmers. The Department of Defense (DOD) leads efforts in detecting and monitoring illegal drug transit into the United States, sharing intelligence with law enforcement and international partners. DOD entities involved in international drug control include the Office for Counternarcotics and Global Threats, the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), and regional combatant commands. DOD also provides foreign assistance to enhance counternarcotics capabilities of foreign agencies. The Department of Justice (DOJ) and Department of Homeland Security (DHS) play key roles in international drug control. DOJ agencies like the DEA, FBI, OCDETF, and EPIC focus on law enforcement operations and intelligence analysis. DHS is responsible for U.S. policies on interdicting illegal drugs entering the country. The Strategic Plan for DHS focuses on securing the U.S. border against illegal drugs, with key offices like CBP, U.S. Coast Guard, and ICE participating in counterdrug activities. The Treasury Department targets illicit financial proceeds from drug trafficking, involving offices like OFAC and FinCEN. The CIA's CNC collects intelligence to counter illicit drug activities. The Administration has requested approximately $27.6 billion for federal drug control programs in FY2016, with $5.5 billion for international and interdiction programs. ONDCP restructured its budgeting process starting from FY2012, adding more agencies and programs to the overall drug budget. This resulted in an increase in the total budget, particularly for domestic programs. The ONDCP's national drug budget includes a significant portion for international counterdrug support through civilian and military-funded assistance to foreign countries. This aid aims to help countries intercept and eliminate drugs, develop alternative livelihoods, and reduce local drug demand. The U.S. Department of State and USAID are the main sources of civilian funding for international counternarcotics programs, which can also be carried out by other U.S. government entities or private contractors. Funding comes from accounts like Development Assistance and Economic Support Fund. The U.S. Department of State and USAID provide funding for international counternarcotics programs through accounts like Development Assistance, Economic Support Fund, Assistance for Europe, Eurasia, and Central Asia, and International Narcotics Control and Law Enforcement. Authority for this funding is derived from provisions in the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, with key sections focusing on coordinating assistance to combat illicit narcotics and prioritizing programs to reduce narcotics cultivation. The U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) plays a key role in counternarcotics efforts by detecting and monitoring illegal drug movements towards the United States. They also collect and share intelligence with law enforcement and international partners. Additionally, DOD provides assistance to train and equip foreign countries in counternarcotics efforts. The DOD is authorized to provide counternarcotics assistance to foreign countries to help them control ungoverned spaces used by drug traffickers. This assistance includes training, equipment provisions, and transport of law enforcement personnel. This authority originates from Section 1004 and Section 1033 of the National Defense Authorization Act. Section 1033 of the National Defense Authorization Act allows DOD to provide non-lethal equipment to assist specific countries in their counterdrug efforts. Assistance includes navigation, communication, radar, night vision systems, vehicles, aircraft, and boats. Currently, DOD is authorized to provide this assistance to 39 countries through FY2016. The National Defense Authorization Act authorizes DOD to provide non-lethal equipment to assist specific countries in their counterdrug efforts. Assistance includes navigation, communication, radar, night vision systems, vehicles, aircraft, and boats to countries like Coast, Jamaica, Liberia, Mauritania, Nicaragua, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, and Togo, as well as Chad, Libya, Mali, and Niger. Additionally, DOD is authorized to support joint counternarcotics and counterterrorism activities in various countries through different provisions in the NDAA for Fiscal Years 2004 and 2015, and the 2002 Supplemental Appropriations Act. The National Defense Authorization Act authorizes DOD to use counternarcotics funds for a unified campaign against narcotics trafficking and terrorism. U.S. counterdrug efforts focus on four main strategies: combating drug production, flow, networks, and promoting international cooperation. The U.S. policy tools for combating illicit drug production focus on eradicating coca bush and opium poppy crops, providing alternative livelihood options to drug crop farmers, and reducing the cultivation of illicit drug crops through various eradication programs such as aerial fumigation, manual removal, and mechanical removal. The United States supports eradication efforts in countries like Colombia, primarily targeting coca, opium, and marijuana crops. The U.S. government supports eradication programs in countries like Colombia, primarily targeting drug crops with chemical herbicides, technical assistance, and spray aircraft. Eradication is a controversial but long-standing U.S. policy for international drug control, aiming to prevent drug cultivation to reduce the need for costly enforcement and interdiction operations. The U.S. government supports eradication programs in countries like Colombia, targeting drug crops with herbicides and technical assistance. Manual eradication of coca plants is time-consuming and resource-intensive, while aerial herbicide application is not always feasible or cost-effective. Critics question the effectiveness of reducing foreign drug supplies on illicit drug use in the United States. Aerial fumigation in Colombia has raised concerns about negative consequences of the herbicide used. Global crop control policies may have negative political and social impacts, as seen in Afghanistan where eradication efforts led to farmers aligning with insurgents. The U.S. government's eradication policies in Afghanistan were deemed a failure, wasting millions of dollars. Since 2009, the U.S. has not directly participated in eradication operations in Afghanistan, but continues to fund a governor-led program. In Colombia, aerial eradication has led to a decline in cocaine production, but remains a high-risk activity due to targeting by drug traffickers. In 2003, FARC shot down a U.S. government plane in Colombia, killing the pilot and taking three crew members hostage until 2008. U.S. counterdrug policy includes foreign assistance for crop farmers to switch to sustainable livelihoods. Alternative development aims to replace drug crops with licit options through training and infrastructure. The U.S. government supports alternative development programs in various regions to reduce drug supply by offering crop substitution options, sustainable farming training, and infrastructure development. These programs aim to provide economic alternatives to narcotics production and legal employment opportunities to farmers, complementing law enforcement efforts. Since the late 1960s, alternative development programs have evolved from crop substitution projects to include broader initiatives such as infrastructure development and health care assistance. In some cases, like in Afghanistan, development aid is tied to reducing drug cultivation. The U.S.-funded Good Performers Initiative rewards provinces in Afghanistan that are poppy-free or have reduced cultivation by 10% with development project awards. Successful models, like in the San Martin region of Peru, have been cited, but critics argue that localized successes do not always translate to national impact. Critics note that localized successes in alternative development programs do not always lead to national or global trends. There are concerns about the limited coordination between alternative development projects and eradication efforts, with only 10-15% of illicit cultivation areas covered by international community-supported projects. On average, only 5% of farmers growing illicit crops receive alternative development assistance. The Department of Defense leads efforts to detect and monitor drug trafficking towards the United States, coordinating with other U.S. agencies and foreign governments to deny traffickers transit routes. Security threats, lack of political will/resources, and local distrust hinder alternative development projects for illicit crop cultivation. The Department of Defense leads interdiction operations in the transit zone to deny drug traffickers access to transit routes. The U.S. Coast Guard is the lead agency for interdiction on the high seas, working with partner nations through bilateral agreements for maritime counternarcotics operations. The U.S. Coast Guard and U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) work together to coordinate detection, monitoring, and interdiction activities to secure the United States from foreign threats, including drugs and drug traffickers. International interdiction operations are also conducted by U.S. agencies like the DEA through programs such as Operation Containment, Project Cohesion, and Project Prism. Operation Containment aims to prevent processing chemicals for heroin production from entering Afghanistan. The U.S. is involved in various international initiatives to track and control precursor chemicals used in the production of drugs like cocaine, heroin, and synthetic drugs. These efforts include Project Cohesion, Project Prism, and the Joint Interagency Task Force-West's Illicit Tracking Cell. Additionally, U.S. counternarcotics activities in Afghanistan focus on interdicting drug trafficking syndicates and intercepting methamphetamine precursor chemicals in commercial maritime cargo. The U.S. is involved in international initiatives to track and control precursor chemicals for drug production. Joint interdiction operations in the transit zone between the U.S. and Latin America have improved regional cooperation. Despite successes, drug trafficking organizations are becoming more sophisticated in evasion techniques. Some observers are concerned about the sophistication of drug trafficking organizations in evading interdiction efforts. Budget pressures may lead to a reduction in resources for interdiction operations, potentially allowing more cocaine to reach the United States. The commitment of U.S. military assets to other priorities in the 2000s may have hindered law enforcement's ability to intercept drug shipments. Interdiction efforts to intercept drug shipments may raise drug prices, incentivizing traffickers. Traffickers may use new tactics like self-propelled semi-submersible vessels. Successful interdiction can lead to short-term increases in drug-related violence as traffickers compete for control of routes. This has been a contributing factor to drug-related violence in Mexico. Some are concerned that increased interdiction efforts in Afghanistan may lead to consequences similar to drug-related violence in Mexico. Operation Anvil in Honduras raised concerns due to aggressive tactics and lethal shootouts involving DEA agents and U.S. helicopters. Key U.S. foreign policy tools for targeting drug traffickers include extradition agreements, asset freezing, and building foreign capacity for law enforcement. The U.S. government uses extradition as a tool against drug traffickers located abroad. Extradition involves surrendering suspects to another state for prosecution. Proponents argue that suspects are more likely to receive a fair trial in U.S. courts. Bilateral judicial cooperation with Mexico and Colombia has led to record numbers of extradited traffickers to the United States. Colombia has extradited over 1,600 individuals since 1997, while Mexico extradited 54 individuals in 2013. Some drug traffickers are changing their behavior due to the threat of extradition, with Colombia and Mexico extraditing individuals to the United States. However, not all countries have extradition agreements with the U.S., with some refusing to extradite suspects citing concerns about the death penalty and sovereignty rights. Burma, for example, has refused to extradite four suspected drug traffickers to the U.S. Some observers claim that suspected traffickers exploit extradition limitations by seeking safe haven in countries unwilling to extradite, to launder illicit drug profits into the legal economy. The United States and international community use anti-money laundering efforts to combat this illegal drug market activity. U.S. agencies are involved in international anti-money laundering efforts to enhance financial transaction transparency, improve cooperation with foreign governments and financial institutions, and provide law enforcement training and support to foreign countries. Congress passed anti-money laundering regulations in 1999. In 1999, Congress passed anti-money laundering regulations to combat illicit drug profits. The Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act allows targeting of significant foreign narcotics traffickers and their organizations to deny access to the U.S. financial system. After 9/11, Congress strengthened measures by giving the Treasury Secretary authority to impose regulatory restrictions against foreign jurisdictions and financial institutions involved in suspicious transactions. The Treasury Secretary can target transactions involving foreign jurisdictions deemed as \"primary money laundering concern\" to combat drug trafficking and related criminal activities. The State Department's annual report identifies major money laundering countries engaging in significant currency transactions from international narcotics trafficking. Other agencies also target drug trafficking-related financial assets. The Department of Justice and Department of Homeland Security's Immigration Customs and Enforcement agency target drug trafficking-related financial assets. Anti-money laundering efforts have been effective in combating drug trafficking, isolating and incapacitating designated supporters, businesses, and front companies linked to Colombian drug cartels. Treasury Secretary has additional authorities to designate jurisdictions of primary money laundering concern. Treasury has the authority to designate jurisdictions of primary money laundering concern and apply \"special measures\" against them, with potential significant impacts on the financial services industry. For example, the designation of Banco Delta Asia led to the freezing of $25 million in North Korean assets, including counterfeit U.S. currency and profits from criminal activities like drug trafficking. Critics argue that anti-money laundering efforts may be less effective in combating drug trafficking compared to other tools. Money laundering methods identified as concerns over a decade ago, such as bulk cash smuggling and trade-based money laundering, continue to be prevalent today. The challenges of money laundering today include the increasing volume of financial transactions, especially international electronic transfers, and the movement of illegal funds through informal channels like \"hawala\" networks and stored-value cards. U.S. efforts to combat foreign drug networks involve providing assistance to foreign countries to strengthen their judicial and law enforcement institutions. This assistance includes training, equipping, and capacity building to fight corruption and support criminal justice system reforms. The U.S. is involved in counterdrug-related capacity building efforts abroad, providing training and technical assistance to foreign law enforcement practitioners. U.S.-funded International Law Enforcement Academies and Regional Training Centers are located in various countries to enhance interdiction efforts. Several U.S. agencies are involved in this training and assistance, including the State Department, U.S. Coast Guard, and U.S. Customs and Border. The U.S. is actively involved in providing anti-narcotics law enforcement training, technical assistance, and equipment to foreign personnel through various agencies such as the DEA, FBI, U.S. Coast Guard, and U.S. Customs and Border Protection. Efforts include capacity building projects in countries like Afghanistan, Colombia, Mexico, and Thailand, as well as support from the U.S. military for drug monitoring. Additionally, the U.S. contributes funding and expertise to international law enforcement assistance activities. Counterdrug policies aim to prevent drug trafficking organizations from undermining foreign government institutions. Some argue that more focus should be placed on developing a culture supportive of the rule of law in foreign countries. Without understanding the importance of the rule of law, aid alone may not be effective in combating the global drug problem. The State Department funds programs in foreign countries to reduce drug use, crime, and violence, as well as prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS among intravenous drug users. This includes supporting drug-free community coalitions in Latin America and substance abuse treatment centers in Afghanistan. International assistance to reduce drug demand has historically been limited. International efforts to reduce drug demand have been limited, with a focus on high-income countries like the United States. However, there is a growing emphasis on addressing demand in drug source countries and transit routes. Early interventions in emerging illicit drug markets are seen as valuable in reducing demand, but programs are often limited in scope. Only one in six problem drug users globally receive treatment, with even fewer receiving interventions in Africa, Eastern Europe, and other regions. Experts acknowledge that demand reduction policies alone may not effectively combat the global drug problem. The President has the authority to suspend U.S. foreign assistance to countries that are major illegal drug producers or transit countries. In FY2015, 22 countries were identified as \"drug majors,\" including Afghanistan, Colombia, and Mexico. Congress requires the President to certify that these countries have made substantial efforts to combat drug production and trafficking. In FY2015, the President did not certify three drug majors: Bolivia, Burma, and Venezuela. The President has the authority to suspend U.S. foreign assistance to countries that are major illegal drug producers or transit countries. Failure to receive a presidential certification of substantial counternarcotics efforts may result in foreign assistance prohibitions against drug majors. Decertified drug majors may still receive U.S. foreign assistance if deemed vital to U.S. national interests. Congress can withhold foreign assistance to drug majors countries despite presidential certification through a joint resolution disapproving of the certification. The drug majors designation process allows the U.S. government to provide assistance to countries like Burma and Venezuela deemed vital to U.S. national interests. While supporters argue it is an effective diplomatic tool, in some cases, like Bolivia, it has led to disagreements and rifts in counternarcotics policies between countries. Critics highlight the unilateral and non-cooperative nature of the drug majors designation process. Critics recommend moving towards multilateral and regional fora for evaluating governments' counterdrug efforts instead of unilateral drug certification requirements. Some suggest using the OAS/CICAD Multilateral Evaluation Mechanism as an alternative model for international drug control cooperation. Many emphasize the importance of international drug control policy due to the transnational nature of the drug trade. Critics criticize existing international drug control policies for not achieving significant progress in combating illegal drugs. The UNODC reports stabilization in global drug use, decline in opium poppy and coca cultivation, and increased illicit drug seizures. Global coordination is seen as crucial for success in combating the international drug trade, but the system has been criticized for not meeting the UN's goal of reducing drug production and availability by 2008. The Commission on Narcotic Drugs set a new target for 2019. In 2019, efforts are being made to reduce illegal drug cultivation, trafficking, and money laundering. Questions arise about national flexibility in drug control treaties, the impact of counternarcotics strategies on drug-related violence, and the consequences of policies allowing marijuana use. The curr_chunk discusses the relationship between counternarcotics operations and drug-related violence, the role of governments in mitigating violence, the interaction of counternarcotics policies with other priorities like counterterrorism, and the potential human rights violations in drug-related investigations. It also raises questions about the Department of Defense's involvement in counternarcotics assistance and the use of aerial eradication as a policy tool. The curr_chunk raises questions about the impact of human rights violations on drug control policies, the consideration of economic and social development in counternarcotics policy, coordination with international partners, and the potential limitations of international legal constraints on U.S. counternarcotics efforts. It also questions how counternarcotics policies intersect with foreign policy goals such as anti-corruption and rule of law improvements."
