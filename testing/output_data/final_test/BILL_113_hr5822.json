    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Developing Standards for Electronic Shipping Papers Act of 2014\". Congress acknowledges the importance of effective response strategies, equipment, and training in mitigating hazardous materials transportation incidents. Shipping papers and manifests are crucial for determining the proper response strategy. While physical shipping papers are required by law to protect first responders, efforts should be made to modernize how hazardous materials information is disseminated. The HM-ACCESS Program is a significant step towards developing innovative methods for sharing this information. The HM-ACCESS Program is developing new ways to share hazardous material information electronically, with pilot tests expected to finish in October 2015. Efforts should be made to ensure best practices and standards are available for transporters until the pilot and subsequent rulemakings are completed. This will help modernize efforts and provide standardized information platforms for first responders. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. This Act defines \"commerce\" and \"hazardous material\" as per section 5102 of title 49, United States Code. \"Electronic shipping paper\" is an electronic version of physical shipping paper providing hazard information instantly to emergency responders. The Hazardous Materials Information Advisory Committee will be established by the Secretary of Transportation within 30 days of the Act's enactment. The committee will include members representing fire services, law enforcement, emergency response providers, hazardous material transporters, and employees involved in transporting hazardous materials. The Hazardous Materials Information Advisory Committee, established by the Secretary of Transportation, will develop a voluntary standard for electronic shipping papers and training for first responders. Recommendations for electronic shipping papers usage will be provided for varying circumstances and locations. The Hazardous Materials Information Advisory Committee will develop best practices for electronic shipping papers, including recommendations for different circumstances and locations. They will also consider scalability of information presentation for emergency response personnel and access to ancillary information related to hazardous materials transport. The Hazardous Materials Information Advisory Committee will address issues such as access and spectrum challenges for rural responders, standardization of information for equipment consistency, data security for integrity protection, National Deployment Standard for secure access, fail-safe redundancies for emergency centers, and funding methods for implementation. The Hazardous Materials Information Advisory Committee will discuss various topics including funding methods for implementing electronic shipping papers devices, updates to Emergency Response Guidebooks, voluntary technologies used for transporting hazardous materials, and pilot test results under MAP-21. The Secretary may provide travel expenses to appointed members in accordance with applicable provisions. The Hazardous Materials Information Advisory Committee will report on best practices, standards, and findings developed under subsection (c) within 120 days of the enactment of the Act to the House and Senate committees."
