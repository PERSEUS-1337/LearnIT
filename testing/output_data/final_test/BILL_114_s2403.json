The \"Military Family Stability Act of 2015\" introduces a new section allowing members of the armed forces and their spouses to jointly elect the timing of spouse relocation during a permanent change of station. Members and spouses eligible to make elections for spouse relocation during a permanent change of station include those where the spouse is gainfully employed or enrolled in an educational program at the beginning of the covered relocation period, or if the member and spouse have dependents, at least one of whom is a child in elementary or secondary school at the beginning of the covered relocation period. During a permanent change of station, members may be eligible for spouse relocation if the spouse is enrolled in an educational program, gainfully employed, or if they have dependents in elementary or secondary school. Additionally, eligibility may also apply if the spouse or dependent is part of the Exceptional Family Member Program, or if the member and spouse are caring for a family member with a chronic illness at the beginning of the relocation period. During a permanent change of station, members may be eligible for spouse relocation based on specific qualifications outlined in regulations applicable to the member's armed force. If the member, spouse, or both meet other qualifications specified in the regulations, they may also be eligible. In cases where no qualifications are met, the commander may determine eligibility for the election based on family stability and the interests of the armed force concerned. During a permanent change of station, unmarried members of the armed forces may elect for their dependents to relocate with them. The decision is made on a case-by-case basis, considering family stability and the interests of the armed force. During a permanent change of station, unmarried members of the armed forces may elect for their dependents to relocate with them. The decision is made based on the member's custodial rights and the dependents' age and living arrangements. Dependents over 19 years old require a power of attorney for residence, while those under 20 years old must reside with a caregiver according to the Family Care Plan until relocated. A member must have at least 24 months of obligated service remaining to make an election under subsections (a) or (b), with a limit of three elections. If a member's spouse relocates before them, the member may be assigned to bachelor quarters until their permanent change of station. The quarters or housing facilities assigned to a member should ideally not charge a lease fee. If no such quarters are available, the member should be assigned to the lowest cost housing option. Secretaries are required to include clauses in contracts for military housing to accommodate members covered by this rule. Members covered by this rule may be assigned to military housing at the lease fee for up to 180 days. Spouses and dependents can continue to reside in US housing during relocation, and eligible spouses and dependents can move into US housing at any time during the relocation period. During the covered relocation period, members undergoing a permanent change of station will receive basic allowance for housing at the with-dependents rate, regardless of when their spouse and dependents relocate. The geographic location of the dependents will determine the portion of the allowance payable to the member. During a permanent change of station, members will receive housing allowance based on the location of their dependents. If quarters are unavailable, members will receive compensation for housing costs until they and their spouse reside in the same area after the relocation. Professional gear will be transported during the relocation according to regulations.
