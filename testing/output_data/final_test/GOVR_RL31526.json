    "content": "The United States formally entered World War II on December 8, 1941, declaring war against Japan after the attack on Pearl Harbor. Three days later, war was declared against Germany and Italy. President Franklin D. Roosevelt, in his third term, faced a Congress with large Democratic majorities that had previously favored isolationism and neutrality. The Johnson Debt Default Act of 1934 prohibited loans to foreign governments in default to the US. In 1934, several European countries formally defaulted on loans to the United States. Congress passed Neutrality Acts to restrict arms shipments and travel to belligerent nations. In 1939, the neutrality law was modified to allow \"cash and carry\" exports of arms. The Senate also established a committee to investigate the munitions industry. The Nye committee, chaired by Senator Gerald P. Nye, conducted public hearings on the heavy profits of financiers and armament makers during World War I. It strengthened isolationist sentiment in Congress and led to the Neutrality Acts of 1935, 1936, and 1937. The committee's investigations and generated opinions hindered the Roosevelt Administration's efforts to expand national defense or pursue a more internationalist foreign policy. It became less relevant during World War II. During World War II, FDR was concerned about his relationship with Congress. The Special Committee to Investigate Un-American Activities, established in 1938, had a broad mandate to probe propaganda activities in the United States, including subversive propaganda from foreign or domestic sources. This committee targeted the Communist Party but also had the authority to investigate any organization promoting social, political, or economic change. The House Special Committee aimed to investigate various organizations promoting social, political, or economic change. However, the committee's chairman, Representative Martin Dies, was conservative and focused on opposing Roosevelt's New Deal. House leaders tried to keep the committee narrowly focused to prevent interference with the war effort. In contrast, the Senate Special Committee to Investigate the National Defense Program, established in March 1941, primarily focused on war mobilization and defense production. Senator Harry S. Truman initiated the creation of a panel to address concerns about defense contract allocation. Truman, known for supporting the New Deal, gained visibility through this initiative. The panel's establishment was seen as a more acceptable alternative to other anti-New Deal efforts. The attack on Pearl Harbor and the subsequent declaration of war marked the beginning of the wartime relationship between the President and Congress. The circumstances of the attack and the immediate response by American armed forces became an early information issue for both branches. Pearl Harbor, located 2,400 miles southwest of California, was impervious to news media after the Japanese attack. By December 8, it was known that 90% of the fleet had been disabled. The extent of the loss was not disclosed to the public for weeks, fearing a Japanese assault. Blame was placed on the Executive Branch by February 1942. The Executive Branch was blamed for the Pearl Harbor attack, with Congress and President Roosevelt seeking to shift responsibility. President Roosevelt tried to appease Congress with a fact-finding report, but Congress continued to hold him and his subordinates accountable for American defenses at Pearl Harbor. Congress held the Roosevelt Administration responsible for the Pearl Harbor attack and directed investigations into possible dereliction of duty. This included creating boards of inquiry and mandating a full investigation by the Joint Committee after Japan's surrender. The Joint Committee investigated the Pearl Harbor attack, blaming national defense system inadequacies for the poor response. Senator Vandenberg proposed a liaison committee between Congress and the executive branch for future conduct. Senator Vandenberg proposed a single committee to serve as a congressional liaison to the executive branch on the conduct of the war, modeled after the Joint Committee on the Conduct of the War from the Civil War era. However, his proposal lacked details and little appeal, leading Congress to disperse control over various standing and investigation committees instead. During the war, information was selectively revealed to relevant legislative committees, and the President held weekly discussions with political leaders. During World War II, various investigating committees were established by the House and Senate, including the Truman panel, House Select Committee on National Defense Migration, Senate Committee on Gasoline and Fuel-Oil Shortages, and committees on military affairs, naval affairs, and small business. Additional panels were created to investigate agricultural labor shortages, fuel production and transportation, the centralization of heavy industry, and other war-related issues. During World War II, numerous investigating committees were established by the House and Senate to address various war-related issues, such as the centralization of heavy industry, petroleum resources, Federal Communications Commission, postwar economic policy, post-war military policy, campaign expenditures, and food shortages. The proliferation of investigation committees was a notable feature of the war Congress, reflecting a focus on policy control after the passage of Acts. The establishment of investigating committees during World War II reflected a focus on policy control after the passage of Acts. Congress lacked intimate knowledge of war developments, leading to a strained relationship with the executive branch. Senator Richard B. Russell predicted a long gap between secret sessions after a poorly reported one in 1943. The army and navy maintained a cooperative relationship with congressional armed services committees. During World War II, the army and navy had a cooperative relationship with congressional armed services committees, confiding in them for support. Congress had limited involvement in military conferences, receiving only general information on decisions made. The President discussed conference outcomes with Congress leaders in off-the-record conversations. The President defended keeping some matters secret from Congress after the Quebec Conference in 1943. During World War II, Secretary Hull and President Roosevelt addressed Congress after key conferences. Congress allowed the President to dictate military strategy and foreign policy. Over a hundred investigations were conducted, but the actual conduct of the war was not thoroughly examined. Senator Truman, before becoming Vice President, chaired the Senate Special Committee. Senator Truman, as chairman of the Senate Special Committee, uncovered the Manhattan Project's secret expenditures. Despite initially avoiding involvement in military strategy, Truman's committee excelled as a production watchdog during World War II. The Truman committee served as a watchdog during World War II, ensuring public confidence in the Roosevelt Administration's war efforts. The conclusion of the war in 1945 brought changes to Korea, which had fallen under Japanese control in 1910. After falling under Japanese control in 1910, Korea became the focus of international agreements following the end of World War II. In August 1945, the United States and the Soviet Union agreed to divide Korea along the 38th parallel, with American troops arriving in the south and Soviet troops in the north to oversee the surrender of Japanese forces. After the division of Korea along the 38th parallel by the United States and the Soviet Union in August 1945, efforts were made to form a provisional government for all of Korea. Despite Soviet obstruction, the United Nations General Assembly resolved to hold Korea-wide elections in September 1947. The elections in May 1948 led to the establishment of the Republic of Korea (ROK) in the south and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) in the north. After the establishment of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) with Soviet assistance, American armed forces completed a staged withdrawal from the south in June 1949. Korean forces replaced them in both sectors, leading to an invasion of ROK territory by DPRK forces on June 25, 1950. Harry S. Truman succeeded to the presidency in April 1945 after Roosevelt's death. Harry S. Truman succeeded to the presidency in April 1945 after Roosevelt's sudden death. He led the United States in various international conferences, directed the use of the atomic bomb against Japan, accepted Japan's surrender, and initiated plans for the conversion of the American economy to peacetime conditions. Truman also responded to growing hostilities with the Soviet Union by implementing the Truman Doctrine and the Marshall Plan to contain Soviet expansion and aid European nations with economic recovery. The 1946 elections brought Truman the loss of Democratic Party majorities in both houses for the 80th Congress, but these were regained in 1948. Truman also won a surprise return to the White House after dissident factions of his party formed their own parties with presidential candidates. The divisions reflected issues such as racial equality, labor rights, anti-communism, military preparedness, and economic stability that continued to charge the political atmosphere post-World War II. After World War II, Congress sought to dismantle the executive's war machinery to maintain its function as a coequal branch of government. The Administrative Procedure Act of 1946 was enacted to bring order to federal agencies' rulemaking activities. Congress also worked to reduce the size of the executive branch post-war. Congress worked to reduce the size of the executive branch post-World War II by repealing authorizations, terminating agencies, and transferring government undertakings to private business. In 1947, the Hoover Commission was mandated to assist with this effort, and the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946 reduced the number of House and Senate standing committees. The Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946 reduced the number of House and Senate standing committees, consolidated committees, and expanded the capacity of the Legislative Reference Service. The House Special Committee on Un-American Activities became a powerful investigative panel, strengthening the position of conservative chairmen. Subcommittees and special committees proliferated, but the act failed to address power distribution within Congress and between Congress and the executive branch. After World War II, power struggles between Congress and the executive branch were prominent. The House Committee on Rules denied President Truman's requests for certain bills, leading to the passage of the Taft-Hartley Act in 1947. This act outlawed the closed shop and was passed despite Truman's veto. Senator Joseph R. McCarthy also gained attention during this time. During the post-World War II era, power struggles between Congress and the executive branch were evident. Senator Joseph R. McCarthy gained attention by accusing Communists in the Department of State, leading to an inquiry by the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations. Hearings lasted 31 days, ending just after the invasion of South Korea. McCarthy continued to make allegations about Communists in government. In the aftermath of the 1950 congressional elections, President Truman announced he would not seek reelection, and General Dwight D. Eisenhower won the presidency in November 1952. Eisenhower visited South Korea in December, and Republicans gained a majority in both the Senate and the House. Senator McCarthy became chairman of the Committee on Government Operations and led hearings on Communism from 1953-1954. In 1953-1954, Senator McCarthy led hearings on Communism. In June 1953, an armistice was signed in Panmunjon, halting Korean hostilities after the DPRK invasion of South Korea in 1950. Senator Tom Connolly commented on Korea's vulnerability, and two days after the invasion, he was invited to the White House by President Truman for a briefing. Truman preferred informal meetings with congressional leaders over formal addresses to Congress regarding the Korean situation, viewing it as a United Nations matter. He informed them of his plans to send a message requesting supplemental support. The President informed congressional leaders of his plans to request supplemental military appropriations and discussed a sharp increase in mobilization, including a national emergency declaration. Meetings were held to address economic mobilization plans, allocations, and wage and price controls. The dissatisfaction of some Members of Congress regarding the Korean situation led to a resolution introduced by Senator James P. Kem, calling for details of the President's talks with British Prime Minister Clement Atlee. Truman's unilateral decision to commit U.S. forces without consulting Congress sparked opposition by the end of the year, especially after China entered the war. In early 1951, a \"great debate\" in Congress and elsewhere arose over military commitments abroad, leading to resolutions supporting the dispatch of U.S. Army divisions to Europe. President Truman decided to relieve General Douglas MacArthur of his commands in the Far East on April 11, 1951. MacArthur, a revered military figure with a distinguished record, had served in various high-ranking positions including Army Chief of Staff and military governor of Japan. General Douglas MacArthur was relieved of his commands in the Far East by President Truman in 1951, leading to a public outcry. MacArthur returned to the US and testified before Congress about his dismissal, with hearings starting on May 3. Truman allowed senior officials and military officers to testify before panels following General MacArthur's dismissal in 1951. Truce negotiations in Korea were stalemated over prisoner repatriation, becoming a presidential campaign issue in 1952. The conflict in Korea in 1952 contributed to public agony and frustration, leading to a receptive climate for demagogic exploitation by figures like Senator Joseph McCarthy. Congressional interest shifted to concerns about Communists in American government and society before the armistice was signed in June 1953. America's military involvement in Vietnam evolved over several presidencies, starting with aid to the government in Saigon in 1955 and training its army. In 1962, the US provided aid to the government in Saigon and began training its army. US forces started bombing North Vietnam in 1964, with combat troops deployed to South Vietnam in 1965. Efforts expanded to Cambodia and Laos in 1970 and 1971. Negotiations led to the Paris peace accords in 1973, marking the withdrawal of US troops and release of prisoners of war. Five resolutions, including the Gulf of Tonkin resolution, were critical in the President-Congress relationship during the Vietnam conflict. The resolutions during the Vietnam conflict focused on the use of U.S. military forces in Vietnam, Formosa, the Middle East, and Cuba. They also addressed war powers and the executive-legislative relationship. The U.S. aimed to contain Communism post-World War II, leading to interventions to thwart Communist advances. The Chinese Communists successfully drove Chiang Kai-shek and the Nationalists from mainland China in 1949, establishing the People's Republic of China. Chiang maintained his regime on Taiwan. The invasion of South Korea by North Korea in 1950, with Chinese support, showed their intention to spread influence. The dispute between Chiang Kai-shek and Mao Tse-tung continued, with Communist China claiming islands occupied by Nationalist forces. President Truman declared the Straits of Formosa neutral during the Korean War. In 1954, President Eisenhower lifted the blockade on the islands of Quemoy and Matsu. The Nationalists strengthened their forces on the islands, prompting military attacks from Mainland China. A mutual defense treaty was signed between the U.S. and Taiwan in December 1954. After Communist forces seized the island of Ichiang in January 1955, President Eisenhower sought authority from Congress to use U.S. forces to protect Taiwan and other islands. President Eisenhower sought Congressional resolution to establish his authority as Commander-in-Chief to employ armed forces promptly and effectively if necessary. He did not address his intentions towards Quemoy, Matsu, and other islands near mainland China, leaving room for potential American intervention. The resolution sought by President Eisenhower aimed to establish his authority to use military force in response to any Chinese Communist forces concentration towards attacking Formosa (Taiwan) and the Pescadores. Congressional Democrats raised concerns about the language used, particularly regarding the status of offshore islands belonging to mainland China. The Formosa Resolution, H. J. Res. 159 (84th Congress), was passed by wide margins in both houses, authorizing President Eisenhower to use military force to protect Formosa and the Pescadores against armed attacks. Eisenhower signed the resolution into law on January 29, 1955. In 1956, the Eisenhower Administration faced a new challenge in the Middle East when Egypt's President Nasser planned to build the Aswan High Dam. The US, Britain, and the World Bank withdrew their loan offers after Nasser negotiated arms deals with the Soviet bloc. In response, Nasser nationalized the Suez Canal, leading to conflicts with Britain, France, and Israel. In response to the Suez Canal crisis, the Eisenhower Administration sought Congressional approval on January 5, 1957, for military aid and economic assistance in the Middle East. The Soviet Union threatened military intervention, leading to a cease-fire agreement on November 6 after British and French attacks on Egypt. The US expanded its naval presence in the region during the crisis. Eisenhower sought Congressional approval for military aid and economic assistance in the Middle East due to the Suez Canal crisis. He emphasized the need for cooperation between the President and Congress to deter aggression and maintain contact in case of military action. Congress was less receptive to the Middle East Resolution compared to previous measures. Congress was hesitant to support the Middle East Resolution due to the belief that the region was not vital to US security. Secretary of State John Foster Dulles defended the resolution before Congress, stating that pinpointing every detail would hinder its purpose. The House of Representatives passed H.J.Res. 117 (85th Congress) on a 355-61 vote, with Democrats voting 118-35 and Republicans 167-26. The Senate, after a joint committee review, amended the resolution to state that the US would be 'prepared' to use armed forces if deemed necessary by the President. The Senate passed the resolution, as amended, by a vote of 72-19 on March 5. In March 1957, the Senate passed a resolution, as amended, by a vote of 72-19. The House then passed the amended version by a 350-60 vote, and President Eisenhower signed it into law on March 9, 1957. In the late 1940s and early 1950s, the French and Viet Minh forces were in conflict in northern Vietnam, culminating in a major attack on Dien Bien Phu in March 1954. Viet Minh forces attacked French bases at Dien Bien Phu in March 1954, leading to French defeat on May 7. The US Administration preferred multilateral action over direct military support to the French forces. Secretary of State Dulles presented the concept of united action on March 29, 1954, after consulting with Congress and making a decision on March 21. Admiral Arthur W. Radford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, decided on March 21, 1954, to pursue a multilateral approach in Southeast Asia. Eisenhower, Dulles, and Radford met with Republican congressional leaders the next day. Dulles briefed them on the Administration's united action concept, which was approved by Eisenhower and bipartisan congressional leaders. Eisenhower discussed options in case of a rapid deterioration at Dien Bien Phu during a meeting with Republican leaders on March 29. During discussions on providing military support for the French troops at Dien Bien Phu, President Eisenhower, Secretary Dulles, Secretary of Defense Wilson, and Admiral Radford met on April 2, 1954. Dulles presented a draft resolution which Eisenhower approved, but they decided to first gauge the thinking of congressional leaders before presenting the resolution to Congress. The situation grew urgent after successful Viet Minh assaults on March 30 and April 1. On April 3, 1954, Administration officials and congressional leaders met to discuss Congress authorizing the President to act in the event air and sea power were necessary in Indochina. Admiral Radford described the military situation, while Secretary Dulles explained the significance of the region. All eight Members at the meeting agreed that the U.S. ought to obtain support from Congress. The U.S. should obtain commitments from allies for political and military support in Indochina. Secretary Dulles would try to get commitments from Britain and other countries, but did not mention a congressional resolution. Congressional leaders' opposition to military action strengthened the President's position against direct intervention with U.S. forces. The Administration met with Members of Congress to discuss a proposed resolution authorizing the President to use air and sea power in response to the situation in Dien Bien Phu. Despite Eisenhower's cooperation with Congress, his philosophy did not extend to covert operations. Eisenhower emphasized the need for a defense arrangement in Southeast Asia and the importance of British and French involvement. President Eisenhower's cooperation with Congress did not extend to covert operations. He approved clandestine activities in Iran and Guatemala without seeking legislative authorization. President Kennedy expanded American involvement in Vietnam, moving from an advisory role to a partner status, and increasing military activities. This expanded commitment, with Congress's approval, raised the level and scope of U.S. commitments to Vietnam. Under President Kennedy, the United States increased its involvement in Vietnam by initiating the strategic hamlet program, supporting covert operations, and establishing the Military Assistance Command Vietnam (MACV) to manage expanding military operations. This marked a shift from an advisory role to a more active partnership with Vietnam. The expansion of U.S. involvement in Vietnam under President Kennedy included a significant increase in military advisers, reaching nearly 15,000 by the end of 1963. The U.S. Air Force also conducted combat operations, with the 4400th Combat Crew Training Squadron flying missions in support of South Vietnamese ground troops. Kennedy's actions in Vietnam were supported by Congress, with generally widespread agreement on U.S. policy. Members supported U.S. policy in Vietnam and believed the President should have sufficient authority in foreign affairs. Senator Mansfield highlighted the deepening involvement in Southeast Asia, emphasizing the President's responsibility in directing the nation's course. Senator Fulbright argued for granting the President adequate authority for conducting foreign policy. Fulbright emphasized the need for greater Presidential authority in American foreign policy, questioning the effectiveness of outdated Congressional checks and balances in the face of modern challenges. He argued that democratic survival in a world of aggressive totalitarianism may require sacrificing some traditional democratic procedures. Mansfield and Fulbright's comments reflected Congress's initial deference to the executive during the early stages of the Vietnam involvement, which would later evolve. Members were content to let the President and his advisers oversee the war, focusing on shoring up South Vietnam and dealing with the pressing issue of Cuba. The failed invasion of Cuba at the Bay of Pigs in April 1961 heightened tension between the U.S. and Cuba. Robert F. Kennedy warned of the possibility of Soviet missiles in Cuba in April 1961, but it wasn't until mid-1962 that suspicious activities were observed. President Kennedy asserted his authority as Commander in Chief during the Cuban missile crisis in September 1962, opting to act unilaterally. During the Cuban missile crisis in 1962, President Kennedy claimed full authority to take military action against Cuba without the need for congressional authorization. He expressed willingness for Congress to pass resolutions if they desired, but a resolution signed in October 1962 did not address presidential authority. During the Cuban missile crisis in 1962, President Kennedy claimed full authority to take military action against Cuba without congressional authorization. A resolution signed in October 1962 did not address presidential authority, with the Senate voting 86-1 and the House 384-7 in support. Senator Bourke Hickenlooper noted the Executive's responsibility for foreign policy operations, and the Administration took steps to interdict offensive weapons to Cuba without calling Congress back to Washington, DC. Former Secretary of State Dean Acheson emphasized the urgency of the situation over legal formalities, and Kennedy used the resolution to legitimize his decisions. President Kennedy used the Cuba resolution to justify his actions, citing his authority from the Constitution and Congress. The assassination of Kennedy did not alter US policy towards Vietnam, as President Johnson reaffirmed the goal of defeating Communist forces in Southeast Asia. Johnson inherited a deteriorating situation in Vietnam after the overthrow and murder of South Vietnam's prime minister, Ngo Dinh Diem. Concerns arose over Diem's potential negotiations with the Communists. The Kennedy Administration was concerned about South Vietnam's negotiations with the Communists and saw the coup as an opportunity for a more capable government. However, reports of the new government's struggles, ineffective strategic hamlet program, and increased Communist pressure led Johnson to send officials to Vietnam for assessment. The reports indicated vulnerability to Communist takeover, prompting consideration of a resolution for the use of U.S. military forces in Vietnam. The Johnson administration considered asking Congress for a resolution on the use of U.S. military forces in Vietnam, following concerns about South Vietnam's negotiations with Communists and the coup. Walt W. Rostow discussed the desirability of seeking congressional approval, citing Johnson's intention to follow Eisenhower's precedent. Johnson requested a working group to develop plans for a congressional resolution on May 20, 1964. The Johnson administration considered seeking congressional approval for military action in Vietnam. McGeorge Bundy reported on progress in drafting alternative forms of a congressional resolution. Top U.S. officials met in Honolulu to discuss plans for Vietnam and Laos, emphasizing the need for a resolution before acting against North Vietnam. The President was consulting with congressional leaders on the matter. The President was consulting with congressional leaders on the desirability and timing of a proposed congressional resolution for military action in Vietnam. William Bundy suggested requesting a resolution within the next three weeks, but recommended waiting due to the risks outweighing the advantages. The President was consulting on a proposed congressional resolution for military action in Vietnam. William Bundy advised waiting for a resolution to be sent to Congress the week of June 22, citing the need for a drastic change in the situation. Discussions were ongoing on when to propose the resolution. Efforts to develop a resolution for military action in Vietnam were suspended in mid-June. A group of senior National Security Council officials agreed that a resolution was not necessary at the time. Later events in the Gulf of Tonkin provided the Johnson Administration with a rationale for proposing a congressional resolution in 1964. In 1964, the Johnson Administration faced criticism for not fully disclosing events in the Gulf of Tonkin. Covert operations like 34-A raids and DE SOTO patrols were conducted in Southeast Asia. The CIA managed commandos for the raids, while the U.S. Navy carried out intelligence missions off the coast of North Vietnam. On July 30, 1964, 34-A boats attacked North Vietnamese islands in the Gulf of Tonkin. The U.S.S. Maddox was attacked by three North Vietnamese torpedo boats in the Gulf of Tonkin on August 2. Despite some advisers urging immediate retaliation, President Johnson approved sending both the Maddox and the destroyer C. Turner Joy back into the danger zone. On August 3, the C. Turner Joy joined the Maddox in the Gulf. Secretary of State Rusk informed the U.S. ambassador to Vietnam that 34-A operations had additional targets. On August 3, Secretary of State Rusk informed the U.S. ambassador to Vietnam that 34-A operations had additional targets and that there was a direct connection between the 34-A operations and the North Vietnamese attack on the Maddox. The Maddox was under continuous torpedo attack on August 4. On August 4, doubts arose about the alleged torpedo attack on Navy ships, with conflicting reports from Navy pilots and a team from the Department of Defense concluding an attack had occurred. The CIA deputy director also questioned the incident, suggesting it may not have happened. On August 4, doubts emerged regarding the alleged torpedo attack on Navy ships, with conflicting reports from Navy pilots and the Department of Defense. The CIA deputy director also questioned the incident, suggesting it may not have occurred. Meanwhile, evidence indicated that an attack likely did not happen within three days of the incident. McNamara and military officials were investigating a potential second attack, while Abram Chayes and Ball were drafting a congressional resolution focused on Executive-Congressional relationships and preserving the President's power. On August 4, President Johnson met with congressional leaders to inform them of a retaliatory strike he ordered in response to the Gulf of Tonkin incident. Despite some doubts about the attack, Johnson announced the U.S. would retaliate, and aircraft attacked North Vietnamese targets the next day. President Johnson's efforts to confirm the attack on U.S. Navy ships in the Gulf of Tonkin led to air strikes on North Vietnamese targets. A draft resolution was sent to Congress on August 5, which was met with little opposition as the urge to act prevailed over doubts about the incident. Representative Dante B. Fascell noted that the focus was on granting the President the power he needed, rather than the actual incident itself. The Tonkin Gulf Resolution was quickly accepted by Congress due to historical precedence and the belief in its past success. Senator Charles Mathias highlighted the pattern of passing resolutions to bring about significant events since World War II. The resolution was pushed through without much focus on the actual incident, as the priority was granting the President the authority he needed. The success of similar resolutions in the past led to over-confidence in its effectiveness. Deputy Attorney General Nicholas deB. Katzenbach cited the upcoming presidential election as a reason for congressional Democrats' support of the Tonkin Gulf Resolution. President Johnson needed to show commitment in dealing with North Vietnam, especially with opponent Senator Barry Goldwater running as a \"hawk.\" Senator Wayne Morse was the only persistent critic, questioning the resolution's constitutionality and objecting to using American forces to aid unworthy governments. The Senate and House passed the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution in 1964, supporting the President's authority to use armed force in Southeast Asia. The resolution allowed for necessary measures to be taken until peace and security were reasonably assured. It was repealed in 1970 due to growing dissatisfaction in Congress. The Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, passed in 1964, granted the President authority to use armed force in Southeast Asia. However, dissatisfaction in Congress led to its repeal in 1970. Senator Morse initiated efforts to repeal it in 1966, and in 1967, hearings were held to consider modifying or replacing the resolution. The resolution was criticized for granting excessive Presidential control over the Armed Forces. The Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, passed in 1964, granted the President authority to use armed force in Southeast Asia. Congress acted out of a sense of urgency to show unity with the President, focusing on national security. However, there was a discrepancy between the resolution's language and Congress's intent, leading to questions about the transfer of power from Congress to the executive. The Gulf of Tonkin Resolution granted the President authority to use armed force in Southeast Asia, but Congress did not expect a full-scale war in Asia. Congress believed they were preventing a large-scale war by taking a firm stand. The committee criticized Congress for making a personal judgment on how President Johnson would implement the resolution instead of making an institutional judgment. President Johnson lost support from Senator Fulbright due to his handling of the Dominican Republic crisis in 1965. In 1965, President Johnson sent U.S. armed forces to the Dominican Republic to evacuate American citizens and other nationals during a rebellion in Santo Domingo. Initially deploying 400 Marines, the U.S. eventually had nearly 19,000 troops in the country. The Johnson Administration justified the troop presence due to concerns about a Communist takeover, but faced criticism from Senator Fulbright and others in Congress for the President's use of war powers without congressional approval. Senator Fulbright criticized the Johnson Administration for shifting focus from saving American lives to preventing a Communist takeover in the Vietnam War. He also pointed out faults in the Administration's evaluation of the threat of Communism, poor intelligence, and lack of transparency with the public. After Johnson's intervention in the Dominican Republic, Fulbright changed his stance and Johnson declined to run for reelection in 1968 due to growing criticism of the war. Richard M. Nixon, elected in 1968, continued the Vietnam conflict with an emphasis on secrecy and limited information sharing. Nixon's Administration emphasized secrecy and limited information sharing with Congress, especially regarding South Vietnam's ability to fend off the North Vietnamese and secret peace talks conducted by Henry Kissinger. The Tet offensive in late January 1968 surprised American forces and the government, leading to a decline in public support for the war. President Johnson's announcement of a partial halt to the bombing of North Vietnam in March 1968 led to a decline in support for the war. He also declared he would not seek reelection and called for negotiations to end the war. Peace talks between the U.S. and North Vietnam took place from May to October, resulting in an agreement to expand the discussions. Johnson then ordered a complete halt to the bombing on October 31. This progress fueled hopes for a negotiated settlement in the United States. By spring 1968, a majority of Americans believed U.S. involvement in Vietnam was a mistake, leading to widespread antiwar demonstrations. Nixon's Vietnamization policy aimed to bring American troops home, as 530,000 military personnel were deployed in the area when he took office. Nixon's Vietnamization policy aimed to withdraw American troops from Vietnam, reducing the number from 530,000 to 27,000 by November 1972. Troop withdrawals were seen as successful, although criticized for being slow. Nixon tied the pace of withdrawal to South Vietnam's military progress. Nixon's Vietnamization policy aimed to withdraw American troops from Vietnam, tying the rate of withdrawal to South Vietnam's military progress and lessening enemy activities. Aiding South Vietnam was crucial to avoid being seen as the President who lost Vietnam and to achieve \"peace with honor.\" Time was needed for the Paris peace talks to succeed, but South Vietnam needed help as they couldn't fend off the Viet Cong alone. The Nixon Administration, following the Vietnamization policy, aimed to bring American troops home while continuing military commitments covertly. Nixon authorized bombing raids in North Vietnam and expanded operations into Laos and Cambodia to disrupt supply routes. The North Vietnamese used trails through Laos and Cambodia for transportation. Nixon ordered bombing missions in Cambodia to disrupt supply routes to South Vietnam, taking measures to conceal the true purpose. His presidency overlapped with Congress's efforts to reclaim its role in foreign affairs and war powers. The Senate passed a resolution in 1969 to address concerns about U.S. commitments abroad. The Senate passed a resolution in 1969 defining \"national commitment\" as the use of armed forces on foreign territory or a promise to assist a foreign country. The resolution emphasized that such commitments require affirmative action by both the legislative and executive branches, but it only expressed the Senate's opinion and did not have the force of law. The resolution aimed to address an imbalance between the branches of government regarding foreign affairs and war powers. The executive and Congress have at times disregarded constitutional requirements, with the executive overstepping congressional authority in times of urgency and Congress passively allowing it. Congress shares blame for giving away its constitutional war power to the executive, which was intentionally vested in Congress by the framers of the Constitution. The transfer of war power from Congress to the executive has occurred rapidly and completely, with Congress failing to challenge it. Factors such as unfamiliarity with the nation's role as a world power, the \"cult of executive expertise,\" and efforts to make up for past rejections of international involvement have led Congress to acquiesce to the executive in foreign affairs. The committee report highlighted urgent situations with no clear historical guidelines as reasons for Congress's passive actions on resolutions regarding Formosa, the Middle East, Cuba, and the Gulf of Tonkin. The committee report highlighted the lack of historical guidelines for urgent situations, leading to executive actions exceeding congressional expectations. Recommendations included thorough debate on resolutions involving the use of Armed Forces, explicit language authorizing the initiation of war, specifying circumstances for military intervention, and including a sunset provision in future joint resolutions. Nixon argued for presidential authority during crises, citing past actions in Lebanon and Congo. Senator Mansfield emphasized the importance of consulting with the Senate for a united front. Nixon publicly acknowledged U.S. involvement in Laos in 1970. In 1970, Nixon publicly acknowledged U.S. involvement in Laos, stating that there were no ground troops but American personnel were involved in logistics and advisory roles. He also mentioned the use of U.S. aircraft for specific purposes, omitting details about CIA activities and the extent of air operations in Laos. Nixon's attention turned to Cambodia in April 1970, planning an invasion shortly after announcing troop withdrawal from Vietnam. He justified the move as necessary to protect troops, defend Cambodia, and capture enemy territory. Senate committees invited Nixon to discuss the matter, but he opted to meet with House and Senate Armed Services Committees instead. During a meeting on May 5, Nixon pledged to withdraw American troops from Cambodia by June 30, 1970. The news of the incursion into Cambodia led to protests on college campuses, including the tragic events at Kent State University and Jackson State University. In 1970, Congress approved a foreign military sales bill that included an amendment to repeal the Gulf of Tonkin resolution. President Nixon signed the bill into law. President Nixon signed an amendment to repeal the Gulf of Tonkin resolution, P.L. 91-672, on January 12, 1971. Senator Robert Dole noted that Nixon never used the resolution in Vietnam policy. Congress passed a foreign aid authorization act, P.L. 91-652, with the Cooper-Church amendment prohibiting funds for introducing US ground troops. On January 11, 1971, Nixon signed a defense appropriations act, P.L. 91-668, which included a prohibition on using funds for introducing U.S. ground troops into Laos or Thailand. Despite this, Nixon assisted South Vietnam in invading Laos on February 8, 1971. The U.S. assisted South Vietnam in invading Laos on February 8, 1971, to neutralize North Vietnamese supply bases. The offensive ended earlier than planned on March 24, resulting in a disaster with heavy casualties on both sides. Nixon's hopes of proving Vietnamization was working were dashed as shocking images of the failed operation were broadcasted. President Nixon declared success in the Vietnam War and announced the withdrawal of 100,000 troops due to the progress of Vietnamization. However, public mistrust grew with concerns of an expanding war. The Pentagon Papers, released in June 1971, revealed the government's study on U.S. involvement in Southeast Asia, highlighting Congress's limited role in foreign policy. The Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Separation of Powers held hearings on the limits of executive privilege and a bill introduced by Senator Fulbright, S. 1125, which required individuals to claim executive privilege in person with a written assertion from the President or face the loss of agency funds. President Nixon's refusal to share information with the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations on military assistance highlighted his philosophy on executive privilege. In a letter to the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, Nixon asserted the President's responsibility to withhold information that could disrupt the executive branch's function. Congress later passed S. 596 in 1972, requiring the White House to provide information on international executive agreements to Congress within 60 days. The legislation P.L. 92-403 (S. 596; 86 Stat. 619) required the President to submit international executive agreements to Congress within 60 days, with exceptions for agreements deemed prejudicial to national security. Passed by the Senate and House in 1972, it was signed into law on August 22, 1972. In 1972, North Vietnamese launched a major offensive against South Vietnam, leading to U.S. air power intervention to prevent defeat. In 1973, Congress passed the War Powers Resolution after unsuccessful attempts in previous years. The House and Senate each passed their own versions of war powers legislation, anticipating a presidential veto. In 1973, Congress passed the War Powers Resolution, with the House and Senate each passing their own versions. The final version, H.J.Res. 542, limited troop commitment to 30 days unless extended by Congress. President Nixon vetoed the resolution on October 24, citing unconstitutional provisions. The War Powers Resolution, H.J.Res. 542, was passed by Congress in 1973 to limit troop commitment to 30 days unless extended by Congress. President Nixon vetoed the resolution, but Congress overrode his veto on November 7, 1973. Key provisions include requiring the President to consult with Congress before committing troops to hostilities. The War Powers Resolution passed in 1973 limits troop commitment to 30 days unless extended by Congress. The President must consult with Congress before committing troops to hostilities. The President must submit a report within 48 hours of expanding U.S. combat troops or introducing troops into hostilities, explaining the circumstances and providing an estimate of the scope and duration of the involvement. Troop commitment must be terminated within 60 days unless Congress declares war or authorizes the use of the armed forces. The War Powers Resolution of 1973 limits troop commitment to 30 days unless extended by Congress. The President must consult with Congress before committing troops to hostilities and submit a report within 48 hours of expanding U.S. combat troops. The initial 60-day period can be extended for up to 30 days if needed for troop removal. Some believe the resolution benefits Congress by involving it in decisions to commit troops, while others argue it has not restored the balance between Congress and the presidency. The War Powers Resolution of 1973 limits troop commitment to 30 days without legislative authority, granting the President independent war-making power. Some Members expressed concerns about Congress losing its role in deciding on war. Representative Vernon Thompson (R-WI) noted a reduction in Congress's role, while Senator Thomas Eagleton (D-MO) opposed the bill and supported Nixon's veto. Senator Thomas Eagleton (D-MO) adamantly opposed the bill that emerged from conference, supporting Nixon's veto due to concerns about the President's unilateral war-making power. The bill did not limit the President's ability to wage war independently, but rather attempted to enshrine this decision-making process into law. During Nixon's first term, national security adviser Henry Kissinger operated in secret, refusing to testify before committees on the Vietnam war. He engaged in private peace negotiations with North Vietnamese diplomats from 1969 to 1971, leading to a peace treaty signed in Paris on January 27, 1973. Nixon, reelected in 1972, faced a scandal soon after. Nixon won with 60.7% of the popular vote and 520 electoral votes but got involved in the Watergate scandal, leading to his resignation under the threat of impeachment. Seven men broke into the Democratic National Committee headquarters at the Watergate hotel in 1972. Nixon, along with White House officials, tried to contain the political fallout but failed as investigations revealed a cover-up. John Dean's revelations to investigators further implicated the White House in the scandal. John Dean revealed discussions with the President about the Watergate cover-up. Evidence suggested White House involvement in the burglary of Daniel Ellsberg's psychiatrist's office. Nixon's attempts to limit damage, including withholding tape recordings, led to negative consequences. The \"Saturday Night Massacre\" saw Nixon abolishing roles in response to the scandal. In the \"Saturday Night Massacre\" on October 20, 1973, Nixon abolished the special prosecutor's office for Watergate, leading to the resignation of key officials. Despite maintaining his innocence, Nixon faced impeachment charges and eventually resigned on August 9, 1974, becoming the first President to do so. Gerald Ford succeeded him as President. After Spiro Agnew's resignation in 1973, Gerald Ford became Vice President. In 1990, under Saddam Hussein's leadership, Iraq attacked Kuwait due to an $8 billion debt from the Iran-Iraq war. Iraq believed the debt should be forgiven as they had shielded against Iran. Kuwait's overproduction of oil and oilfield disputes also fueled the conflict. In mid-July 1990, Iraq accused Kuwait and the UAE of exceeding OPEC quotas and pumping oil worth $2.4 billion. Iraq then built up troops near Kuwait's border, leading to an invasion on August 2. President George H. W. Bush condemned the invasion. The United States strongly condemned the Iraqi military invasion of Kuwait, calling for immediate withdrawal of Iraqi forces and characterizing the assault as \"raw aggression.\" Emergency Security Council meeting convened to vote on condemning Iraqi action and demanding withdrawal. Department of State urged global condemnation of Iraqi aggression and consultation on further actions. E.O. 12722 declared national emergency due to threat from Iraqi invasion. The Bush Administration's response to the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait included issuing E.O. 12723 to protect Kuwaiti government property and assets. President Bush initially stated he was not contemplating intervention but later mentioned discussing options with advisers. The administration showed willingness to work through the United Nations and with other nations to address Iraq's aggression. President Bush was considering various options in response to the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. Congress swiftly passed bills imposing sanctions on Iraq, with overwhelming bipartisan support. The Senate also endorsed the President's actions. A key concern was preventing further Iraqi advances into Saudi Arabia, a major U.S. oil supplier. Congressional leaders supported this strategy. President Bush convinced the Saudi king to allow U.S. troops in response to an Iraqi missile threat. Only Senator Sam Nunn was informed in advance of the deployment. By the end of the month, the U.S. and other nations had assembled military forces in the Gulf region. President Bush called 50,000 military reservists to active duty to support the growing military presence in Saudi Arabia. President Bush worked on building an international coalition to oppose the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, securing political support and combat forces from various countries including Arab nations like Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Syria, as well as others like Canada, France, and Italy. The U.N. was also involved in retaliating against Iraq. The U.N. retaliated against Iraq by adopting resolutions condemning the attack on Kuwait and imposing a near-total embargo on Iraqi commerce. The Security Council eventually authorized the use of force to ensure compliance with the embargo and later approved the use of force to expel Iraq from Kuwait. Diplomatic efforts were made to persuade Iraq to withdraw peacefully before military action was taken. With the U.N. adopting resolutions condemning Iraq's attack on Kuwait and imposing an embargo, diplomatic efforts were made for 47 days to persuade Iraq to withdraw peacefully. Congressional support for opposing Iraq's aggression and protecting Saudi Arabia remained strong, but there were growing calls for close consultation with Congress and a formal authorization before any move to war. Congressional committees questioned proposed accelerated arms sales to Saudi Arabia, with prominent Republicans also expressing the need for congressional involvement in decisions regarding the invasion of Kuwait. During congressional consideration, the House adopted a resolution on a 380-29 vote, while the Senate endorsed a counterpart measure with a 96-3 vote. Senators reassured opponents that it was not a Tonkin Gulf resolution for the Persian Gulf. Public opinion polls showed decreasing support for the President's Gulf policies. The President announced reinforcement of American troops in the Persian Gulf, with 200,000 personnel being deployed and troop rotations discontinued. Some critics questioned the troop increase in the Persian Gulf, suggesting it reflected a lack of confidence in economic sanctions on Iraq. Congressional leaders were surprised by the personnel increase announcement. President Bush reassured them he was not seeking war, despite demands for a special session of Congress. Democratic House members filed a lawsuit to prevent Bush from using force in Kuwait without congressional authorization. The lawsuit filed by Democratic House members, Ronald V. Dellums et al. v. George Bush, challenging the use of force in Kuwait without congressional authorization, was dismissed by Judge Harold H. Green on December 12. Green stated that the issue was not \"ripe\" as Congress had not taken a stand yet. Meanwhile, the Bush Administration obtained Security Council agreement on Resolution 678, authorizing force against Iraq. Congress, with the President's party in the minority, debated giving sanctions more time before resorting to war. President Bush requested Congress to adopt a resolution supporting the use of force to implement UN Security Council Resolution 678 against Iraq. This request came after disputes over the President's constitutional authority to order offensive actions and the need for diplomatic efforts before resorting to war. Attempts to reach a resolution on the Persian Gulf crisis were briefly delayed by unsuccessful negotiations between the United States and Iraq in Geneva. The Iraqi foreign minister's actions unintentionally strengthened support in Congress for the president's threat of using force. Competing resolutions were produced in both chambers, with the Senate approving the use of force resolution and rejecting the economic sanctions resolution, while the House rejected the economic sanctions resolution and approved the action authorization resolution. Voting took place on January 12. The action authorization resolution (H.J.Res. 77) was adopted on a bipartisan 250-183 vote and signed into law on January 14. \"Operation Desert Storm\" began on January 16 with attacks on strategic targets in Iraq and Kuwait. The Senate and House both commended the President's efforts in the Persian Gulf crisis with overwhelming support. Iraq retaliated with missile assaults against Israel after initial successful aerial assaults. Israel did not enter the war at the urging of the Bush Administration. Congress commended Israel's performance with resolutions. Aerial bombing of Iraq continued for 38 days without a surrender or uprising. President Bush rejected Iraq's withdrawal offer on February 15 and a withdrawal plan negotiated by the Soviet Union on February 21. President Bush gave Iraq an ultimatum to withdraw from Kuwait by February 23, leading to a military offensive on February 24 by American, British, and French forces resulting in the liberation of Kuwait. A cease-fire was established on February 28, and President Bush addressed Congress on March 6 to celebrate his accomplishments in the Persian Gulf crisis. President Bush received warm congratulations from Congress for the Desert Storm Operation victory. Various factors influence a President's communication with Congress regarding military conflicts, including political party majority, public support, number of personnel involved, anticipated duration, and diplomatic conditions. The nature of the informing activity, such as a presidential speech or briefing, is also crucial. The President usually informs Congress about military actions through various means such as speeches, briefings, or documents. The recipients of this information can vary from congressional leadership to selected committee chairs or supportive members. While the President may seek advice from Congress, direct involvement in decision-making is uncommon. Members of Congress may be dissatisfied with the way information about military commitments is provided, including the unilateral direction by the President and the broad expansion of commitments made in response to specific incidents."
