    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Protect Our Women From Ovarian Cancer Act of 2002\". Ovarian cancer is a serious threat to women's health, being the deadliest gynecologic cancer and the fourth leading cause of cancer death among women in the United States. It occurs in 1 out of 57 women in the US, with a high mortality rate if not detected early. Detection in the beginning stages is crucial for successful treatment, but most cases are diagnosed in advanced stages. Ovarian cancer survival rates are significantly higher when detected early, with over 90% of women surviving longer than 5 years. However, only 25% of cases in the US are diagnosed in the beginning stages. Diagnosis in advanced stages lowers the 5-year survival chance to about 25%. Difficulty in diagnosing ovarian cancer is due to symptoms being easily confused with other diseases and the lack of a reliable screening tool. Expansion of Medicare preventive benefits to include qualified ovarian cancer screening tests is proposed in the Social Security Act. This amendment aims to improve early detection rates, as ovarian cancer survival rates are significantly higher when detected early. The Social Security Act proposes expanding Medicare preventive benefits to include qualified ovarian cancer screening tests for women over 50. These tests may include proteomic pattern blood tests and other appropriate procedures for early detection of ovarian cancer. The Social Security Act proposes expanding Medicare preventive benefits to include qualified ovarian cancer screening tests for women over 50, such as proteomic pattern blood tests. Amendments are made to the diagnostic laboratory test fee schedules under Section 1833(h)(1)(A) and payment rates under Section 1833(h)(7) of the Act. Amendments are made to Section 1862(a) of the Social Security Act to include qualified ovarian cancer screening tests performed more frequently than covered under the Act. This expands Medicare preventive benefits for women over 50. The amendments made to Section 1862(a) of the Social Security Act expand Medicare preventive benefits for women over 50 by including qualified ovarian cancer screening tests. The amendments also specify that the effectiveness of using proteomic patterns in blood serum to identify ovarian cancer will be evaluated, and the amendments will become effective based on the findings of this evaluation. Research will be conducted on the effectiveness of using proteomic patterns in blood serum to identify ovarian cancer, both alone and in combination with other screening methods. A report will be submitted to Congress evaluating the research findings."
