    "content": "The Act is known as the \"Jacob Wetterling Crimes Against Children Registration Act\" and establishes a program. The Attorney General establishes guidelines for State programs requiring convicted individuals of criminal offenses against minor victims to register their current address with law enforcement for ten years after release. Offenses include kidnapping, false imprisonment, criminal sexual conduct, and solicitation of minors for sexual conduct. The approved State registration program requires individuals convicted of offenses against minors to register their address with law enforcement upon release, parole, or supervised release. They must be informed of their duty to register and update their address within ten days if they move. The approved State registration program mandates individuals convicted of offenses against minors to register their address with law enforcement within ten days of release. This includes obtaining fingerprints, photographs, and signing a form explaining the duty to register. The information must be transferred to the State law enforcement agency within three days for entry into the State and National Crime Information Center databases. The approved State registration program requires individuals convicted of offenses against minors to register their address with law enforcement within ten days of release. On each anniversary of registration, a verification form must be mailed to the last reported address and returned within ten days. Failure to comply results in notification to law enforcement. A person required to register under this section must report any change of address to the designated State law enforcement agency, which will then inform the local law enforcement agency where the person resides. The registration requirement lasts for ten years after release from imprisonment, parole, or supervised release, with penalties for violations of the State program. Private data provided under this section is confidential and can be used for law enforcement purposes, including background checks by child care services. Violators of State program requirements may face criminal penalties, with Congress suggesting a minimum of six months imprisonment. Each State has three years from the enactment of this Act to comply with its provisions. States failing to comply after three years will have their funds reduced by 25% under the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968, with the unallocated funds redistributed to compliant States."
