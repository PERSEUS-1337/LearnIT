    "content": "The United States has a comprehensive veteran benefits and services system managed by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) through three administrations: Veterans Health Administration (VHA), Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA), and National Cemetery Administration (NCA). The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) manages a comprehensive system for veteran benefits and services through three administrations: Veterans Health Administration (VHA), Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA), and National Cemetery Administration (NCA). The VHA is the largest operating unit, providing direct primary and specialty care services, as well as social and supportive services such as housing assistance and home health aide services. The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) provides health care services to veterans and eligible family members, conducts medical research, trains health care professionals, and offers support during national emergencies. It also provides nursing home care in VA facilities and private nursing facilities. VA long-term care services have expanded to include a full range of services and supports. VA long-term care services have expanded to include a full range of services and supports, both institutional and non-institutional. These programs, known as Geriatrics and Extended Care (GEC) Programs, aim to support veterans in the least restrictive environment. The report provides an overview of VA's long-term care services, including a brief history of relevant legislation, information on veteran eligibility, and enrollment for care. The report discusses veteran eligibility for care and enrollment, the structure of the VHA, long-term care programs offered by the VA, and potential issues for Congress. Before P.L. 88-450 in 1964, the VA lacked statutory authority for nursing home care but provided limited institutional care in domiciliaries. Plans were made for a nursing home care program with 2,000 beds for physically disabled veterans needing nursing care. In August 1964, P.L. 88-450 authorized 4,000 beds for nursing home care for veterans who needed long-term nursing care. It allowed for care in private or public nursing homes for up to six months at VA expense. If permanent care was needed, veterans would be placed in a VA nursing home. Per diem payments were also authorized to state veterans' nursing homes. Congress recognized the growing need for nursing home care for World War II veterans and the need to move patients from expensive hospital settings. In 1969, P.L. 91-101 amended P.L. 88-450 to allow veterans to be moved from expensive hospitals to nursing homes for convalescence. The six-month limitation on care at contracted community nursing homes was eliminated for veterans with service-connected disabilities. The Veterans Health Care Expansion Act of 1973 further expanded eligibility for nursing home care for veterans with service-connected conditions. In 1998, a Federal Advisory Committee found that VA's long-term care system is focused on nursing home care, with underdeveloped home and community-based care. Services are not universally available, access is restricted, and coordination mechanisms are lacking. Long-term care is seen as an adjunct rather than integral to the healthcare system, requiring remodeling for effective service delivery. Congress began examining VA's long-term care programs based on the Committee's recommendations. The Veterans Millennium Health Care and Benefits Act (P.L. 106-117) was enacted in November 1999 after Congress examined the VA's long-term care programs. The act mandated nursing home care for veterans with service-connected conditions and those with 70% or more service-connected disabilities. It also required the VA to provide non-institutional care, such as home-based care and adult day health care, to all enrolled veterans. President Clinton emphasized the importance of providing enhanced extended care services to veterans with the highest priority for nursing home care. The Veterans Millennium Health Care and Benefits Act (P.L. 106-117) mandated nursing home care for veterans with service-connected conditions and those with 70% or more service-connected disabilities. It also required the VA to provide non-institutional care, such as home-based care and adult day health care, to all enrolled veterans. Eligibility for VA long-term care services depends on factors like veterans' need for the service, service-connected status, and VA health care enrollment process. VA medical care is not an entitlement program, and not every veteran is automatically entitled to health care from the VA. Eligibility for VA health care is primarily based on veteran status from military service, established by active-duty status and discharge under conditions other than dishonorable. Veterans are categorized based on service-connected disabilities or income levels. Those with service-connected disabilities or low incomes are considered high priority and enrolled in Priority Groups 1-6. Priority Groups 7 and 8 consist of veterans with nonservice-connected medical conditions and incomes above the VA threshold. The majority of VA-enrolled veterans are in Priority Groups 1-6, with 23% in Group 1 and 22% in Group 5. Veterans enrolled in the VA health care system do not need to reapply annually unless they choose to disenroll. The size and scope of the VA health care system are influenced by various factors. The VA health care system is influenced by factors like veteran population size, eligibility, enrollment decisions, and utilization of services. Around 9.1 million veterans were enrolled in FY2016, with an increase in enrollment despite a decline in overall veteran numbers. The Veterans' Health Care Eligibility Reform Act of 1996 established a national enrollment system. The VHA manages inpatient and outpatient medical care for veterans. Enrollment in the VHA increased by 86% from FY2000 to FY2016, reaching 9.1 million enrollees. Factors contributing to this increase include newer veterans from OEF/OIF/OND, more female veterans, and economic conditions. VHA enrollees have complex healthcare needs, with higher rates of chronic conditions like PTSD. The VHA faces challenges in providing care to aging veterans with disabilities and those aging into disability. The number of veterans with service-connected disabilities is increasing, leading to a higher demand for long-term care. Veterans accessing VHA services tend to be older, less socioeconomically well off, and less healthy than those who do not rely on the VA for care. The VHA's policies on mental health screening contribute to higher rates of diagnosis among veterans. The number of veterans with service-connected disabilities is increasing, with over 3.7 million veterans having a service-connected disability in FY2013. The percentage of veterans with 70% to 100% service-connected disabilities has also risen from 18% in FY2003 to 30% in FY2013. This trend suggests a growing demand for VA long-term care services over veterans' lifespans. The need for long-term care services for veterans increases with age. About half of individuals turning 65 will require long-term care, with most needing it for two years on average. Veterans aged 65 and over make up a significant portion of those enrolled in VA healthcare, with the majority being aged 65 to 84. Vietnam-era veterans are the largest group reaching advanced age. The VHA is the largest integrated healthcare system in the US, providing care at over 1,700 sites. The VHA is the largest integrated healthcare system in the US, with over 1,700 sites of care including medical centers, nursing facilities, clinics, and vet centers. The country is divided into 18 Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISN) based on geography, each overseen by a VISN Director who supervises the facilities within the network. For example, VISN 10 oversees VA facilities in Indiana, Michigan, and Ohio, including 10 medical centers and one outpatient health care center. Each main facility has associated community-based outpatient clinics. The Cleveland, OH VAMC has 12 CBOCs in outlying areas, while the Columbus, OH HCC has four CBOCs. Many facilities also have a Community Living Center (CLC) under the direction of the parent VAMC. VISN 1 covers more states and has 11 VAMCs, while VISN 21 covers a large geographical area with nine VAMCs in three states and U.S. territories. Table 2 shows national numbers of different types of facilities as of December 2015. Table 2 displays national numbers of various facilities as of December 2015. VA LTC programs are managed at the VAMC/HCC level, with each facility offering mandatory and optional programs. While VISN Directors provide oversight, facilities have flexibility in program administration, leading to variability within the same VISN. For instance, in VISN 17, most VAMCs in Texas offer the Medical Foster Home Program, except for Waco and Harlington VAMCs. This variability is influenced by factors like patient demand, staffing, and budget constraints. The Veteran Directed Home and Community Based Services (VD-HCBS) program, a collaboration between the VA and ACL, allows veterans to direct their own home care services with a budget. Sixty-eight out of 168 VAMCs offered this program as of October 2016. The VHA Office of Geriatrics and Extended Care provides guidance and oversight for LTC programs, which may be organized within different departments at the facility level. The VA offers long-term care in institutional and non-institutional settings, with variability in program organization. Long-term care in institutional settings primarily occurs in nursing homes, covering a spectrum of care needs for veterans. The VA provides home and community-based care to eligible veterans enrolled in the VHA, focusing on supporting veterans to remain safely in their homes with optimum health and wellness as they age. The VA offers non-institutional long-term care services such as adult health care and respite care, either provided directly or purchased from outside providers. The VA provides home-based primary care services through the HBPC program for eligible veterans with chronic health conditions or long-term care needs. A multidisciplinary team, including physicians, nurses, social workers, therapists, and pharmacists, make home visits to coordinate care and create a medical care plan for veterans. The program aims to maintain veterans' health and well-being in their homes. The VA offers comprehensive case management for veterans through the HBPC program, aiming to maintain veterans safely at home, reduce hospitalizations, and manage chronic illnesses to improve quality of life. The CRC program provides supported housing for veterans who need assistance with daily living skills in VA-approved group homes, with VA staff offering case management services and monitoring care provided by group home staff. Veterans pay out-of-pocket for room and board in the CRC program. The CRC program offers supported housing for veterans who need assistance with daily living skills in VA-approved group homes. Veterans pay out-of-pocket for room and board, with VA staff providing regular visits and inspections. VA staff also offer education and training to CRC caregivers on various topics. For veterans needing more assistance, the Medical Foster Home program provides a higher level of care in VA-approved adult foster care settings with 24-hour supervision by caregivers with nursing backgrounds. The Medical Foster Home (MFH) program allows caregivers to open their homes to veterans needing nursing home level care. Caregivers provide personal care, supervision, and household management for up to three veterans. Veterans pay caregivers for room and board, costs vary based on care needed and location. VA provides oversight, case management, education, and inspections for MFH veterans. The VA offers various outpatient clinic-based services, including geriatric evaluation in different settings. However, not all VA facilities provide this service due to a lack of geriatric expertise. A comprehensive interdisciplinary assessment is essential for geriatric evaluation, involving a team of healthcare professionals. Veterans are typically referred from primary care for these evaluations. The outpatient Palliative Care Clinic provides comfort care and symptom management for veterans with chronic illnesses, aiming to improve their quality of life. Veterans are referred from primary care or other specialties for issues such as functional deficits, dementia-related behavioral issues, psychosocial situations, polypharmacy, and frequent hospitalizations. The clinic team develops a treatment plan and either implements it or provides recommendations to the primary care team for managing the veteran's care. The Palliative Care Clinic provides comfort care and symptom management for veterans with chronic illnesses, aiming to improve their quality of life. Veterans may have a prognosis of two years or less to live and can receive palliative care even while continuing curative treatment. The Palliative Care Team includes a medical provider, social worker, nurse, chaplain, and may include a psychologist and dietitian. Hospice, a specific form of palliative care for veterans with six months or less to live, is provided in home or inpatient settings. Some VA facilities offer onsite Adult Day Health Care (ADHC) for veterans needing assistance with personal care and daily living skills. The VA purchases Adult Day Health Care (ADHC) services from community agencies for veterans needing assistance with personal care and daily living skills. The VA refers veterans to ADHC sites, authorizes attendance based on clinical need, and monitors care through onsite visits. The VA pays a daily or hourly rate to ADHC sites. Homemaker/Home Health Aide (H/HHA) services are also available. The VA purchases Home Health Aide (H/HHA) services from community agencies for veterans who are clinically eligible for nursing home level of care. A VA provider assesses the need for care, determines the amount of care based on clinical need, and makes a referral to a home health agency. Respite services are also provided by the VA for short-term relief, either in the home or at an Adult Day Health Care (ADHC) setting. The VA purchases skilled home care, respite services, and home hospice from community agencies for veterans. Respite services offer short-term relief for family caregivers, while skilled home care includes therapy and wound care. VA physicians determine the need for skilled care and coordinate with agencies for services. Quality measures of agencies are monitored annually. The VA purchases home hospice services from community agencies for veterans with life-limiting diagnoses. Hospice provides palliative care for those with a life expectancy of six months or less, offering interdisciplinary support to manage symptoms and improve quality of life. If needed, the VA may cover inpatient hospice stays or transfer veterans to VA facilities for care. The VA offers various options for hospice care for veterans, including respite stays in community facilities, inpatient hospice services in VA Community Living Centers, and Veteran-Directed Home and Community-Based Services (VD-HCBS). VD-HCBS provides veterans with a budget for services to hire home health aides or arrange supportive services for independent living. The program aims to give veterans more control over their care and keep them safely at home, with local Area Agencies on Aging administering the program. The VA provides nursing home care to certain service-connected veterans based on specific disability ratings and needs, as mandated by the Veterans Millennium Health Care and Benefits Act. The VA provides nursing home care to disabled veterans, including nonservice-connected veterans in need of institutional care. This care is offered in VA Community Living Centers (CLCs), Community Nursing Homes (CNHs), or State Veteran's Homes. CLCs provide nursing home level care, rehabilitation, custodial, and hospice care, with some offering specialty services like dementia units. The program underwent a change in the mid-2000s, renaming facilities to Community Living Centers to create a more homelike atmosphere for veterans. The VA offers nursing home care to disabled veterans in VA Community Living Centers (CLCs), Community Nursing Homes (CNHs), and State Veteran's Homes. CLCs focus on cultural transformation with a person-centered approach and resident choice in daily activities. CNHs involve contracts with community nursing facilities for care, while State Veteran's Homes provide another setting for VA nursing home care. Inspections and quality reviews are conducted regularly to ensure proper care for veterans. State Veterans Homes (SVHs) are owned and operated by the state, with eligibility determined by the state. The VA may provide grants for infrastructure costs, and SVHs receive a per diem covering a portion of veteran care expenses. SVHs offer various levels of care, including nursing home, domiciliary, assisted living, and adult day health care. VA facilities may also offer respite, hospice, palliative care, and geriatric evaluation programs. Veterans are eligible for 30 days of respite care per year. Veterans may receive respite care in institutional settings like CLC or CNH for a break from caregiving. Hospice care can also be provided in institutional settings, such as VA CLC, for veterans whose care needs cannot be managed at home. In some cases, the VA may cover inpatient hospice care in other facilities. Palliative care may be offered in institutional settings like CLCs. In institutional settings like CLCs, palliative care and geriatric evaluation teams may be offered to eligible veterans. Long-term care expenditures account for over one-tenth of the VHA's total medical care budget, with institutional care making up 71% of the spending. In FY2015, the VHA spent $7.4 billion on veteran's long-term care. In FY2015, VHA spent $7.4 billion on veteran's long-term care, with non-institutional care accounting for 29% of the total. Non-institutional long-term care expenditures doubled from FY2010 to FY2015, increasing from 19% to 29% of total VA long-term care spending. The majority of VHA institutional care spending (64%) is for VA Community Living Centers (CLCs), where over 9,000 veterans received care in FY2015. The majority of veteran's long-term care spending in FY2015 was on VA Community Living Centers (CLCs), with over 9,000 veterans receiving care. State veterans nursing homes accounted for over half of the workload, with 88% of residents being long-stay. Per diem costs in CLCs are higher, but they have a greater proportion of short-stay residents. Total medical care obligations for state nursing homes only include VA's portion of the total cost of care. In FY2015, VA Community Living Centers (CLCs) had higher per diem costs due to a greater proportion of short-stay residents needing post-acute care. CLCs offer specialized care for veterans with mental health conditions, dementia, or spinal cord injuries, with costs covering medical staff, education, research, and overhead expenses. These costs are not included in per diem costs for state nursing homes. In FY2015, almost 70% of long-term care expenditures in non-institutional settings were for home-based primary care or homemaker/home health aide programs. The most visited program was homemaker/home health aide services, which provide daily assistance to veterans with personal care needs. Congress faces issues regarding veterans' access to long-term care services and the balance between home-based and institutional care. The third issue involves veteran's health coverage options and federal coordination of financing and health care delivery within the VA health care system and across federal programs. The veteran population is older than the general population, with an increasing number of veterans eligible for VA-paid nursing home care. Current policy discussions focus on reforming access to care within the VA health care system. The Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act of 2014 required external assessments of the VA, with recommendations made by independent assessments and the Commission on Care. These recommendations address challenges related to aging and disabled veterans, but do not fully consider the impact on demand for VA long-term care services. Policymakers face questions regarding access issues in VA health system reform. In the context of VA health system reform, policymakers need to consider access issues for long-term care, specialty, and primary care. The VA must maximize quality and efficiency by ensuring access to long-term care services and care coordination to prevent costly acute inpatient stays or emergency department visits. Questions arise about the adequacy of geriatric and extended care health professionals to meet the needs of disabled and aging veterans. Additionally, the VA's flexibility in negotiating with community partners for home and community-based care is crucial. Medicaid's shift towards home and community-based care has increased significantly over the years, with spending on institutional care decreasing from 82% in FY1995 to 47% in FY2014. This transition was driven by administrative efforts, financial incentives, and statutory authority, as well as the Supreme Court decision in Olmstead v. L.C. The move towards more patient-centered care has been accompanied by the expansion of HCBS services. The movement to expand HCBS alongside patient-centered care preferences is evident in the VA's desire for a balanced offering of home and community-based services. However, in FY2015, 29% of VA long-term care spending was on non-institutional care. The VA faces challenges in balancing long-term care services due to statutory requirements for nursing home care for certain veterans. The VA operates under a mandate to provide nursing home care to certain veterans, similar to federal Medicaid statute. The State Veterans Home program favors institutional care over HCBS, with the VA providing grants to states for facility construction and a per diem for each veteran in a state veteran's home. States are incentivized to maintain long-term care facilities over non-institutional alternatives. The VA faces challenges in shifting towards Home and Community-Based Services (HCBS) due to requirements to maintain institutional care beds and staffing. This may hinder the reduction of institutional spending in favor of HCBS. Additionally, current contracting limitations may prevent the VA from purchasing institutional care in the community, impacting the need for VA-owned facilities. Maintaining physical infrastructure and occupancy of institutional beds are also factors to consider in efficiently utilizing resources. The VA faces challenges in shifting towards Home and Community-Based Services (HCBS) due to requirements to maintain institutional care beds and staffing. This may hinder the reduction of institutional spending in favor of HCBS. Questions arise regarding the appropriate proportion of VA LTSS spending on institutional versus non-institutional care, the number of CLC beds, and the VA's ability to partner with community long-term care facilities. Congress may need to review the VA's long-term care infrastructure to address these issues. Many veterans have multiple sources of health coverage in addition to VA care, such as Medicare, Medicaid, TRICARE, and private insurance. Only 20% of veterans surveyed reported having no other health coverage. Veterans may choose to access the VA for care for various reasons, even if they have coverage elsewhere. Some veterans may choose to access VA care for various reasons, including personal preference, lower costs, or access to services not covered by other plans. The VA offers long-term care services without requiring veterans to spend down assets or meet strict income guidelines. Veterans may also opt for other coverage options and receive healthcare in the community based on personal preference or proximity to providers. Some veterans rely on the VA for health care services, while others use it intermittently. This poses a challenge for the VA in understanding and predicting demand. As veterans age, they may rely more on VA's long-term care services not covered by Medicare. Coordination across health care programs is crucial to avoid duplication and overutilization, raising questions for policymakers on enhancing efficiency and coordination. The VA faces challenges in understanding and predicting demand for long-term care services not covered by Medicare. Coordination across health care programs is crucial to avoid duplication and overutilization, prompting questions on enhancing efficiency and coordination for veterans accessing Medicaid, Medicare, and the VA. Some veterans are required to pay copayments for certain services and outpatient medications related to nonservice-connected conditions. Veterans with certain disability ratings or deemed catastrophically disabled by a VA provider are exempt from copayments for long-term care. Copayments for nonservice-connected care vary based on the level of care, but may be adjusted based on financial circumstances. Medal of Honor recipients are exempt from LTC copayments. Some VA long-term care programs have additional costs, such as room and board for veterans in Medical Foster Home or Community Residential Care homes. Medical Foster Home or Community Residential Care homes require out-of-pocket payment for room and board, varying by location and level of care. State Veterans Homes may also have out-of-pocket costs on a sliding fee scale. VA hospice services have no cost to veterans. Veterans Priority Groups 1 through 8 eligibility criteria are listed in Appendix B."
