    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Trail of the Ancients National Heritage Area Study Act of 2005\". Congress finds that the Four Corners region is of great archaeological interest, showcasing the Ancestral Puebloan culture, Paleo-American inhabitants dating back to 10,000 B.C., Ancestral Puebloan Indians from 1 to 1300 A.D., Ute and Navajo Indian cultures, and well-preserved archaeological sites due to the semi-arid climate. National and international recognition of these sites has enriched our understanding of the region. The Trail of the Ancients National Heritage Area in the Four Corners region features scenic byways in multiple states and would link cultural and recreation sites without imposing restrictions on private property or requiring land acquisition. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. The Act defines key terms such as \"Heritage Area\" as Trail of the Ancients National Heritage Area, \"Secretary\" as Secretary of the Interior, \"State\" as Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, and Utah, and \"study area\" as the Four Corner region including specific counties and reservations. The Act designates portions of reservations of the Ute Mountain Ute, Navajo, and Hopi Tribes in the States. SEC. 4. TRAIL OF THE ANCIENTS NATIONAL HERITAGE AREA STUDY. The Secretary, with the Four Corners Heritage Council, will conduct a study to assess designating the study area as the Trail of the Ancients National Heritage Area. The study will analyze if the area has natural, historic, cultural, educational, scenic, or recreational resources representing distinctive aspects of US heritage, best managed through partnerships. The study area for the Trail of the Ancients National Heritage Area combines diverse resources reflecting US heritage, providing opportunities for conservation, recreation, and education. Residents, businesses, and organizations are involved in the process. Residents, businesses, nonprofit organizations, and government entities in the study area are actively involved in planning and supporting the Heritage Area. A conceptual financial plan has been developed outlining the roles of all participants. Additionally, there is a potential management entity to collaborate with various stakeholders for the development of the Heritage Area while promoting economic activity at the local, state, and tribal levels. The study area for the Heritage Area involves consultation with various governmental and community stakeholders to support economic activity and develop a conceptual boundary map. The Secretary must submit a report to the Senate and House committees within 3 fiscal years of receiving funds for the study, detailing its findings, conclusions, and recommendations.
