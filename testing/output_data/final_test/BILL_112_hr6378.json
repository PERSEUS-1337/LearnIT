The Administrator may designate an area as an air and health quality empowerment zone if the local governmental entity submits an application nominating the area and it meets eligibility criteria. The air pollution control district or local governmental entity must submit an application to the Administrator for an air and health quality empowerment zone. The application must demonstrate eligibility criteria and include a strategic plan for addressing air quality challenges and improving population health. The district or local governmental entity must be actively involved in developing and implementing the strategic plan, with a focus on local contributions and available resources. The plan should outline the funding sources and public-private partnerships to be utilized. The strategic plan must include partnerships with institutions of higher education, medical centers, and other entities, identify funding from Federal programs, establish baselines and benchmarks for success measurement, and provide any additional information required by the Administrator. Written assurances must be provided to the Administrator. To be eligible for designation under the strategic plan, an area must meet criteria including extreme nonattainment of ozone and nonattainment of PM2.5 standards, with emissions of oxides of nitrogen from farm equipment of at least 30 tons per day. The area must have emissions of at least 30 tons per day from farm equipment in 2011 or 3 tons per day of volatile organic compounds in 2010. The area should also have air quality-related health effects exceeding the national average incidence of asthma and higher unemployment rates than the national average. The local government submitting the strategic plan must agree to provide matching funds. The local government submitting the strategic plan must agree to provide matching funds equal to $1 for each $1 of Federal funds provided. The designation remains in effect for up to ten years or until revoked by the Administrator. The Administrator may revoke the designation of an area if it is in attainment with air quality standards or if the local entity fails to comply with the strategic plan. Grants may be awarded for Air and Health Quality Empowerment Zones. The grants awarded for Air and Health Quality Empowerment Zones must be used for carrying out the strategic plan submitted by the designated entity. The amount of the grant is determined by the Administrator based on the information in the application and the needs outlined in the strategic plan. The Administrator will award grants for Air and Health Quality Empowerment Zones based on the submitted strategic plan. $20,000,000 is authorized for each fiscal year from 2013 to 2017. The Administrator will award grants for Air and Health Quality Empowerment Zones based on strategic plans submitted for fiscal years 2013 through 2017. Definitions include the Administrator as the head of the EPA and PM2.5 as particulate matter with a diameter not exceeding 2.5 micrometers. The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency must submit a report to Congress within 5 years of this Act's enactment, detailing its impact on reducing emissions, improving health indicators like asthma rates, and economic factors."
