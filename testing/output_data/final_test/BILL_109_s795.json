    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Safe Teen and Novice Driver Uniform Protection Act of 2005\" or the \"STANDUP Act.\" Congress finds that teen drivers, representing only 6.4% of all drivers, were involved in 14.3% of fatal motor vehicle crashes in 2002. Motor vehicle crashes are the leading cause of death for Americans aged 15-20, with almost 64,000 deaths in this age group between 1994 and 2003. In 2003, 3,657 American drivers aged 15-20 were killed in motor vehicle crashes. In 2003, 7,884 American drivers aged 15-20 were involved in fatal crashes, resulting in 9,088 total fatalities, a 5 percent increase since 1993. Over 50 percent of motor vehicle crash fatalities involving young drivers occur at night. In the same year, 6,300,000 motor vehicle crashes claimed the lives of nearly 43,000 Americans and injured almost 3,000,000 more. Teen drivers between 16 and 20 years of age were involved in 14.3% of fatal motor vehicle crashes in 2002. Teen drivers aged 16-20 have a fatality rate 4 times higher than drivers aged 25-70. Drivers at 16 have a crash rate almost ten times higher than those aged 30-60. In 1997, Florida saw a 9% decrease in fatal and injurious crashes among young drivers aged 15-18 with the introduction of a graduated driver licensing system. The Journal of the American Medical Association and the National Transportation Safety Board report significant decreases in crashes involving 16-year-old drivers in Michigan, North Carolina, and California after the implementation of graduated driver licensing systems. California saw a 40% decrease in teenage passenger deaths and injuries, while the number of at-fault collisions involving 16-year-old drivers decreased by 24%. 39 States and the District of Columbia have also implemented 3-stage systems according to the National Transportation Safety Board. Many states have not implemented basic safety features of graduated driver licensing laws to protect teenage and novice drivers. A 2001 Harris Poll shows high support for requirements such as practice driving hours, learner's permit periods, and limits on teen passengers in cars with teen drivers. Many states lack essential safety measures in their graduated driver licensing laws for teenage and novice drivers. Many states lack essential safety measures in their graduated driver licensing laws for teenage and novice drivers. A State is compliant with this section if it has a 3-stage licensing process for novice drivers under 21, including a learner's permit and intermediate stage, a prohibition on nighttime driving, restrictions on non-familial passengers under 21, and any other requirements set by the Secretary of Transportation. The graduated driver licensing laws for novice drivers may include a learner's permit stage of 6 months, an intermediate stage of 6 months, and specific requirements for behind-the-wheel training with a licensed driver over 21 years old. Full licensure may be delayed for individuals who do not meet these requirements. Penalties may be imposed on individuals with provisional licenses for offenses like driving while intoxicated, misrepresentation of age, reckless driving, unbelted driving, speeding, or other violations. The Secretary will issue regulations through rulemaking to implement this section. SEC. 4. INCENTIVE GRANTS. In the first 3 fiscal years post-enactment, the Secretary will grant funds to compliant States submitting applications. States must apply with required information and governor certification of compliance. Grant amounts for each fiscal year will be determined based on a specific ratio. The Secretary will grant funds to compliant States for enforcement, training, publishing educational materials, and administrative activities related to the State graduated driver licensing law. Authorization of $25,000,000 annually from the Highway Trust Fund for enforcement, training, and administrative activities related to State graduated driver licensing laws from 2005 to 2009. SEC. 5. WITHHOLDING OF FUNDS FOR NON-COMPLIANCE. The Secretary will withhold a percentage of funds from states not in compliance with the Act for fiscal years 2010, 2011, and beyond under section 104(b) of title 23, United States Code. The Secretary will withhold 6 percent of funds from states not complying with the Act starting in fiscal year 2012 under section 104(b) of title 23, United States Code. Withheld funds are available for distribution to the state until the end of the third fiscal year following the appropriation. The Secretary will withhold funds from non-compliant states starting in fiscal year 2012. If a state complies with the Act before the funds expire, the Secretary will distribute the withheld amounts to the state for expenditure until the end of the third fiscal year. If a state is not compliant with the Act by the end of the specified period, any withheld funds will revert back to the Treasury of the United States."
