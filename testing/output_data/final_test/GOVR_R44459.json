    "content": "The United States has around 614,000 bridges on public roads, with state and local governments owning 98% of them. Interstate and principal arterial bridges carry the majority of daily traffic, with urban Interstate bridges handling the highest loads. Federal law mandates periodic inspections of public road bridges by states. The Federal Highway Administration requires periodic inspections of public road bridges to assess their condition as good, fair, or poor, and to identify structurally deficient bridges. A bridge is considered structurally deficient if significant load-carrying elements are in poor condition or if the waterway opening causes traffic interruptions. This classification does not necessarily mean the bridge is unsafe but may require weight restrictions. In 2016, 47.4% of bridges were in good condition, 44.6% were fair, and 7.9% were poor. The number of structurally deficient bridges decreased from 89,000 in 2000 to about 56,000 in 2016. As of December 2016, 9% of all bridges were classified as structurally deficient, down from 15% in 2000. Structural deficiency mainly affects rural areas, with 82% of deficient bridges in rural areas and 54% on local rural roads. In 2016, 57% of structurally deficient bridges were on urban bridges, with 39% on urban Interstates and other principal arterials. Urban Interstate Highway bridges had a 3.5% structural deficiency rate, while rural Interstate Highway bridges had a 3.0% rate. Bridges on local roads, owned by local governments, had more than twice the structural deficiency rate of state-owned bridges in 2016. In 2016, locally owned bridges had a 12.4% structural deficiency rate, compared to 5.6% for state-owned bridges. The FHWA assesses the condition and performance of highways and bridges every two years, estimating future spending needs. Despite uncertainties, these estimates help evaluate current spending levels against future needs. The 2015 needs assessment showed that $17.5 billion was spent on bridge construction in 2012, with $16.4 billion going towards rehabilitating or replacing existing bridges. Spending on bridge rehab/replacement increased by 22% from 2008 to 2012 but decreased by 7% from 2010. Higher spending in 2009 and 2010 was due to funding under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. FHWA's future estimates focus on fixing deficiencies in existing bridges when benefits outweigh costs. The estimated cost of fixing all bridge deficiencies existing in 2012 would be $123.1 billion, almost eight times the 2012 spending level. To eliminate the backlog by 2032 would require an annual investment of $24.6 billion. If the 2012 spending level of $16.4 billion continues, the total bridge reconstruction backlog would decline by roughly 84% by 2032. Federal assistance for bridge maintenance and construction primarily comes through FHWA. The Federal-Aid Highway Program, administered by FHWA, provides funding for highway bridge maintenance, rehabilitation, and construction. States receive the funding and have the authority to decide how it is spent, following federal guidelines and regulations. Bridge projects are managed at the state level, with state departments of transportation overseeing contracts, construction, and inspections. The Highway Bridge Program, previously part of the Federal-Aid Highway Program, focuses specifically on highway bridges. The Highway Bridge Program, previously part of the Federal-Aid Highway Program, was terminated in FY2012. The 2015 FAST Act does not have a specific bridge program but allows bridge projects to be funded through the NHPP, STBG, and NHFP. States decide how to allocate funds for bridges and other highway projects, including seismic retrofitting for earthquake risk reduction. Funding from other formula programs can also be used for bridges. FHWA is involved in the project decision-making process for bridge projects, classifying bridges based on risk and assigning priorities for maintenance, replacement, or rehabilitation. States can transfer funds between formula programs and may also receive funding from the Nationally Significant Freight and Highway Projects Program for large bridge projects benefiting freight movement. FHWA sets performance measures for states to meet to avoid funding penalties, such as penalties for states with over 10% structurally deficient bridges on the National Highway System. States may need to allocate funds for bridge projects. Table 2 displays federal funding obligations for bridges from FY2009 to FY2017, adjusting for project cost inflation. Bridge obligation figures were higher from FY2009 to FY2011. In FY2012, federal funds for bridges fell 23% below pre-ARRA obligations after adjusting for inflation. Obligations for bridges grew slightly faster than inflation in FY2013 and FY2016. Total obligations for bridges in FY2017 were slightly lower than pre-ARRA levels in current-dollar terms and about 15% lower after adjusting for inflation. All bridges on public roads longer than 20 feet must be inspected under the National Bridge Inspection Program. Data from these inspections are reported to FHWA. The FHWA compiles a list of structurally deficient bridges based on inspections conducted under the National Bridge Inspection Program. States use this information to prioritize bridge replacement or repair. The NBIS sets standards for bridge inspections, with each state responsible for inspecting public highway bridges, delegating some responsibilities if needed. Qualified individuals can conduct inspections, including state employees, consultants, or others. The NBIS establishes standards for bridge inspections, with inspections typically required every 24 months. States can identify bridges needing more frequent inspections or request approval for longer intervals. Underwater inspections are usually every 60 months but can be extended to 72 months with FHWA permission. Fracture-critical members must be inspected hands-on every 24 months. Inspections are mainly visual, led by a trained team leader, with special inspections not requiring a team leader present. The FHWA provides engineering expertise for catastrophic bridge failures and audits state compliance with inspection requirements. The Emergency Relief Program funds repairs for bridges damaged in natural disasters or catastrophic failures. FHWA bridge engineers have limited time for oversight. The Emergency Relief Program provides funds for emergency repairs immediately after a disaster to restore essential traffic, with a federal share of 100% for the first 180 days. Additional funding may be provided through supplemental appropriations acts. Congress has sometimes raised the federal share to 100% for certain disasters, such as the 2007 collapse of a bridge on Interstate-35W in Minnesota. The Emergency Relief Program, administered through state departments of transportation in coordination with FHWA, provides funds for emergency repairs after disasters. Despite warnings of a crisis due to structurally deficient bridges, FHWA data shows a consistent decrease in such bridges since 1990. However, the condition of roads, especially urban roads, has not seen the same level of improvement. In the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (MAP-21; P.L. 112-141), Congress gave states flexibility to allocate federal funding for roads or bridges. This decision avoided mandating specific spending levels on bridges, leaving it to the states to determine yearly budgets. The act also emphasizes the importance of efficiency in addressing structurally deficient bridges without compromising safety. FHWA is tasked with developing performance measures for bridges. The FHWA is required to develop performance measures for bridges, with oversight on implementation speed and effectiveness. States must address structurally deficient bridges to avoid penalties under the NHPP, which mandates spending on bridge improvements until deficiencies are below 10%. This may result in states allocating more federal highway funds to bridges rather than roadway projects. The FAST Act increased funding for the Federal-Aid Highway program by 2.4% above previous levels, with a focus on bridge improvement. Congress may need to monitor states' bridge spending patterns to ensure deficient bridges are being addressed effectively. Tolling could expedite major bridge improvements. The FAST Act increased funding for the Federal-Aid Highway program with a focus on bridge improvement. Tolling could allow for more rapid improvement of major bridges, making bridge building an attractive investment for private entities. Bridge tolls are unpopular but can help projects become eligible for federal loans. Some states charge out-of-state users higher toll rates to make bridge tolls more acceptable within the state. Currently, any bridge on the federal-aid highway system, including Interstate Highway bridges, may be converted to a toll facility if related to reconstruction or replacement. New bridges, including those on new segments of Interstate Highways, may also be tolled. Lane capacity can be added with tolls as long as the number of free lanes remains the same. Bridge owners have the right to implement tolling under specific regulations. FHWA does not regulate toll rates, which are set by the toll road owner or operator. Toll revenue usage is restricted by federal law. Tolling bridges connecting two states is typically done with mutual agreement. Establishing tolls on bridges between two states may require mutual agreement, but unilateral toll imposition is possible for bridges owned by one state. Congress could provide guidance on toll imposition processes. Historically, federal highway funding was mainly for roads on the federal-aid highway system. The Surface Transportation Assistance Act of 1978 set limits on off-system bridge spending. Off-system bridge projects, not part of the federal-aid system, have been required since 1978. STBG funds must be used for off-system bridges, which are mainly on local rural roads. The set-aside for off-system projects is supported by rural states and local governments. The FAST Act made changes in bridge funding. The FAST Act expanded bridge project eligibility under the NHPP program to include bridges on the 1.02 million-mile federal-aid highway system. This change allows states to use NHPP funds for bridge projects, freeing up STBG funds for bridges not on the federal-aid highway system. In FY2014, 9% of funds were for new bridges, 51% for bridge replacement, 7% for major rehabilitation, and 33% for minor bridge work, supporting projects on 5,173 bridges. The share of spending for new and replacement bridges combined was 60%, lower than in the late 1990s. The share of federal funding for major bridge rehabilitation has decreased since the late 1990s, with more funds now allocated to minor bridge work. This shift in spending could be due to fewer deficient bridges and states favoring less expensive projects. Funding for bridges owned by the federal government or Indian tribes comes from separate programs like the Tribal Transportation Program and Federal Lands Transportation Program. The Tribal Transportation Program and Federal Lands Transportation Program, along with the Federal Lands Access Program, provide funding for transportation projects on federal lands. These programs are smaller compared to core formula programs, with an average annual funding of $485 million for the Tribal Transportation Program and $355 million for the Federal Lands Transportation Program under the FAST Act. Funding decisions for the Federal Lands Access Program are made by a state committee including representatives from FHWA and state transportation departments. The annual average Federal Lands Transportation program authorization is divided among various federal land management agencies, covering road, bridge, and public transportation needs. Funding for bridges on federal and tribal land has led to complications, such as the rehabilitation of Arlington Memorial Bridge, owned by the National Park Service. The cost of $227 million for the project exceeds the Park Service's yearly funding for all highway needs. To complete the project, the Park Service is combining $107 million from its transportation and general funds. To complete the Arlington Memorial Bridge project, the Park Service is combining $107 million of its funds with a $90 million grant from the Department of Transportation's INFRA program and a $30 million transfer from federal highway formula funds. Congress should consider funding for large federal lands bridge projects like this one. The FHWA is developing a risk-based approach to prioritize bridge maintenance, replacement, or rehabilitation. Issues include unclear usage of prioritized project lists and potential conflicts with state asset management plans. Congress may require states to use the national classification system for bridge project funding eligibility. The FHWA is considering aligning state asset management plans with national prioritization for bridge project funding. They may direct FHWA to ensure inspections align with NBIS, potentially requiring more on-site reviews or increased paperwork. Current law mandates minimum inspection standards and annual state compliance reviews. The Secretary of Transportation is to update NBIS, including methodology and training. The FHWA is considering aligning state asset management plans with national prioritization for bridge project funding. The Secretary of Transportation is expected to update the NBIS, including methodology, training, and qualifications of inspectors by February 2018. Congress may oversee implementation and monitor effectiveness."
