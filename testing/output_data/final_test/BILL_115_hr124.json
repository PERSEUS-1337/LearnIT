    "content": "The \"Camera Accountability Maintenance and Transparency in Policing Act of 2017\" or the \"CAM TIP Act of 2017\" allows grants for body-worn cameras for law enforcement officers under the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968. Grants can be used for acquisition, operation, and maintenance of these cameras. The grants awarded under the \"CAM TIP Act of 2017\" are distributed directly to the State, local government, or Indian tribe for the program described in section 3033. The program described in this section outlines requirements for law enforcement officers to use body-worn cameras, including policies for usage, civil liberties protection, limitations on monitoring recordings, and standards for camera placement on officers. The program outlines requirements for law enforcement officers using body-worn cameras, including best practices for accurate narratives, policies for collection and storage of recordings, availability of recordings to the public, victims, and internal use, and guidelines/training for officers on camera management. The text chunk discusses the matching requirements and funding for grants under a specific program. The federal share of costs cannot exceed 50%, and non-federal share can be in cash or in-kind. Grants can be made using available funds. Additionally, there is a study on the cost of purchasing and using body-worn cameras by law enforcement agencies. The Attorney General will conduct a study on the cost of body-worn cameras for law enforcement agencies and submit a report to Congress within 180 days. Additionally, a task force on community policing and body camera accountability will be established. A task force will be established in the Department of Justice to provide recommendations on community policing, including accountability and transparency practices. The task force will include representatives from civil rights organizations, law enforcement personnel, and community policing experts. They will also develop body-worn camera training protocols and study the impact of citizen review boards on investigating police misconduct cases. The task force established by the Department of Justice will conduct a survey to determine the best practices and effectiveness of body camera requirements in investigating cases of alleged police misconduct. The findings will be reported back to Congress within 1 year of implementing the policy. The Comptroller General of the United States will submit a report to Congress within 90 days on the Pentagon's 1033 program, detailing equipment distribution, value, officer training, and equipment usage in jurisdictions."
