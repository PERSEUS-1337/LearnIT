    "content": "The Act titled \"United States Independent Film and Television Production Incentive Act of 2001\" introduces tax incentives for qualified US independent film and television production through a new section called \"SEC. 45G. UNITED STATES INDEPENDENT FILM AND TELEVISION PRODUCTION WAGE CREDIT.\" The United States independent film and television production wage credit is 25 percent of qualified wages paid or incurred during the taxable year. In certain areas, the percentage can be increased to 35 percent for qualified employees. Only the first $25,000 of wages per year are taken into account. The United States independent film and television production wage credit is 25 percent of qualified wages paid or incurred during the taxable year, with a maximum of $25,000 per year for each qualified employee. Qualified wages include wages paid for services performed in the United States by a qualified employee and employee fringe benefit expenses. The United States independent film and television production wage credit applies to employees whose services are mainly related to qualified productions. Certain individuals, such as those described in specific sections, are not eligible for this credit. No other wage credits are allowed under this chapter in conjunction with this credit. The term 'employee fringe benefit expenses' includes employer contributions to retirement plans, health insurance coverage, and life/disability insurance for employees. Amounts treated as wages under this provision are not eligible for any other wage credits under this chapter. The term 'qualified United States independent film and television production' refers to productions primarily filmed in the United States for various formats like motion pictures, television shows, and mini-series. The term 'qualified United States independent film and television production' refers to productions primarily filmed in the United States for public entertainment or educational purposes, with total qualified wages between $200,000 and $10,000,000. It excludes productions requiring records under section 2257 of title 18, United States Code. The term 'public entertainment' includes motion pictures, TV programs, or videos intended for public broadcast or cable distribution. It excludes films produced for private noncommercial use or with a primarily topical market. The $10,000,000 amount in paragraph (1)(C) is adjusted for inflation for taxable years after 2001. The taxable amount is increased annually based on the cost-of-living adjustment for the calendar year. If the increase is not a multiple of $500,000, it is rounded to the nearest multiple. Controlled groups of employers are treated as a single entity for tax purposes. The United States independent film and television production wage credit is determined under section 45G(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Controlled groups of employers are treated as a single entity for tax purposes, and the credit for each employer is its proportionate share of the wages giving rise to the credit. Rules similar to section 51(k) and subsections (c) and (d) of section 52 apply for the application of certain other rules. The amendment prohibits the carryback of the section 45G credit before its effective date. It also denies a double benefit and includes a conforming amendment to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The amendment to section 45G prohibits carryback of the credit before its effective date, applying to amounts paid or incurred after the enactment of the Act in taxable years ending after that date."
