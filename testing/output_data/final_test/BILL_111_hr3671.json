    "content": "The Upper Mississippi River Basin Protection Act establishes a sediment and nutrient monitoring network, with responsibilities for data collection, storage, collaboration with existing efforts, reporting requirements, and a National Research Council assessment. Additionally, it includes provisions for computer modeling and research. The Upper Mississippi River Basin Protection Act includes provisions for computer modeling and research of sediment and nutrient sources, use of electronic means for information distribution, and reporting requirements. Authorization of appropriations and cost-sharing requirements are also addressed in the act. The Upper Mississippi River Basin Protection Act defines key terms related to the watershed area and activities authorized to monitor nutrient and sediment loss. Sound science is emphasized for identifying sources and fate of nutrients. The Upper Mississippi River Basin Protection Act emphasizes sound science in quantifying sources, transport, and fate of nutrients and sediment, as well as the impact of treatment methods on nutrient and sediment loss. The Upper Mississippi River Basin Protection Act emphasizes Federal investments guided by sound science. Establishment of a sediment and nutrient monitoring network is outlined in Title I. The Secretary of the Interior will establish a sediment and nutrient monitoring network for the Upper Mississippi River Basin to identify sources, quantify processes, record changes over time, provide data for computer modeling, and identify major sources of sediment and nutrients. The Secretary of the Interior will establish a sediment and nutrient monitoring network for the Upper Mississippi River Basin to identify major sources of sediment and nutrients. The United States Geological Survey will assist in carrying out this task. SEC. 102. DATA COLLECTION AND STORAGE RESPONSIBILITIES.\n\nThe Secretary of the Interior will set guidelines for sediment and nutrient monitoring data collection, ensuring consistent methods, reporting, storage, and release to the public with generic identifiers. Private land monitoring station locations will not be disclosed without permission.\n\nSEC. 103. RELATIONSHIP TO EXISTING SEDIMENT AND NUTRIENT MONITORING. The Secretary of the Interior will inventory existing sediment and nutrient monitoring efforts to identify overlap, data gaps, and redundancies. They will integrate these efforts into the monitoring network required by section 101 and make maximum use of existing data and programs from various entities. The Secretary of the Interior will coordinate with the long-term estuary assessment project while developing the sediment and nutrient monitoring network required by section 101. The Secretary of the Interior will collaborate with other monitoring programs to establish the sediment and nutrient monitoring network. Reporting to Congress on the network's development is required within 180 days. The National Research Council will assess water resources in the Upper Mississippi River Basin. SEC. 201. COMPUTER MODELING AND RESEARCH OF SEDIMENT AND NUTRIENT SOURCES. The Upper Mississippi River Stewardship Initiative requires the establishment of a modeling program by the Director of the United States Geological Survey to identify significant sources of sediment and nutrients in the Upper Mississippi River Basin. Computer modeling will be used to pinpoint subwatersheds contributing to sediment and nutrient loss for targeted reduction efforts. The program includes models to link nutrient and sediment loss to landscape, land use, and management practices, as well as models defining river channel nutrient transformation processes. The Upper Mississippi River Stewardship Initiative requires a modeling program to identify sources of sediment and nutrients in the basin. Ancillary information like land use, soils, elevation, sediment, and nutrient reduction actions, and remotely sensed data will be collected in GIS format to support modeling and management use. The Director of the US Geological Survey will establish an Internet system within 90 days to provide information on programs, sediment/nutrient levels, and successful projects in the Upper Mississippi River Basin. The Director of the US Geological Survey will provide annual reports on monitoring activities in the Upper Mississippi River Basin and progress reports on modeling activities to Congress and the public. Authorization of appropriations is also included in the report. SEC. 301. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. $6,250,000 each fiscal year for US Geological Survey activities, with one-third for Cooperative Water Program and the rest for Hydrologic Networks and Analysis Program. $650,000 for National Research Council assessment. SEC. 302. COST-SHARING REQUIREMENTS. SEC. 302. COST-SHARING REQUIREMENTS. Funds for the US Geological Survey Cooperative Water Program must adhere to cost-sharing requirements specified in the Department of the Interior Appropriations Act, 2006."
