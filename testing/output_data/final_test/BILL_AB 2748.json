    "title": "AB 2748",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 1544 of the Civil Code states that any partial or interim payment made by a responsible polluter or related entity in connection with an environmental disaster does not release the polluter from liability for any current or future claims by the recipient. The payment cannot be conditioned upon the recipient agreeing to release the polluter from liability. (b) A payment or reimbursement in connection with an environmental disaster by the responsible polluter or related entity can be credited against liability to the recipient for any current or future claim related to the disaster. (c) Settlement in connection with an environmental disaster releases the responsible polluter from liability only for known acts or injuries prior to the settlement, not for unknown claims or events post-settlement. Any agreement entered into on or after February 1, 2017, in violation of specified provisions is void and against public policy. A \"partial or interim payment or reimbursement\" refers to immediate out-of-pocket expenses. This section applies to agreements related to environmental disasters at specific facilities and excludes actions against public entities. Section 340.85 is added to the Code of Civil Procedure. In civil actions for injury from hazardous materials, the time limit is three years from injury or awareness of injury cause and liability. In wrongful death cases involving exposure to hazardous materials or toxic substances, the time limit to file a lawsuit is three years from the date of death or from when the plaintiff becomes aware of the cause of death. In wrongful death cases involving hazardous materials or toxic substances, media reports alone are not enough to establish notice of wrongdoing. This provision applies to actions related to environmental disasters at specific facilities and excludes actions against public entities. Section 1021.3 is added to the Code of Civil Procedure. Section 1021.3 of the Code of Civil Procedure allows for the award of attorneys' fees to a prevailing plaintiff in private nuisance actions against environmental polluters for disasters they are liable for. This provision applies specifically to the Aliso Canyon gas storage facility and the Exide Technologies facility in the City of Vernon, excluding actions against public entities. The Legislature deems a special law necessary for civil litigation involving damages from environmental disasters in California, as a general law cannot adequately address the unique circumstances."
