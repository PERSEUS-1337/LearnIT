    "content": "During the 2008 and 2009 financial crisis, the motor vehicle industry in the United States and other industrial countries faced a severe downturn. Old Chrysler and Old GM struggled as credit markets tightened, leading them to seek federal financial assistance. Both automakers, along with Chrysler Financial and GMAC, received aid from the Bush and Obama Administrations. During the 2008 and 2009 financial crisis, Old Chrysler and Old GM filed for bankruptcy with oversight from the Obama Administration. Chrysler was restructured with Fiat taking over management and the U.S. government providing loans. New Chrysler repaid the loans in 2011 and Fiat purchased the government's remaining interests. In July 2011, Fiat bought out the U.S. government's remaining stake in Chrysler, ending direct government involvement. The TARP assistance for Chrysler was not fully recovered due to losses in bankruptcy. The report outlines New Chrysler's progress since its creation in 2009 and the divestment of the government's stake. Initial loans were provided by the Bush Administration in 2008 and 2009 to assist the motor vehicle industry, totaling nearly $80 billion through TARP. The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act authorized nearly $80 billion in assistance through the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) in 2008 to address the financial crisis. The objective was to restore liquidity and stability to the financial system, with guiding principles to protect taxpayer investments and promote market stability. The Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) was established to stabilize financial markets and the economy, boost market confidence, and dispose of investments in a timely manner. The program's broad authorities were utilized to provide funding to the auto industry, with both Chrysler and GM receiving TARP loans in 2009. The Obama Administration continued this support, leading to major restructuring efforts for the companies. GMAC/Ally Financial also received capital infusions to survive economic downturns and losses in the mortgage market. The TARP assistance provided to the U.S. auto industry, including Chrysler and GM, raised legal and operational questions. Chrysler Financial repaid its TARP loan quickly, while Chrysler underwent multiple ownership changes since 1980. Despite market share losses in passenger cars, Chrysler's share in light trucks grew. In 1979, Old Chrysler faced bankruptcy due to lack of capital for federal standards compliance. Congress approved a $1.5 billion loan guarantee to save the company. After receiving the loan, Chrysler revamped operations and introduced new vehicle lines. Chrysler's fortunes improved in the 1990s as the economy grew and the auto industry globalized. In 1998, Old Chrysler and Daimler announced a merger, seen as a global restructuring of the auto industry. Despite improvements and investments, the merger failed due to limited synergies and price pressures on Old Chrysler affecting Daimler's profitability. Daimler's profitability and share prices were negatively impacted by issues at Old Chrysler, leading to Daimler selling 80% of it to Cerberus Capital Management in 2007. Cerberus also acquired Chrysler Financial and a stake in GMAC, with an optimistic outlook on strengthening U.S. manufacturing through private equity investments. Ownership of Chrysler by Cerberus Capital Management offered advantages such as the ability to focus on long-term value and strategic investments without pressure from quarterly reports. Despite facing financial challenges similar to Old GM, Chrysler sought federal aid in 2008 due to the economic crisis. CEO Robert Nardelli attributed the need for aid to the financial crisis that began in 2007. During the economic crisis that began in 2007 and worsened in 2008, Chrysler faced a significant decline in auto sales, resulting in a loss of market share and revenue. To continue restructuring and fund product development, Chrysler required a loan from the government. The Bush Administration mandated a viability plan from Old Chrysler in exchange for further federal assistance. Old Chrysler's viability plan for restructuring included plant closings, labor concessions, operational changes, and dealership closings. President Obama rejected the plan in March 2009, giving the company until May 1 to come up with a more comprehensive restructuring plan. Despite reaching agreements with most stakeholders, a group of creditors holding 30% of the debt did not approve the proposal, putting the company at risk of bankruptcy. Old Chrysler faced bankruptcy after 30% of its creditors balked at a settlement agreement. The company filed for bankruptcy on April 30, becoming the first major U.S. auto company to seek protection since 1933. Most stakeholders agreed before the filing, expediting the court decisions in just 42 days. Old Chrysler's liabilities were taken over by Old Carco, while its assets were sold to New Chrysler, now Chrysler Group LLC. The government provided a final TARP installment to assist New Chrysler in becoming a new, smaller automaker, which began operations on June 1, 2009. On June 1, 2009, Old Chrysler's departing Chairman and CEO Robert Nardelli highlighted the benefits of the bankruptcy proceedings, including a competitive wage structure, debt reduction, asset disposition, dealer network optimization, and supplier agreements. The United Auto Workers' health care retirement trust, VEBA, became the largest equity owner in New Chrysler. The union's VEBA trust received a large piece of Chrysler due to Old Chrysler's $8 billion retiree healthcare liability being converted into an equity stake. Fiat became a partner in managing New Chrysler and was given a 20% equity stake without a direct financial contribution. Fiat could increase its stake by meeting performance benchmarks, including producing fuel-efficient vehicles in the U.S. In 2011, Fiat increased its equity stake in New Chrysler by buying additional shares and buying back the government's equity interest. Fiat now holds a 58.5% stake, with the remaining held by the UAW VEBA. Fiat's share could potentially rise to over 70% if it exercises its rights to purchase more from the UAW VEBA Trust. Fiat purchased these rights from the U.S. Treasury for $60 million. The federal government provided $10.9 billion in financial support for Chrysler in 2008 and 2009, including TARP assistance that was converted into common equity. This common equity represents an ownership stake in the company and the government's recoupment of its assistance depends on the price it receives when selling this equity. Similar conversions of TARP assistance into common equity were also done for other recipients like GM, GMAC/Ally Financial, AIG, and Citigroup. The government's recoupment of TARP assistance for Chrysler depends on the price received when selling its equity stake. If the equity is sold for less than the assistance amount, the company is not obligated to compensate the government. However, if the equity value is high, the government may make a profit. Proceeds from equity sales are used to reduce the public debt. The sale of the government's remaining interests in Chrysler to Fiat resulted in a $560 million payment to the Treasury, compared to $1.8 billion in outstanding TARP assistance. The government recouped less money from TARP assistance for Chrysler than the loans given, with gains of $1.1 billion in interest payments. TARP provided $10.9 billion in loans to Chrysler, but the government received approximately $9.6 billion in return, including loan repayments, recoupment from bankruptcy, interest, and payments from Fiat. The method of calculating gains or losses for TARP assistance depends on the accounting method used. The government recouped $1.1 billion in interest payments from TARP assistance for Chrysler, resulting in a $1.3 billion gap between funds loaned and recouped. Additional cost factors like borrowing costs, risk premiums, and management expenses were not fully included in this figure. The Congressional Budget Office and the Office of Management and Budget consider these factors in their budgetary scores for TARP assistance. The value of TARP assistance is estimated using market interest rates and reflected in the federal budget. Estimates are reported in aggregate figures, with the budget cost for the auto industry estimated at $19 billion by CBO in March 2012. The Treasury and OMB estimated the lifetime cost as of May 31, 2012, to be $25 billion, but individual gains or losses for Chrysler, GM, and GMAC/Ally Financial were not reported separately."
