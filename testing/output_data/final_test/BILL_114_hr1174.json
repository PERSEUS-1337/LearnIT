The Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986 (ECPA) aimed to protect the privacy of electronic communications stored with service providers while allowing law enforcement access to records. ECPA authorized governmental entities to obtain communication data through warrants, subpoenas, and a new court order in section 2703(d) of title 18, United States Code. The Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986 (ECPA) allows law enforcement in the United States to access electronic communications data through warrants, subpoenas, and court orders. Courts in the US do not have the power to issue warrants for extraterritorial searches, but the Act permits search warrants extraterritorially for obtaining electronic communications of US persons. SEC. 3. SCOPE AND CLARIFICATION OF WARRANT REQUIREMENT. In General, Chapter 121 of title 18, United States Code, is amended to restrict providers of remote computing or electronic communication services from disclosing communication contents to governmental entities. Governmental entities can request disclosure of communication contents stored by service providers. The amended Chapter 121 of title 18, United States Code restricts providers from disclosing communication contents without a warrant issued by a court of competent jurisdiction. Warrants can require disclosure of communication contents stored within the United States by the provider. The amended Chapter 121 of title 18, United States Code restricts providers from disclosing communication contents without a warrant issued by a court of competent jurisdiction, even if the account-holder is a United States person. The court can modify or vacate the warrant if it would require the provider to violate foreign laws. The section clarifies that governmental entities can use administrative subpoenas or grand jury subpoenas to compel disclosure of electronic communication contents from originators, addressees, or service providers' officers, directors, employees, or agents. The section specifies that a governmental entity must provide notice to a subscriber or customer within 10 business days after receiving the contents of a wire or electronic communication. The notice must include a copy of the warrant and details about the nature of the law enforcement inquiry. The legislation requires a governmental entity to notify a subscriber or customer within 10 business days after obtaining their information from a provider of electronic communication service. The entity can request a delay in notification as part of the warrant application process. The legislation mandates notification to a subscriber within 10 days of obtaining their information from a service provider. A court can delay notification for up to 90 days if adverse consequences are likely. Additionally, the definition of a \"United States person\" is clarified. The definition of a \"United States person\" is clarified as a permanent resident alien of the United States, or an entity organized under US laws. SEC. 4. MUTUAL LEGAL ASSISTANCE TREATY REFORMS. The Attorney General must establish a form and online docketing system for foreign governments to file mutual legal assistance treaty requests within 180 days of this Act's enactment. The Attorney General must establish a form and online docketing system for foreign governments to file mutual legal assistance treaty requests within 180 days of this Act's enactment. Additionally, the Attorney General shall publish annual statistics on the number of MLAT requests made by the Department of Justice to foreign governments and the average processing time for these requests. The Attorney General must notify the Secretary of State within 7 days of disclosing electronic communications content to a foreign government through an MLAT request. The Attorney General is also authorized to issue regulations for the preservation of records related to MLAT requests. The Attorney General may issue a request under section 2703(f) of title 18, United States Code, upon receiving a valid MLAT request. When obtaining information from an electronic communications provider based on an MLAT request, the Attorney General must notify the provider in writing that the request is made under a mutual legal assistance treaty. Congress believes that data localization requirements imposed by foreign governments are incompatible with the borderless nature of the Internet, hinder online innovation, and are unnecessary for law enforcement needs. The Department of Justice, State, and Trade Representatives should advocate for open data flow policies with foreign nations."
