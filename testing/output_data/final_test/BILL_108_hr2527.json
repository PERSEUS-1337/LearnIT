    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Compassionate Assistance for Rape Emergencies Act\" and includes findings related to the issue. The \"Compassionate Assistance for Rape Emergencies Act\" highlights the following key findings:\n- 25,000 to 32,000 women become pregnant each year due to rape or incest, with 22,000 pregnancies preventable with timely access to emergency contraception.\n- A 1996 study found that 50% of rape-related pregnancies end in abortion.\n- Many hospitals do not routinely provide emergency contraception to sexual assault survivors.\n- The risk of pregnancy after sexual assault is estimated to be 4.7% in survivors without contraception at the time of the attack. The Food and Drug Administration has declared emergency contraception safe and effective in preventing unintended pregnancy, with medical research indicating that administering it sooner increases the likelihood of success. The American Medical Association and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists support wider availability of emergency contraception, endorsed by the American College of Emergency Physicians as well. Emergency contraception should be offered as standard care to female patients after sexual assault. Most women are unaware of emergency contraception, leading to low usage among assault survivors. Data shows that emergency contraception has prevented thousands of abortions and contributed to a significant decrease in total abortions. Hospitals providing emergency medical treatment should offer emergency contraception to prevent unintended pregnancies in assault survivors. Hospitals should provide emergency contraceptives free of charge to sexual assault survivors. Federal funds may only be given to hospitals under health-related programs if they meet conditions for providing assistance to sexual assault victims, including offering accurate information about emergency contraception. Emergency contraception is offered promptly to women after unprotected sex, and it is effective in preventing pregnancy. The information provided must be clear and in multiple languages if needed. Services cannot be denied based on the woman's ability to pay. Emergency contraception, defined as a drug or device used postcoitally to prevent pregnancy, must be approved by the FDA. The term \"hospital\" and \"Secretary\" are also defined in relation to emergency services. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Health and Human Services, while \"sexual assault\" is defined as non-consensual coitus. This section will take effect after 180 days from the enactment of the Act, with the Secretary required to publish criteria for implementation 30 days before the expiration of this period."
