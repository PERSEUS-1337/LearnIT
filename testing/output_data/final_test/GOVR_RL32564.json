    "content": "In the years following the 9/11 attacks, concerns were raised about terrorists entering the US on temporary visas despite immigration laws. The 9/11 Commission highlighted the importance of border security in counterterrorism efforts. In response to the 9/11 Commission's findings, proposals in the 108th and 109th Congresses addressed border security in immigration law. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 and the REAL ID Act of 2005 included provisions related to immigration reform and document security. The Department of State, Department of Homeland Security, and Department of Justice play key roles in administering alien admission laws and policies. The Department of State, Department of Homeland Security, and Department of Justice play key roles in administering alien admission laws and policies. Affairs issues visas, USCIS approves immigrant petitions, and CBP inspects people entering the US. The report focuses on terrorism-related grounds for inadmissibility and deportation, explaining legal definitions and screening processes. The alien screening process involves reviews by DOS consular officers abroad and CBP inspectors at U.S. ports of entry to determine admissibility based on various grounds for inadmissibility outlined in the Immigration and Nationality Act. These grounds include health, criminal history, security concerns, public charge, illegal entry, and previous removal. Some grounds may be waived for nonimmigrants and refugees. Prior to the Immigration Act of 1990, there was no terrorism-related ground for exclusion. The terrorism grounds for inadmissibility were added in the 1990 Act to modernize security and foreign policy grounds. This allowed for a broader definition of terrorist associations and activities. In response to the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, Congress strengthened anti-terrorism provisions in the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) through laws like the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 and the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act. Additionally, the Violent Crime Control Act of 1994 established a temporary \"S\" nonimmigrant visa category for witnesses and informants on criminal and terrorist activities, later made permanent by Congress in 2001. The USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 was a comprehensive anti-terrorism measure. The USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 and the Enhanced Border Security and Visa Entry Reform Act of 2002 amended immigration law to add terrorism-related grounds for inadmissibility, expand definitions of terrorism-related activities, improve visa issuance processes, implement electronic data systems for alien screening, and require biometric identifiers on newly issued visas. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 and the REAL ID Act expanded terror-related grounds for exclusion and removal, increased funding for homeland security, and tightened monitoring of persons entering and leaving the United States. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 and the REAL ID Act expanded terror-related grounds for exclusion and removal, increased funding for homeland security, and tightened monitoring of persons entering and leaving the United States. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008 modified certain terrorism-related provisions of the INA, exempting organizations from the definition of \"terrorist organization\" and expanding immigration authorities' waiver authority over terrorism-related INA provisions. Since 1990, \"terrorism\"-related activities by an alien have been grounds for exclusion and removal, covering membership in terrorist organizations and activities supporting terrorism-related entities. The INA defines terms like \"terrorist activity,\" \"engage in terrorist activity,\" and \"terrorist organization\" for specific conduct or entities. These terms refer to distinct concepts and their definitions impact INA provisions. \"Terrorist activity\" includes acts like hijacking or assassination, while \"engaging in terrorist activity\" covers direct acts and support activities like soliciting participation. The INA defines \"terrorist organization\" to include designated groups by the United States and non-designated terrorist organizations that carry out terror-related activities. The terms were amended by the REAL ID Act to encompass a wider range of assistance to terrorist organizations. The Consolidated Appropriations Act FY2008 exempted certain groups from being labeled as \"terrorist organizations\" and authorized immigration authorities to exempt others based on specific criteria. The act also designated the Taliban as a \"terrorist organization\" for immigration purposes. \"Terrorist activity\" is defined by the INA as involving unlawful actions like hijacking or sabotage of vehicles and threatening individuals. The REAL ID Act expanded the definition of \"terrorist organization\" in the INA to include various violent acts such as assassination, use of biological or chemical agents, explosives, firearms, or threats to compel actions from others. The REAL ID Act broadened the definition of \"terrorist organization\" in the INA to include groups providing indirect assistance to terrorist activities. The INA now covers entities with subgroups engaged in terrorism, categorized into three tiers based on their threat to U.S. security. The definition of \"terrorist organization\" under the INA is broad, encompassing any group directly or indirectly involved in terrorist activities. The Taliban is classified as a Tier I terrorist organization. The INA's definition of \"terrorist activity\" is also broad, potentially overlooking the context and support of such activities. Prior to the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008, U.S. authorities could waive the application of the provision regarding \"terrorist organizations\" if a group had a subgroup engaged in terrorist activity. However, no waiver was possible for a group directly involved in such activities. Some policymakers raised concerns about the limited waiver authority in the provision regarding \"terrorist activity.\" The State Department acknowledged that the current waiver authority does not provide enough flexibility in all refugee cases, leading to issues for certain groups like Cuban anti-Castro fighters and Vietnamese Montagnards. The Administration aims to find solutions for these groups while balancing national security concerns with the refugee admissions program. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008, amended the INA to allow immigration authorities to waive the \"terrorist organization\" definition for certain non-designated groups, with exceptions for those engaged in terrorist activities against the US or democratic countries. Ten groups were specified as not considered terrorist organizations for INA purposes. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008, amended the INA to waive the \"terrorist organization\" definition for certain non-designated groups, including the Kayan New Land Party, Arakan Liberation Party, Tibetan Mustangs, Cuban Alzados, Karenni National Progressive Party, and groups affiliated with the Hmong and Montagnards. P.L. 110-257 retroactively included the African National Congress in the list of non-terrorist organizations for immigration purposes. The INA distinguishes between \"terrorist activity\" and \"engaging in terrorist activity.\" The REAL ID Act broadened the definition of \"engage in terrorist activity\" to include indirect support for non-designated terrorist organizations. To engage in terrorist activity, an alien must commit or incite to commit a terrorist act, plan or prepare for terrorism, gather information on potential targets, or solicit funds for terrorist organizations. The solicitor must prove they did not know the organization was a terrorist group when soliciting others to engage in terrorist activities or provide material support to terrorist organizations. Prior to the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008, immigration authorities could waive the material support provision for individuals who unknowingly provided support to terrorist organizations. The State Department and DHS used waiver authority to consider applications for refugee status and asylum for aliens who provided material support to terrorist entities. Waivers were granted to large groups of refugees in 2006 and to aliens supporting specific groups in 2007. The waiver authority allowed aliens who provided material support to certain organizations to be considered for refugee status or asylum. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008, specified that these groups would not be considered terrorist organizations for immigration purposes. This meant that individuals who supported these groups would not be deemed to have engaged in terrorist activity, regardless of previous waivers granted by the Secretary of Homeland Security. In 2007 and 2008, the DHS exempted individuals who provided material support under duress to terrorist organizations like FARC and ELN. The waiver authority allowed aliens associated with certain groups to be considered for refugee status or asylum, as specified in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008. The waiver under the Consolidated Appropriations Act exempts aliens affiliated with certain groups from being labeled as \"terrorist organizations\" for immigration purposes, provided they meet specific criteria. However, the waiver does not apply to aliens involved in terrorist activities targeting non-combatants or posing a threat to the US security. Engaging in terrorism-related activities can impact an alien's ability to enter or stay in the US, with legal consequences for those admitted who later engage in terrorist acts. The INA categorizes certain classes of aliens as inadmissible, making them ineligible to receive visas and be admitted to the United States. The REAL ID Act expanded these grounds in 2005, including activities like espousal of terrorist activity and receipt of military-type training from a terrorist organization as reasons for exclusion. The Act also aligned the terrorism-related grounds for deportability with those for inadmissibility. Aliens can be denied entry or removed from the US on separate security-related grounds even if they do not fall under terrorism-related categories. An alien can be deemed inadmissible or deportable on terrorism-related grounds if they have engaged in terrorist activity, are known or believed to be involved in such activities, incited terrorist acts, or are affiliated with terrorist organizations. This is in line with the REAL ID Act which expanded grounds for exclusion in 2005, aligning deportation criteria with inadmissibility standards. The REAL ID Act expanded grounds for exclusion in 2005, aligning deportation criteria with inadmissibility standards. An alien can be deemed inadmissible or deportable on terrorism-related grounds if they have engaged in terrorist activity, are known or believed to be involved in such activities, incited terrorist acts, or are affiliated with terrorist organizations. This includes being an officer, official, representative, or spokesman of the Palestine Liberation Organization, endorsing or espousing terrorist activity, persuading others to do so, supporting a terrorist organization, being the spouse or child of an alien inadmissible on terror-related grounds, or receiving military-type training from a terrorist organization. The REAL ID Act expanded grounds for exclusion in 2005, aligning deportation criteria with inadmissibility standards related to terrorism. An alien can be deemed inadmissible or deportable for association with terrorist organizations and engaging in activities that could endanger the United States' welfare, safety, or security. This provision can also be used to remove aliens already legally admitted into the United States. Prior to the Consolidated Appropriations Act FY2008, immigration authorities had exemption authority over inadmissibility provisions concerning aliens endorsing or espousing terrorist activity. The Consolidated Appropriations Act FY2008 expanded waiver authority over terrorism-related grounds for inadmissibility, allowing the Secretary of State or Secretary of Homeland Security to waive most provisions. The Secretary of Homeland Security has waiver authority over terrorism-related grounds for inadmissibility, not the Secretary of State. Certain categories of aliens, such as those engaged in terrorist activity, are not eligible for waivers under INA \u00a7 212(a)(3)(B). The Consolidated Appropriations Act expands immigration authorities' waiver authority, but the provision covering aliens endorsing terrorist activity may not be waived for Tier I or Tier II organizations. While the Secretary of State and Secretary of Homeland Security can waive certain terrorism-related grounds for inadmissibility, there is no explicit waiver authority for deportable aliens under INA \u00a7 237. The Act suggests that the waiver authority applies to both inadmissible and deportable aliens, even if not found inadmissible or deportable on terror-related grounds. An alien may be removed from the United States or denied entry on security-related grounds if they engage in activities opposing the US government by force or violence. Consular officers or immigration authorities can designate an alien inadmissible if they intend to engage in such conduct. The Secretary of State can also prevent an alien's entry if their presence or activities pose a serious foreign threat. Aliens in the United States may be deemed inadmissible or deportable if their presence poses serious adverse foreign policy consequences. However, officials of foreign governments, candidates for foreign office, or aliens with lawful beliefs, statements, or associations cannot be deported solely based on these grounds unless it compromises a compelling US foreign policy interest. No similar limitation on removal is provided for aliens inadmissible or deportable on terrorism-related grounds. Consular interviews are required for all prospective legal permanent residents and most foreign nationals seeking nonimmigrant visas, especially for applicants aged 14 to 79. The Consular Consolidated Database (CCD) is used to screen visa applicants, storing over 82 million records with photos and fingerprints. The system also links with other databases to flag any prior visa application outcomes. The Consular Consolidated Database (CCD) is the central system for screening visa applicants, checking for admissibility issues such as terrorist security and criminal grounds. It links with other databases like the Consular Lookout and Support System (CLASS) to flag problems. The National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC) has direct access to CCD and CLASS for security screenings. The Security Advisory Opinion (SAO) system involves consular officers referring selected visa cases for further review by intelligence and law enforcement agencies. Visa Viper procedures were established after the 1993 World Trade Center bombing and were formalized by the Enhanced Border Security and Visa Entry Reform Act of 2002. Consular officials send Visa Viper cables to the NCTC if they receive concerning information about a foreign national. Additionally, consular officers send suspect names to the FBI for a name check as part of SAO procedures. Consular officers refer visa applicants from certain countries to the FBI for name checks through programs like Visa Condor and Visa Mantis. They also screen applicants for access to controlled technologies to prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Additionally, there is a Terrorist Exclusion List that includes individuals associated with terrorist-supporting organizations. Aliens requesting a visa are issued a travel document with biometric identifiers since October 2004. The biometric data is available through the CCD, linking with US-VISIT. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorist Prevention Act of 2004 established an Office of Visa and Passport Security. The Prevention Act of 2004 created an Office of Visa and Passport Security to target fraudulent production and use of visas and passports linked to terrorist organizations. The office also analyzes terrorist travel methods using false documents to enter the United States and other countries. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 mandated the use of new technologies to combat illegal entry using fraudulent travel documents. The Department of Homeland Security was required to submit a plan to Congress for deploying authentication technologies at consulates, ports of entry, and immigration offices. However, by 2007, it seemed that the terrorist travel program had not been established as required by the law. The DHS had not established the terrorist travel program mandated by law. The Secretary was required to establish the program within 90 days and report to Congress within 180 days. The Assistant Secretary for Policy at DHS must be designated as head of the program, with specific duties outlined. All aliens seeking entry into the US must be inspected, and possession of a visa or travel document does not guarantee admission. The CBP conducts inspections at 327 official ports of entry in the United States, including preclearance offices in Canada, Ireland, and the Caribbean. In FY2008, approximately 409 million individuals were inspected at land, air, and sea ports of entry. Foreign nationals entering the US without visas are subject to border inspections, including a primary inspection with a CBP officer and a check of documents and the IBIS system. Suspicious travelers are referred to secondary inspection. During secondary inspections at US ports of entry, travelers are extensively questioned and their travel documents are further examined. The US-VISIT system requires certain foreign nationals to provide fingerprints and photographs upon arrival. CBP inspectors now capture a digital photograph and scan 10 fingerprints from each foreign national. US-VISIT operates two major automated identification systems for biometric data. The Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (IIRIRA) mandated the implementation of pre-inspection programs at selected foreign airports to prevent inadmissible aliens from departing for the United States. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorist Prevention Act of 2004 directed the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to expand the pre-inspection program at foreign airports and the Immigration Security Initiative to enhance national security measures. CBP inspectors at foreign airports work to prevent national security threats from entering the country. The Immigration Security Initiative requires at least 50 airports to participate by December 31, 2006. INA \u00a7 235(c) allows for the exclusion of arriving aliens suspected of being inadmissible on security grounds, with no right to appeal. The Attorney General reviews removal orders based on confidential information, and the regional director of CBP can deny further inquiry into the alien's status. The regional director of the CBP can deny further inquiry into an alien's status and order removal or disposal of the case as deemed appropriate. An alien's removal to a specific country may be withheld if their life or freedom is at risk due to race, religion, nationality, social group membership, or political opinion. However, an alien may be ineligible for this remedy if convicted of an aggravated felony or deemed a danger to U.S. security. All aliens, including those ineligible for withholding of removal, are subject to U.S. legislation implementing the U.N. Convention against Torture. Legislation enacted in the 110th Congress modified terrorism-related grounds for inadmissibility and removal, impacting alien eligibility for relief from removal. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008 exempted specified groups from the INA's definition of \"terrorist organization\" and expanded immigration authorities' waiver authority over terrorism-related grounds for exclusion. P.L. 110-257 limits application of terrorism-related grounds for inadmissibility with respect to the African National Congress (ANC) and certain groups. Legislation in the 110th Congress modified terrorism-related grounds for inadmissibility and removal, impacting alien eligibility for relief. P.L. 110-257 exempts the ANC from the INA's definition of \"terrorist organization\" and provides exemptions for aliens involved in anti-apartheid activities in South Africa. Immigration reform in the 111th Congress may further address the immigration consequences of terrorism-related activity. The case of Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, who attempted to bring down Northwest Airlines Flight 253 in 2009, has raised concerns about terrorist screening in visa issuance. Abdulmutallab, a Nigerian student in London, was granted a tourist visa in 2008 despite no red flags in his application or background check. The suspect's father, a wealthy banker and former Nigerian government official, contacted U.S. officials expressing concern about his son's involvement in Islamic fanaticism. State Department officials acknowledged a misspelling error in Abdulmutallab's name during the visa screening process, which led to the failure to report his previous visa issuance in 2008. The Visa Viper did not report Abdulmutallab's 2008 visa issuance, which was corrected in a cable on November 25, 2009. Questions arose about the Embassy's authority to revoke his visa based on his father's information. The State Department stated that the information was insufficient for visa revocation. Consular officers can revoke visas on terrorist grounds but defer to the NCTC for identifying suspected terrorists. The Secretary of State has discretionary authority to revoke visas at any time. Consular officers have the authority to revoke a visa if the alien is ineligible under INA \u00a7212(a) or overstays the visa time limits. The Foreign Affairs Manual instructs officers to seek advisory opinions for new determinations of ineligibility, such as for \"misrepresentation,\" \"terrorist activity,\" or \"foreign policy.\" According to DOS officials, consular officers may prudentially revoke visas if there are concerns about U.S. law enforcement interests. The officers are instructed to consult with law enforcement agencies and State officials before revoking a visa to avoid compromising legal or intelligence investigations. Visa revocation has been a ground for removal since 2004. Since 2004, visa revocation has been a basis for removal under INA \u00a7237(a)(1)(B) with limited judicial review allowed if visa revocation is the sole reason for removal."
