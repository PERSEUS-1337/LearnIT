The Competitive Communities Demonstration Act of 1994 aims to address economic challenges in distressed communities by focusing on supporting high-growth private sector activities to create quality jobs. The Economic Development Administration is urged to establish a Competitive Communities Demonstration Program to assist these communities in economic development. The Competitive Communities Demonstration Act of 1994 aims to assist distressed communities in developing a competitive economic base to compete in the global marketplace. The Act aims to enable the Economic Development Administration to partner with community leadership and competitive businesses to build a new economic base and raise economic aspirations beyond retaining existing economic activities. The Competitive Communities Demonstration Program, part of the Public Works and Economic Development Act of 1965, aims to assist distressed communities in developing a competitive economic base. The Secretary will establish the Competitive Communities Demonstration Program to provide grants to eligible intermediaries like economic development districts, Indian tribes, states, cities, nonprofits, or consortia. Grants must be used to support community investment strategies. The Competitive Communities Demonstration Program provides grants to eligible intermediaries for financial assistance to high growth businesses in distressed communities, including loans, loan guarantees, and interest reduction payments. Grant applications must outline proposed uses, show how the grant would impact investment decisions, align with community development strategies, and provide assurances to the Secretary. The program requires grant applications to include assurances on loan repayment use, form, and additional information as prescribed by the Secretary. A panel of experts, including the Secretary, Assistant Secretary for Economic Development, and a Regional Director, will review grant applications. The Secretary appoints members to a panel of experts for the program, including representatives from the Economic Development Administration and private citizens with expertise in economic development. The selection of grant recipients is based on recommendations from the panel after a national competition. The national competition for projects is held periodically, with a scoring system based on criteria for ranking proposed projects. Geographic balance is emphasized in the scoring system to promote a balance among regions and urban and rural areas. The panel considers criteria such as the role of the intermediary in recommending grant recipients. The intermediary's role in the community's economic development strategy, its capacity to participate in the program, business plans, job creation, businesses' commitment to the community, and economic distress levels are key factors considered for grant recipients. The panel recommends grant recipients based on factors like the intermediary's role in economic development, capacity to participate, business plans, job creation, commitment to the community, leveraging of non-Federal funds, and special considerations for applicants with revolving loan funds or seeking empowerment zone designation. The Secretary will establish deadlines for grant applications in the Federal Register. Grant applications will be approved or disapproved within 60 days of the deadline. Grant agreements will require eligible intermediaries to provide specified services. The program requires eligible intermediaries to assist businesses with grant amounts within 90 days or return any remaining funds to the Secretary. $20,000,000 from the 1995 fiscal year appropriation is allocated for this purpose. SEC. 906. LOAN GUARANTEE DEMONSTRATION PROGRAM is added to Title IX of the Act, allocating $20,000,000 for eligible intermediaries to assist businesses with grant amounts within 90 days. The Secretary is authorized to guarantee loans for economic adjustment purposes, including land development, facility construction, and working capital provision. Loan guarantees are subject to terms and conditions set by the Secretary. Loan guarantees provided under this section shall have the full faith and credit of the United States. The Secretary may conduct the guarantee program on a preferred lenders basis and authorize lenders to act on the Secretary's behalf. The Secretary may conduct loan guarantee programs on a preferred lenders basis, authorizing lenders to act on their behalf for determining eligibility, credit worthiness, monitoring, collections, and liquidation. $10,000,000 from the 1995 fiscal year appropriations will be allocated for this purpose. SEC. 907. REPORTING REQUIREMENT. The Secretary must assess the competitiveness of distressed areas, progress in encouraging investment in competitive businesses, success of the Competitiveness Communities Demonstration Program, and success of the loan guarantee program in the annual report to Congress.
