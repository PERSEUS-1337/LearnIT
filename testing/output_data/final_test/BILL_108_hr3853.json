Extension of pay-as-you-go under the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 is amended to enforce pay-as-you-go. The purpose of this section is to ensure that any legislation enacted before October 1, 2009, increasing the deficit triggers an offsetting sequestration within 15 days of Congress adjourning. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) will calculate the deficit increase or decrease by adding all estimates for the budget year of direct spending legislation. The legislation requires the calculation of savings in direct spending programs resulting from prior year's sequestration and any net deficit increase or decrease in the current year from OMB estimates for direct spending legislation. The legislation mandates OMB to assume a $7.4 billion deficit increase and outlines the process for sequestering funds from non-exempt direct spending accounts in a specific order.

CBO and OMB are required to provide estimates for direct spending legislation within specific timeframes. The OMB is required to provide estimates for direct spending legislation, including current economic assumptions and explanations for any differences between OMB and CBO estimates. If significant differences are found, OMB must consult with the Committees on the Budget of the House of Representatives and the Senate before issuing the report. The OMB and CBO must determine common scorekeeping guidelines and prepare estimates for direct spending legislation, excluding amounts from full funding of the deposit insurance guarantee commitment and emergency provisions. If emergency legislation is enacted, the President can designate it as such.

The definition of \"emergency\" under the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 is a situation that requires new budget authority and outlays for the prevention, mitigation, or response to loss of life, property, or national security threat, and is unanticipated. \"Unanticipated\" means the situation is sudden and quickly arises.

This definition is also added to the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985. SEC. 7. RULE RESPECTING DESIGNATION OF LEGISLATIVE PROVISION AS AN EMERGENCY.

Bills with emergency designations under the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 must also meet this definition to be considered in the Senate or House of Representatives. The Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 outlines procedures for waiver and appeal in the Senate, requiring a three-fifths vote to suspend certain sections. In the House of Representatives, it is not allowed to consider a rule that waives subsection (b). The Chair in the House must put the question of consideration for a point of order, which is debatable for 10 minutes. The House of Representatives allows for 10 minutes of debate on a point of order, with an additional 10 minutes for an opponent. The question of consideration for a bill or joint resolution also applies to determining consideration for an amendment made in order as original text. A conforming amendment is made to the table of contents in the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974.
