    "content": "Congressional efforts to establish standards for House districts have a long history, dating back to 1842 when federal redistricting standards were first passed. These standards included requirements for districts to be composed of contiguous territory with an equal number of inhabitants and compact territory. Despite these standards, they were never consistently enforced by the states. Since 1842, there have been efforts to establish standards for House districts, including requirements for contiguous and compact territory with an equal number of inhabitants. These standards were not consistently enforced by the states. In 1929, the Permanent Apportionment Act removed districting standards, but in 1941 and 1967 laws were enacted requiring Representatives to run from single-member districts. The conflict between the 1941 and 1967 laws remains unresolved. The 1967 law (P.L. 90-196) mandated single-member districts, conflicting with the 1941 law. The legislative history of the 1967 law is unusual, with no hearings or reports on the at-large election prohibition that became 2 U.S.C. \u00a7 2c. In the Ninety-first Congress, each State entitled to more than one Representative must establish a number of districts equal to the number of Representatives. H.R. 2275 was enacted after a previous bill (H.R. 2508) failed, which also included provisions for at-large representation. H.R. 2508 aimed to change redistricting standards by banning at-large elections and deleting subsection (c) of the Apportionment Act of 1929. The Apportionment Act of 1929 aimed to change redistricting standards by banning at-large elections and adjusting the election process based on the number of Representatives in a State. The Apportionment Act of 1929 aimed to change redistricting standards by banning at-large elections and adjusting the election process based on the number of Representatives in a State. Public Law 90-196 introduced conflicting provisions regarding at-large House elections under certain circumstances, raising questions about their reconciliation with prohibitions outlined in the U.S. Code. Section 2c may override Section 2a(c) in cases where redistricting is not completed before the first election following reapportionment. The history of court involvement in redistricting, starting with the \"one person, one vote\" principle in 1962, supports the argument that Section 2a(c) may no longer be applicable. Since Baker v. Carr and the Voting Rights Act of 1965, courts have intervened in state redistricting. In Branch v. Smith (2003), the Supreme Court addressed reconciling statutory provisions. After the 2000 census, Mississippi's delegation was reduced to four Representatives. When the legislature couldn't pass a redistricting plan in time, both state and federal courts drafted plans. The federal court's plan would be used if the state plan wasn't precleared by the Justice Department by the filing deadline. The Supreme Court addressed the issue of whether courts must order at-large elections if a state redistricting plan is not in place before court action. The Court held that the lower court was required to create a plan with single-member districts, rejecting the argument for at-large elections. The Supreme Court did not reach a consensus on the rationale behind its holding regarding at-large elections in redistricting cases. Justice Scalia's concurrence viewed the at-large option as a last-resort remedy when time constraints prevent a single-member plan. The Court interpreted that \u00a72a(c) is inapplicable unless all entities fail to redistrict pursuant to \u00a72c before an imminent election. The Supreme Court's interpretation of \u00a72a(c) as a last-resort remedy for redistricting when no constitutional plan exists before an election, while a separate plurality concluded that Section 2c must be invoked before \u00a72a(c) can be applied. The Supreme Court's interpretation of Section 2a(c) as a last-resort remedy for redistricting when no constitutional plan exists before an election. Justice O'Connor argued that federal courts must order at-large elections if states fail to redistrict after reapportionment. The issue of at-large congressional representation remains unsettled, and seating of at-large delegations could be challenged in the House of Representatives. The seating of at-large delegations in the House of Representatives could be challenged on the grounds of violating Section 2c, which prohibits at-large elections. A challenged delegation may argue that historical precedent and the need for state representation should allow them to be seated despite the violation. The 19th-century precedent may not be followed today if the House organization is at stake. Section 2a(c) serves as an insurance policy for states unable to complete redistricting in time for elections. Congress chose to keep Section 2a(c) allowing multi-member districts in place in 1967. In 2003, a bill was introduced to establish a commission on House membership size and election methods. H.R. 415 requires a commission to examine alternatives to the current method of electing Representatives in the House of Representatives. This could potentially impact federal laws governing representation in the House. The bill has been referred to the House Committee on the Judiciary with no further action taken yet."
