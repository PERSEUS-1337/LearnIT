    "content": "Smooth markets (SM-games) are introduced as a class of n-player games with pairwise zero sum interactions, relevant for analyzing and optimizing machine learning algorithms. Despite limited guidance from game theory, SM-games offer a way to understand and control artificial agents' collective behavior. In this paper, the focus is on how markets structure agents' behavior, with a mention of Nash equilibria and negative results in game theory. Despite challenges, human societies manage to organize themselves well, suggesting game theory lacks fundamental organizing principles. Market mechanisms have been extensively studied, but prior work has been limited to specific examples like auctions and prediction markets. Our approach is more abstract and directly suited to modern machine learning with markets encompassing discriminators and generators trading errors in GANs and agents trading wins and losses in StarCraft. The paper introduces a class of games where optimization and aggregation, meaning gradient-based methods and weighted sums, make sense for analyzing ensembles and populations in various fields. The paper introduces a class of games where coupling concave profit functions can lead to uncontrolled behavior. The goal is to understand how to 'glue together agents' for predictable collective behavior. In a smooth market (SM-game), each player's profit includes personal objectives and zero-sum interactions with other players. SM-games incorporate double-entry bookkeeping and conservation of energy principles, accounting for externalities. They have implications for gradient-based learners and generalize adversarial games. The paper studies SM-games from the perspectives of rational agents and the game as a whole, introducing the concept of legibility to quantify collective dynamics. Profit-maximizing agents in SM-games are not rational due to the lack of a shared objective. The paper introduces the concept of legibility to quantify collective dynamics in SM-games. It proves basic theorems on the dynamics of SM-games under gradient-ascent, showing stability of Nash equilibria and convergence to Nash equilibrium for all learning rates. The results are important as they identify a class of games amenable to analysis and control, with useful quantities to track at the individual firm level for drawing conclusions about global dynamics. Forecasts are highlighted as a useful lever for mechanism design. The paper introduces the concept of legibility to quantify collective dynamics in SM-games, proving the stability of Nash equilibria and convergence under gradient-ascent. It abstracts an existing design pattern to elucidate consequences for interacting agents, drawing on work studying convergence in generative adversarial networks and related minimax problems. In this paper, dynamics in continuous time are considered, with a focus on optimizing GANs and SM-games. The analysis shows that optimization is relatively easy in continuous time, making it possible in discrete time with additional effort. Gradient-based methods struggle to find local Nash equilibria in smooth games, contrasting with the relative ease in continuous time. The effect of learning rates in two games is illustrated in Figure 1. In smooth games, dynamics are destabilized by reducing the learning rate of the second player, while the SM-game remains unaffected. Economic terminology is used, but the underlying mathematics is based on first and second-order derivatives. Smooth games model interacting agents with differentiable objectives, such as GANs and adversarial training in mainstream machine learning. Smooth games involve players with differentiable profit functions controlled by parameters. Players update actions through gradient ascent, leading to a dynamical system. Every continuous dynamical system on R d can be represented as simultaneous gradient ascent on profit functions. Problems in simple smooth games are illustrated, including stable fixed points. The concepts from dynamical systems and game theory discuss stable fixed points and local Nash equilibria. Stable fixed points satisfy specific conditions, while local Nash equilibria have neighborhoods where players are harmed by small deviations. These notions differ from classical Nash equilibrium and are essential in nonconcave settings. The game described is a potential game with a unique local Nash equilibrium at (0, 0) where players can increase profits through coordinated action, indicating poorly designed incentives. The game also exhibits unstable equilibrium and divergence in dynamics. Simultaneous gradient ascent in games can lead to divergence to infinity due to poorly designed incentives, unstable equilibrium, and positive feedback loops between players' parameters and profits. This results in externalities where players' decisions affect each other's profits, leading to the failure to converge to a Nash equilibrium. The debate lies on whether the fault lies with gradients, the concept of Nash, or the game structure. Gradient-based optimizers like RMSProp and Adam use adaptive, parameter-dependent learning rates. While this is effective in optimizing functions, it can lead to severe problems in general games. Parameter-dependent learning rates behave well in potential games but can cause issues in other types of games. The dynamics of SM-games are analyzed, showing convergence to Nash equilibrium. Example 2 converges faster without cycling around the Nash, while Example 3 experiences slower convergence due to cycling. Decreasing the learning rate of the second player results in unstable dynamics in Example 2. The paper aims to explain the behavior of SM-games. The paper discusses the use of stop gradient operators in automatic differentiation tools like TensorFlow and PyTorch. These operators prevent gradients from being computed, which can affect the behavior of neural architectures. Stop gradients can interact unexpectedly with parameter-dependent learning rates, leading to potential issues in complex systems. Collectives of well-behaved agents may not behave well collectively due to parameter-dependent learning rates. Coupling concave functions can cause gradient ascent to diverge, and reducing the learning rate of a strongly concave player can destabilize dynamics. The behavior of collectives is sensitive to profits and relative learning rates, with off-the-shelf optimizers like Adam potentially destabilizing some games. Restricting to more structured games is recommended to avoid these issues. In structured games, interactions are pairwise and zero-sum, with profits being revenue minus costs. The model defines firms as profit maximizers in a smooth market game. Functions f i can act as regularizers or dummy players providing non-adversarial revenue sources. SM-games involve optimizing functions in a zero or near-zero sum setting. Zero-sum polymatrix games are a type of SM-game where profits are constrained to probability simplices. Nash equilibria are computed via linear programs in these games. Intrinsic curiosity modules utilize games for learning purposes. Intrinsic curiosity modules drive exploration through games, with one module predicting the environment and an adversary choosing unpredictable actions. Adversarial training involves a minmax problem, creating a star-shaped SM-game with a neural net at the center and adversaries on the arms. Task-suites with agents trained on tasks form a bipartite graph, becoming an SM-game when tasks are parametrized and adversarially rewarded based on difficulty. Homogeneous games occur when coupling functions are equal, as seen in population self-play. Monetary exchanges in SM-games are general, with error signals and wins/losses traded between agents in StarCraft. Adam Smith's concept of profit-maximizing firms promoting society's interests is questioned. Firms do not collectively maximize aggregate profit or revenue, as it would require ignoring interactions with other firms. In SM-games, firms do not collectively maximize aggregate revenue or profit by ignoring interactions with other firms. Instead, firms aim to increase their profit individually by forecasting better outcomes using gradients. Profit maximization by individual firms is based on rational decision-making to modify production and forecast profit changes. Profit maximization by individual firms in SM-games involves forecasting better outcomes using gradients to increase profit. However, tracking aggregate profits is not useful as firms update their production simultaneously, making profit a meaningless macroeconomic concept. In SM-games, profit forecasts are key for collective decision-making. Sentiment is derived from forecast changes, guiding firms to adjust production for increased profits. The firm's production forecasts are influenced by sentiment, leading to either optimistic or pessimistic adjustments. Sentiment is additive in SM-games, affecting aggregate profit forecasts based on individual forecasts. Gradient-based learners in SM-games use updates in the direction of profit forecasts to adjust production for increased profits. In SM-games, firms can choose their learning rates for forecast adjustments. The \u03b7-weighted dynamics and forecasts play a key role in determining sentiment and aggregate dynamics. The pairwise zero-sum structure is essential for legibility in forecasts. Example 1 illustrates non-legible forecasts and their impact on sentiments. Aggregate sentiment is influenced by individual forecasts, with a focus on profit adjustments for increased profits. The dynamics of smooth markets are influenced by individual forecasts and learning rates chosen by firms. Stability and local Nash equilibrium coincide in SM-games, with a fixed point being a local Nash equilibrium if it is stable. Lyapunov functions are used to study convergence in dynamical systems, where dynamics converge to a fixed point if a Lyapunov function exists. Aggregate forecasts in smooth markets exhibit properties similar to Lyapunov functions, such as shared global minima and positivity. These forecasts can be used to analyze convergence and divergence across different learning rates. Theorem 5 states that stable fixed points attract dynamics towards them, while unstable fixed points repel dynamics. This explains the robustness of SM-games to differences in learning rates. Theorem 6 explains the boundedness of dynamics in SM-games, showing that positive feedback loops leading to divergence cannot occur due to negative sentiment of firms for large production values. This is in contrast to example 1, highlighting the robustness of SM-games to differences in learning rates. In SM-games, dynamics are bounded and legibility allows for reading off game dynamics visually. The phase space is divided into regions with positive and negative sentiment, with boundaries where sentiment is zero. The dynamics operate on a landscape where height corresponds to the aggregate forecast value. In SM-games, sentiment determines whether dynamics ascend, descend, or remain level. Changing learning rates alters emphasis on firms' opinions, shaping boundaries between regions. SM-games offer richer dynamics than potential games, with a visual description of landscapes and decision-making. Computing landscapes for general SM-games is complex, similar to neural nets. In SM-games, the interaction between agents is crucial for controlling collective behavior. The pairwise zero-sum condition is an organizing principle that allows for analysis and control. SM-games are legible, with changes in aggregate forecasts reflecting individual firms' expectations. In SM-games, firms' forecasts are expected to change, allowing for guarantees on collective convergence, stability, and boundedness. Legibility in SM-games is a local-to-global principle, where the behavior of collectives can be inferred from individual members. Identifying games with local-to-global principles will be crucial as artificial agents become more common. This section offers a physics-inspired perspective on smooth markets, viewing them as a dynamical system with particles moving according to differential equations. In Hamiltonian games, energy is conserved, measured in joules, with power being the rate of change of energy over time. Hamiltonian systems do not generate power overall due to the conservation of energy. Smooth markets, while not conserving total energy like Hamiltonian games, still have constraints on energy generation. Legibility in smooth markets states that the total power is the sum of individual particle powers. The individual particles in a system dissipate energy, but the system as a whole can generate energy through interaction effects. Every continuous dynamical system on R d arises as simultaneous gradient ascent on the profit functions of a smooth game. Proposition 2 states that sentiment is additive, proven by showing that the Jacobian decomposes into symmetric and antisymmetric components. Proposition 3 discusses legibility under gradient dynamics, with a lemma showing the dynamics of the system. Theorem 4 states that a fixed point in an SM-game is a local Nash equilibrium if it is stable. The stability is determined by the negative definiteness of the symmetric component of the Jacobian, which is block diagonal in an SM-game. The antisymmetric component of the Jacobian in an SM-game is negative definite if the submatrices along the diagonal are negative definite for all players. In continuous time, for all positive learning rates, simultaneous gradient ascent on the profits leads to a stationary point where the gradient is zero. The Jacobian in an SM-game is negative definite if submatrices along the diagonal are negative definite. In continuous time, simultaneous gradient ascent on profits leads to stationary points with zero gradient. The model of monetary exchange in smooth markets ignores key aspects like inventories, investment, borrowing, and interest rates. Money is exchanged for goods or services in practice, which is not accounted for in the model. The proposed extension to SM-games introduces the exchange of both money and goods, without considering inventories. The model includes functions to measure the amount of goods exchanged between firms, with the assumption that the exchange is based on subjective valuation of widgets. The extension to SM-games introduces parameters \u03b1 ij to measure the value of goods exchanged between firms. The transaction is beneficial if \u03b1 ji \u00b7 \u03c9 ji > g ji, where firms benefit from the exchange. The assumptions are reasonable as long as firms do not pay to give away widgets. The off-block-diagonal terms of the game Jacobian, S and A ij, have consequences for how forecasts behave in near SM-games. If \u03b1 ij \u223c \u03b1 ji, the corrections due to different valuations of goods will be negligible, making the game well-behaved. However, the dynamics of near SM-games cannot be explained solely by the sum of sentiments of individual firms, as correction terms involve interactions between dynamics of different firms and quantities of goods exchanged. The correction terms in near SM-games involve interactions between dynamics of different firms and quantities of goods exchanged. Any smooth vector field can be constructed as the gradient of a function augmented with stop gradient operators."
